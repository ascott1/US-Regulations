                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 1997), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.

[[Page vii]]

    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 73.21  Classes of AM broadcast channels and stations.

    (a) Clear channel. A clear channel is one on which stations are 
assigned to serve wide areas. These stations are protected from 
objectionable interference within their primary service areas and, 
depending on the class of station, their secondary service areas. 
Stations operating on these channels are classified as follows:
    (1) Class A station. A Class A station is an unlimited time station 
that operates on a clear channel and is designed to render primary and 
secondary service over an extended area and at relatively long distances 
from its transmitter. Its primary service area is protected from 
objectionable interference

[[Page 12]]

from other stations on the same and adjacent channels, and its secondary 
service area is protected from interference from other stations on the 
same channel. (See Sec. 73.182). The operating power shall not be less 
than 10 kW nor more than 50 kW. (Also see Sec. 73.25(a)).
    (2) Class B station. A Class B station is an unlimited time station 
which is designed to render service only over a primary service area. 
Class B stations are authorized to operate with a minimum power of 0.25 
kW (or, if less than 0.25 kW, an equivalent RMS antenna field of at 
least 141 mV/m at 1 km) and a maximum power of 50 kW, or 10 kW for 
stations that are authorized to operate in the 1605-1705 kHz band.
    (3) Class D station. A Class D station operates either daytime, 
limited time or unlimited time with nighttime power less than 0.25 kW 
and an equivalent RMS antenna field of less than 141 mV/m at one km. 
Class D stations shall operate with daytime powers not less than 0.25 kW 
nor more than 50 kW. Nighttime operations of Class D stations are not 
afforded protection and must protect all Class A and Class B operations 
during nighttime hours. New Class D stations that had not been 
previously licensed as Class B will not be authorized.
    (b) Regional Channel. A regional channel is one on which Class B and 
Class D stations may operate and serve primarily a principal center of 
population and the rural area contiguous thereto.

    Note: Until the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement 
(NARBA) is terminated with respect to the Bahama Islands and the 
Dominican Republic, radiation toward those countries from a Class B 
station may not exceed the level that would be produced by an 
omnidirectional antenna with a transmitted power of 5 kW, or such lower 
level as will comply with NARBA requirements for protection of stations 
in the Bahama Islands and the Dominican Republic against objectionable 
interference.

    (c) Local channel. A local channel is one on which stations operate 
unlimited time and serve primarily a community and the suburban and 
rural areas immediately contiguous thereto.
    (1) Class C station. A Class C station is a station operating on a 
local channel and is designed to render service only over a primary 
service area that may be reduced as a consequence of interference in 
accordance with Sec. 73.182. The power shall not be less than 0.25 kW, 
nor more than 1 kW. Class C stations that are licensed to operate with 
0.1 kW may continue to do so.

<R05>
Sec. 73.23  AM broadcast station applications affected by international agreements.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no 
application for an AM station will be accepted for filing if 
authorization of the facilities requested would be inconsistent with 
international commitments of the United States under treaties and other 
international agreements, arrangements and understandings. (See list of 
such international instruments in Sec. 73.1650(b)). Any such application 
that is inadvertently accepted for filing will be dismissed.
    (b) AM applications that involve conflicts only with the North 
American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA), but that are in 
conformity with the remaining treaties and other international 
agreements listed in Sec. 73.1650(b) and with the other requirements of 
this part 73, will be granted subject to such modifications as the FCC 
may subsequently find appropriate, taking international considerations 
into account.
    (c) In the case of any application designated for hearing on issues 
other than those related to consistency with international relationships 
and as to which no final decision has been rendered, whenever action 
under this section becomes appropriate because of inconsistency with 
international relationships, the applicant involved shall, 
notwithstanding the provisions Secs. 73.3522 and 73.3571, be permitted 
to amend its application to achieve consistency with such relationships. 
In such cases the provisions of Sec. 73.3605(c) will apply.
    (d) In some circumstances, special international considerations may 
require that the FCC, in acting on applications, follow procedures 
different from those established for general use. In such cases, 
affected applicants will

[[Page 13]]

be informed of the procedures to be followed.

<R05>
Sec. 73.24  Broadcast facilities; showing required.

    An authorization for a new AM broadcast station or increase in 
facilities of an existing station will be issued only after a 
satisfactory showing has been made in regard to the following, among 
others:
    (a) That the proposed assignment will tend to effect a fair, 
efficient, and equitable distribution of radio service among the several 
states and communities.
    (b) That a proposed new station (or a proposed change in the 
facilities of an authorized station) complies with the pertinent 
requirements of Sec. 73.37 of this chapter.
    (c) That the applicant is financially qualified to construct and 
operate the proposed station.
    (d) That the applicant is legally qualified. That the applicant (or 
the person or persons in control of an applicant corporation or other 
organization) is of good character and possesses other qualifications 
sufficient to provide a satisfactory public service.
    (e) That the technical equipment proposed, the location of the 
transmitter, and other technical phases of operation comply with the 
regulations governing the same, and the requirements of good engineering 
practice.
    (f) That the facilities sought are subject to assignment as 
requested under existing international agreements and the rules and 
regulations of the Commission.
    (g) That the population within the 1 V/m contour does not exceed 1.0 
percent of the population within the 25 mV/m contour: Provided, however, 
That where the number of persons within the 1 V/m contour is 300 or less 
the provisions of this paragraph are not applicable.
    (h) That, in the case of an application for a Class B or Class D 
station on a clear channel, the proposed station would radiate, during 
two hours following local sunrise and two hours preceding local sunset, 
in any direction toward the 0.1 mV/m groundwave contour of a co-channel 
United States Class A station, no more than the maximum value permitted 
under the provisions of Sec. 73.187.
    (i) That, for all stations, the daytime 5 mV/m contour encompasses 
the entire principal community to be served. That, for stations in the 
535-1605 kHz band, 80% of the principal community is encompassed by the 
nighttime 5 mV/m contour or the nighttime interference-free contour, 
whichever value is higher. That, for stations in the 1605-1705 kHz band, 
50% of the principal community is encompassed by the 5 mV/m contour or 
the nighttime interference-free contour, whichever value is higher. 
That, Class D stations with nighttime authorizations need not 
demonstrate such coverage during nighttime operation.
    (j) That the public interest, convenience, and necessity will be 
served through the operation under the proposed assignment.

Sec. 73.28  Assignment of stations to channels.

    (a) The Commission will not make an AM station assignment that does 
not conform with international requirements and restrictions on spectrum 
use that the United States has accepted as a signatory to treaties, 
conventions, and other international agreements. See Sec. 73.1650 for a 
list of pertinent treaties, conventions and agreements, and Sec. 73.23 
for procedural provisions relating to compliance with them.
    (b) Engineering standards now in force domestically differ in some 
respects from those specified for international purposes. The 
engineering standards specified for international purposes (see 
Sec. 73.1650, International Agreements) will be used to determine:
    (1) The extent to which interference might be caused by a proposed 
station in the United States to a station in another country; and
    (2) whether the United States should register an objection to any 
new or changed assignment notified by another country. The domestic 
standards in effect in the United States will be used to determine the 
extent to which interference exists or would exist from a foreign 
station where the value of such interference enters into a calculation 
of:
    (i) The service to be rendered by a proposed operation in the United 
States; or
    (ii) the permissible interfering signal from one station in the 
United States to another United States station.

Sec. 73.30  Petition for authorization of an allotment in the 1605-1705 kHz band.

    (a) Any party interested in operating an AM broadcast station on one 
of the ten channels in the 1605-1705 kHz band must file a petition for 
the establishment of an allotment to its community of license. Each 
petition must include the following information:
    (1) Name of community for which allotment is sought;
    (2) Frequency and call letters of the petitioner's existing AM 
operation; and

[[Page 15]]

    (3) Statement as to whether or not AM stereo operation is proposed 
for the operation in the 1605-1705 kHz band.
    (b) Petitions are to be filed during a filing period to be 
determined by the Commission. For each filing period, eligible stations 
will be allotted channels based on the following steps:
    (1) Stations are ranked in descending order according to the 
calculated improvement factor.
    (2) The station with the highest improvement factor is initially 
allotted the lowest available channel.
    (3) Successively, each station with the next lowest improvement 
factor, is allotted an available channel taking into account the 
possible frequency and location combinations and relationship to 
previously selected allotments. If a channel is not available for the 
subject station, previous allotments are examined with respect to an 
alternate channel, the use of which would make a channel available for 
the subject station.
    (4) When it has been determined that, in accordance with the above 
steps, no channel is available for the subject station, that station is 
no longer considered and the process continues to the station with the 
next lowest improvement factor.
    (c) If awarded an allotment, a petitioner will have sixty (60) days 
from the date of public notice of selection to file an application for 
construction permit on FCC Form 301. (See Secs. 73.24 and 73.37(e) for 
filing requirements). Unless instructed by the Commission to do 
otherwise, the application shall specify Model I facilities. (See 
Sec. 73.14). Upon grant of the application and subsequent construction 
of the authorized facility, the applicant must file a license 
application on FCC Form 302.

    Note 1: Until further notice by the Commission, the filing of these 
petitions is limited to licensees of existing AM stations (excluding 
Class C stations) operating in the 535-1605 kHz band. First priority 
will be assigned to Class D stations located within the primary service 
contours of U.S. Class A stations that are licensed to serve communities 
of 100,000 or more for which there exists no local fulltime aural 
service.

    Note 2: Selection among competing petitions will be based on 
interference reduction. Notwithstanding the exception contained in Note 
5 of this section, within each operational category, the station 
demonstrating the highest value of improvement factor will be afforded 
the highest priority for an allotment, with the next priority assigned 
to the station with next lowest value, and so on, until available 
allotments are filled.

    Note 3: The Commission will periodically evaluate the progress of 
the movement of stations from the 535-1605 kHz band to the 1605-1705 kHz 
band to determine whether the 1605-1705 kHz band should continue to be 
administered on an allotment basis or modified to an assignment method. 
If appropriate, the Commission will later develop further procedures for 
use of the 1605-1705 kHz band by existing station licensees and others.

    Note 4: Other than the exception specified in note 1 of this 
section, existing fulltime stations are considered first for selection 
as described in note 2 of this section. In the event that an allotment 
availability exists for which no fulltime station has filed a relevant 
petition, such allotment may be awarded to a licensed Class D station. 
If more than one Class D station applies for this migration opportunity, 
the following priorities will be used in the selection process: First 
priority--a Class D station located within the 0.5 mV/m-50% contour of a 
U.S. Class A station and licensed to serve a community of 100,000 or 
more, for which there exists no local fulltime aural service; Second 
priority--Class D stations ranked in order of improvement factor, from 
highest to lowest, considering only those stations with improvement 
factors greater than zero.

    Note 5: The preference for AM stereo in the expanded band will be 
administered as follows: when an allotment under consideration 
(candidate allotment) conflicts with one or more previously selected 
allotments (established allotments) and cannot be accommodated in the 
expanded band, the candidate allotment will be substituted for the 
previously established allotment provided that: the petitioner for the 
candidate allotment has made a written commitment to the use of AM 
stereo and the petitioner for the established allotment has not; the 
difference between the ranking factors associated with the candidate and 
established allotments does not exceed 10% of the ranking factor of the 
candidate allotment; the substitution will not require the displacement 
of more than one established allotment; and both the candidate allotment 
and the established allotment are within the same priority group.

Sec. 73.35  Calculation of improvement factors.

    A petition for an allotment (See Sec. 73.30) in the 1605-1705 kHz 
band filed by an existing fulltime AM station licensed in the 535-1605 
kHz band will be ranked according to the station's calculated 
improvement factor. (See Sec. 73.30). Improvement factors relate to both 
nighttime and daytime interference conditions and are based on two 
distinct considerations: (a) Service area lost by other stations due to 
interference caused by the subject station, and (b) service area of the 
subject station. These considerations are represented by a ratio. The 
ratio consists, where applicable, of two separate additive components, 
one for nighttime and one for daytime. For the nighttime component, to 
determine the numerator of the ratio (first consideration), calculate 
the RSS and associated service area of the stations (co- and adjacent 
channel) to which the subject station causes nighttime interference. 
Next, repeat the RSS and service area calculations excluding the subject 
station. The cumulative gain in the above service area is the numerator 
of the ratio. The denominator (second consideration) is the subject 
station's interference-free service area. For the daytime component, the 
composite amount of service lost by co-channel and adjacent channel 
stations, each taken individually, that are affected by the subject 
station, excluding the effects of other assignments during each study, 
will be used as the numerator of the daytime improvement factor. The 
denominator will consist of the actual daytime service area (0.5 mV/m 
contour) less any area lost to interference from other assignments. The 
value of this combined ratio will constitute the petitioner's 
improvement factor. Notwithstanding the requirements of Sec. 73.153, for 
uniform comparisons and simplicity, measurement data will not be used 
for determining improvement factors and FCC figure M-3 ground 
conductivity values are to be used exclusively in accordance with the 
pertinent provisions of Sec. 73.183(c)(1).

    (b) In determining overlap received, an application for a new Class 
C station with daytime power of 250 watts, or greater, shall be 
considered on the assumption that both the proposed operation and all 
existing Class C stations operate with 250 watts and utilize non-
directional antennas.
    (c) If otherwise consistent with the public interest, an application 
requesting an increase in the daytime power of an existing Class C 
station on a local channel from 250 watts to a maximum of 1kW, or from 
100 watts to a maximum of 500 watts, may be granted notwithstanding 
overlap prohibited by paragraph (a) of this section. In the case of a 
100 watt Class C station increasing daytime power, the provisions of 
this paragraph shall not be construed to permit an increase in power to 
more than 500 watts, if prohibited overlap would be involved, even if 
successive applications should be tendered.
    (d) In addition to demonstrating compliance with paragraphs (a), 
and, as appropriate, (b), and (c) of this section, an application for a 
new AM broadcast station, or for a major change (see Sec. 73.3571(a)(1)) 
in an authorized AM broadcast station, as a condition for its 
acceptance, shall make a satisfactory showing, if new or modified 
nighttime operation by a Class B station is proposed, that objectionable 
interference will not result to an authorized station, as determined 
pursuant to Sec. 73.182(1).
    (e) An application for an authorization in the 1605-1705 kHz band 
which has been selected through the petition process (See Sec. 73.30) is 
not required to demonstrate compliance with paragraph (a), (b), (c), or 
(d) of this section. Instead, the applicant need only comply with the 
terms of the allotment authorization issued by the Commission in 
response to the earlier petition for establishment of a station in the 
1605-1705 kHz band. Within the allotment authorization, the Commission 
will specify the assigned frequency and the applicable technical 
requirements.
    (f) Stations on 1580, 1590 and 1600 kHz. In addition to the rules 
governing the authorization of facilities in the 535-1605 kHz band, 
stations on these frequencies seeking facilities modifications must 
protect assignments in the 1610-1700 kHz band. Such protection shall be 
afforded in a manner which considers the spacings that occur or exist 
between the subject station and a station within the range 1605-1700 
kHz. The spacings are the same as those specified for stations in the 
frequency band 1610-1700 kHz or the current separation distance, 
whichever is greater. Modifications that would result in a spacing or 
spacings that fails to meet any of the separations must include a 
showing that appropriate adjustment has been made to the radiated signal 
which effectively results in a site-to-site radiation that is equivalent 
to the radiation of a station with standard Model I facilities (10 kW-D, 
1 kW-N, non-DA, 90 degree antenna ht. & ground system) operating in 
compliance with all of the above separation distances. In those cases 
where that radiation equivalence value is already exceeded, a station 
may continue to maintain, but not increase beyond that level.

    Note 1: In the case of applications for changes in the facilities of 
AM broadcast stations covered by this section, an application will be 
accepted even though overlap of field strength contours as mentioned in 
this section would occur with another station in an area where such 
overlap does not already exist, if:
    (1) The total area of overlap with that station would not be 
increased;
    (2) There would be no net increase in the area of overlap with any 
other station; and
    (3) There would be created no area of overlap with any station with 
which overlap does not now exist.

    Note 2: The provisions of this section concerning prohibited overlap 
of field strength contours will not apply where:
    (1) The area of overlap lies entirely over sea water: or
    (2) The only overlap involved would be that caused to a foreign 
station, in which case the

[[Page 18]]

provisions of the applicable international agreement, as identified in 
Sec. 73.1650, will apply. When overlap would be received from a foreign 
station, the provisions of this section will apply, except where there 
would be overlap with a foreign station with a frequency separation of 
20 kHz, in which case the provisions of the international agreement will 
apply in lieu of this section.

    Note 3: In determining the number of ``authorized'' aural 
transmission facilities in a given community, applications for that 
community in hearing or otherwise having protected status under 
specified ``cut-off'' procedures shall be considered as existing 
stations. In the event that there are two or more mutually exclusive 
protected applications seeking authorization for the proposed community 
it will be assumed that only one is ``authorized.''

    Note 4: A ``transmission facility'' for a community is a station 
licensed to the community. Such a station provides a ``transmission 
service'' for that community.

Sec. 73.44  AM transmission system emission limitations.

    (a) The emissions of stations in the AM service shall be attenuated 
in accordance with the requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section. Emissions shall be measured using a properly operated and 
suitable swept-frequency RF spectrum analyzer using a peak hold duration 
of 10 minutes, no video filtering, and a 300 Hz resolution bandwidth, 
except that a wider resolution bandwidth may be employed above 11.5 kHz 
to detect transient emissions. Alternatively, other specialized 
receivers or monitors with appropriate characteristics may be used to 
determine compliance with the provisions of this section, provided that 
any disputes over measurement accuracy are resolved in favor of 
measurements obtained by using a calibrated spectrum analyzer adjusted 
as set forth above.
    (b) Emissions 10.2 kHz to 20 kHz removed from the carrier must be 
attenuated at least 25 dB below the unmodulated carrier level, emissions 
20 kHz to 30 kHz removed from the carrier must be attenuated at least 35 
dB below the unmodulated carrier level, emissions 30 kHz to 60 kHz 
removed from the carrier must be attenuated at least [5 + 1 dB/kHz] 
below the unmodulated carrier level, and emissions between 60 kHz and 75 
kHz of the carrier frequency must be attenuated at least 65 dB below the 
unmodulated carrier level. Emissions removed by more than 75 kHz must be 
attenuated at least 43 + 10 Log (Power in watts) or 80 dB below the 
unmodulated carrier level, whichever is the lesser attenuation, except 
for transmitters having power less than 158 watts, where the attenuation 
must be at least 65 dB below carrier level.
    (c) Should harmful interference be caused to the reception of other 
broadcast or non-broadcast stations by out of band emissions, the 
licensee may be directed to achieve a greater degree of attentuation 
than specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (d) Measurements to determine compliance with this section for 
transmitter type acceptance are to be made using signals sampled at the 
output terminals of the transmitter when operating into an artificial 
antenna of substantially zero reactance. Measurements made of the 
emissions of an operating station are to be made at ground level 
approximately 1 kilometer from the center of the antenna system. When a 
directional antenna is used, the carrier frequency reference field 
strength to be used in order of preference shall be:
    (1) The measure non-directional field strength.
    (2) The RMS field strength determined from the measured directional 
radiation pattern.
    (3) The calculated expected field strength that would be radiated by 
a non-directional antenna at the station authorized power.
    (e) Licensees of stations complying with the ANSI/EIA-549-1988, 
NRSC-1 AM Preemphasis/Deemphasis and Broadcast Transmission Bandwidth 
Specifications (NRSC-1), prior to June 30, 1990 or from the original 
commencement of operation will, until June 30, 1994, be considered to 
comply with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, absent any reason 
for the Commission to believe otherwise. Such stations are waived from 
having to make the periodic measurements required in Sec. 73.1590(a)(6) 
until June 30, 1994. However, licensees must make measurements to 
determine compliance with

Notice of Violation or a Notice of Apparent Liability alleging 
noncompliance with those provisions, or upon specific request by the

class and power of station. (See Secs. 73.186 and 73.189.)
    (1) An application for authority to install an AM broadcast antenna 
must specify a definite site and include full details of the antenna 
system design and expected performance.
    (2) All data necessary to show compliance with the terms and 
conditions of the construction permit must be filed with the application 
for the station license to cover the construction. If the station has 
constructed a directional antenna, a directional proof of performance 
must be filed. See Secs. 73.150 through 73.157.
    (b) The simultaneous use of a common antenna or antenna structure by 
more than one AM station or by a station of any other type or service 
may be authorized provided:
    (1) Engineering data are submitted showing that satisfactory 
operation of each station will be obtained without adversely affecting 
the operation of the other station(s).
    (2) The minimum field strength for each AM station complies with 
Sec. 73.189(b).
    (c) Should any changes be made or otherwise occur which would 
possibly alter the resistance of the antenna system, the licensee must 
commence the determination of the operating power by a method described 
in Sec. 73.51(a)(1) or (d). (If the changes are due to the construction 
of FM or TV transmitting facilities, see Secs. 73.316 and 73.685.) Upon 
completion of any necessary repairs or adjustments, or upon completion 
of authorized construction or modifications, the licensee must make a 
new determination of the antenna resistance using the procedures 
described in Sec. 73.54. Operating power should then be determined by a 
direct method as described in Sec. 73.51. Notification of the value of 
resistance of the antenna system must be filed with the FCC in 
Washington, DC., as follows:
    (1) Whenever the measurements show that the antenna or common point 
resistance differs from that shown on the station authorization by more 
than 2%, FCC Form 302 must be filed with the information and measurement 
data specified in Sec. 73.54(d).
    (2) Whenever AM stations use direct reading power meters pursuant to 
Sec. 73.51, notification to the FCC in Washington, DC, must be filed in 
accordance with Sec. 73.54(e).

Sec. 73.49  AM transmission system fencing requirements.

    Antenna towers having radio frequency potential at the base (series 
fed, folded unipole, and insulated base antennas) must be enclosed 
within effective locked fences or other enclosures. Ready access must be 
provided to each antenna tower base for meter reading and maintenance 
purposes at all times. However, individual tower fences need not be 
installed if the towers are contained within a protective property 
fence.

Sec. 73.51  Determining operating power.

    (a) Except in those circumstances described in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the operating power shall be determined by the direct method. 
The direct method consists of either:
    (1) using a suitable instrument for determining the antenna's input 
power directly from the RF voltage, RF current, and phase angle; or
    (2) calculating the product of the licensed antenna or common point 
resistance at the operating frequency (see Sec. 73.54), and the square 
of the indicated unmodulated antenna current at that frequency, measured 
at the point where the resistance has been determined.

[[Page 20]]

    (b) The authorized antenna input power for each station shall be 
equal to the nominal power for such station, with the following 
exceptions:
    (1) For stations with nominal powers of 5 kW, or less, the 
authorized antenna input power to directional antennas shall exceed the 
nominal power by 8 percent.
    (2) For stations with nominal powers in excess of 5 kW, the 
authorized antenna input power to directional antennas shall exceed the 
nominal power by 5.3 percent.
    (3) In specific cases, it may be necessary to limit the radiated 
field to a level below that which would result if normal power were 
delivered to the antenna. In such cases, excess power may be dissipated 
in the antenna feed circuit, the transmitter may be operated with power 
output at a level which is less than the rated carrier power, or a 
combination of the two methods may be used, subject to the conditions 
given in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (i) Where a dissipative network is employed, the authorized antenna 
current and resistance, and the authorized antenna input power shall be 
determined at the input terminals of the dissipative network.
    (ii) Where the authorized antenna input power is less than the 
nominal power, subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (c) of 
this section, the transmitter may be operated at the reduced power level 
necessary to supply the authorized antenna input power.
    (c) Applications for authority to operate with antenna input power 
which is less than nominal power and/or to employ a dissipative network 
in the antenna system shall be made on FCC Form 302. The technical 
information supplied on section II-A of this form shall be that applying 
to the proposed conditions of operation. In addition, the following 
information shall be furnished, as pertinent:
    (1) Full details of any network employed for the purpose of 
dissipating radio frequency energy otherwise delivered to the antenna 
(see Sec. 73.54).
    (2) A showing that the transmitter has been type accepted or 
notified for operation at the proposed power output level, or, in lieu 
thereof:
    (i) A full description of the means by which transmitter output 
power will be reduced.
    (ii) Where the proposed transmitter power output level(s) is less 
than 90% of the rated power of the transmitter, equipment performance 
measurements must be made to confirm that the station transmissions 
conform to the emission limitation specified in Sec. 73.44, under all 
conditions of program operation.
    (iii) A showing that, at the proposed power output level, means are 
provided for varying the transmitter output within a tolerance of 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>10 percent, to compensate for variations in line 
voltage or other factors which may affect the power output level.
    (d) When it is not possible or appropriate to use the direct method 
of power determination due to technical reasons, the indirect method of 
determining operating power (see paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section) 
may be used on a temporary basis. A notation must be made in the station 
log indicating the dates of commencement and termination of measurement 
using the indirect method of power determination.
    (e) The antenna input power is determined indirectly by applying an 
appropriate factor to the input power to the last radio-frequency power 
amplifier stage of the transmitter, using the following formula:
Where:

Antenna input power=Ep x Ip x F

Ep=DC input voltage of final radio stage.
Ip=Total DC input current of final radio stage.
F= Efficiency factor.

    (1) If the above formula is not appropriate for the design of the 
transmitter final amplifier, use a formula specified by the transmitter 
manufacturer with other appropriate operating parameters.
    (2) The value of F applicable to each mode of operation must be 
determined and a record kept thereof with a notation as to its 
derivation. This factor is to be established by one of the methods 
described in paragraph (f) of this section and retained in the station 
records.

[[Page 21]]

    (f) The value of F is to be determined by one of the following 
procedures listed in order of preference:
    (1) If the station had previously been authorized and operating by 
determining the antenna input power by the direct method, the factor F 
is the ratio of the antenna input power (determined by the direct 
method) to the corresponding final radio frequency power amplifier input 
power.
    (2) If a station has not been previously in regular operation with 
the power authorized for the period of indirect power determination, if 
a new transmitter has been installed, or if, for any other reason, the 
determination of the factor F by the method described in paragraph 
(f)(1) of this section is impracticable:
    (i) The factor F as shown in the transmitter manufacturer's test 
report, if such a test report specifies a unique value of F for the 
power level and frequently used; or
    (ii) The value determined by reference to the following table:

which is equal in amplitude to the reference signal.
    (vi) Accuracy shall be determined for the most adverse combination 
of conditions set forth above.
    (vii) Repeatability shall be determined as that which may be 
achieved under the specified test conditions over a period of 7 days, 
during which no calibration or adjustment of the instrument, subsequent 
to the initial calibration, shall be made.
    (viii) The effects of modulation of the RF signal shall be 
separately determined, and shall not be included in establishing values 
for accuracy and repeatability.
    (c) A station determined to have a critical directional antenna must 
use an antenna monitor having high tolerance characteristics determined 
on an individual basis, and specified on the station authorization. Such 
monitors are not subject to the authorization of paragraph (a), however 
they may be used only at the station for which they were specified.

    Note: In paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the requirement that 
monitors be capable of operation in the 535-1705 kHz band shall apply 
only to equipment manufactured after July 1, 1992. Use of a monitor in 
the 1605-1705

[[Page 23]]

kHz band which is not approved for such operation will be permitted 
pending the general availability of 535-1705 kHz band monitors if a 
manufacturer can demonstrate, in the interim, that its monitor performs 
in accordance with the standards in this section on these 10 channels.

Sec. 73.54  Antenna resistance and reactance measurements.

    (a) The resistance of an omnidirectional series fed antenna is 
measured at either the base of the antenna without intervening coupling 
or tuning networks, or at the point the transmission line connects to 
the output terminals of the transmitter. The resistance of a shunt 
excited antenna may be measured at the point the radio frequency energy 
is transferred to the feed wire circuit or at the output terminals of 
the transmitter.
    (b) The resistance and reactance of a directional antenna shall be 
measured at the point of common radiofrequency input to the directional 
antenna system. The following conditions shall obtain:
    (1) The antenna shall be finally adjusted for the required radiation 
pattern.
    (2) The reactance at the operating frequency and at the point of 
measurement shall be adjusted to zero, or as near thereto as 
practicable.
    (c)(1) The resistance of an antenna shall be determined by the 
following procedure: A series of discrete measurements shall be made 
over a band of frequencies extending from approximately 25 kHz below the 
operating frequency to approximately 25 kHz above that frequency, at 
intervals of approximately 5 kHz. The measured values shall be plotted 
on a linear graph, with frequency as the abscissa and resistance as the 
ordinate. A smooth curve shall be drawn through the plotted values. The 
resistance value corresponding to the point of intersection of the curve 
and the ordinate representing the operating frequency of the station 
shall be the resistance of the antenna.
    (2) For a directional antenna, the reactance of the antenna shall be 
determined by a procedure similar to that described in paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section.
    (d) Notification must be filed with the FCC in Washington, DC when 
determining power by the direct method pursuant to Sec. 73.51 and must 
specify the antenna or common point resistance at the operating 
frequency. The following information must also be kept on file at the 
station:
    (1) A full description of the method used to make measurements.
    (2) A schematic diagram showing clearly all components of coupling 
circuits, the point of resistance measurement, the location of the 
antenna ammeter, connections to and characteristics of all tower 
lighting isolation circuits, static drains, and any other fixtures 
connected to and supported by the antenna, including other antennas and 
associated networks. Any network or circuit component used to dissipate 
radio frequency power shall be specifically identified, and the 
impedances of all components which control the level of power 
dissipation, and the effective input resistance of the network must be 
indicated.
    (e) AM stations using direct reading power meters in accordance with 
Sec. 73.51, can either submit the information required by paragraph (d) 
of this section or submit a statement indicating that such a meter is 
being used. Subsequent station licenses will indicate the use of a 
direct reading power meter in lieu of the antenna resistance value in 
such a situation.

Sec. 73.57  Remote reading antenna and common point ammeters.

    Remote reading antenna and common point ammeters may be used without 
further authority according to the following conditions:
    (a) Remote reading antenna or common point ammeters may be provided 
by:

[[Page 24]]

    (1) Inserting second radio frequency current sensing device directly 
in the antenna circuit with remote leads to the indicating instruments.
    (2) Inductive coupling to radio frequency current sensing device for 
providing direct current to indicating instrument.
    (3) Capacity coupling to radio frequency current sensing device for 
providing direct current to indicating instrument.
    (4) Current transformer connected to radio frequency current sensing 
device for providing direct current to indicating instrument.
    (5) Using transmission line current meter at transmitter as remote 
reading ammeter. See paragraph (c) of this section.
    (6) Using the indications of the antenna (phase) monitor, provided 
that when the monitor is used to obtain remote reading indication of 
non-directional antenna base current, the monitor calibration can be 
independently made and maintained for each mode of operation.
    (b) Devices used for obtaining remote reading antenna or common 
point current indications, except antenna monitor coupling elements, 
shall be located at the same point as, but below (transmitter side) the 
associated main ammeter.
    (c) In the case of shunt-excited antennas, the transmission line 
current meter at the transmitter may be considered as the remote antenna 
ammeter provided the transmission line is terminated directly into the 
excitation circuit feed line, which shall employ series tuning only (no 
shunt circuits of any type shall be employed) and insofar as 
practicable, the type and scale of the transmission line meter should be 
the same as those of the excitation circuit feed line meter (meter in 
slant wire feed line or equivalent).
    (d) Each remote reading ammeter shall be accurate to within 2 
percent of the value read on its corresponding regular ammeter.
    (e) All remote reading ammeters shall conform with the 
specifications for regular antenna ammeters.
    (f) Meters with arbitrary scale divisions may be used provided that 
calibration charts or curves are provided at the transmitter control 
point showing the relationship between the arbitrary scales and the 
reading of the main meters.
    (g) If a malfunction affects the remote reading indicators of the 
antenna or common point ammeter, the operating power may be determined 
by a method using alternative procedures as described in Sec. 73.51.

Sec. 73.58  Indicating instruments.

    (a) Each AM broadcast station must be equipped with indicating 
instruments which conform with the specifications described in 
Sec. 73.1215 for determining power by the direct and indirect methods, 
and with such other instruments as are necessary for the proper 
adjustment, operation, and maintenance of the transmitting system. 
However, auxiliary transmitters with a nominal power rating of 100 watts 
or less are not required to be equipped with instruments to determine 
power by the indirect method provided that the licensee can determine 
the antenna input power at all times.
    (b) A thermocouple type ammeter or other device capable of providing 
an indication of radio frequency current, meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 73.1215, shall be installed at the base of each antenna element. A 
suitable jack and plug arrangement may be used to permit removal of the 
meter from the antenna circuit thereby protecting it from damage by 
lighting.
    (c) Since it is usually impractical to measure the actual antenna 
current of a shunt excited antenna system, the current measured at the 
input of the excitation circuit feed line is accepted as the antenna 
current.
    (d) The function of each instrument shall be clearly and permanently 
shown on the instrument itself or on the panel immediately adjacent 
thereto.
    (e) In the event that any one of these indicating instruments 
becomes defective when no substitute which conforms with the required 
specifications

[[Page 25]]

is available, the station may be operated without the defective 
instrument pending its repair or replacement for a period not in excess 
of 60 days without further authority of the Commission: Provided, That:
    (1) If the defective instrument is an antenna base current ammeter 
of a directional antenna system, the indications may be obtained from 
the antenna monitor pending the return to service of the regular meter, 
provided other parameters are maintained at their normal values.
    (2) If the defective instrument is the antenna current meter of a 
non-directional station which does not employ a remote antenna ammeter, 
or if the defective instrument is the common point meter of a station 
which employs a directional antenna and does not employ a remote common 
point meter, the operating power shall be determined by a method 
described in Sec. 73.51(a)(1) or (d) during the entire time the station 
is operated without the antenna current meter or common point meter. 
However, if a remote meter is employed and the antenna current ammeter 
or common point meter becomes defective, the remote meter can be used to 
determine operating power pending the return to service of the regular 
meter.
    (f) If conditions beyond the control of the licensee prevent the 
restoration of the meter to service within the above allowed period, 
information requested in accordance with Sec. 73.3549 may be filed with 
the Engineer in Charge of the radio district in which the station is 
located for such additional time as may be required to complete repairs 
of the defective instrument.

Sec. 73.61  AM directional antenna field strength measurements.

    (a) Each AM station using a directional antenna must make field 
strength measurements at the monitoring point locations specified in the 
instrument of authorization, as often as necessary to ensure that the 
field at those points does not exceed the values specified in the 
station authorization. Additionally, stations not having an approved 
sampling system must make the measurements once each calendar quarter at 
intervals not exceeding 120 days. The provision of this paragraph 
supersedes any schedule specified on a station license issued prior to 
January 1, 1986. The results of the measurements are to be entered into 
the station log pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 73.1820.
    (b) Partial proof of performance measurements using the procedures 
described in Sec. 73.154 must be made whenever the licensee has reason 
to believe that the radiated field may be exceeding the limits for which 
the station was most recently authorized to operate.
    (c) A station may be directed to make a partial proof of performance 
by the FCC whenever there is an indication that the antenna is not 
operating as authorized.

Sec. 73.62  Directional antenna system tolerances.

    (a) Each AM station operating a directional antenna must maintain 
the indicated relative amplitudes of the antenna base currents and 
antenna monitor currents within 5% of the values specified therein. 
Directional antenna relativephase currents must be maintained to within 
<plus-minus>3 deg. of the values specified on the instrument of 
authorization, unless other tolerances are specified therein.
    (b) Whenever the operating parameters of a directional antenna 
cannot be maintained within the tolerances specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section, the following procedures will apply:
    (1) The licensee shall measure and log every monitoring point at 
least once for each mode of directional operation. Subsequent variations 
in operating parameters will require the remeasuring and logging of 
every monitoring point to assure that the authorized monitoring point 
limits are not being exceeded.
    (2) Provided each monitoring point is within its specified limit, 
operation may continue for a period up to 30 days before a request for 
Special Temporary Authority (STA) must be filed, pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(4) of this section,

[[Page 26]]

to operate with parameters at variance from the provisions of paragraph 
(a) of this section.
    (3) If any monitoring point exceeds its specified limit, the 
licensee must either terminate operation within 3 hours or reduce power 
in accordance with the applicable provisions of Sec. 73.1350(d), in 
order to eliminate any possibility of interference or excessive 
radiation in any direction.
    (4) If operation pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section is 
necessary, or before the 30 day period specified in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section expires, the licensee must request a Special Temporary 
Authority (STA) in accordance with Sec. 73.1635 to continue operation 
with parameters at variance and/or with reduced power along with a 
statement certifying that all monitoring points will be continuously 
maintained within their specified limits.
    (5) The licensee will be permitted 24 hours to accomplish the 
actions specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; provided that, 
the date and time of the failure to maintain proper operating parameters 
has been recorded in the station log.
    (c) In any other situation in which it might reasonably be 
anticipated that the operating parameters might vary out of tolerance 
(such as planned array repairs or adjustment and proofing procedures), 
the licensee shall, before such activity is undertaken, obtain an STA in 
accordance with Sec. 73.1635 in order to operate with parameters at 
variance and/or with reduced power as required to maintain all 
monitoring points within their specified limits.

Sec. 73.68  Sampling systems for antenna monitors.

    (a) Each AM station permittee authorized to construct a new 
directional antenna system, must install the sampling system in 
accordance with the following specifications:
    (1) Devices used to extract or sample the current and the 
transmission line connecting the sampling elements to the antenna 
monitor must provide accurate and stable signals to the monitor (e.g., 
rigidly mounted and non-rotatable loops and all system components 
protected from physical and environmental disturbances).
    (2) Sampling lines for critical directional antennas (see 
Sec. 73.14) must be of uniform length. Sampling lines for non-critical 
directional antennas may be of different lengths provided the phase 
difference of signals at the monitor are less than 0.5 deg. between the 
shortest and longest cable lengths due to temperature variations to 
which the system is exposed.
    (3) Other configurations of sampling systems may be used upon 
demonstration of stable operation to the FCC.
    (b) A station having an antenna sampling system constructed 
according to the specifications given in paragraph (a) of this section, 
may obtain approval of that system by submitting an informal request to 
the FCC in Washington, DC. The request for approval, signed by the 
licensee or authorized representative, must contain sufficient 
information to show that the sampling system is in compliance with all 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.

    Note: A public notice giving additional information on approval of 
antenna sampling systems is available upon request from the FCC's 
current copy contractor.

    (c) In the event that the antenna monitor sampling system is 
temporarily out of service for repair or replacement, the station may be 
operated, pending completion of repairs or replacement, for a period not 
exceeding 120 days without further authority from the FCC if all other 
operating parameters and the field monitoring point values are within 
the limits specified on the station authorization.
    (d) If the antenna sampling system is modified or components of the 
sampling system are replaced, the following procedure shall be followed:
    (1) Temporary authority shall be requested and obtained from the 
Commission in Washington to operate with parameters at variance with 
licensed values pending issuance of a modified license specifying 
parameters subsequent to modification or replacement of components.
    (2) Immediately prior to modification or replacement of components 
of the sampling system not on the towers,

[[Page 27]]

and after a verification that all monitoring point values, base current 
ratios and operating parameters are within the limits or tolerances 
specified in the instrument of authorization or the pertinent rules, the 
following indications must be read for each radiation pattern: Final 
plate current and plate voltage, common point current, base currents and 
their ratios, antenna monitor phase and current indications, and the 
field strength at each monitoring point. Subsequent to these 
modifications or changes the above procedure must be repeated.
    (3) If that portion of the sampling system above the base of the 
towers is modified or components replaced, a partial proof of 
performance shall be executed in accordance with Sec. 73.154 subsequent 
to these changes. The partial proof of performance shall be accompanied 
by common point impedance measurements made in accordance with 
Sec. 73.54.
    (4) Request for modification of license shall be submitted to the 
FCC in Washington, DC, within 30 days of the date of sampling system 
modification or replacement. Such request shall specify the transmitter 
plate voltage and plate current, common point current, base currents and 
their ratios, antenna monitor phase and current indications, and all 
other data obtained pursuant to this paragraph.
    (e) If an existing sampling system is found to be patently of 
marginal construction, or where the performance of a directional antenna 
is found to be unsatisfactory, and this deficiency reasonably may be 
attributed, in whole or in part, to inadequacies in the antenna 
monitoring system, the FCC may require the reconstruction of the 
sampling system in accordance with requirements specified above.

<R05>
Sec. 73.69  Antenna monitors.

    (a) Each station using a directional antenna must have in operation 
at the transmitter site an FCC authorized antenna monitor. However, if 
the station authorization sets specific tolerances within which the 
phase and amplitude relationships must be maintained, or requires the 
use of a monitor of specified repeatability, resolution or accuracy, the 
antenna monitor used will be authorized on an individual basis.
    (1) Normally, the antenna monitor is to be installed immediately 
adjacent to the transmitter and antenna phasing equipment. However, the 
monitor may be located elsewhere provided that its environment is 
maintained at all times within those limits under which the monitor was 
type-approved.
    (2) The antenna monitor installed at a station operating a 
directional antenna by remote control or when the monitor is installed 
in the antenna field at a distance from the transmitter, must be 
designed and authorized for such use in accordance with the provisions 
of Sec. 73.53(b)(9).
    (b) In the event that the antenna monitor sampling system is 
temporarily out of service for repair or replacement, the station may be 
operated, pending completion of repairs or replacement, for a period not 
exceeding 120 days without further authority from the FCC if all other 
operating parameters, and the field monitoring point values are within 
the limits specified on the station authorization.
    (c) If conditions beyond the control of the licensee prevent the 
restoration of the monitor to service within the allowed period, 
informal request in accordance with Sec. 73.3549 of the Commission's 
rules must be filed with the Engineer in Charge of the radio district in 
which the station is located for such additional time as may be required 
to complete repairs of the defective instrument.
    (d) If an authorized antenna monitor is replaced by another antenna 
monitor, the following procedure shall be followed:
    (1) Temporary authority shall be requested and obtained from the 
Commission in Washington to operate with parameters at variance with 
licensed values, pending issuance of a modified license specifying new 
parameters.
    (2) Immediately prior to the replacement of the antenna monitor, 
after a verification that all monitoring point

[[Page 28]]

values and base current ratios are within the limits or tolerances 
specified in the instrument of authorization or the pertinent rules, the 
following indications must be read for each radiation pattern: Final 
plate current and plate voltage, common point current, base currents, 
antenna monitor phase and current indications, and the field strength at 
each monitoring point.
    (3) With the new monitor substituted for the old, all indications 
specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, again must be read. If no 
change has occurred in the indication for any parameter other than the 
indications of the antenna monitor, the new antenna monitor indications 
must be deemed to be those reflecting correct array adjustments.
    (4) If it cannot be established by the observations required in 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section that base current ratios and monitoring 
point values are within the tolerances or limits prescribed by the rules 
and the instrument of authorization, or if the substitution of the new 
antenna monitor for the old results in changes in these parameters, a 
partial proof of performance shall be executed and analyzed in 
accordance with Sec. 73.154.
    (5) An informal request for modification of license shall be 
submitted to the Commission in Washington, DC, within 30 days of the 
date of monitor replacement. Such request shall specify the make, type, 
and serial number of the replacement monitor, phase and sample current 
indications, and other data obtained pursuant to this paragraph (d) of 
this section.
    (e) The antenna monitor must be calibrated according to the 
manufacturer's instructions as often as necessary to ensure its proper 
operation.

Sec. 73.99  Presunrise service authorization (PSRA) and postsunset service authorization (PSSA).

    (a) To provide maximum uniformity in early morning operation 
compatible with interference considerations, and to provide for 
additional service during early evening hours for Class D stations, 
provisions are made for presunrise service and postsunset service. The 
permissible power for presunrise or postsunset service authorizations 
shall not exceed 500 watts, or the authorized daytime or critical hours 
power (whichever is less). Calculation of the permissible power shall 
consider only co-channel stations for interference protection purposes.

[[Page 29]]

    (b) Presunrise service authorizations (PSRA) permit:
    (1) Class D stations operating on Mexican, Bahamian, and Canadian 
priority Class A clear channels to commence PSRA operation at 6 a.m. 
local time and to continue such operation until the sunrise times 
specified in their basic instruments of authorization.
    (2) Class D stations situated outside 0.5 mV/m-50% skywave contours 
of co-channel U.S. Class A stations to commence PSRA operation at 6 a.m. 
local time and to continue such operation until sunrise times specified 
in their basic instruments of authorization.
    (3) Class D stations located within co-channel 0.5 mV/m-50% skywave 
contours of U.S. Class A stations, to commence PSRA operation either at 
6 a.m. local time, or at sunrise at the nearest Class A station located 
east of the Class D station (whichever is later), and to continue such 
operation until the sunrise times specified in their basic instruments 
of authorization.
    (4) Class B and Class D stations on regional channels to commence 
PSRA operation at 6 a.m. local time and to continue such operation until 
local sunrise times specified in their basic instruments of 
authorization.
    (c) Extended Daylight Saving Time Pre-Sunrise Authorizations:
    (1) Between the first Sunday in April and the end of the month of 
April, Class D stations will be permitted to conduct pre-sunrise 
operation beginning at 6 a.m. local time with a maximum power of 500 
watts (not to exceed the station's regular daytime or critical hours 
power), reduced as necessary to comply with the following requirements:
    (i) Full protection is to be provided as specified in applicable 
international agreements.
    (ii) Protection is to be provided to the 0.5 mV/m groundwave signals 
of co-channel U.S. Class A stations; protection to the 0.5 mV/m-50% 
skywave contours of these stations is not required.
    (iii) In determining the protection to be provided, the effect of 
each interfering signal will be evaluated separately. The presence of 
interference from other stations will not reduce or eliminate the 
required protection.
    (iv) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) (ii) and 
(iii) of this section, the stations will be permitted to operate with a 
minimum power of 10 watts unless a lower power is required by 
international agreement.
    (2) The Commission will issue appropriate authorizations to Class D 
stations not previously eligible to operate during this period. Class D 
stations authorized to operate during this presunrise period may 
continue to operate under their current authorization.
    (d) Postsunset service authorizations (PSSA) permit:
    (1) Class D stations located on Mexican, Bahamian, and Canadian 
priority Class A clear channels to commence PSSA operation at sunset 
times specified in their basic instruments of authorization and to 
continue for two hours after such specified times.
    (2) Class D stations situated outside 0.5 mV/m-50% skywave contours 
of co-channel U.S. Class A stations to commence PSSA operations at 
sunset times specified in their basic instruments of authorization and 
to continue for two hours after such specified times.
    (3) Class D stations located within co-channel 0.5 mV/m-50% skywave 
contours of U.S. Class A stations to commence PSSA operation at sunset 
times specified in their basic instruments of authorization and to 
continue such operation until two hours past such specified times, or 
until sunset at the nearest Class A station located west of the Class D 
station, whichever is earlier. Class D stations located west of the 
Class A station do not qualify for PSSA operation.
    (4) Class D stations on regional channels to commence PSSA operation 
at sunset times specified on their basic instruments of authorization 
and to continue such operation until two hours past such specified 
times.
    (e) Procedural Matters. (1) Applications for PSRA and PSSA operation 
are not required. Instead, the FCC will calculate the periods of such 
operation and the power to be used pursuant to the provisions of this 
section and the protection requirements contained in applicable 
international agreements.

[[Page 30]]

Licensees will be notified of permissible power and times of operation. 
Presunrise and Postsunset service authority permits operation on a 
secondary basis and does not confer license rights. No request for such 
authority need be filed. However, stations intending to operate PSRA or 
PSSA shall submit by letter, signed as specified in Sec. 73.3513, the 
following information:
    (i) Licensee name, station call letters and station location,
    (ii) Indication as to whether PSRA operation, PSSA operation, or 
both, is intended by the station,
    (iii) A description of the method whereby any necessary power 
reduction will be achieved.
    (2) Upon submission of the required information, such operation may 
begin without further authority.
    (f) Technical Criteria. Calculations to determine whether there is 
objectionable interference will be determined in accordance with the AM 
Broadcast Technical Standards, Secs. 73.182 through 73.190, and 
applicable international agreements. Calculations will be performed 
using daytime antenna systems, or critical hours antenna systems when 
specified on the license. In performing calculations to determine 
assigned power and times for commencement of PSRA and PSSA operation, 
the following standards and criteria will be used:
    (1) Class D stations operating in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1), 
(b)(2), (d)(1), and (d)(2) of this section are required to protect the 
nighttime 0.5 mV/m-50% skywave contours of co-channel Class A stations. 
Where a 0.5 mV/m-50% skywave signal from the Class A station is not 
produced, the 0.5 mV/m groundwave contour shall be protected.
    (2) Class D stations are required to fully protect foreign Class B 
and Class C stations when operating PSRA and PSSA; Class D stations 
operating PSSA are required to fully protect U.S. Class B stations. For 
purposes of determining protection, the nighttime RSS limit will be used 
in the determination of maximum permissible power.
    (3) Class D stations operating in accordance with paragraphs (d)(2) 
and (d)(3) of this section are required to restrict maximum 10% skywave 
radiation at any point on the daytime 0.1 mV/m groundwave contour of a 
co-channel Class A station to 25 <greek-m>V/m. The location of the 0.1 
mV/m contour of the Class A station will be determined by use of Figure 
M3, Estimated Ground Conductivity in the United States. When the 0.1 mV/
m contour extends beyond the national boundary, the international 
boundary shall be considered the 0.1 mV/m contour.
    (4) Class B and Class D stations on regional channels operating PSRA 
and PSSA (Class D only) are required to provide full protection to co-
channel foreign Class B and Class C stations.
    (5) Class D stations on regional channels operating PSSA beyond 6 
p.m. local time are required to fully protect U.S. Class B stations.
    (6) The protection that Class D stations on regional channels are 
required to provide when operating PSSA until 6 p.m. local time is as 
follows.
    (i) For the first half-hour of PSSA operation, protection will be 
calculated at sunset plus 30 minutes at the site of the Class D station;
    (ii) For the second half-hour of PSSA operation, protection will be 
calculated at sunset plus one hour at the site of the Class D station;
    (iii) For the second hour of PSSA operation, protection will be 
calculated at sunset plus two hours at the site of the Class D station;
    (iv) Minimum powers during the period until 6 p.m. local time shall 
be permitted as follows:

                                                                        
------------------------------------------------------------------------
           Calculated power                  Adjusted minimum power     
------------------------------------------------------------------------
From 1 to 45 watts....................  50 watts.                       
Above 45 to 70 watts..................  75 watts.                       
Above 70 to 100 watts.................  100 watts.                      
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (7) For protection purposes, the nighttime 25% RSS limit will be 
used in the determination of maximum permissible power.
    (g) Calculations made under paragraph (d) of this section may not 
take outstanding PSRA or PSSA operations into account, nor will the 
grant of a PSRA or PSSA confer any degree of interference protection on 
the holder thereof.
    (h) Operation under a PSRA or PSSA is not mandatory, and will not be 
included in determining compliance with the requirements of 
Sec. 73.1740. To the extent actually undertaken, however,

[[Page 31]]

presunrise operation will be considered by the FCC in determining 
overall compliance with past programming representations and station 
policy concerning commercial matter.
    (i) The PSRA or PSSA is secondary to the basic instrument of 
authorization with which it is to be associated. The PSRA or PSSA may be 
suspended, modified, or withdrawn by the FCC without prior notice or 
right to hearing, if necessary to resolve interference conflicts, to 
implement agreements with foreign governments, or in other circumstances 
warranting such action. Moreover, the PSRA or PSSA does not extend 
beyond the term of the basic authorization.
    (j) The Commission will periodically recalculate maximum permissible 
power and times for commencing PSRA and PSSA for each Class D station 
operating in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The 
Commission will calculate the maximum power at which each individual 
station may conduct presunrise operations during extended daylight 
saving time and shall issue conforming authorizations. These original 
notifications and subsequent notifications should be associated with the 
station's authorization. Upon notification of new power and time of 
commencing operation, affected stations shall make necessary adjustments 
within 30 days.
    (k) A PSRA and PSSA does not require compliance with Secs. 73.45, 
73.182 and 73.1560 where the operation might otherwise be considered as 
technically substandard. Further, the requirements of paragraphs (a)(5), 
(b)(2), (c)(2), and (d)(2) of Sec. 73.1215 concerning the scale ranges 
of transmission system indicating instruments are waived for PSRA and 
PSSA operation except for the radio frequency ammeters used in 
determining antenna input power.
    (1) A station having an antenna monitor incapable of functioning at 
the authorized PSRA and PSSA power when using a directional antenna 
shall take the monitor reading using an unmodulated carrier at the 
authorized daytime power immediately prior to commencing PSRA or PSSA 
operations. Special conditions as the FCC may deem appropriate may be 
included for PSRA or PSSA to insure operation of the transmitter and 
associated equipment in accordance with all phases of good engineering 
practice.

Sec. 73.127  Use of multiplex transmission.

    The licensee of an AM broadcast station may use its AM carrier to 
transmit signals not audible on ordinary consumer receivers, for both 
broadcast and non-broadcast purposes subject to the following 
requirements:
    (a) Such use does not disrupt or degrade the station's own programs 
or the programs of other broadcast stations.
    (b) AM carrier services that are common carrier in nature are 
subject to common carrier regulation. Licensees operating such services 
are required to apply to the FCC for the appropriate authorization and 
to comply with all policies and rules applicable to the service. 
Responsibility for making the initial determinations of whether a 
particular activity is common carriage rests with the AM station 
licensee. Initial determinations by licensees are subject to FCC 
examination and may be reviewed at the FCC's discretion. AM carrier 
services that are private carrier in nature must notify the Licensing 
Division of the Private Radio Bureau at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania 17325, 
by letter, prior to initiating service certifying compliance with 47 CFR 
parts 90 and 94.
    (c) AM carrier services are of a secondary nature under the 
authority of the AM station authorization, and the authority to provide 
such communications services may not be retained or transferred in any 
manner separate from the station's authorization. The grant or renewal 
of an AM station permit or license is not furthered or promoted by 
proposed or past service. The permittee or licensee must establish that 
the broadcast operation is in the public interest wholly apart from the 
subsidiary communications services provided.
    (d) The station identification, delayed recording, and sponsor 
identification announcements required by Secs. 73.1201, 73.1208, and 
73.1212 are not applicable to leased communications

equipment to determine that the stereophonic transmissions conform to 
the modulation characteristics specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of 
this section. Stations transmitting stereophonic programs prior to March 
21, 1994 may continue to do so until March 21, 1995 as long as they 
continue to comply with the rules in effect prior to March 21, 1994.
    (b) The following limitations on the transmitted wave must be met to 
insure compliance with the occupied bandwidth limitations, compatibility 
with AM receivers using envelope detectors, and any applicable 
international agreements to which the FCC is a party:
    (1) The transmitted wave must meet the occupied bandwidth 
specifications of Sec. 73.44 under all possible conditions of program 
modulation. Compliance with requirement shall be demonstrated either by 
the following specific modulation tests or other documented test 
procedures that are to be fully described in the application for type 
acceptance and the transmitting equipment instruction manual. (See 
Sec. 2.983(d)(8) and (j)).
    (i) Main channel (L+R) under all conditions of amplitude modulations 
for the stereophonic system but not exceeding amplitude modulation on 
negative peaks of 100%.
    (ii) Stereophonic (L-R) modulated with audio tones of the same 
amplitude at the transmitter input terminals as in paragraph (b)(i) of 
this section but with the phase of either the L or R channel reversed.
    (iii) Left and Right Channel only, under all conditions of 
modulation for the stereophonic system in use but not exceeding 
amplitude modulation on negative peaks of 100%.
    (c) Effective on December 20, 1994, stereophonic transmissions shall 
conform to the following additional modulation characteristics:
    (1) The audio response of the main (L+R) channel shall conform to 
the requirements of the ANSI/EIA-549-1988, NRSC-1 AM Preemphasis/
Deemphasis and Broadcast Transmission Bandwidth Specifications (NRSC-1).
    (2) The left and right channel audio signals shall conform to 
frequency response limitations dictated by ANSI/EIA-549-1988.
    (3) The stereophonic difference (L-R) information shall be 
transmitted by varying the phase of the carrier in accordance with the 
following relationship:

    where:

L(t)=audio signal left channel,
R(t)=audio signal right channel,
m=modulation factor, and
m<INF>peak</INF>(L(t)+R(t))=1 for 100% amplitude modulation,
m<INF>peak</INF>(L(t)-R(t))=1 for 100% phase modulation.


[[Page 33]]


    (4) The carrier phase shall advance in a positive direction when a 
left channel signal causes the transmitter envelope to be modulated in a 
positive direction. The carrier phase shall likewise retard (negative 
phase change) when a right channel signal causes the transmitter 
envelope to be modulated in a positive direction. The phase modulation 
shall be symmetrical for the condition of difference (L-R) channel 
information sent without the presence of envelope modulation.
    (5) Maximum angular modulation, which occurs on negative peaks of 
the left or right channel with no signal present on the opposite channel 
(L(t)=-0.75, R(t)=0, or R(t)=-0.75, L(t)=0) shall not exceed 1.25 
radians.
    (6) A peak phase modulation of +/-0.785 radians under the condition 
of difference (L-R) channel modulation and the absence of envelope (L+R) 
modulation and pilot signal shall represent 100% modulation of the 
difference channel.
    (7) The composite signal shall contain a pilot tone for indication 
of the presence of stereophonic information. The pilot tone shall 
consist of a 25 Hz tone, with 3% or less total harmonic distortion and a 
frequency tolerance of +/- 0.1 H<INF>2</INF>, which modulates the 
carrier phase +/- 0.05 radians peak, corresponding to 5% L-R modulation 
when no other modulation is present. The injection level shall be 5%, 
with a tolerance of +1, -1%.
    (8) The composite signal shall be described by the following 
expression:

Sec. 73.132  Territorial exclusivity.

    No licensee of an AM broadcast station shall have any arrangement 
with a network organization which prevents or hinders another station 
serving substantially the same area from broadcasting the network's 
programs not taken by the former station, or which prevents or hinders 
another station serving a substantially different area from broadcasting 
any program of the network organization: Provided, however, That this 
section does not prohibit arrangements under which the station is 
granted first call within its primary service area upon the network's 
programs. The term ``network organization'' means any organization 
originating program material, with or without commercial messages, and 
furnishing the same to stations interconnected so as to permit 
simultaneous broadcast by all or some of them. However, arrangements 
involving only stations under common ownership, or only the rebroadcast 
by one station or programming from another with no compensation other 
than a lump-sum payment by the station rebroadcasting, are not 
considered arrangements with a network organization. The term 
``arrangement'' means any contract, arrangement or understanding, 
expressed or implied.

Sec. 73.150  Directional antenna systems.

    (a) For each station employing a directional antenna, all 
determinations of service provided and interference caused shall be 
based on the inverse distance fields of the standard radiation pattern 
for that station. (As applied to nighttime operation the term ``standard 
radiation pattern'' shall include the radiation pattern in the 
horizontal plane, and radiation patterns at angles above this plane.)
    (1) Parties submitting directional antenna patterns pursuant to this 
section and Sec. 73.152 (Modified standard pattern) must submit patterns 
which are tabulated and plotted in units of millivolts per meter at 1 
kilometer.

    Note: Applications for new stations and for changes (both minor and 
major) in existing stations must use a standard pattern.

    (b) The following data shall be submitted with an application for 
authority to install a directional antenna:
    (1) The standard radiation pattern for the proposed antenna in the 
horizontal plane, and where pertinent, tabulated values for the 
azimuthal radiation patterns for angles of elevation up to and including 
60 degrees, with a separate section for each increment of 5 degrees.
    (i) The standard radiation pattern shall be based on the theoretical 
radiation pattern. The theoretical radiation pattern shall be calculated 
in accordance with the following mathematical expression:

where:

E(<greek-ph><INF>,</INF><greek-th>)<INF>th</INF> Represents the 
          theoretical inverse distance fields at one kilometer for the 
          given azimuth and elevation.
k  Represents the multiplying constant which determines the basic 
          pattern size. It shall be chosen so that the effective field 
          (RMS) of the theoretical pattern in the horizontal plane shall 
          be no greater than the value computed on the assumption that 
          nominal station power (see Sec. 73.14) is delivered to the 
          directional array, and that a lumped loss resistance of one 
          ohm exists at the current loop of each element of the array, 
          or at the base of each element of electrical height lower than 
          0.25 wavelength, and no less than the value required by 
          Sec. 73.189(b)(2) of this part for a station of the class and 
          nominal power for which the pattern is designed.
n  Represents the number of elements (towers) in the directional array.
i  Represents the i<SUP>th</SUP> element in the array.
F<INF>i</INF>  Represents the field ratio of the i<SUP>th</SUP> element 
          in the array.
<greek-th  Represents the vertical elevation angle measured from the 
          horizontal plane.
f<INF>i</INF> (<greek-th) represents the vertical plane radiation 
          characteristic of the i<SUP>th</SUP> antenna. This value 
          depends on the tower height, as well as whether the tower is 
          top-loaded or sectionalized. The various formulas for 
          computing f<INF>i</INF> (<greek-th) are given in Sec. 73.160.
S<INF>i</INF>  Represents the electrical spacing of the i<SUP>th</SUP> 
          tower from the reference point.
<greek-ph><INF>i</INF>  Represents the orientation (with respect to true 
          north) of the i<SUP>th</SUP> tower.
<greek-ph>  Represents the azimuth (with respect to true north).
<greek-ps><INF>i</INF>  Represents the electrical phase angle of the 
          current in the i<SUP>th</SUP> tower.
    The standard radiation pattern shall be constructed in accordance 
with the following mathematical expression:

    where:
    E(<greek-ph>,<greek-th>)<INF>std</INF> represents the inverse 
distance fields at one kilometer which are produced by the directional 
antenna in the horizontal and vertical planes. 
E(<greek-ph>,<greek-th>)<INF>th</INF> represents the theoretical inverse 
distance fields at one kilometer as computed in accordance with Eq. 1, 
above.
    Q is the greater of the following two quantities: 0.025g(<greek-th>) 
E<INF>rss</INF> or 10.0g(<greek-th>) <radical> P<INF>kW</INF>
    where:
    g(<greek-th>) is the vertical plane distribution factor, 
f(<greek-th>), for the shortest element in the array (see Eq. 2, above; 
also see Sec. 73.190, Figure 5). If the shortest element has an 
electrical height in excess of 0.5 wavelength, g(<greek-th>) shall be 
computed as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MR91.064

    E<INF>rss</INF> is the root sum square of the amplitudes of the 
inverse fields of the elements of the array in the horizontal plane, as 
used in the expression for E(<greek-ph>,<greek-th>)<INF>th</INF> (see 
Eq. 1, above), and is computed as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MR91.065

    P<INF>kW</INF> is the nominal station power expressed in kilowatts, 
see Sec. 73.14. If the nominal power is less than one kilowatt, 
P<INF>kW</INF>=1.

    (ii) Where the orthogonal addition of the factor Q to E(<greek-ph>, 
<greek-th>)<INF>th</INF> results in a standard pattern whose minimum 
fields are lower than those found necessary or desirable, these fields 
may be increased by appropriate adjustment of the parameters of 
E(<greek-ph>, <greek-th>)<INF>th</INF>.
    (2) All patterns shall be computed for integral multiples of five 
degrees, beginning with zero degrees representing true north, and, shall 
be plotted to the largest scale possible on unglazed letter-size paper 
(main engraving approximately 7'  x  10') using only scale divisions and 
subdivisions of 1,2,2.5, or 5 times 10<SUP>nth</SUP>. The horizontal 
plane pattern shall be plotted on polar coordinate paper, with the zero 
degree point corresponding to true north. Patterns for elevation angles 
above the horizontal plane may be plotted in polar or

[[Page 36]]

rectangular coordinates, with the pattern for each angle of elevation on 
a separate page. Rectangular plots shall begin and end at true north, 
with all azimuths labelled in increments of not less than 20 degrees. If 
a rectangular plot is used, the ordinate showing the scale for radiation 
may be logarithmic. Such patterns for elevation angles above the 
horizontal plane need be submitted only upon specific request by 
Commission staff. Minor lobe and null detail occurring between 
successive patterns for specific angles of elevation need not be 
submitted. Values of field strength on any pattern less than ten percent 
of the maximum field strength plotted on that pattern shall be shown on 
an enlarged scale. Rectangular plots with a logarithmic ordinate need 
not utilize an expanded scale unless necessary to show clearly the minor 
lobe and null detail.
    (3) The effective (RMS) field strength in the horizontal plane of 
E(<greek-ph>,<greek-th>)<INF>std</INF>, 
E(<greek-ph>,<greek-th>)<INF>th</INF> and the root-sum-square (RSS) 
value of the inverse distance fields of the array elements at 1 
kilometer, derived from the equation for 
E(<greek-ph>,<greek-th>)<INF>th</INF>. These values shall be tabulated 
on the page on which the horizontal plane pattern is plotted, which 
shall be specifically labelled as the Standard Horizontal Plane Pattern.
    (4) Physical description of the array, showing:
    (i) Number of elements.
    (ii) Type of each element (i.e., guyed or self-supporting, uniform 
cross section or tapered (specifying base dimensions), grounded or 
insulated, etc.)
    (iii) Details of top loading, or sectionalizing, if any.
    (iv) Height of radiating portion of each element in feet (height 
above base insulator, or base, if grounded).
    (v) Overall height of each element above ground.

of the antenna elements, thereon, their spacing from each other, and 
their orientation with respect to each other and to true north, the 
number and length of the radials in the ground system about each 
element, the dimensions of ground screens, if any, and bonding between 
towers and between radial systems.
    (5) Electrical description of the array, showing:
    (i) Relative amplitudes of the fields of the array elements.
    (ii) Relative time phasing of the fields of the array elements in 
degrees leading [+] or lagging [-].
    (iii) Space phasing between elements in degrees.
    (iv) Where waiver of the content of this section is requested or 
upon request of the Commission staff, all assumptions made and the basis 
therefor, particularly with respect to the electrical height of the 
elements, current distribution along elements, efficiency of each 
element, and ground conductivity.
    (v) Where waiver of the content of this section is requested, or 
upon request of the Commission staff, those formulas used for computing 
E(<greek-ph>,<greek-th>)<INF>th</INF> and 
E(<greek-ph>,<greek-th>)<INF>std</INF>. Complete tabulation of final 
computed data used in plotting patterns, including data for the 
determination of the RMS value of the pattern, and the RSS field of the 
array.
    (6) The values used in specifying the parameters which describe the 
array must be specified to no greater precision than can be achieved 
with available monitoring equipment. Use of greater precision raises a 
rebuttable presumption of instability of the array. Following are 
acceptable values of precision; greater precision may be used only upon 
showing that the monitoring equipment to be installed gives accurate 
readings with the specified precision.
    (i) Field Ratio: 3 significant figures.
    (ii) Phasing: to the nearest 0.1 degree.
    (iii) Orientation (with respect to a common point in the array, or 
with respect to another tower): to the nearest 0.1 degree.
    (iv) Spacing (with respect to a common point in the array, or with 
respect to another tower): to the nearest 0.1 degree.
    (v) Electrical Height (for all parameters listed in Section 73.160): 
to the nearest 0.1 degree.
    (vi) Theoretical RMS (to determine pattern size): 4 significant 
figures.
    (vii) Additional requirements relating to modified standard patterns 
appear in Sec. 73.152(c)(3) and (c)(4).

Sec. 73.151  Field strength measurements to establish performance of directional antennas.

    (a) In addition to the information required by the license 
application form, the following showing must be submitted to establish 
for each mode of directional operation, that the effective measured 
field strength (RMS) at 1 mile is not less than 85 percent of the 
effective field strength specified for the standard radiation pattern 
for that mode of directional operation, or less than that specified in 
Sec. 73.189(b) for the class of station involved, whichever is the 
higher value, and that the measured field strength at 1 mile in any 
direction does not exceed the field shown in that direction on the 
standard radiation pattern for that mode of directional operation:
    (1) A tabulation of inverse field strengths in the horizontal plane 
at 1 mile, as determined from field strength measurements taken and 
analyzed in accordance with Sec. 73.186, and a statement of the 
effective field strength (RMS), based on these measurements. 
Measurements shall be made in at least the following directions:
    (i) Those specified in the instrument of authorization.
    (ii) In major lobes. Generally at least three radials are necessary 
to establish a major lobe; however, additional radials may be required.
    (iii) Along sufficient number of other radials to establish the 
effective field. In the case of a relatively simple directional antenna 
pattern, approximately five radials in addition to those in paragraphs 
(a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section are sufficient. However, when more 
complicated patterns are involved, that is, patterns having several or 
sharp lobes or nulls, measurements shall be taken along as many radials 
as may be necessary, to definitely establish the pattern(s).

[[Page 38]]

    (2) A tabulation of:
    (i) The phase difference of the current in each other element with 
respect to the reference element, and whether the current leads (+) or 
lags (-) the current in the reference element, as indicated by the 
station's antenna monitor.
    (ii) The ratio of the amplitude of the radio frequency current in 
each other element to the current in the reference element, as indicated 
on the station's antenna monitor.
    (iii) The value of the radio frequency current at the base of each 
element, and the ratio of the current in each other element to the base 
current in the reference element. If there are substantial differences 
between the ratios established in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section 
and the ratios computed in this paragraphs (a)(2)(iii) and/or if there 
are substantial differences between the parameters established in 
paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section and this paragraph 
(a)(2)(iii), and those used in the design of the standard radiation 
pattern, a full explanation of the reasons for these differences shall 
be given.
    (3) The actual field strength measured at each monitoring point 
established in the various directions for which a limiting field was 
specified in the instrument of authorization together with accurate and 
detailed description of each monitoring point together with ordinary 
snapshots, clear and sharp, taken with the field strength meter in its 
measuring position and with the camera so located that its field of view 
takes in as many pertinent landmarks as possible. In addition, the 
directions for proceeding to each monitoring point together with a rough 
sketch or map upon which has been indicated the most accessible 
approaches to the monitoring points should be submitted.
    (b) For stations authorized to operate with simple directional 
antenna systems (e.g., two towers) in the 1605-1705 kHz band, the 
measurements to support pattern RMS compliance referred to in paragraphs 
(a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) of this section are not required. In such 
cases, measured radials are required only in the direction of short-
spaced allotments, or in directions specifically identified by the 
Commission.

Sec. 73.152  Modification of directional antenna data.

    (a) If, after construction and final adjustment of a directional 
antenna, a measured inverse distance field in any direction exceeds the 
field shown on the standard radiation pattern for the pertinent mode of 
directional operation, an application shall be filed, specifying a 
modified standard radiation pattern and/or such changes as may be 
required in operating parameters so that all measured effective fields 
will be contained within the modified standard radiation pattern.
    (b) Normally, a modified standard pattern is not acceptable at the 
initial construction permit stage, before a proof-of-performance has 
been completed. However, in certain cases, where it can be shown that 
modification is necessary, a modified standard pattern will be 
acceptable at the initial construction permit stage. Following is a non-
inclusive list of items to be considered in determining whether a 
modification is acceptable at the initial construction permit stage:
    (1) When the proposed pattern is essentially the same as an existing 
pattern at the same antenna site. (e.g., A DA-D station proposing to 
become a DA-1 station.)
    (2) Excessive reradiating structures, which should be shown on a 
plat of the antenna site and surrounding area.
    (3) Other environmental factors; they should be fully described.
    (4) Judgment and experience of the engineer preparing the 
engineering portion of the application. This must be supported with a 
full discussion of the pertinent factors.
    (c) The following general principles shall govern the situations in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) in this section:
    (1) Where a measured field in any direction will exceed the 
authorized standard pattern, the license application may specify the 
level at which the input power to the antenna shall be limited to 
maintain the measured field

[[Page 39]]

at a value not in excess of that shown on the standard pattern, and 
shall specify the common point current corresponding to this power 
level. This value of common point current will be specified on the 
license for that station.
    (2) Where any excessive measured field does not result in 
objectionable interference to another station, a modification of 
construction permit application may be submitted with a modified 
standard pattern encompassing all measured fields. The modified standard 
pattern shall supersede the previously submitted standard radiation 
pattern for that station in the pertinent mode of directional operation. 
Following are the possible methods of creating a modified standard 
pattern:
    (i) The modified pattern may be computed by making the entire 
pattern larger than the original pattern (i.e., have a higher RMS value) 
if the measured fields systematically exceed the confines of the 
original pattern. The larger pattern shall be computed by using a larger 
multiplying constant, k, in the theoretical pattern equation (Eq. 1) in 
Sec. 73.150(b)(1).
    (ii) Where the measured field exceeds the pattern in discrete 
directions, but objectionable interference does not result, the pattern 
may be expanded over sectors including these directions. When this 
``augmentation'' is desired, it shall be achieved by application of the 
following equation:

     E(<greek-ph><INF>,</INF><greek-th)<INF>aug</INF> = <radical> { 
    E(<greek-ph><INF>,</INF><greek-th)<INF>std</INF> }<SUP>2</SUP>+ 
             A{g(<greek-th) cos (180 D<INF>A</INF>/S }<SUP>2

</SUP>where:

    E(<greek-ph><INF>,</INF><greek-th)<INF>std</INF> is the standard 
pattern field at some particular azimuth and elevation angle, before 
augmentation, computed pursuant to Eq. 2, Sec. 73.150(b)(1)(i).
    E(<greek-ph><INF>,</INF><greek-th)<INF>aug.</INF> is the field in 
the direction specified above, after augmentation.
    A=E(<greek-ph><INF>,</INF> 
O)<SUP>2</SUP><INF>aug</INF>-E(<greek-ph><INF>,</INF> 
O)<SUP>2</SUP><INF>std</INF> in which <greek-ph> is the central azimuth 
of augmentation. E(<greek-ph><INF>,</INF> O)<INF>aug</INF> and 
E(<greek-ph><INF>,</INF> O)<INF>std</INF> are the fields in the 
horizontal plane at the central azimuth of augmentation.

    Note: ``A'' must be positive, except during the process of 
converting non-standard patterns to standard patterns pursuant to the 
Report and Order in Docket No. 21473, and in making minor changes to 
stations with patterns developed during the conversion. However, even 
when ``A'' is negative, ``A'' cannot be so negative that 
E(<greek-ph><INF>,</INF><greek-a>)<INF>aug</INF> is less than 
E(<greek-ph><INF>,</INF><greek-th)<INF>th</INF> at any azimuth or 
vertical elevation angle.


    g(<greek-th) is defined in Sec. 73.150(b)(1)(i).
    S is the angular range, or ``span'', over which augmentation is 
applied. The span is centered on the central azimuth of augmentation. At 
the limits of the span, the augmented pattern merges into the 
unaugmented pattern. Spans may overlap.
    D<INF>A</INF> is the absolute horizontal angle between the azimuth 
at which the augmented pattern value is being computed and the central 
azimuth of augmentation. (D<INF>A</INF> cannot exceed 1/2 S.)

    In the case where there are spans which overlap, the above formula 
shall be applied repeatedly, once for each augmentation, in ascending 
order of central azimuth of augmentation, beginning with zero degrees 
representing true North. Note that, when spans overlap, there will be, 
in effect, an augmentation of an augmentation. And, if the span of an 
earlier augmentation overlaps the central azimuth of a later 
augmentation, the value of ``A'' for the later augmentation will be 
different than the value of ``A'' without the overlap of the earlier 
span.
    (iii) A combination of paragraphs (c)(2) (i) and (ii), of this 
section, with (i) being applied before (ii) is applied.
    (iv) Where the measured inverse distance field exceeds the value 
permitted by the standard pattern, and augmentation is allowable under 
the terms of this section, the requested amount of augmentation shall be 
centered upon the azimuth of the radial upon which the excessive 
radiation was measured and shall not exceed the following:
    (A) The actual measured inverse distance field value, where the 
radial does not involve a required monitoring point.
    (B) 120% of the actual measured inverse field value, where the 
radial has a monitoring point required by the instrument of 
authorization.

Whereas some pattern smoothing can be accommodated, the extent of the 
requested span(s) shall be minimized and in no case shall a requested 
augmentation span extend to a radial azimuth for which the analyzed 
measurement data does not show a need for augmentation.

[[Page 40]]

    (3) A Modified Standard Pattern shall be specifically labeled as 
such, and shall be plotted in accordance with the requirements of 
paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 73.150. The effective (RMS) field strength in 
the horizontal plane of E(<greek-ph><INF>,</INF><greek-a>)<INF>std,</INF> 
E(<greek-ph><INF>,</INF><greek-a>)<INF>th</INF>, and the root sum square 
(RSS) value of the inverse fields of the array elements (derived from 
the equation for E(<greek-ph><INF>,</INF><greek-a>)<INF>th</INF>), shall 
be tabulated on the page on which the horizontal plane pattern is 
plotted. Where sector augmentation has been employed in designing the 
modified pattern, the direction of maximum augmentation (i.e., the 
central azimuth of augmentation) shall be indicated on the horizontal 
plane pattern for each augmented sector, and the limits of each sector 
shall also be shown. Field values within an augmented sector, computed 
prior to augmentation, shall be depicted by a broken line.
    (4) There shall be submitted, for each modified standard pattern, 
complete tabulations of final computed data used in plotting the 
pattern. In addition, for each augmented sector, the central azimuth of 
augmentation, span, and radiation at the central azimuth of augmentation 
(E(<greek-ph><INF>,</INF><greek-a>)<INF>aug</INF>) shall be tabulated.
    (5) The parameters used in computing the modified standard pattern 
shall be specified with realistic precision. Following is a list of the 
maximum acceptable precision:
    (i) Central Azimuth of Augmentation: to the nearest 0.1 degree.
    (ii) Span: to the nearest 0.1 degree.
    (iii) Radiation at Central Azimuth of Augmentation: 4 significant 
figures.
    (d) Sample calculations for a modified standard pattern follow. 
First, assume the existing standard pattern in Sec. 73.150(c). Then, 
assume the following augmentation parameters:

Sec. 73.153  Field strength measurements in support of applications or evidence at hearings.

    In the determination of interference, groundwave field strength 
measurements will take precedence over theoretical values, provided such 
measurements are properly taken and presented. When measurements of 
groundwave signal strength are presented, they shall be sufficiently 
complete in accordance with Sec. 73.186 to determine the field strength 
at 1 mile in the pertinent directions for that station. The antenna 
resistance measurements required by Sec. 73.186 need not be taken or 
submitted.

Sec. 73.154  AM directional antenna partial proof of performance measurements.

    (a) A partial proof of performance consists of at least 10 field 
strength measurements made on each of the radials established in the 
latest complete proof of performance of the directional antenna system.
    (b) The measurements are to be made within 2 to 10 miles (3 to 16 
kilometers) from the center of the antenna array. When a monitoring 
point as designated on the station authorization is on a particular 
radial, one of the radial measurements must be made at that point.
    (c) The results of the measurements are to be analyzed in either of 
two methods. Either the arithmetic average or the logarithmic average of 
the ratios of the field strength at each measurement point along each 
radial to the corresponding field strength in the most recent complete 
proof of performance may be used to establish the inverse distance 
fields. (The logarithmic average for each radial is the antilogarithm of 
the mean of the logarithms of the ratios of field strength

[[Page 41]]

(new to old) for each measurement location along a given radial).
    (d) The result of the most recent partial proof of performance 
measurements and analysis is to be retained in the station records 
available to the FCC upon request.

Sec. 73.157  Antenna testing during daytime.

    (a) The licensee of a station using a directional antenna during 
daytime or nighttime hours may, without further authority, operate 
during daytime hours with the licensed nighttime directional facilities 
or with a nondirectional antenna when conducting monitoring point field 
strength measurements or antenna proof of performance measurements.
    (b) Operation pursuant to this section is subject to the following 
conditions:
    (1) No harmful interference will be caused to any other station.
    (2) The FCC may notify the licensee to modify or cease such 
operation to resolve interference complaints or when such action may 
appear to be in the public interest, convenience and necessity.
    (3) Such operation shall be undertaken only for the purpose of 
taking monitoring point field strength measurements or antenna proof of 
performance measurements, and shall be restricted to the minimum time 
required to accomplish the measurements.
    (4) Operating power in the nondirectional mode shall be adjusted to 
the same power as was utilized for the most recent nondirectional proof 
of performance covering the licensed facilities.

    (a) When a licensee of a station using a directional antenna system 
finds that a field monitoring point, as specified on the station 
authorization, is no longer accessible for use or is unsuitable because 
of nearby construction or other disturbances to the measured field, an 
informal application to change the monitoring point location is to be 
promptly submitted to the FCC in Washington, DC. The application must 
include the following information:
    (1) A partial proof of performance conducted on the radial 
containing the monitoring point to be changed.
    (2) A written description of the routing to the new selected 
monitoring point.
    (3) A map showing the location and routing to the new selected 
monitoring point.
    (4) A photograph showing the new monitoring point in relation to 
nearby permanent landmarks that can be used in locating the point 
accurately at all times throughout the year. Do not use seasonal or 
temporary features in either the written descriptions or photographs as 
landmarks for locating field points.
    (b) When the descriptive routing to reach any of the monitoring 
points as shown on the station license is no longer correct due to road 
or building construction or other changes, the licensee must prepare and 
file with the FCC, in Washington, DC, a request for a corrected station 
license showing the new routing description. A copy of the description 
is to be posted with the existing station license. The notification is 
to include the information specified in paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of 
this section.

is 0 degrees in the horizontal plane, and 90 degrees when perpendicular 
to the horizontal plane. The vertical plane radiation characteristic is 
referred to as f(<greek-th). The generic formula for f(<greek-th) is:

f(<greek-th)=E(<greek-th)/E(O)

where:

    E(<greek-th) is the radiation from the tower at angle 
<greek-th<INF>.
    </INF>E(O) is the radiation from the tower in the horizontal plane.

    (b) Listed below are formulas for f(<greek-th) for several common 
towers.

    B is the difference, in electrical degrees, between the apparent 
electrical height (G, based on current distribution) and the actual 
physical height.
    G is the apparent electrical height: the sum of A and B; A+B.

current distribution) of the lower section of the tower and the physical 
height of the lower section of the tower.
    C is the physical height of the entire tower, in electrical degrees.
    D is the difference between the apparent electrical height of the

physical height of the entire tower. D will be zero if the sectionalized 
tower is not top-loaded.
    G is the sum of A and B; A+B.

    (c) One of the above f(<greek-th) formulas must be used in computing 
radiation in the vertical plane, unless the applicant submits a special 
formula for a particular type of antenna. If a special formula is

<R05>
Sec. 73.182  Engineering standards of allocation.

    (a) Sections 73.21 to 73.37, inclusive, govern allocation of 
facilities in the AM broadcast band 535-1705 kHz. Sec. 73.21 establishes 
three classes of channels in this band, namely, clear, regional and 
local. The classes and power of AM broadcast stations which will be 
assigned to the various channels are set forth in Sec. 73.21. The 
classifications of the AM broadcast stations are as follows:
    (1) Class A stations operate on clear channels with powers no less 
than 10kW nor greater than 50 kW. These stations are designed to render 
primary and secondary service over an extended area, with their primary 
services areas protected from objectionable interference from other 
stations on the same and adjacent channels. Their secondary service 
areas are protected from objectionable interference from co-channel 
stations. For purposes of protection, Class A stations may be divided 
into two groups, those located in any of the contiguous 48 States and 
those located in Alaska in accordance with Sec. 73.25.
    (i) The mainland U.S. Class A stations are those assigned to the 
channels allocated by Sec. 73.25. The power of these stations shall be 
50 kW. The Class A stations in this group are afforded protection as 
follows:
    (A) Daytime. To the 0.1 mV/m groundwave contour from stations on the 
same channel, and to the 0.5 mV/m groundwave contour from stations on 
adjacent channels.
    (B) Nighttime. To the 0.5 mV/m-50% skywave contour from stations on 
the same channels.
    (ii) Class A stations in Alaska operate on the channels allocated by 
Sec. 73.25 with a minimum power of 10 kW, a maximum power of 50 kW, and 
an antenna efficiency of 282 mV/m/kW at 1 kilometer. Stations operating 
on these channels in Alaska which have not been designated as Class A 
stations in response to licensee request will continue to be considered 
as Class B stations. During daytime hours a Class A station in Alaska is 
protected to the 100 <greek-m>V/m groundwave contour from co-channel 
stations. During nighttime hours, a Class A station in Alaska is 
protected to the 100 <greek-m>V/m-50 percent skywave contour from co-
channel stations. The 0.5 mV/m groundwave contour is protected both 
daytime and nighttime from stations on adjacent channels.


[[Page 47]]


    Note:  In the Report and Order in MM Docket No. 83-807, the 
Commission designated 15 stations operating on U.S. clear channels as 
Alaskan Class A stations. Eleven of these stations already have Alaskan 
Class A facilities and are to be protected accordingly. Permanent 
designation of the other four stations as Alaskan Class A is conditioned 
on their constructing minimum Alaskan Class A facilities no later than 
December 31, 1989. Until that date or until such facilities are 
obtained, these four stations shall be temporarily designated as Alaskan 
Class A stations, and calculations involving these stations should be 
based on existing facilities but with an assumed power of 10 kW. 
Thereafter, these stations are to be protected based on their actual 
Alaskan Class A facilities. If any of these stations does not obtain 
Alaskan Class A facilities in the period specified, it is to be 
protected as a Class B station based on its actual facilities. These 
four stations may increase power to 10 kW without regard to the impact 
on co-channel Class B stations. However, power increases by these 
stations above 10 kW (or by existing Alaskan Class A stations beyond 
their current power level) are subject to applicable protection 
requirements for co-channel Class B stations. Other stations not on the 
original list but which meet applicable requirements may obtain Alaskan 
Class A status by seeking such designation from the Commission. If a 
power increase or other change in facilities by a station not on the 
original list is required to obtain minimum Alaskan Class A facilities, 
any such application shall meet the interference protection requirements 
applicable to an Alaskan Class A proposal on the channel.

    (2) Class B stations are stations which operate on clear and 
regional channels with powers not less than 0.25 kW nor more than 50 kW. 
These stations render primary service only, the area of which depends on 
their geographical location, power, and frequency. It is recommended 
that Class B stations be located so that the interference received from 
other stations will not limit the service area to a groundwave contour 
value greater than 2.0 mV/m nighttime and to the 0.5 mV/m groundwave 
contour daytime, which are the values for the mutual protection between 
this class of stations and other stations of the same class.

    Note: See Secs. 73.21(b)(1) and 73.26(b) concerning power 
restrictions and classifications relative to Class B, Class C, and Class 
D stations in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
Stations in the above-named places that are reclassified from Class C to 
Class B stations under Sec. 73.26(b) shall not be authorized to increase 
power to levels that would increase the nighttime interference-free 
limit of co-channel Class C stations in the conterminous United States.

    (3) Class C stations operate on local channels, normally rendering 
primary service to a community and the suburban or rural areas 
immediately contiguous thereto, with powers not less than 0.25 kW, nor 
more than 1 kW, except as provided in Sec. 73.21(c)(1). Such stations 
are normally protected to the daytime 0.5 mV/m contour. On local 
channels the separation required for the daytime protection shall also 
determine the nighttime separation. Where directional antennas are 
employed daytime by Class C stations operating with more than 0.25 kW 
power, the separations required shall in no case be less than those 
necessary to afford protection, assuming nondirectional operation with 
0.25 kW. In no case will 0.25 kW or greater nighttime power be 
authorized to a station unable to operate nondirectionally with a power 
of 0.25 kW during daytime hours. The actual nighttime limitation will be 
calculated. For nighttime protection purposes, Class C stations in the 
48 contiguous United States may assume that stations in Alaska, Hawaii, 
Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands operating on 1230, 1240, 1340, 
1400, 1450, and 1490 kHz are Class C stations.
    (4) Class D stations operate on clear and regional channels with 
daytime powers of not less than 0.25 kW (or equivalent RMS field of 141 
mV/m at one kilometer if less than 0.25 kW) and not more than 50 kW. 
Class D stations that have previously received nighttime authority 
operate with powers of less than 0.25 kW (or equivalent RMS fields of 
less than 141 mV/m at one kilometer) are not required to provide 
nighttime coverage in accordance with Sec. 73.24(j) and are not 
protected from interference during nighttime hours. Such nighttime 
authority is permitted on the basis of full nighttime protection being 
afforded to all Class A and Class B stations.
    (b) When a station is already limited by interference from other 
stations to

[[Page 48]]

a contour value greater than that normally protected for its class, the 
individual received limits shall be the established standard for such 
station with respect to interference from each other station.
    (c) The four classes of AM broadcast stations have in general three 
types of service areas, i.e., primary, secondary and intermittent. (See 
Sec. 73.14 for the definitions of primary, secondary, and intermittent 
service areas.) Class A stations render service to all three areas. 
Class B stations render service to a primary area but the secondary and 
intermittent service areas may be materially limited or destroyed due to 
interference from other stations, depending on the station assignments 
involved. Class C and Class D stations usually have only primary service 
areas. Interference from other stations may limit intermittent service 
areas and generally prevents any secondary service to those stations 
which operate at night. Complete intermittent service may still be 
obtained in many cases depending on the station assignments involved.
    (d) The groundwave signal strength required to render primary 
service is 2 mV/m for communities with populations of 2,500 or more and 
0.5 mV/m for communities with populations of less than 2,500. See 
Sec. 73.184 for curves showing distance to various groundwave field 
strength contours for different frequencies and ground conductivities, 
and also see Sec. 73.183, ``Groundwave signals.''
    (e) A Class C station may be authorized to operate with a 
directional antenna during daytime hours providing the power is at least 
0.25 kW. In computing the degrees of protection which such antenna will 
afford, the radiation produced by the directional antenna system will be 
assumed to be no less, in any direction, than that which would result 
from non-directional operation using a single element of the directional 
array, with 0.25 kW.
    (f) All classes of broadcast stations have primary service areas 
subject to limitation by fading and noise, and interference from other 
stations to the contours set out for each class of station.
    (g) Secondary service is provided during nighttime hours in areas 
where the skywave field strength, 50% or more of the time, is 0.5 mV/m 
or greater (0.1 mV/m in Alaska). Satisfactory secondary service to 
cities is not considered possible unless the field strength of the 
skywave signal approaches or exceeds the value of the groundwave field 
strength that is required for primary service. Secondary service is 
subject to some interference and extensive fading whereas the primary 
service area of a station is subject to no objectionable interference or 
fading. Only Class A stations are assigned on the basis of rendering 
secondary service.

    Note: Standards have not been established for objectionable fading 
because of the relationship to receiver characteristics. Selective 
fading causes audio distortion and signal strength reduction below the 
noise level, objectionable characteristics inherent in many modern 
receivers. The AVC circuits in the better designed receivers generally 
maintain the audio output at a sufficiently constant level to permit 
satisfactory reception during most fading conditions.

    (h) Intermittent service is rendered by the groundwave and begins at 
the outer boundary of the primary service area and extends to a distance 
where the signal strength decreases to a value that is too low to 
provide any service. This may be as low as a few <greek-m>V/m in certain 
areas and as high as several millivolts per meter in other areas of high 
noise level, interference from other stations, or objectionable fading 
at night. The intermittent service area may vary widely from day to 
night and generally varies over shorter intervals of time. Only Class A 
stations are protected from interference from other stations to the 
intermittent service area.
    (i) Broadcast stations are licensed to operate unlimited time, 
limited time, daytime, share time, and specified hours. (See 
Secs. 73.1710, 73.1725, 73.1720, 73.1715, and 73.1730.) Applications for 
new stations shall specify unlimited time operation only.
    (j) Section 73.24 sets out the general requirements for modifying 
the facilities of a licensed station and for establishing a new station. 
Sections 73.24(b) and 73.37 include interference related

[[Page 49]]

provisions that be considered in connection with an application to 
modify the facilities of an existing station or to establish a new 
station. Section 73.30 describes the procedural steps required to 
receive an authorization to operate in the 1605-1705 kHz band.
    (k) Objectionable nighttime interference from a broadcast station 
occurs when, at a specified field strength contour with respect to the 
desired station, the field strength of an undesired station (co-channel 
or first adjacent channel, after application of proper protection ratio) 
exceeds for 10% or more of the time the values set forth in these 
standards. The value derived from the root-sum-square of all 
interference contributions represents the extent of a station's 
interference-free coverage.
    (1) With respect to the root-sum-square (RSS) values of interfering 
field strengths referred to in this section, calculation of nighttime 
interference-free service is accomplished by considering the signals on 
the three channels of concern (co- and first adjacencies) in order of 
decreasing magnitude, adding the squares of the values and extracting 
the square root of the sum, excluding those signals which are less than 
50% of the RSS values of the higher signals already included.
    (2) With respect to the root-sum-square values of interfering field 
strengths referred to in this section, calculation of nighttime 
interference for non-coverage purposes is accomplished by considering 
the signals on the three channels of concern (co- and first adjacencies) 
in order of decreasing magnitude, adding the squares of the values and 
extracting the square root of the sum, excluding those signals which are 
less than 25% of the RSS values of the higher signals already included.
    (3) With respect to the root-sum-square values of interfering field 
strengths referred to in this section, calculation is accomplished by 
considering the signals on the three channels of concern (co- and first 
adjacencies) in order of decreasing magnitude, adding the squares of the 
values and extracting the square root of the sum. The 0% exclusion 
method applies only to the determination of an improvement factor value 
for evaluating a station's eligibility for migration to the band 1605-
1705 kHz.
    (4) The RSS value will not be considered to be increased when a new 
interfering signal is added which is less than the appropriate exclusion 
percentage as applied to the RSS value of the interference from existing 
stations, and which at the same time is not greater than the smallest 
signal included in the RSS value of interference from existing stations.
    (5) It is recognized that application of the above ``50% exclusion'' 
method (or any exclusion method using a per cent value greater than 
zero) of calculating the RSS interference may result in some cases in 
anomalies wherein the addition of a new interfering signal or the 
increase in value of an existing interfering signal will cause the 
exclusion of a previously included signal and may cause a decrease in 
the calculated RSS value of interference. In order to provide the 
Commission with more realistic information regarding gains and losses in 
service (as a basis for determination of the relative merits of a 
proposed operation) the following alternate method for calculating the 
proposed RSS values of interference will be employed wherever 
applicable.
    (6) In the cases where it is proposed to add a new interfering 
signal which is not less than 50% (or 25%, depending on which study is 
being performed) of the RSS value of interference from existing stations 
or which is greater that the smallest signal already included to obtain 
this RSS value, the RSS limitation after addition of the new signal 
shall be calculated without excluding any signal previously included. 
Similarly, in cases where it is proposed to increase the value of one of 
the existing interfering signals which has been included in the RSS 
value, the RSS limitation after the increase shall be calculated without 
excluding the interference from any source previously included.
    (7) If the new or increased signal proposed in such cases is 
ultimately authorized, the RSS values of interference to other stations 
affected will thereafter be calculated by the ``50% exclusion'' (or 25% 
exclusion, depending on which study is being performed)

[[Page 50]]

method without regard to this alternate method of calculation.
    (8) Examples of RSS interference calculations:
    (i) Existing interferences:

    Station No. 1--1.00 mV/m.
    Station No. 2--0.60 mV/m.
    Station No. 3--0.59 mV/m.
    Station No. 4--0.58 mV/m.

The RSS value from Nos. 1, 2 and 3 is 1.31 mV/m; therefore interference 
from No. 4 is excluded for it is less than 50% of 1.31 mV/m.

    (ii) Station A receives interferences from:

    Station No. 1--1.00 mV/m.
    Station No. 2--0.60 mV/m.
    Station No. 3--0.59 mV/m.

It is proposed to add a new limitation, 0.68 mV/m. This is more than 50% 
of 1.31 mV/m, the RSS value from Nos. 1, 2 and 3. The RSS value of 
Station No. 1 and of the proposed station would be 1.21 m/Vm which is 
more than twice as large as the limitation from Station No. 2 or No. 3. 
However, under the above provision the new signal and the three existing 
interferences are nevertheless calculated for purposes of comparative 
studies, resulting in an RSS value of 1.47 mV/m. However, if the 
proposed station is ultimately authorized, only No. 1 and the new signal 
are included in all subsequent calculations for the reason that Nos. 2 
and 3 are less than 50% of 1.21 mV/m, the RSS value of the new signal 
and No. 1.

    (iii) Station A receives interferences from:

    Station No. 1--1.00 mV/m.
    Station No. 2--0.60 mV/m.
    Station No. 3--0.59 mV/m.

No. 1 proposes to increase the limitation it imposes on Station A to 
1.21 mV/m. Although the limitations from stations Nos. 2 and 3 are less 
than 50% of the 1.21 mV/m limitation, under the above provision they are 
nevertheless included for comparative studies, and the RSS limitation is 
calculated to be 1.47 mV/m. However, if the increase proposed by Station 
No. 1 is authorized, the RSS value then calculated is 1.21 mV/m because 
Stations Nos. 2 and 3 are excluded in view of the fact that the 
limitations they impose are less than 50% of 1.21 mV/m.

    Note: The principles demonstrated in the previous examples for the 
calculation of the 50% exclusion method also apply to calculations using 
the 25% exclusion method after appropriate adjustment.

    (l) Objectionable nighttime interference from a station shall be 
considered to exist to a station when, at the field strength contour 
specified in paragraph (q) of this section with respect to the class to 
which the station belongs, the field strength of an interfering station 
operating on the same channel or on a first adjacent channel after 
signal adjustment using the proper protection ratio, exceeds for 10% or 
more of the time the value of the permissible interfering signal set 
forth opposite such class in paragraph (q) of this section.
    (m) For the purpose of estimating the coverage and the interfering 
effects of stations in the absence of field strength measurements, use 
shall be made of Figure 8 of Sec. 73.190, which describes the estimated 
effective field (for 1 kW power input) of simple vertical 
omnidirectional antennas of various heights with ground systems having 
at least 120 quarter-wavelength radials. Certain approximations, based 
on the curve or other appropriate theory, may be made when other than 
such antennas and ground systems are employed, but in any event the 
effective field to be employed shall not be less than the following:

                                                                        
------------------------------------------------------------------------
              Class of station                Effective field (at 1 km) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
All Class A (except Alaskan)...............  362 mV/m.                  
Class A (Alaskan), B and D.................  282 mV/m.                  
Class C....................................  241 mV/m.                  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note (1): When a directional antenna is employed, the radiated signal of
  a broadcasting station will vary in strength in different directions, 
  possibly being greater than the above values in certain directions and
  less in other directions depending upon the design and adjustment of  
  the directional antenna system. To determine the interference in any  
  direction, the measured or calculated radiated field (unattenuated    
  field strength at 1 kilometer from the array) must be used in         
  conjunction with the appropriate propagation curves. (See Sec.  73.185
  for further discussion and solution of a typical directional antenna  
  case.)                                                                
Note (2): For Class B stations in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the   
  U.S. Virgin Islands, 241 mV/m shall be used.                          

    (n) The existence or absence of objectionable groundwave 
interference from stations on the same or adjacent channels shall be 
determined by actual measurements made in accordance with the method 
described in Sec. 73.186, or in the absence of such measurements, by 
reference to the propagation curves of Sec. 73.184. The existence or 
absence of objectionable interference due to skywave propagation shall 
be determined by reference to Formula 2 in Sec. 73.190.
    (o) Computation of Skywave Field Strength Values:

[[Page 51]]

    (1) Fifty Percent Skywave Field Strength Values (Clear Channel). In 
computing the fifty percent skywave field strength values of a Class A 
clear channel station, use shall be made of Formula 1 of Sec. 73.190, 
entitled ``Skywave Field Strength'' for 50 percent of the time.
    (2) Ten Percent Skywave Field Strength Values. In computing the 10% 
skywave field strength for stations on a single signal or an RSS basis, 
Formula 2 in Sec. 73.190 shall be used.
    (3) Determination of Angles of Departure. In calculating skywave 
field strength for stations on all channels, the pertinent vertical 
angle shall be determined by use of the formula in Sec. 73.190(d).
    (p) The distance to any specified groundwave field strength contour 
for any frequency may be determined from the appropriate curves in 
Sec. 73.184 entitled ``Ground Wave Field Strength vs. Distance.''
    (q) Normally protected service contours and permissible interference 
signals for broadcast stations are as follows (for Class A stations, see 
also paragraph (a) of this section):

\1\ When a station is already limited by interference from other stations to a contour of higher value than that
  normally protected for its class, this higher value contour shall be the established protection standard for  
  such station. Changes proposed by Class A and B stations shall be required to comply with the following       
  restrictions. Those interferers that contribute to another station's RSS using the 50% exclusion method are   
  required to either reduce their contributions to that RSS by 10%, or to a level at which their contributions  
  no longer enter into the 50% RSS value, whichever is the lesser amount of reduction. Those interferers that   
  contribute to a station's RSS using the 25% exclusion method but do not contribute to that station's RSS using
  the 50% exclusion method may make changes not to exceed their present contribution. Interferers not included  
  in a station's RSS using the 25% exclusion method are permitted to increase radiation as long as the 25%      
  exclusion threshold is not equalled or exceeded. In no case will a reduction be required that would result in 
  a contributing value that is below the pertinent value specified in the table. This note does not apply to    
  Class C stations; or to the protection of Class A stations which are normally protected on a single signal,   
  non-RSS basis.

\4\ During nighttime hours, Class C stations in the contiguous 48 States may treat all Class B stations assigned
  to 1230, 1240, 1340, 1400, 1450 and 1490 kHz in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands as if 
  they were Class C stations.

    (r) The following table of logarithmic expressions is to be used as 
required for determining the minimum permissible ratio of the field 
strength of a desired to an undesired signal. This table shall be used 
in conjunction with the protected contours specified in paragraph (q) of 
this section.

    (s) Two stations, one with a frequency twice of the other, should 
not be assigned in the same groundwave service area unless special 
precautions are taken to avoid interference from the second harmonic of 
the station operating on the lower frequency. Additionally, in selecting 
a frequency, consideration should be given to the fact that occasionally 
the frequency assignment of two stations in the same area may bear such 
a relation to the intermediate frequency of some broadcast

[[Page 52]]

receivers as to cause ``image'' interference, However, since this can 
usually be rectified by readjustment of the intermediate frequency of 
such receivers, the Commission, in general, will not take this kind of 
interference into consideration when authorizing stations.
    (t) The groundwave service of two stations operating with 
synchronized carriers and broadcasting identical programs will be 
subject to some distortion in areas where the signals from the two 
stations are of comparable strength. For the purpose of estimating 
coverage of such stations, areas in which the signal ratio is between 
1:2 and 2:1 will not be considered as receiving satisfactory service.

    Note: Two stations are considered to be operated synchronously when 
the carriers are maintained within 0.2 Hz of each other and they 
transmit identical program s.

Sec. 73.183  Groundwave signals.

    (a) Interference that may be caused by a proposed assignment or an 
existing assignment during daytime hours should be determined, when 
possible, by measurements on the frequency involved or on another 
frequency over the same terrain and by means for the curves in 
Sec. 73.184 entitled ``Ground Wave Field Strength versus Distance.''

    Note: Groundwave field strength measurements will not be accepted or 
considered for the purpose of establishing that interference to a 
station in a foreign country other than Canada, or that the field 
strength at the border thereof, would be less than indicated by the use 
of the ground conductivity maps and engineering standards contained in 
this part and applicable international agreements. Satisfactory 
groundwave measurements offered for the purpose of demonstrating values 
of conductivity other than those shown by Figure M3 in problems 
involving protection of Canadian stations will be considered only if, 
after review thereof, the appropriate agency of the Canadian government 
notifies the Commission that they are acceptable for such purpose.

    (b)(1) In all cases where measurements taken in accordance with the 
requirements are not available, the groundwave strength must be 
determined by means of the pertinent map of ground conductivity and the 
groundwave curves of field strength versus distance. The conductivity of 
a given terrain may be determined by measurements of any broadcast 
signal traversing the terrain involved. Figure M3 (See Note 1) shows the 
conductivity throughout the United States by general areas of reasonably 
uniform conductivity. When it is clear that only one conductivity value 
is involved, Figure R3 of Sec. 73.190, may be used. It is a replica of 
Figure M3, and is contained in these standards. In all other situations 
Figure M3 must be employed. It is recognized that in areas of limited 
size or over a particular path, the conductivity may vary widely from 
the values given; therefore, these maps are to be used only when 
accurate and acceptable measurements have not been made.
    (2) For determinations of interference and service requiring a 
knowledge of ground conductivities in other countries, the ground 
conductivity maps comprising Appendix 1 to Annex 2 of each of the 
following international agreements may be used:
    (i) For Canada, the U.S.-Canada AM Agreement, 1984;
    (ii) For Mexico, the U.S.-Mexico AM Agreement, 1986; and
    (iii) For other Western Hemisphere countries, the Regional Agreement 
for the Medium Frequency Broadcasting Service in Region 2.
    Where different conductivities appear in the maps of two countries 
on opposite sides of the border, such differences are to be considered 
as real, even if they are not explained by geophysical cleavages.
    (c) Example of determining interference by the graphs in 
Sec. 73.184:

    It is desired to determine whether objectionable interference exists 
between a proposed 5 kW Class B station on 990 kHz and an existing 1 kW 
Class B station on first adjacent channel, 1000 kHz. The distance 
between the two stations is 260 kilometers and both stations operate 
nondirectionally with antenna systems that produce a horizontal 
effective field of 282 in mV/m at one kilometer. (See Sec. 73.185 
regarding use of directional antennas.) The ground conductivity at the 
site of each station and along the intervening terrain is 6 mS/m. The 
protection to Class B stations during daytime is to the 500 <greek-m>V/m

[[Page 53]]

(0.5 Vm) contour using a 6 dB protection factor. The distance to the 500 
<greek-m>V/m groundwave contour of the 1 kW station is determined by the 
use of the appropriate curve in Sec. 73.184. Since the curve is plotted 
for 100 mV/m at a 1 kilometer, to find the distance of the 0.5 mV/m 
contour of the 1 kw station, it is necessary to determine the distance 
to the 0.1773 m/Vm contour.

(100 x 0.5/282=0.1773)

Using the 6 mS/m curve, the estimated radius of the 0.5 mV/m contour is 
62.5 kilometers. Subtracting this distance from the distance between the 
two stations leaves 197.5 kilometers. Using the same propagation curve, 
the signal from the 5 kW station at this distance is seen to be 0.059 
mV/m. Since a protection ratio of 6 dB, desired to undesired signal, 
applies to stations separated by 10 kHz, the undesired signal could have 
had a value of up to 0.25 mV/m without causing objectionable 
interference. For co-channel studies, a desired to undesired signal 
ratio of no less than 20:1 (26 dB) is required to avoid causing 
objectionable interference.

    (d) Where a signal traverses a path over which different 
conductivities exist, the distance to a particular groundwave field 
strength contour shall be determined by the use of the equivalent 
distance method. Reasonably accurate results may be expected in 
determining field strengths at a distance from the antenna by 
application of the equivalent distance method when the unattenuated 
field of the antenna, the various ground conductivities and the location 
of discontinuities are known. This method considers a wave to be 
propagated across a given conductivity according to the curve for a 
homogeneous earth of that conductivity. When the wave crosses from a 
region of one conductivity into a region of a second conductivity, the 
equivalent distance of the receiving point from the transmitter changes 
abruptly but the field strength does not. From a point just inside the 
second region the transmitter appears to be at that distance where, on 
the curve for a homogeneous earth of the second conductivity, the field 
strength equals the value that occurred just across the boundary in the 
first region. Thus the equivalent distance from the receiving point to 
the transmitter may be either greater or less than the actual distance. 
An imaginary transmitter is considered to exist at that equivalent 
distance. This technique is not intended to be used as a means of 
evaluating unattenuated field or ground conductivity by the analysis of 
measured data. The method to be employed for such determinations is set 
out in Sec. 73.186.
    (e) Example of the use of the equivalent distance method;

    It is desired to determine the distance to the 0.5 mV/m and 0.025 
mV/m contours of a station on a frequency of 1000 kHz with an inverse 
distance field of 100 mV/m at one kilometer being radiated over a path 
having a conductivity of 10 mS/m for a distance of 20 kilometers, 5 mS/m 
for the next 30 kilometers and 15 mS/m thereafter. Using the appropriate 
curve in Sec. 73.184, Graph 12, at a distance of 20 kilometers on the 
curve for 10 mS/m, the field strength is found to be 2.84 mV/m. On the 
5mS/m curve, the equivalent distance to this field strength is 14.92 
kilometers, which is 5.08 (20-14.92 kilometers nearer to the 
transmitter. Continuing on the propagation curve, the distance to a 
field strength of 0.5 mV/m is found to be 36.11 kilomteres.
    The actual length of the path travelled, however, is 41.19 
(36.11+5.08) kilometers. Continuing on this propagation curve to the 
conductivity change at 44.92 (50.00-5.08) kilometers, the field strength 
is found to be 0.304 mV/m. On the 15 mS/m propagation curve, the 
equivalent distance to this field strength is 82.94 kilometers, which 
changes the effective path length by 38.02 (82.94-44.92) kilometers. 
Continuing on this propagation curve, the distance to a field strength 
of 0.025 mV/m is seen to be 224.4 kilometers. The actual length of the 
path travelled, however, is 191.46 (224.4+5.08-38.02) kilometers.

Sec. 73.184  Groundwave field strength graphs.

    (a) Graphs 1 to 20 show, for each of 20 frequencies, the computed 
values of groundwave field strength as a function of groundwave 
conductivity and distance from the source of radiation. The groundwave 
field strength is considered to be that part of the vertical component 
of the electric field which has not been reflected from the ionosphere 
nor from the troposphere. These 20 families of curves are plotted on 
log-log graph paper and each is to be used for the range of frequencies 
shown

[[Page 54]]

thereon. Computations are based on a dielectric constant of the ground 
(referred to air as unity) equal to 15 for land and 80 for sea water and 
for the ground conductivities (expressed in mS/m) given on the curves. 
The curves show the variation of the groundwave field strength with 
distance to be expected for transmission from a vertical antenna at the 
surface of a uniformly conducting spherical earth with the groundwave 
constants shown on the curves. The curves are for an antenna power of 
such efficiency and current distribution that the inverse distance 
(unattenuated) field is 100 mV/m at 1 kilometer. The curves are valid 
for distances that are large compared to the dimensions of the antenna 
for other than short vertical antennas.
    (b) The inverse distance field (100 mV/m divided by the distance in 
kilometers) corresponds to the groundwave field intensity to be expected 
from an antenna with the same radiation efficiency when it is located 
over a perfectly conducting earth. To determine the value of the 
groundwave field intensity corresponding to a value of inverse distance 
field other than 100 mV/m at 1 kilometer, multiply the field strength as 
given on these graphs by the desired value of inverse distance field at 
1 kilometer divided by 100; for example, to determine the groundwave 
field strength for a station with an inverse distance field of 2700 mV/m 
at 1 kilometer, simply multiply the values given on the charts by 27. 
The value of the inverse distance field to be used for a particular 
antenna depends upon the power input to the antenna, the nature of the 
ground in the neighborhood of the antenna, and the geometry of the 
antenna. For methods of calculating the interrelations between these 
variables and the inverse distance field, see ``The Propagation of Radio 
Waves Over the Surface of the Earth and in the Upper Atmosphere,'' Part 
II, by Mr. K.A. Norton, Proc. I.R.E., Vol. 25, September 1937, pp. 1203-
1237.

    Note:  The computed values of field strength versus distance used to 
plot Graphs 1 to 20 are available in tabular form. For information on 
obtaining copies of these tabulations call or write the Consumer Affairs 
Office, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554, (202) 
632-7000.

    (c) Provided the value of the dielectric constant is near 15, the 
ground conductivity curves of Graphs 1 to 20 may be compared with actual 
field strength measurement data to determine the appropriate values of 
the ground conductivity and the inverse distance field strength at 1 
kilometer. This is accomplished by plotting the measured field strengths 
on transparent log-log graph paper similar to that used for Graphs 1 to 
20 and superimposing the plotted graph over the Graph corresponding to 
the frequency of the station measured. The plotted graph is then shifted 
vertically until the plotted measurement data is best aligned with one 
of the conductivity curves on the Graph; the intersection of the inverse 
distance line on the Graph with the 1 kilometer abscissa on the plotted 
graph determines the inverse distance field strength at 1 kilometer. For 
other values of dielectric constant, the following procedure may be used 
to determine the dielectric constant of the ground, the ground 
conductivity and the inverse distance field strength at 1 kilometer. 
Graph 21 gives the relative values of groundwave field strength over a 
plane earth as a function of the numerical distance p and phase angle b. 
On graph paper with coordinates similar to those of Graph 21, plot the 
measured values of field strength as ordinates versus the corresponding 
distances from the antenna in kilometers as abscissae. The data should 
be plotted only for distances greater than one wavelength (or, when this 
is greater, five times the vertical height of the antenna in the case of 
a nondirectional antenna or 10 times the spacing between the elements of 
a directional antenna) and for distances less than 
80f\1\<SUP>/</SUP>\3\MHz kilometers (i.e., 80 kilometers at 1 MHz). 
Then, using a light box, place the plotted graph over Graph 21 and shift 
the plotted graph vertically and horizontally (making sure that the 
vertical lines on both sheets are parallel) until the best fit with the 
data is obtained with one of the curves on Graph 21. When the two sheets 
are properly lined up, the value of the field strength corresponding to 
the intersection of the inverse distance line of Graph 21 with the 1 
kilometer

[[Page 55]]

abscissa on the data sheet is the inverse distance field strength at 1 
kilometer, and the values of the numerical distance at 1 kilometer, 
p<INF>1</INF>, and of b are also determined. Knowing the values of b and 
p<INF>1</INF> (the numerical distance at one kilometer), we may 
substitute in the following approximate values of the ground 
conductivity and dielectric constant.

Equation (2) may then be solved for <greek-d> and equation (3) for 
<greek-e>. At distances greater than 80/f\1\<SUP>/</SUP>\3\ MHz 
kilometers the curves of Graph 21 do not give the correct relative 
values of field strength since the curvature of the earth weakens the 
field more rapidly than these plane earth curves would indicate. Thus, 
no attempt should be made to fit experimental data to these curves at 
the larger distances.

    Note: For other values of dielectric constant, use can be made of 
the computer program which was employed by the FCC in generating the 
curves in Graphs 1 to 20. For information on obtaining a printout of 
this program, call or write the Consumer Affairs Office, Federal 
Communications Commission, Washington, DC 200554, (202) 632-7000.

    (d) At sufficiently short distances (less than 55 kilometers at AM 
broadcast frequencies), such that the curvature of the earth does not 
introduce an additional attenuation of the waves, the curves of Graph 21 
may be used to determine the groundwave field strength of transmitting 
and receiving antennas at the surface of the earth for any radiated 
power, frequency, or set of ground constants. First, trace the straight 
inverse distance line corresponding to the power radiated on transparent 
log-log graph paper similar to that of Graph 21, labelling the ordinates 
of the chart in terms of field strength, and the abscissae in terms of 
distance. Next, using the formulas given on Graph 21, calculate the 
value of the numerical distance, p, at 1 kilometer, and the value of b. 
Then superimpose the log-log graph paper over Graph 21, shifting it 
vertically until both inverse distance lines coincide and shifting it 
horizontally until the numerical distance at 1 kilometer on Graph 21 
coincides with 1 kilometer on the log-log graph paper. The curve of 
Graph 21 corresponding to the calculated value of b is then traced on 
the log-log graph paper giving the field strength versus distance in 
kilometers.
    (e) This paragraph consists of the following Graphs 1 to 20 and 21.

    Note: The referenced graphs are not published in the CFR, nor will 
they be included in the Commission's automated rules system. For

Affairs Office, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554,

Sec. 73.185  Computation of interfering signal.

    (a) Measured values of radiation are not to be used in calculating 
overlap, interference, and coverage.
    (1) In the case of an antenna which is intended to be non-
directional in the horizontal plane, an ideal non-directional radiation 
pattern shall be used in determining interference, overlap, and 
coverage, even if the antenna is not actually non-directional.
    (2) In the case of an antenna which is directional in the horizontal 
plane, the radiation which shall be used in determining interference, 
overlap, and coverage is that calculated pursuant to Sec. 73.150 or 
Sec. 73.152, depending on whether the station has a standard or modified 
standard pattern.
    (3) In the case of calculation of interference or overlap to (not 
from) a foreign station, the notified radiation

[[Page 56]]

shall be used, even if the notified radiation differs from that in 
paragraphs (a) (1) or (2) of this section.
    (b) For skywave signals from stations operating on all channels, 
interference shall be determined from the appropriate formulas and 
Figure 6a contained in Sec. 73.190.
    (c) The formulas in Sec. 73.190(d) depicted in Figure 6a of 
Sec. 73.190, entitled ``Angles of Departure versus Transmission Range'' 
are to be used in determining the angles in the vertical pattern of the 
antenna of an interfering station to be considered as pertinent to 
transmission by one reflection. To provide for variation in the 
pertinent vertical angle due to variations of ionosphere height and 
ionosphere scattering, the curves 2 and 3 indicate the upper and lower 
angles within which the radiated field is to be considered. The maximum 
value of field strength occurring between these angles shall be used to 
determine the multiplying factor to apply to the 10 percent skywave 
field intensity value determined from Formula 2 in Sec. 73.190. The 
multiplying factor is found by dividing the maximum radiation between 
the pertinent angles by 100 mV/m.
    (d) Example of the use of skywave curves and formulas: Assume a 
proposed new Class B station from which interference may be expected is 
located at a distance of 724 kilometers from a licensed Class B station. 
The proposed station specifies geographic coordinates of 40 deg.00'00'N 
and 100 deg. 00'00'W and the station to be protected is located at an 
azimuth of 45 deg. true at geographic coordinates of 44 deg.26'05'N and 
93 deg.32'54'W. The critical angles of radiation as determined from 
Figure 6a of Sec. 73.190 for use with Class B stations are 9.6 deg. and 
16.6 deg.. If the vertical pattern of the antenna of the proposed 
station in the direction of the existing station is such that, between 
the angles of 9.6 deg. and 16.6 deg. above the horizon the maximum 
radiation is 260 mV/m at one kilometer, the value of the 50% field, as 
derived from Formula 1 of Sec. 73.190, is 0.06217 mV/m at the location 
of the existing station. To obtain the value of the 10% field, the 50% 
value must be adjusted by a factor derived from Formula 2 of 
Sec. 73.190. The value in this case is 8.42 dB. Thus, the 10% field is 
0.1616 mV/m. Using this in conjunction with the co-channel protection 
ratio of 26 dB, the resultant nighttime limit from the proposed station 
to the licensed station is 3.232 mV/m.
    (e) In the case of an antenna which is non-directional in the 
horizontal plane, the vertical distribution of the relative fields 
should be computed pursuant to Sec. 73.160. In the case of an antenna 
which is directional in the horizontal plane, the vertical pattern in 
the great circle direction toward the point of reception in question 
must first be calculated. In cases where the radiation in the vertical 
plane, at the pertinent azimuth, contains a large lobe at a higher angle 
than the pertinent angle for one reflection, the method of calculating 
interference will not be restricted to that just described; each such 
case will be considered on the basis of the best knowledge available.
    (f) In performing calculations to determine permissible radiation 
from stations operating presunrise or postsunset in accordance with 
Sec. 73.99, calculated diurnal factors will be multiplied by the values 
of skywave field strength for such stations obtained from Formula 1 or 2 
of Sec. 73.190.
    (1) The diurnal factor is determined using the time of day at the 
mid-point of path between the site of the interfering station and the 
point at which interference is being calculated. Diurnal factors are 
computed using the formula 
D<INF>f</INF>=a+bF+cF<SUP>2</SUP>+dF<SUP>3</SUP> where:

D<INF>f</INF> represents the diurnal factor,
F is the frequency in MHz,
a,b,c, and d are constants obtained from the tables in paragraph (k)(2)


A diurnal factor greater than one will not be used in calculations and 
interpolation is to be used between calculated values where necessary. 
For reference purposes, curves for presunrise and postsunset diurnal 
factors are contained in Figures 13 and 14 of Sec. 73.190.
    (2) Constants used in calculating diurnal factors for the presunrise 
and postsunset periods are contained in paragraphs (f)(2) (i) and (ii) 
of this section respectively. The columns labeled T<INF>mp</INF> 
represent the number of hours before and after sunrise and sunset at the 
path midpoint.

    Editorial Note: At 56 FR 64867, Dec. 12, 1991, Sec. 73.185 was 
amended by redesignating paragraphs (d), (e), (h), and (k) as (c), (d), 
(e), and (f), resulting in two consecutive paragraph (f)'s. These 
paragraphs will be correctly designated by a Federal Communication 
Commission document published in the Federal Register at a later date.
    (f) For stations operating on regional and local channels, 
interfering skywave field intensities shall be determined in accordance 
with the procedure specified in (d) of this section and illustrated in 
(e) of this section, except that Figure 2 of Sec. 73.190 is used in 
place of Figure 1a and 1b and the formulas of Sec. 73.190. In using 
Figure 2 of Sec. 73.190, one additional parameter must be considered, 
i.e., the variation of received field with the latitude of the path.
    (g) Figure 2 of Sec. 73.190, ``10 percent Skywave Signal Range 
Chart,'' shows the signal as a function of the latitude of the 
transmission path, which is defined as the geographic latitude of the 
midpoint between the transmitter and receiver. When using Figure 2 of 
Sec. 73.190, latitude 35 deg. should be used in case the mid-point of 
the path lies below 35 deg. North and latitude 50 deg. should be used in 
case the mid-point of the path lies above 50 deg. North.

Sec. 73.186  Establishment of effective field at one kilometer.

    (a) Section 73.189 provides that certain minimum field strengths are 
acceptable in lieu of the required minimum physical heights of the 
antennas proper. Also, in other situations, it may be necessary to 
determine the effective field. The following requirements shall govern 
the taking and submission of data on the field strength produced:
    (1) Beginning as near to the antenna as possible without including 
the induction field and to provide for the fact that a broadcast antenna 
is not a point source of radiation (not less than one wave length or 5 
times the vertical height in the case of a single element, i.e., 
nondirectional antenna or 10 times the spacing between the elements of a 
directional antenna), measurements shall be made on eight or more 
radials, at intervals of approximately 0.2 kilometer up to 3 kilometers 
(1.87 miles) from the antenna, at intervals of approximately 1 kilometer 
from 3 kilometers (1.87 miles) to 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) from the 
antenna, at intervals of approximately 3 kilometers from 10 kilometers 
(6.2 miles) to 25 or 34 kilometers (15.5 miles or 20 miles) from the 
antenna, and a few additional measurements if needed at greater 
distances from the antenna. Where the antenna is rurally located and 
unobstructed measurements can be made, there shall be as many as 18 
measurements on each radial. However, where the antenna is located in a 
city where unobstructed measurements are difficult to make, measurements 
shall be made on each radial at as many unobstructed locations as 
possible, even though the intervals are considerably less than stated 
above, particularly within 3 kilometers of the antenna. In cases where 
it is not possible to obtain accurate measurements at the closer 
distances (even out to 8 or 10 kilometers due to

[[Page 58]]

the character of the intervening terrain), the measurements at greater 
distances should be made at closer intervals. (It is suggested that 
``wave tilt'' measurements may be made to determine and compare 
locations for taking field strength measurements, particularly to 
determine that there are no abrupt changes in ground conductivity or 
that reflected waves are not causing abnormal strengths.
    (2) The data required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section should be 
plotted for each radial in accordance with either of the two methods set 
forth below:
    (i) Using log-log coordinate paper, plot field strengths as ordinate 
and distance as abscissa.
    (ii) Using semi-log coordinate paper, plot field strength times 
distance as ordinate on the log scale and distance as abscissa on the 
linear scale.
    (3) However, regardless of which of the methods in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section is employed, the proper curve to be drawn through the 
points plotted shall be determined by comparison with the curves in 
Sec. 73.184 as follows: Place the sheet on which the actual points have 
been plotted over the appropriate Graph in Sec. 73.184, hold to the 
light if necessary and adjust until the curve most closely matching the 
points is found. This curve should then be drawn on the sheet on which 
the points were plotted, together with the inverse distance curve 
corresponding to that curve. The field at 1 kilometer for the radial 
concerned shall be the ordinate on the inverse distance curve at 1 
kilometer.
    (4) When all radials have been analyzed in accordance with paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section, a curve shall be plotted on polar coordinate 
paper from the fields obtained, which gives the inverse distance field 
pattern at 1 kilometer. The radius of a circle, the area of which is 
equal to the area bounded by this pattern, is the effective field. (See 
Sec. 73.14.)
    (5) The antenna power of the station shall be maintained at the 
authorized level during all field measurements. The power determination

Sec. 73.187  Limitation on daytime radiation.

    (a)(1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of 
this section, no authorization will be granted for a Class B or Class D 
station on a frequency specified in Sec. 73.25 if the proposed operation 
would radiate during the period of critical hours (the two hours after 
local sunrise and the two hours before local sunset) toward any point on 
the 0.1 mV/m contour of a co-channel U.S. Class A station, at or below 
the pertinent vertical angle determined from Curve 2 of Figure 6a of 
Sec. 73.190, values in excess of those obtained as provided in paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (2) The limitation set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
shall not apply in the following cases:

[[Page 59]]

    (i) Any Class B or Class D operation authorized before November 30, 
1959; or
    (ii) For Class B and Class D stations authorized before November 30, 
1959, subsequent changes of facilities which do not involve a change in 
frequency, an increase in radiation toward any point on the 0.1 mV/m 
contour of a co-channel U.S. Class A station, or the move of transmitter 
site materially closer to the 0.1 mV/m contour of such Class A station.
    (3) A Class B or Class D station authorized before November 30, 
1959, and subsequently authorized to increase daytime radiation in any 
direction toward the 0.1 mV/m contour of a co-channel U.S. Class A 
station (without a change in frequency or a move of transmitter site 
materially closer to such contour), may not, during the two hours after 
local sunrise or the two hours before local sunset, radiate in such 
directions a value exceeding the higher of:
    (i) The value radiated in such directions with facilities last 
authorized before November 30, 1959, or
    (ii) The limitation specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (b) To obtain the maximum permissible radiation for a Class B or 
Class D station on a given frequency from 640 through 990 kHz, multiply 
the radiation value obtained for the given distance and azimuth from the 
500 kHz chart (Figure 9 of Sec. 73.190) by the appropriate interpolation 
factor shown in the K<INF>500</INF> column of paragraph (c) of this 
section; and multiply the radiation value obtained for the given 
distance and azimuth from the 1000 kHz chart (Figure 10 of Sec. 73.190) 
by the appropriate interpolation factor shown in the K<INF>1000</INF> 
column of paragraph (c) of this section. Add the two products thus 
obtained; the result is the maximum radiation value applicable to the 
Class B or Class D station in the pertinent directions. For frequencies 
from 1010 to 1580 kHz, obtain in a similar manner the proper radiation 
values from the 1000 and 1600 kHz charts (Figures 10 and 11 of 
Sec. 73.190), multiply each of these values by the appropriate 
interpolation factors in the K'<INF>1000</INF> and K'<INF>1600</INF> 
columns in paragraph (c) of this section, and add the products.
    (c) Interpolation factors. (1) Frequencies below 1000 kHz.

Sec. 73.189  Minimum antenna heights or field strength requirements.

    (a) Section 73.45 requires that all applicants for new, additional, 
or different broadcast facilities and all licensees requesting authority 
to move 0the transmitter of an existing station, shall specify a 
radiating system, the efficiency of which complies with the requirements 
of good engineering practice for the class and power of the station.
    (b) The specifications deemed necessary to meet the requirements of 
good engineering practice at the present state of the art are set out in 
detail below.
    (1) The licensee of a AM broadcast station requesting a change in 
power, time of operation, frequency, or transmitter location must also 
request authority to install a new antenna system or to make changes in 
the existing antenna system which will meet the minimum height 
requirements, or submit evidence that the present antenna system meets 
the minimum requirements with respect to field strength, before 
favorable consideration will be given thereto. (See Sec. 73.186.) In the 
event it is proposed to make substantial changes in an existing antenna 
system, the changes shall be such as to meet the minimum height 
requirements or will be permitted subject to the submission of field 
strength measurements showing that it meets the minimum requirements 
with respect to effective field strength.
    (2) These minimum actual physical vertical heights of antennas 
permitted to be installed are shown by curves A, B, and C of Figure 7 of 
Sec. 73.190 as follows:
    (i) Class C stations, and stations in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico 
and the U.S. Virgin Islands on 1230, 1240, 1340, 1400, 1450 and 1490 kHz 
that were formerly Class C and were redesignated as Class B pursuant to 
Sec. 73.26(b), 45 meters or a minimum effective field strength of 241 
mV/m for 1 kW (121 mV/m for 0.25 kW). (This height applies to a Class C 
station on a local channel only. Curve A shall apply to any Class C 
stations in the 48 conterminous States that are assigned to Regional 
channels.)
    (ii) Class A (Alaska), Class B and Class D stations other than those 
covered in Sec. 73.189(b)(2)(i), a minimum effective field strength of 
282 mV/m for 1 kW.
    (iii) Class A stations, a minimum effective field strength of 362 
mV/m for 1 kW.
    (3) The heights given on the graph for the antenna apply regardless 
of whether the antenna is located on the ground or on a building. Except 
for the reduction of shadows, locating the antenna on a building does 
not necessarily increase the efficiency and where the height of the 
building is in the order of a quarter wave the efficiency may be 
materially reduced.
    (4) At the present development of the art, it is considered that 
where a vertical radiator is employed with its base on the ground, the 
ground system should consist of buried radial wires at least one-fourth 
wave length long. There should be as many of these radials evenly spaced 
as practicable and in no event less than 90. (120 radials of 0.35 to 0.4 
of a wave length in length and spaced 3 deg. is considered an excellent 
ground system and in case of high base voltage, a base screen of 
suitable dimensions should be employed.)
    (5) In case it is contended that the required antenna efficiency can 
be obtained with an antenna of height or ground system less than the 
minimum specified, a complete field strength survey must be supplied to 
the Commission showing that the field strength at a mile without 
absorption fulfills the minimum requirements. (See Sec. 73.186.) This 
field survey must be made by a qualified engineer using equipment of 
acceptable accuracy.
    (6) The main element or elements of a directional antenna system 
shall meet the above minimum requirements with respect to height or 
effective field strength. No directional antenna system will be approved 
which is so designed that the effective field of the array is less than 
the minimum prescribed for the class of station concerned, or in case of 
a Class A station less than 90 percent of the ground wave field which 
would be obtained from a perfect antenna of the height specified by 
Figure 7 of Sec. 73.190 for operation on frequencies below 1000 kHz, and 
in the case of a Class B or Class D station less than 90 percent of the 
ground wave

[[Page 61]]

field which would be obtained from a perfect antenna of the height 
specified by Figure 7 of Sec. 73.190 for operation on frequencies below 
750 kHz.

    (a) Except as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, 
applications may be filed to construct FM broadcast stations only at the 
communities and on the channels contained in the Table of Allotments 
(Sec. 73.202(b)). Applications that fail to comply with this 
requirements, whether or not accompanied by

[[Page 114]]

a petition to amend the Table, will not be accepted for tender.
    (b) Applications filed on a first come, first served basis may 
propose a lower or higher class adjacent, intermediate frequency or co-
channel. Applications for the modification of an existing FM broadcast 
station may propose a lower or higher class adjacent, intermediate 
frequency or co-channel, or an same class adjacent channel. In these 
cases, the applicant need not file a petition for rule making to amend 
the Table of Allotments (Sec. 73.202(b)) to specify the modified channel 
class.

    Note: Changes in channel and/or class by application are limited to 
modifications on first, second and third adjacent channels, intermediate 
frequency (IF) channels, and co-channels which require no other changes 
to the FM Table of Allotments. Applications requesting such 
modifications must meet either the minimum spacing requirements of 
Sec. 73.207 at the site specified in the application, without resort to 
the provisions of the Commission's Rules permitting short spaced 
stations as set forth in Secs. 73.213 through 73.215 or demonstrate by a 
separate exhibit attached to the application the existence of a suitable 
allotment site that fully complies with Secs. 73.207 and 73.315 without 
resort to Secs. 73.213 through 73.215.

Sec. 73.205  Zones.

    For the purpose of allotments and assignments, the United States is 
divided into three zones as follows:
    (a) Zone I consists of that portion of the United States located 
within the confines of the following lines drawn on the United States 
Albers Equal Area Projection Map (based on standard parallels 291/2 deg. 
and 451/2 deg.; North American datum): Beginning at the most easterly 
point on the State boundary line between North Carolina and Virginia; 
thence in a straight line to a point on the Virginia-West Virginia 
boundary line located at north latitude 37 deg.49' and west longitude 
80 deg.12'30'; thence westerly along the southern boundary lines of the 
States of West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois to a point at the 
junction of the Illinois, Kentucky, and Missouri State boundary lines; 
thence northerly along the western boundary line of the State of 
Illinois to a point at the junction of the Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin 
State boundary lines; thence easterly along the northern State boundary 
line of Illinois to the 90th meridian; thence north along this meridian 
to the 43.5 deg. parallel; thence east along this parallel to the United 
States-Canada border; thence southerly and following that border until 
it again intersects the 43.5 deg. parallel; thence east along this 
parallel to the 71st meridian; thence in a straight line to the 
intersection of the 69th meridian and the 45th parallel; thence east 
along the 45th parallel to the Atlantic Ocean. When any of the above 
lines pass through a city, the city shall be considered to be located in 
Zone I. (See Figure 1 of Sec. 73.699.)
    (b) Zone I-A consists of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and that 
portion of the State of California which is located south of the 40th 
parallel.
    (c) Zone II consists of Alaska, Hawaii and the rest of the United 
States which is not located in either Zone I or Zone I-A.

Sec. 73.207  Minimum distance separation between stations.

    (a) Except for assignments made pursuant to Sec. 73.213 or 73.215, 
FM allotments and assignments must be separated from other allotments 
and assignments on the same channel (co-channel) and five pairs of 
adjacent channels by not less than the minimum distances specified in 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. The Commission will not accept 
petitions to amend the Table of Allotments unless the reference points 
meet all of the minimum distance separation requirements of this 
section. The Commission will not accept applications for new stations, 
or applications to change the channel or location of existing 
assignments unless transmitter sites meet the minimum distance 
separation requirements of

[[Page 115]]

this section, or such applications conform to the requirements of 
Sec. 73.213 or 73.215. However, applications to modify the facilities of 
stations with short-spaced antenna locations authorized pursuant to 
prior waivers of the distance separation requirements may be accepted, 
provided that such applications propose to maintain or improve that 
particular spacing deficiency. Class D (secondary) assignments are 
subject only to the distance separation requirements contained in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section. (See Sec. 73.512 for rules governing 
the channel and location of Class D (secondary) assignments.)
    (b) The distances listed in Tables A, B, and C apply to allotments 
and assignments on the same channel and each of five pairs of adjacent 
channels. The five pairs of adjacent channels are the first (200 kHz 
above and 200 kHz below the channel under consideration), the second 
(400 kHz above and below), the third (600 kHz above and below), the 
fifty-third (10.6 MHz above and below), and the fifty-fourth (10.8 MHz 
above and below). The distances in the Tables apply regardless of 
whether the proposed station class appears first or second in the 
``Relation'' column of the table.
    (1) Domestic allotments and assignments must be separated from each 
other by not less than the distances in Table A which follows:

    (3) Under the 1992 Mexico-United States FM Broadcasting Agreement, 
domestic U.S. assignments or allotments within 320 kilometers (199 
miles) of the common border must be separated from Mexican assignments 
or allotments by not less than the distances given in Table C in this 
paragraph (b)(3). When applying Table C--
    (i) U.S. or Mexican assignments or allotments which have been 
notified internationally as Class A are limited to a maximum of 3.0 kW 
ERP at 100 meters HAAT, or the equivalent;
    (ii) U.S. or Mexican assignments or allotments which have been 
notified internationally as Class AA are limited to a maximum of 6.0 kW 
ERP at 100 meters HAAT, or the equivalent;
    (iii) U.S. Class C3 assignments or allotments are considered Class 
B1;
    (iv) U.S. Class C2 assignments or allotments are considered Class B; 
and
    (v) Class C1 assignments or allotments assume maximum facilities of 
100 kW ERP at 300 meters HAAT. However, U.S. Class C1 stations may not, 
in any event, exceed the domestic U.S. limit of 100 kW ERP at 299 meters 
HAAT, or the equivalent.

<R05>
Sec. 73.208  Reference points and distance computations.

    (a)(1) The following reference points must be used to determine 
distance separation requirements when petitions to amend the Table of 
Allotments (Sec. 73.202(b)) are considered:
    (i) First, transmitter sites if authorized, or if proposed in 
applications with cut-off protection pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section;
    (ii) Second, reference coordinates designated by the FCC;
    (iii) Third, coordinates listed in the United States Department of 
Interior publication entitled Index to the National Atlas of the United 
States of America; or
    (iv) Last, coordinates of the main post office.
    (The community's reference points for which the petition is 
submitted will normally be the coordinates listed in the above 
publication.)
    (2) When the distance between communities is calculated using 
community reference points and it does not meet the minimum separation 
requirements of Sec. 73.207, the channel may still be allotted if a 
transmitter site is available that would meet the minimum separation 
requirements and still permit the proposed station to meet the minimum 
field strength requirements of Sec. 73.315. A showing indicating the 
availability of a suitable site should be sumitted with the petition. In 
cases where a station is not authorized in a community or communities 
and the proposed channel cannot meet the separation requirement a 
showing should also be made indicating adequate distance between 
suitable transmitter sites for all communities.
    (3) Petitions to amend the Table of Allotments that do not meet 
minimum distance separation requirements to transmitter sites specified 
in pending applications will not be considered unless they are filed no 
later than:
    (i) The last day of a filing window if the application is for a new 
FM facility or a major change in the non-reserved band and is filed 
during a filing window established under section 73.3564(d)(3); or
    (ii) The cut-off date established in a Commission Public Notice 
under Sec. 73.3564(d) and 73.3573(e) if the application is for a new FM 
facility or a major change in the reserved band; or
    (iii) The date of receipt of all other types of FM applications. If 
an application is amended so as to create a conflict with a petition for 
rule making filed prior to the date the amendment is filed, the amended 
application will be treated as if filed on the date of the amendment for 
purposes of this paragraph (a)(3).

    Note: If the filing of a conflicting FM application renders an 
otherwise timely filed counterproposal unacceptable, the counterproposal 
may be considered in the rulemaking proceeding if it is amended to 
protect the site of the previously filed FM application within 15 days 
after being placed on the Public Notice routinely issued by the staff 
concerning the filing of counterproposals. No proposals involving 
communities not already included in the proceeding can be introduced 
during the reply comment period as a method of resolving conflicts. The 
counterproponent is required to make a showing that, at the time it 
filed the counterproposal, it did not know, and could not have known by 
exercising due diligence, of

[[Page 118]]

the pendency of the conflicting FM application.

    (b) Station separations in licensing proceedings shall be determined 
by the distance between the coordinates of the proposed transmitter site 
in one community and
    (1) The coordinates of an authorized transmitter site for the 
pertinent channel in the other community; or, where such transmitter 
site is not available for use as a reference point,
    (2) Reference coordinates designated by the FCC; or, if none are 
designated,
    (3) The coordinates of the other community as listed in the 
publication listed in paragraph (a) of this section; or, if not 
contained therein,
    (4) The coordinates of the main post office of such other community.
    (5) In addition, where there are pending applications in other 
communities which, if granted, would have to be considered in 
determining station separations, the coordinates of the transmitter 
sites proposed in such applications must be used to determine whether 
the requirements with respect to minimum separations between the 
proposed stations in the respective cities have been met.
    (c) The method given in this paragraph shall be used to compute the 
distance between two reference points, except that, for computation of 
distance involving stations in Canada and Mexico, the method for 
distance computation specified in the applicable international agreement 
shall be used instead. The method set forth in this paragraph is valid 
only for distances not exceeding 475 km (295 miles).
    (1) Convert the latitudes and longitudes of each reference point 
from degree-minute-second format to degree-decimal format by dividing 
minutes by 60 and seconds by 3600, then adding the results to degrees.
    (2) Calculate the middle latitude between the two reference points 
by averaging the two latitudes as follows:

ML=(LAT1<INF>dd</INF>+LAT2<INF>dd</INF>)<bullet>2

    (3) Calculate the number of kilometers per degree latitude 
difference for the middle latitude calculated in paragraph (c)(2) as 
follows:

KPD<INF>lat</INF>=111.13209-0.56605 cos(2ML)+0.00120 cos(4ML)

    (4) Calculate the number of kilometers per degree longitude 
difference for the middle latitude calculated in paragraph (c)(2) as 
follows:

KPD<INF>lon</INF>=111.41513 cos(ML)-0.09455 cos(3ML)+0.00012 cos(5ML)

    (5) Calculate the North-South distance in kilometers as follows:

NS=KPD<INF>lat</INF>(LAT1<INF>dd</INF>-LAT2<INF>dd</INF>)

    (6) Calculate the East-West distance in kilometers as follows:

EW=KPD<INF>lon</INF>(LON1<INF>dd</INF>-LON2<INF>dd</INF>)

    (7) Calculate the distance between the two reference points by 
taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the East-West and 
North-South distances as follows:

DIST=(NS<SUP>2+</SUP> EW<SUP>2</SUP>)<SUP>0.5</SUP>

    (8) Round the distance to the nearest kilometer.
    (9) Terms used in this section are defined as follows:
    (i) LAT1<INF>dd</INF> and LON1<INF>dd</INF>=the coordinates of the 
first reference point in degree-decimal format.
    (ii) LAT2<INF>dd</INF> and LON2<INF>dd</INF>=the coordinates of the 
second reference point in degree-decimal format.
    (iii) ML=the middle latitude in degree-decimal format.
    (iv) KPD<INF>lat</INF>=the number of kilometers per degree of 
latitude at a given middle latitude.
    (v) KPD<INF>lon</INF>=the number of kilometers per degree of 
longitude at a given middle latitude.
    (vi) NS=the North-South distance in kilometers.
    (vii) EW=the East-West distance in kilometers.
    (viii) DIST=the distance between the two reference points, in 
kilometers.

Sec. 73.209  Protection from interference.

    (a) Permittees and licensees of FM broadcast stations are not 
protected from any interference which may be caused by the grant of a 
new station, or of authority to modify the facilities of an existing 
station, in accordance with

[[Page 119]]

the provisions of this subpart. However, they are protected from 
interference caused by Class D (secondary) noncommercial educational FM 
stations. See Sec. 73.509.
    (b) The nature and extent of the protection from interference 
afforded FM broadcast stations operating on Channels 221-300 is limited 
to that which results when assignments are made in accordance with the 
rules in this subpart.

Sec. 73.210  Station classes.

    (a) The rules applicable to a particular station, including minimum 
and maximum facilities requirements, are determined by its class. 
Possible class designations depend upon the zone in which the station's 
transmitter is located, or proposed to be located. The zones are defined 
in Sec. 73.205. Allotted station classes are indicated in the Table of 
Allotments, Sec. 73.202. Class A, B1 and B stations may be authorized in 
Zones I and I-A, Class A, C3, C2, C1, and C stations may be authorized 
in Zone II.
    (b) The power and antenna height requirements for each class are set 
forth in Sec. 73.211. If a station has an ERP and an antenna HAAT such 
that it cannot be classified using the maximum limits and minimum 
requirements in Sec. 73.211, its class shall be determined using the 
following procedure:
    (1) Determine the reference distance of the station using the 
procedure in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of Sec. 73.211. If this distance is 
less than or equal to 28 km, the station is Class A; otherwise,
    (2) For a station in Zone I or Zone I-A, except for Puerto Rico and 
the Virgin Islands:
    (i) If this distance is greater than 28 km and less than or equal to 
39 km, the station is Class B1.
    (ii) If this distance is greater than 39 km and less than or equal 
to 52 km, the station is Class B.
    (3) For a station in Zone II:
    (i) If this distance is greater than 28 km and less than or equal to 
39 km, the station is Class C3.
    (ii) If this distance is greater than 39 km and less than or equal 
to 52 km, the station is Class C2.
    (iii) If this distance is greater than 52 km and less than or equal 
to 72 km, the station is Class C1.
    (iv) If this distance is greater than 72 km and less than or equal 
to 92 km, the station is Class C.
    (4) For a station in Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands:
    (i) If this distance is less than or equal to 42 km, the station is 
Class A.
    (ii) If this distance is greater than 42 km and less than or equal 
to 46 km, the station is Class B1.
    (iii) If this distance is greater then 46 km and less than or equal 
to 78 km, the station is Class B.

Sec. 73.211  Power and antenna height requirements.

    (a) Minimum requirements. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs 
(a)(3) and (b)(2) of this section, FM stations must operate with a 
minimum effective radiated power (ERP) as follows:
    (i) The minimum ERP for Class A stations is 0.1 kW.
    (ii) The ERP for Class B1 stations must exceed 6 kW.
    (iii) The ERP for Class B stations must exceed 25 kW.
    (iv) The ERP for Class C3 stations must exceed 6 kW.
    (v) The ERP for Class C2 stations must exceed 25 kW.
    (vi) The ERP for Class C1 stations must exceed 50 kW.
    (vii) The minimum ERP for Class C stations is 100 kW.
    (2) Class C stations must have an antenna height above average 
terrain (HAAT) of at least 300 meters (984 feet). No minimum HAAT is 
specified for Classes A, B1, B, C3, C2, or C1 stations.
    (3) Stations of any class except Class A may have an ERP less than 
that specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, provided that the 
reference distance, determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of 
this section, exceeds the distance to the class contour for the next 
lower class. Class A stations may have an ERP less than 100 watts 
provided that the reference distance, determined in accordance with

[[Page 120]]

paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, equals or exceeds 6 kilometers.
    (b) Maximum limits. (1) Except for stations located in Puerto Rico 
or the Virgin Islands, the maximum ERP in any direction, reference HAAT, 
and distance to the class contour for each FM station class are listed 
below:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) The reference distance of a station is obtained by finding the 
predicted distance to the 1mV/m contour using Figure 1 of Sec. 73.333 
and then rounding to the nearest kilometer. Antenna HAAT is determined 
using the procedure in Sec. 73.313. If the HAAT so determined is less 
than 30 meters (100 feet), a HAAT of 30 meters must be used when finding 
the predicted distance to the 1 mV/m contour.
    (ii) If a station's ERP is equal to the maximum for its class, its 
antenna HAAT must not exceed the reference HAAT, regardless of the 
reference distance. For example, a Class A station operating with 6 kW 
ERP may have an antenna HAAT of 100 meters, but not 101 meters, even 
though the reference distance is 28 km in both cases.
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, no 
station will be authorized in Zone I or I-A with an ERP equal to 50 kW 
and a HAAT exceeding 150 meters. No station will be authorized in Zone 
II with an ERP equal to 100 kW and a HAAT exceeding 600 meters.
    (2) If a station has an antenna HAAT greater than the reference HAAT 
for its class, its ERP must be lower than the class maximum such that 
the reference distance does not exceed the class contour distance. If 
the antenna HAAT is so great that the station's ERP must be lower than 
the minimum ERP for its class (specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3) 
of this section), that lower ERP will become the minimum for that 
station.
    (3) For stations located in Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands, the 
maximum ERP in any direction, reference HAAT, and distance to the class 
contour for each FM station class are listed below:

    (c) Existing stations. Stations authorized prior to March 1, 1984 
that do not conform to the requirements of this section may continue to 
operate as authorized. Stations operating with facilities in excess of 
those specified in paragraph (b) of this section may not increase their 
effective radiated powers or extend their 1 mV/m field strength contour 
beyond the location permitted by their present authorizations. The

Sec. 73.213  Grandfathered short-spaced stations.

    (a) Stations at locations authorized prior to November 16, 1964 that 
did not meet the separation distances required by Sec. 73.207 and have 
remained continuously short-spaced since that time may be modified or 
relocated with respect to such short-spaced stations, provided that no 
area previously receiving interference-free service would receive co-
channel or first-adjacent channel interference as predicted in 
accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or that a showing is 
provided pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section that demonstrates 
that the public interest would be served by the proposed changes.
    (1) The F(50,50) curves in Figure 1 of Sec. 73.333 are to be used in 
conjunction with the proposed effective radiated power and antenna 
height above average terrain, as calculated pursuant to Sec. 73.313(c), 
(d)(2) and (d)(3), using data for as many radials as necessary, to 
determine the location of the desired (service) field strength. The 
F(50,10) curves in Figure 1a of Sec. 73.333 are to be used in 
conjunction with the proposed effective radiated power and antenna 
height above average terrain, as calculated pursuant to Sec. 73.313(c), 
(d)(2) and (d)(3), using data for as many radials as necessary, to 
determine the location of the undesired (interfering) field strength. 
Predicted interference is defined to exist only for locations where the 
desired (service) field strength exceeds 0.5 mV/m (54 dBu) for a Class B 
station, 0.7 mV/m (57 dBu) for a Class B1 station, and 1 mV/m (60 dBu) 
for any other class of station.
    (i) Co-channel interference is predicted to exist, for the purpose 
of this section, at all locations where the undesired (interfering 
station) F(50,10) field strength exceeds a value 20 dB below the desired 
(service) F(50,50) field strength of the station being considered (e.g., 
where the protected field strength is 60 dBu, the interfering field 
strength must be 40 dBu or more for predicted interference to exist).
    (ii) First-adjacent channel interference is predicted to exist, for 
the purpose of this section, at all locations where the undesired 
(interfering station) F(50,10) field strength exceeds a value 6 dB below 
the desired (service) F(50,50) field strength of the station being 
considered (e.g., where the protected field strength is 60 dBu, the 
interfering field strength must be 54 dBu or more for predicted 
interference to exist).
    (2) For co-channel and first-adjacent channel stations, a showing 
that the public interest would be served by the changes proposed in an 
application must include exhibits demonstrating that the total area and 
population subject to co-channel or first-adjacent channel interference, 
caused and received, would be maintained or decreased. In addition, the 
showing must include exhibits demonstrating that the area and the 
population subject to co-channel or first-adjacent channel interference 
caused by the proposed facility to each short-spaced station 
individually is not increased. In all cases, the applicant must also 
show that any area predicted to lose service as a result of new co-
channel or first-adjacent-channel interference has adequate aural 
service remaining. For the purpose of this section, adequate service is 
defined as 5 or more aural services (AM or FM).
    (3) For co-channel and first-adjacent-channel stations, a copy of 
any application proposing interference caused in any areas where 
interference is not currently caused must be served upon the licensee(s) 
of the affected short-spaced station(s).
    (4) For stations covered by this paragraph (a), there are no 
distance separation or interference protection requirements with respect 
to second-adjacent and third-adjacent channel short-spacings that have 
existed continuously since November 16, 1964.
    (b) Stations at locations authorized prior to May 17, 1989, that did 
not meet the IF separation distances required by Sec. 73.207 and have 
remained short-spaced since that time may be modified or relocated 
provided that the overlap area of the two stations' 36 mV/m field 
strength contours is not increased.
    (c) Short spacings involving at least one Class A allotment or 
authorization. Stations that became short spaced on or after November 
16, 1964 (including stations that do not meet

[[Page 122]]

the minimum distance separation requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section and that propose to maintain or increase their existing distance 
separations) may be modified or relocated in accordance with paragraph 
(c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, except that this provision does not 
apply to stations that became short spaced by grant of applications 
filed after October 1, 1989, or filed pursuant to Sec. 73.215. If the 
reference coordinates of an allotment are short spaced to an authorized 
facility or another allotment (as a result of the revision of 
Sec. 73.207 in the Second Report and Order in MM Docket No. 88-375), an 
application for the allotment may be authorized, and subsequently 
modified after grant, in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of 
this section only with respect to such short spacing. No other stations 
will be authorized pursuant to these paragraphs.
    (1) Applications for authorization under requirements equivalent to 
those of prior rules. Each application for authority to operate a Class 
A station with no more than 3000 watts ERP and 100 meters antenna HAAT 
(or equivalent lower ERP and higher antenna HAAT based on a class 
contour distance of 24 km) must specify a transmitter site that meets 
the minimum distance separation requirements in this paragraph. Each 
application for authority to operate a Class A station with more than 
3000 watts ERP (up to a maximum of 5800 watts), but with an antenna HAAT 
lower than 100 meters such that the distance to the predicted 0.05 mV/m 
(34 dB<greek-m> V/m) F(50,10) field strength contour does not exceed 98 
km must specify a transmitter site that meets the minimum distance 
separation requirements in this paragraph. Each application for 
authority to operate an FM station of any class other than Class A must 
specify a transmitter site that meets the minimum distance separation 
requirements in this paragraph with respect to Class A stations 
operating pursuant to this paragraph or paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, and that meets the minimum distance separation requirements of 
Sec. 73.207 with respect to all other stations.

consent of the licensee of each co-channel, first, second or third 
adjacent channel station (for which the requirements of Sec. 73.207 are 
not met) to a grant of that application. Each such application must 
specify a transmitter site that meets the applicable IF-related channel 
distance separation requirements of Sec. 73.207. Applications that 
specify a new transmitter site which is short-spaced to an FM station 
other than another Class A station which is seeking a mutual increase in 
facilities may be granted only if no alternative fully-spaced site or 
less short-spaced site is available. Licensees of Class A stations 
seeking mutual increases in facilities need not show that a fully spaced 
site or less short-spaced site is available. Applications submitted 
pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph may be granted only if such 
action is consistent with the public interest.

Sec. 73.213  Grandfathered short-spaced stations.

    (a) Stations at locations authorized prior to November 16, 1964 that 
did not meet the separation distances required by Sec. 73.207 and have 
remained short-spaced since that time may be modified or relocated 
provided that the predicted distance to the 1 mV/m field strength 
contour is not extended toward the 1 mV/m field strength contour of any 
short-spaced station. Mutual increase in the facilities of such stations 
up to the limits set forth in Sec. 73.211 may be permitted pursuant to 
an agreement between the affected stations and a showing of public 
interest. See Sec. 73.4235.

Sec. 73.215  Contour protection for short-spaced assignments.

    The Commission will accept applications that specify short-spaced 
antenna locations (locations that do not meet the domestic co-channel 
and adjacent channel minimum distance separation requirements of 
Sec. 73.207); Provided That, such applications propose contour 
protection, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, with all short-
spaced assignments, applications and allotments, and meet the other 
applicable requirements of this section. Each application to be 
processed pursuant to this section must specifically request such 
processing on its face, and must include the necessary exhibit to 
demonstrate that the requisite contour protection will be provided. Such 
applications may be granted when the Commission determines that such 
action would serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity.
    (a) Contour protection. Contour protection, for the purpose of this 
section, means that on the same channel and on the first, second and 
third adjacent channels, the predicted interfering contours of the 
proposed station do not overlap the predicted protected contours of 
other short-spaced assignments, applications and allotments, and the 
predicted interfering contours of other short-spaced assignments, 
applications and allotments do not overlap the predicted protected 
contour of the proposed station.
    (1) The protected contours, for the purpose of this section, are 
defined as follows. For all Class B and B1 stations on Channels 221 
through 300 inclusive, the F(50,50) field strengths along the protected 
contours are 0.5 mV/m (54 dB<greek-m>) and 0.7 mV/m (57 dB<greek-m>), 
respectively. For all other stations, the F(50,50) field strength along 
the protected contour is 1.0 mV/m (60 dB<greek-m>).
    (2) The interfering contours, for the purpose of this section, are 
defined as follows. For co-channel stations, the F(50,10) field strength 
along the interfering contour is 20 dB lower than the F(50,50) field 
strength along the protected contour for which overlap is prohibited. 
For first adjacent channel stations (<plus-minus>200 kHz), the F(50,10) 
field strength along the interfering contour is 6 dB lower than the 
F(50,50) field strength along the protected contour for which overlap is 
prohibited. For both second and third adjacent channel stations 
(<plus-minus>400 kHz and <plus-minus>600 kHz), the F(50,10) field 
strength along the interfering contour is 40 dB higher than the F(50,50) 
field strength along the protected contour for which overlap is 
prohibited.
    (3) The locations of the protected and interfering contours of the 
proposed station and the other short-spaced assignments, applications 
and allotments must be determined in accordance with the procedures of 
paragraphs (c), (d)(2) and (d)(3) of Sec. 73.313, using data for as many 
radials as necessary to accurately locate the contours.
    (4) Stations in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands may submit 
application for short-spaced locations provided the predicted distance 
to their 1 mV/m field strength contour is not extended toward the 1 mV/m 
field strength contour of any short-spaced station.
    (b) Applicants requesting short-spaced assignments pursuant to this 
section must take into account the following factors in demonstrating 
that contour protection is achieved:
    (1) The ERP and antenna HAAT of the proposed station in the 
direction of the contours of other short-spaced assignments, 
applications and allotments. If a directional antenna is proposed, the 
pattern of that antenna must be used to calculate the ERP in particular 
directions. See Sec. 73.316 for

[[Page 124]]

additional requirements for directional antennas.
    (2) The ERP and antenna HAAT of other short-spaced assignments, 
applications and allotments in the direction of the contours of the 
proposed station. The ERP and antenna HAATs in the directions of concern 
must be determined as follows:
    (i) For vacant allotments, contours are based on the presumed use, 
at the allotment's reference point, of the maximum ERP that could be 
authorized for the station class of the allotment, and antenna HAATs in 
the directions of concern that would result from a non-directional 
antenna mounted at a standard eight-radial antenna HAAT equal to the 
reference HAAT for the station class of the allotment.
    (ii) For existing stations that were not authorized pursuant to this 
section, including stations with authorized ERP that exceeds the maximum 
ERP permitted by Sec. 73.211 for the standard eight-radial antenna HAAT 
employed, and for applications not requesting authorization pursuant to 
this section, contours are based on the presumed use of the maximum ERP 
for the applicable station class (as specified in Sec. 73.211), and the 
antenna HAATs in the directions of concern that would result from a non-
directional antenna mounted at a standard eight-radial antenna HAAT 
equal to the reference HAAT for the applicable station class, without 
regard to any other restrictions that may apply (e.g. zoning laws, FAA 
constraints, application of Sec. 73.213).

    (iii) For stations authorized pursuant to this section, except 
stations with authorized ERP that exceeds the maximum ERP permitted by 
Sec. 73.211 for the standard eight-radial antenna HAAT employed, 
contours are based on the use of the authorized ERP in the directions of 
concern, and HAATs in the directions of concern derived from the 
authorized standard eight-radial antenna HAAT. For stations with 
authorized ERP that exceeds the maximum ERP permitted by Sec. 73.211 for 
the standard eight-radial antenna HAAT employed, authorized under this 
section, contours are based on the presumed use of the maximum ERP for 
the applicable station class (as specified in Sec. 73.211), and antenna 
HAATs in the directions of concern that would result from a non-
directional antenna mounted at a standard eight-radial antenna HAAT 
equal to the reference HAAT for the applicable station class, without 
regard to any other restrictions that may apply.
    (iv) For applications containing a request for authorization 
pursuant to this section, except for applications to continue operation 
with authorized ERP that exceeds the maximum ERP permitted by 
Sec. 73.211 for the standard eight-radial antenna HAAT employed, 
contours are based on the use of the proposed ERP in the directions of 
concern, and antenna HAATs in the directions of concern derived from the 
proposed standard eight-radial antenna HAAT. For applications to 
continue operation with an ERP that exceeds the maximum ERP permitted by 
Sec. 73.211 for the standard eight-radial HAAT employed, if processing 
is requested under this section, contours are based on the presumed use 
of the maximum ERP for the applicable station class (as specified in 
Sec. 73.211), and antenna HAATs in the directions of concern that would 
result from a nondirectional antenna mounted at a standard eight-radial 
antenna HAAT equal to the reference HAAT for the applicable station 
class, without regard to any other restrictions that may apply.

    Note to paragraph (b): Applicants are cautioned that the antenna 
HAAT in any particular direction of concern will not usually be the same 
as the standard eight-radial antenna HAAT or the reference HAAT for the 
station class.

    (c) Applications submitted for processing pursuant to this section 
are not required to propose contour protection of any assignment, 
application or allotment for which the minimum distance separation 
requirements of Sec. 73.207 are met, and may, in the directions of those 
assignments, applications and allotments, employ the maximum ERP 
permitted by Sec. 73.211 for the standard eight-radial antenna HAAT 
employed.
    (d) Stations authorized pursuant to this section may be subsequently 
authorized on the basis of compliance with the domestic minimum 
separation distance requirements of Sec. 73.207, upon

[[Page 125]]

filing of an FCC Form 301 or FCC Form 340 (as appropriate) requesting a 
modification of authorization.
    (e) The Commission will not accept applications that specify a 
short-spaced antenna location for which the following minimum distance 
separation requirements, in kilometers (miles), are not met:

Sec. 73.220  Restrictions on use of channels.

    (a) The frequency 89.1 MHz (channel 206) is revised in the New York 
City metropolitan area for the use of the United Nations with the 
equivalent of an antenna height of 150 meters (492 feet) above average 
terrain and effective radiated power of 20 kWs, and the FCC will make no 
assignments which would cause objectionable interference with such use.
    (b) In Alaska, FM broadcast stations operating on Channels 221-300 
(92.1-107.9 MHz) shall not cause harmful interference to and must accept 
interference from non-Government fixed operations authorized prior to 
January 1, 1982.

Sec. 73.232  Territorial exclusivity.

    No licensee of an FM broadcast station shall have any arrangement 
with a network organization which prevents or hinders another station 
serving substantially the same area from broadcasting the network's 
programs not taken by the former station, or which prevents or hinders 
another station serving a substantially different area from broadcasting 
any program of the network organization: Provided, however, That this 
section does not prohibit arrangements under which the station is 
granted first call within its primary service area upon the network's 
programs. The term ``network organization'' means any organization 
originating program material, with or without commercial messages, and 
furnishing the same to stations interconnected so as to permit 
simultaneous broadcast by all or some of them. However, arrangements 
involving only stations under common ownership, or only the rebroadcast 
by one station of programming from another with no compensation other 
than a lump-sum payment by the station rebroadcasting, are not 
considered arrangements with a network organization. The term 
``arrangement`` means any contract, arrangement or understanding, 
express or implied.

    No FM broadcast station license or renewal of FM broadcast station 
license will be granted to any person who owns, leases, or controls a 
particular site which is peculiarly suitable for FM broadcasting in a 
particular area and (a) which is not available for use by other FM

Sec. 73.258  Indicating instruments.

    (a) Each FM broadcast station shall be equipped with indicating 
instruments which conform with the specifications described in 
Sec. 73.1215 for determining power by the indirect method; for 
indicating the relative amplitude of the transmission line radio 
frequency current, voltage, or power; and with such other instruments as 
are necessary for the proper adjustment, operation, and maintenance of 
the transmitting system.
    (b) The function of each instrument shall be clearly and permanently 
shown in the instrument itself or on the panel immediately adjacent 
thereto.
    (c) In the event that any one of these indicating instruments 
becomes defective when no substitute which conforms with the required 
specifications is available, the station may be operated without the 
defective instrument pending its repair or replacement for a period not 
in excess of 60 days without further authority of the FCC: Provided 
that, if the defective instrument is the transmission line meter of a 
station which determines the output power by the direct method, the 
operating power shall be determined by the indirect method in accordance 
with Sec. 73.267(c) during the entire time the station is operated 
without the transmission line meter.
    (d) If conditions beyond the control of the licensee prevent the 
restoration of the meter to service within the above allowed period, 
informal request in accordance with Sec. 73.3549 may be filed with the 
Engineer in Charge of the radio district in which the station is located 
for such additional time as may be required to complete repairs of the 
defective instrument.

<R05>
Sec. 73.267  Determining operating power.

    (a) The operating power of each FM station is to be determined by 
either the direct or indirect method.
    (b) Direct method. The direct method of power determination for an 
FM station uses the indications of a calibrated transmission line meter 
(responsive to relative voltage, current, or power) located at the RF 
output terminals of the transmitter. This meter must be calibrated 
whenever there is any indication that the calibration is inaccurate or 
whenever any component of the metering circuit is repaired or replaced. 
The calibration must cover, as a minimum, the range from 90% to 105% of 
authorized power. The meter calibration may be checked by measuring the 
power at the transmitter terminals while either:
    (1) Operating the transmitter into the transmitting antenna, and 
determining actual operating power by the indirect method described in 
Sec. 73.267(c); or
    (2) Operating the transmitter into a load (of substantially zero 
reactance and a resistance equal to the transmission line characteristic 
impedance) and using an electrical device (within <plus-minus>5% 
accuracy) or temperature and coolant flow indicator (within 
<plus-minus>4% accuracy) to determine the power.
    (3) The calibration must cover, as a minimum, the range from 90% to 
105% of authorized power and the meter must provide clear indications 
which will permit maintaining the operating power within the prescribed 
tolerance or the meter shall be calibrated to read directly in power 
units.
    (c) Indirect method. The operating power is determined by the 
indirect method by applying an appropriate factor to the input power to 
the last radio-frequency power amplifier stage of the transmitter, using 
the following formula:

Transmitter output power=Ep x Ip x F

Where:

Ep=DC input voltage of final radio stage.
Ip=Total DC input current of final radio stage.
F=Efficiency factor.

    (1) If the above formula is not appropriate for the design of the 
transmitter final amplifier, use a formula specified by the transmitter 
manufacturer with other appropriate operating parameters.

[[Page 127]]

    (2) The value of the efficiency factor, F, established for the 
authorized transmitter output power is to be used for maintaining the 
operating power, even though there may be some variation in F over the 
power operating range of the transmitter.
    (3) The value of F is to be determined and a record kept thereof by 
one of the following procedures listed in order of preference:
    (i) Using the most recent measurement data for calibration of the 
transmission line meter according to the procedures described in 
paragraph (b) of this section or the most recent measurements made by 
the licensee establishing the value of F. In the case of composite 
transmitters or those in which the final amplifier stages have been 
modified pursuant to FCC approval, the licensee must furnish the FCC and 
also retain with the station records the measurement data used as a 
basis for determining the value of F.
    (ii) Using measurement data shown on the transmitter manufacturer's 
test data supplied to the licensee; Provided, That measurements were 
made at the authorized frequency and transmitter output power.
    (iii) Using the transmitter manufacturer's measurement data 
submitted to the FCC for type acceptance and as shown in the instruction 
book supplied to the licensee.

Sec. 73.295  FM subsidiary communications services.

    (a) Subsidiary communication services are those transmitted on a 
subcarrier within the FM baseband signal, but do not include services 
which enhance the main program broadcast service, or exclusively relate 
to station operations (see Sec. 73.293). Subsidiary communications 
include, but are not limited to services such as functional music, 
specialized foreign language programs, radio reading services, utility 
load management, market and financial data and news, paging and calling, 
traffic control signal switching, bilingual television audio, and point 
to point or multipoint messages.
    (b) FM subsidiary communications services that are common carrier in 
nature are subject to common carrier regulation. Licensees operating 
such services are required to apply to the FCC for the appropriate 
authorization and to comply with all policies and rules applicable to 
the service. Responsibility for making the initial determinations of 
whether a particular activity is common carriage rests with the FM 
station licensee. Initial determinations by licensees are subject to FCC 
examination and may be reviewed at the FCC's discretion.
    (c) Subsidiary communications services are of a secondary nature 
under the authority of the FM station authorization, and the authority 
to provide such communications services may not be retained or 
transferred in any manner separate from the station's authorization. The 
grant or renewal of an FM station permit or license is not furthered or 
promoted by proposed or past services. The permittee or licensee

[[Page 128]]

must establish that the broadcast operation is in the public interest 
wholly apart from the subsidiary communications services provided.
    (d) The station identification, delayed recording and sponsor 
identification announcements required by Secs. 73.1201, 73.1208, and 
73.1212 are not applicable to material transmitted under an SCA.
    (e) The licensee or permittee must retain control over all material 
transmitted in a broadcast mode via the station's facilities, with the 
right to reject any material that it deems inappropriate or undesirable.

upon installation of stereophonic sound transmitting equipment under the 
provisions of Secs. 2.1001, 73.322, and 73.1590 of the Rules. Prior to 
commencement of stereophonic sound broadcasting, equipment performance 
measurements must be made to ensure that the transmitted signal complies 
with all applicable rules and standards.
    (b) Each licensee or permittee engaging in multichannel broadcasting 
must measure the pilot subcarrier frequency as often as necessary to 
ensure that it is kept at all times within 2 Hz of the authorized 
frequency.

<R05>
Sec. 73.310  FM technical definitions.

    (a) Frequency modulation.
    Antenna height above average terrain (HAAT). HAAT is calculated by: 
determining the average of the antenna heights above the terrain from 3 
to 16 kilometers (2 to 10 miles) from the antenna for the eight 
directions evenly spaced for each 45 deg. of azimuth starting with True 
North (a different antenna height will be determined in each direction 
from the antenna): and computing the average of these separate heights. 
In some cases less than eight directions may be used. (See 
Sec. 73.313(d).) Where circular or elliptical polarization is used, the 
antenna height above average terrain must be based upon the height of 
the radiation of the antenna that transmits the horizontal component of 
radiation.
    Antenna power gain. The square of the ratio of the root-mean-square 
(RMS) free space field strength produced at 1 kilometer in the 
horizontal plane in millivolts per meter for 1 kW antenna input power to 
221.4 mV/m. This ratio is expressed in decibels (dB). If specified for a 
particular direction, antenna power gain is based on that field strength 
in the direction only.
    Auxiliary facility. An auxiliary facility is an antenna separate 
from the main facility's antenna, permanently installed on the same 
tower or at a different location, from which a station may broadcast for 
short periods without prior Commission authorization or notice to the 
Commission while the main facility is not in operation (e.g., where 
tower work necessitates turning off the main antenna or where lightning 
has caused damage to the main antenna or transmission system) (See 
Sec. 73.1675).
    Center frequency. The term ``center frequency'' means:
    (1) The average frequency of the emitted wave when modulated by a 
sinusoidal signal.
    (2) The frequency of the emitted wave without modulation.
    Composite antenna pattern. The composite antenna pattern is a 
relative field horizontal plane pattern for 360 degrees of azimuth, for 
which the value at a particular azimuth is the greater of the 
horizontally polarized or vertically polarized component relative field 
values. The composite antenna pattern is normalized to a maximum of 
unity (1.000) relative field.
    Composite baseband signal. A signal which is composed of all program 
and other communications signals that frequency modulates the FM 
carrier.
    Effective radiated power. The term ``effective radiated power'' 
means the product of the antenna power (transmitter output power less 
transmission line loss) times: (1) The antenna power gain, or (2) the 
antenna field gain squared. Where circular or elliptical

[[Page 129]]

polarization is employed, the term effective radiated power is applied 
separately to the horizontal and vertical components of radiation. For 
allocation purposes, the effective radiated power authorized is the 
horizontally polarized component of radiation only.
    Equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP). The term 
``equivalent isotropically radiated power (also known as ``effective 
radiated power above isotropic) means the product of the antenna input 
power and the antenna gain in a given direction relative to an isotropic 
antenna.
    FM Blanketing. Blanketing is that form of interference to the 
reception of other broadcast stations which is caused by the presence of 
an FM broadcast signal of 115 dBu (562 mV/m) or greater signal strength 
in the area adjacent to the antenna of the transmitting station. The 115 
dBu contour is referred to as the blanketing contour and the area within 
this contour is referred to as the blanketing area.
    FM broadcast band. The band of frequencies extending from 88 to 108 
MHz, which includes those assigned to noncommercial educational 
broadcasting.
    FM broadcast channel. A band of frequencies 200 kHz wide and 
designated by its center frequency. Channels for FM broadcast stations 
begin at 88.1 MHz and continue in successive steps of 200 kHz to and 
including 107.9 MHz.
    FM broadcast station. A station employing frequency modulation in 
the FM broadcast band and licensed primarily for the transmission of 
radiotelephone emissions intended to be received by the general public.
    Field strength. The electric field strength in the horizontal plane.
    Free space field strength. The field strength that would exist at a 
point in the absence of waves reflected from the earth or other 
reflecting objects.
    Frequency departure. The amount of variation of a carrier frequency 
or center frequency from its assigned value.
    Frequency deviation. The peak difference between modulated wave and 
the carrier frequency.
    Frequency modulation. A system of modulation where the instantaneous 
radio frequency varies in proportion to the instantaneous amplitude of 
the modulating signal (amplitude of modulating signal to be measured 
after pre-emphasis, if used) and the instantaneous radio frequency is 
independent of the frequency of the modulating signal.
    Frequency swing. The peak difference between the maximum and the 
minimum values of the instantaneous frequency of the carrier wave during 
modulation.
    Multiplex transmission. The term ``multiplex transmission'' means 
the simultaneous transmission of two or more signals within a single 
channel. Multiplex transmission as applied to FM broadcast stations 
means the transmission of facsimile or other signals in addition to the 
regular broadcast signals.
    Percentage modulation. The ratio of the actual frequency deviation 
to the frequency deviation defined as 100% modulation, expressed in 
percentage. For FM broadcast stations, a frequency deviation of 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>75kHz is defined as 100% modulation.
    (b) Stereophonic sound broadcasting.
    Cross-talk. An undesired signal occurring in one channel caused by 
an electrical signal in another channel.
    FM stereophonic broadcast. The transmission of a stereophonic 
program by a single FM broadcast station utilizing the main channel and 
a stereophonic subchannel.
    Left (or right) signal. The electrical output of a microphone or 
combination of microphones placed so as to convey the intensity, time, 
and location of sounds originating predominately to the listener's left 
(or right) of the center of the performing area.
    Left (or right) stereophonic channel. The left (or right) signal as 
electrically reproduced in reception of FM stereophonic broadcasts.
    Main channel. The band of frequencies from 50 to 15,000 Hz which 
frequency-modulate the main carrier.
    Pilot subcarrier. A subcarrier that serves as a control signal for 
use in the reception of FM stereophonic sound broadcasts.
    Stereophonic separation. The ratio of the electrical signal caused 
in sound channel A to the signal caused in sound channel B by the 
transmission of only a channel B signal. Channels A and B

[[Page 130]]

may be any two channels of a stereophonic sound broadcast transmission 
system.
    Stereophonic sound. The audio information carried by plurality of 
channels arranged to afford the listener a sense of the spatial 
distribution of sound sources. Stereophonic sound broadcasting includes, 
but is not limited to, biphonic (two channel), triphonic (three channel) 
and quadrophonic (four channel) program services.
    Stereophonic sound subcarrier. A subcarrier within the FM broadcast 
baseband used for transmitting signals for stereophonic sound reception 
of the main broadcast program service.
    Stereophonic sound subchannel. The band of frequencies from 23 kHz 
to 99 kHz containing sound subcarriers and their associated sidebands.
    (c) Visual transmissions. Communications or message transmitted on a 
subcarrier intended for reception and visual presentation on a viewing 
screen, teleprinter, facsimile printer, or other form of graphic display

Sec. 73.312  Topographic data.

    (a) In the preparation of the profile graphs previously described, 
and in determining the location and height above mean sea level of the 
antenna site, the elevation or contour intervals shall be taken from 
United States Geological Survey Topographic Quadrangle Maps, United 
States Army Corps of Engineers Maps or Tennessee Valley Authority maps, 
whichever is the latest, for all areas for which such maps are 
available. If such maps are not published for the area in question, the 
next best topographic information should be used. Topographic data may 
sometimes be obtained from state and municipal agencies. The data from 
the Sectional Aeronautical Charts (including bench marks) or railroad 
depot elevations and highway elevations from road maps may be used where 
no better information is available. In cases where limited topographic 
data can be obtained, use may be made of an altimeter in a car driven 
along roads extending generally radially from the transmitter site.
    (b) The Commission will not ordinarily require the submission of 
typographical maps for areas beyond 24 km (15 miles) from the antenna 
site, but the maps must include the principal city or cities to be 
served. If it appears necessary additional data may be requested.
    (c) The U.S. Geological Survey Topography Quadrangle Sheets may be 
obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey Department of the Interior, 
Washington, DC 20240. The Sectional Aeronautical Charts are available 
from the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, Department of Commerce, 
Washington,

[[Page 131]]

DC 20235. These maps may also be secured from branch offices and from 
authorized agents or dealers in most principal cities.
    (d) In lieu of maps, the average terrain elevation may be computer 
generated except in cases of dispute, using elevations from a 30 second, 
point or better topographic data file. The file must be identified and 
the data processed for intermediate points along each radial using 
linear interpolation techniques. The height above mean sea level of the 
antenna site must be obtained manually using appropriate topographic 
maps.

Sec. 73.313  Prediction of coverage.

    (a) All predictions of coverage made pursuant to this section shall 
be made without regard to interference and shall be made only on the 
basis of estimated field strengths.
    (b) Predictions of coverage shall be made only for the same purposes 
as relate to the use of field strength contours as specified in 
Sec. 73.311.
    (c) In predicting the distance to the field strength contours, the 
F(50,50) field strength chart, Figure 1 of Sec. 73.333 must be used. The 
50% field strength is defined as that value exceeded for 50% of the 
time.
    (1) The F(50,50) chart gives the estimated 50% field strengths 
exceeded at 50% of the locations in dB above 1 uV/m. The chart is based 
on an effective power radiated from a half-wave dipole antenna in free 
space, that produces an unattenuated field strength at 1 kilometer of 
about 107 dB above 1 uV/m (221.4 mV/m).
    (2) To use the chart for other ERP values, convert the ordinate 
scale by the appropriate adjustment in dB. For example, the ordinate 
scale for an ERP of 50 kW (17 dBk) should be adjusted by 17 dB and, 
therefore, a field strength of 40 dBu would be converted to 57 dBu. When 
predicting the distance to field strength contours, use the maximum ERP 
of the main radiated lobe in the pertinent azimuthal direction. When 
predicting field strengths over areas not in the plane of the maximum 
main lobe, use the ERP in the direction of such areas, determined by 
considering the appropriate vertical radiation pattern.
    (d) The antenna height to be used with this chart is the height of 
the radiation center of the antenna above the average terrain along the 
radial in question. In determining the average elevation of the terrain, 
the elevations between 3 and 16 kilometers from the antenna site are 
used.
    (1) Profile graphs must be drawn for eight radials beginning at the 
antenna site and extending 16 kilometers therefrom. The radials should 
be drawn for each 45 deg. of azimuth starting with True North. At least 
one radial must include the principal community to be served even though 
it may be more than 16 kilometers from the antenna site. However, in the 
event none of the evenly spaced radials include the principal community 
to be served, and one or more such radials are drawn in addition, these 
radials must not be used in computing the antenna height above average 
terrain.
    (2) Where the 3 to 16 kilometers portion of a radial extends in 
whole or in part over a large body of water or extends over foreign 
territory but the 50 uV/m contour encompasses land area within the 
United States beyond the 16 kilometers portion of the radial, the entire 
3 to 16 kilometers portion of the radial must be included in the 
computation of antenna height above average terrain. However, where the 
50 uV/m contour does not so encompass United States land area and (i) 
the entire 3 to 16 kilometers portion of the radial extends over large 
bodies of water or foreign territory, such radial must be completely 
omitted from the computation of antenna height above average terrain, 
and (ii) where a part of the 3 to 16 kilometers portion of a radial 
extends over large bodies of water or foreign territory, only that part 
of the radial extending from the 3 kilometers sector to the outermost 
portion of land area within the United States covered by the radial must 
be used in the computation of antenna height above average terrain.
    (3) The profile graph for each radial should be plotted by contour 
intervals of from 12 to 30 meters and, where the

[[Page 132]]

data permits, at least 50 points of elevation (generally uniformly 
spaced) should be used for each radial. In instances of very rugged 
terrain where the use of contour intervals of 30 meters would result in 
several points in a short distance, 60 or 120 meter contour intervals 
may be used for such distances. On the other hand, where the terrain is 
uniform or gently sloping the smallest contour interval indicated on the 
topographic map should be used, although only relatively few points may 
be available. The profile graph should indicate the topography 
accurately for each radial, and the graphs should be plotted with the 
distance in kilometers as the abscissa and the elevation in meters above 
mean sea level as the ordinate. The profile graphs should indicate the 
source of the topographical data used. The graph should also show the 
elevation of the center of the radiating system. The graph may be 
plotted either on rectangular coordinate paper or on special paper that 
shows the curvature of the earth. It is not necessary to take the 
curvature of the earth into consideration in this procedure as this 
factor is taken care of in the charts showing signal strengths. The 
average elevation of the 13 kilometer distance between 3 and 16 
kilometers from the antenna site should then be determined from the 
profile graph for each radial. This may be obtained by averaging a large 
number of equally spaced points, by using a planimeter, or by obtaining 
the median elevation (that exceeded for 50% of the distance) in sectors 
and averaging those values.
    (4) Examples of HAAT calculations:
    (i) The heights above average terrain on the eight radials are as 
follows:

                                                                        
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 Meters 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The antenna height above terrain (defined in Sec. 73.310(a)) is 
computed as follows:

(120+255+185+90-10-85+40+85)/8=85 meters.

    (ii) Same as paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, except the 0 deg. 
radial is entirely over sea water. The antenna height above average 
terrain is computed as follows (note that the divisor is 7 not 8):

(255+185+90-10-85+40+85)/7=80 meters.

    (iii) Same as paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, except that only 
the first 10 kilometers of the 90 deg. radial are in the United States; 
beyond 10 kilometers the 90 deg. radial is in a foreign country. The 
height above average terrain of the 3 to 10 kilometer portion of the 
90 deg. radial is 105 meters. The antenna height above average terrain 
is computed as follows (note that the divisor is 8 not 7.5):

(120+255+105+90-10-85+40+85)/8=75 meters.

    (e) In cases where the terrain in one or more directions from the 
antenna site departs widely from the average elevation of the 3 to 16 
kilometer sector, the prediction method may indicate contour distances 
that are different from what may be expected in practice. For example, a 
mountain ridge may indicate the practical limit of service although the 
prediction method may indicate otherwise. In such cases, the prediction 
method should be followed, but a supplemental showing may be made 
concerning the contour distances as determined by other means. Such 
supplemental showings should describe the procedure used and should 
include sample calculations. Maps of predicted coverage should include 
both the coverage as predicted by the regular method and as predicted by 
a supplemental method. When measurements of area are required, these 
should include the area obtained by the regular prediction method and 
the area obtained by the supplemental method. In directions where the 
terrain is such that antenna heights less than 30 meters for the 3 to 16 
kilometer sector are obtained, an assumed height of 30 meters must be 
used for the prediction of coverage. However, where the actual contour 
distances are critical factors, a supplemental showing of expected 
coverage must be included together with a description of the method used 
in predicting such coverage. In special cases, the

[[Page 133]]

FCC may require additional information as to terrain and coverage.
    (f) The effect of terrain roughness on the predicted field strength 
of a signal at points distant from an FM transmitting antenna is assumed 
to depend on the magnitude of a terrain roughness factor (h) which, for 
a specific propagation path, is determined by the characteristics of a 
segment of the terrain profile for that path 40 kilometers in length 
located between 10 and 50 kilometers from the antenna. The terrain 
roughness factor has a value equal to the distance, in meters, between 
elevations exceeded by all points on the profile for 10% and 90% 
respectively, of the length of the profile segment. (See Sec. 73.333, 
Figure 4.)
    (g) If the lowest field strength value of interest is initially 
predicted to occur over a particular propagation path at a distance that 
is less than 50 kilometers from the antenna, the terrain profile segment 
used in the determination of terrain roughness factor over that path 
must be that included between points 10 kilometers from the transmitter 
and such lesser distances. No terrain roughness correction need be 
applied when all field strength values of interest are predicted to 
occur 10 kilometers or less from the transmitting antenna.
    (h) Profile segments prepared for terrain roughness factor 
determinations are to be plotted in rectangular coordinates, with no 
less than 50 points evenly spaced within the segment using data obtained 
from topographic maps with contour intervals of approximately 15 meters 
(50 feet) or less if available.
    (i) The field strength charts (Sec. 73.333, Figs. 1-1a) were 
developed assuming a terrain roughness factor of 50 meters, which is 
considered to be representative of average terrain in the United States. 
Where the roughness factor for a particular propagation path is found to 
depart appreciably from this value, a terrain roughness correction 
(<greek-D>F) should be applied to field strength values along this path, 
as predicted with the use of these charts. The magnitude and sign of 
this correction, for any value of <greek-D>h, may be determined from a 
chart included in Sec. 73.333 as Figure 5.
    (j) Alternatively, the terrain roughness correction may be computed 
using the following formula:

                <greek-D>F=1.9-0.03(<greek-D>h)(1+f/300)

Where:

    <greek-D>F=terrain roughness correction in dB
    <greek-D>k=terrain roughness factor in meters
    f=frequency of signal in MHz (MHz)

Sec. 73.314  Field strength measurements.

    (a) Except as provided for in Sec. 73.209, FM broadcast stations 
shall not be protected from any type of interference or propagation 
effect. Persons desiring to submit testimony, evidence or data to the 
Commission for the purpose of showing that the technical standards 
contained in this subpart do not properly reflect the levels of any 
given type of interference or propagation effect may do so only in 
appropriate rule making proceedings concerning the amendment of such 
technical standards. Persons making field strength measurements for 
formal submission to the Commission in rule making proceedings, or 
making such measurements upon the request of the Commission, shall 
follow the procedure for making and reporting such measurements outlined 
in paragraph (b) of this section. In instances where a showing of the 
measured level of a signal prevailing over a specific community is 
appropriate, the procedure for making and reporting field strength 
measurements for this purpose is set forth in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (b) Collection of field strength data for propagation analysis.
    (1) Preparation for measurements. (i) On large scale topographic 
maps, eight or more radials are drawn from the transmitter location to 
the maximum distance at which measurements are to be made, with the 
angles included between adjacent radials of approximately equal size. 
Radials should be

[[Page 134]]

oriented so as to traverse representative types of terrain. The specific 
number of radials and their orientation should be such as to accomplish 
this objective.
    (ii) Each radial is marked, at a point exactly 16 kilometers from 
the transmitter and, at greater distances, at successive 3 kilometer 
intervals. Where measurements are to be conducted over extremely rugged 
terrain, shorter intervals may be used, but all such intervals must be 
of equal length. Accessible roads intersecting each radial as nearly as 
possible at each 3 kilometer marker are selected. These intersections 
are the points on the radial at which measurements are to be made, and 
are referred to subsequently as measuring locations. The elevation of 
each measuring location should approach the elevation at the 
corresponding 3 kilometer marker as nearly as possible.
    (2) Measurement procedure. All measurements must be made utilizing a 
receiving antenna designed for reception of the horizontally polarized 
signal component, elevated 9 meters above the roadbed. At each measuring 
location, the following procedure must be used:
    (i) The instrument calibration is checked.
    (ii) The antenna is elevated to a height of 9 meters.
    (iii) The receiving antenna is rotated to determine if the strongest 
signal is arriving from the direction of the transmitter.
    (iv) The antenna is oriented so that the sector of its response 
pattern over which maximum gain is realized is in the direction of the 
transmitter.
    (v) A mobile run of at least 30 meters is made, that is centered on 
the intersection of the radial and the road, and the measured field 
strength is continuously recorded on a chart recorder over the length of 
the run.
    (vi) The actual measuring location is marked exactly on the 
topographic map, and a written record, keyed to the specific location, 
is made of all factors which may affect the recorded field, such as 
topography, height and types of vegetation, buildings, obstacles, 
weather, and other local features.
    (vii) If, during the test conducted as described in paragraph 
(b)(2)(iii) of this section, the strongest signal is found to come from 
a direction other than from the transmitter, after the mobile run 
prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section is concluded, 
additional measurements must be made in a ``cluster'' of at least five 
fixed points. At each such point, the field strengths with the antenna 
oriented toward the transmitter, and with the antenna oriented so as to 
receive the strongest field, are measured and recorded. Generally, all 
points should be within 60 meters of the center point of the mobile run.
    (viii) If overhead obstacles preclude a mobile run of at least 30 
meters, a ``cluster'' of five spot measurements may be made in lieu of 
this run. The first measurement in the cluster is identified. Generally, 
the locations for other measurements must be within 60 meters of the 
location of the first.
    (3) Method of reporting measurements. A report of measurements to 
the Commission shall be submitted in affidavit form, in triplicate, and 
should contain the following information:
    (i) Tables of field strength measurements, which, for each measuring 
location, set forth the following data:
    (A) Distance from the transmitting antenna.
    (B) Ground elevation at measuring location.
    (C) Date, time of day, and weather.
    (D) Median field in dBu for 0 dBk, for mobile run or for cluster, as 
well as maximum and minimum measured field strengths.
    (E) Notes describing each measuring location.
    (ii) U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps, on which is shown the 
exact location at which each measurement was made. The original plots 
shall be made on maps of the largest available scale. Copies may be 
reduced in size for convenient submission to the Commission, but not to 
the extent that important detail is lost. The original maps shall be 
made available, if requested. If a large number of maps is involved, an 
index map should be submitted.
    (iii) All information necessary to determine the pertinent 
characteristics

[[Page 135]]

of the transmitting installation, including frequency, geographical 
coordinates of antenna site, rated and actual power output of 
transmitter, measured transmission line loss, antenna power gain, height 
of antenna above ground, above mean sea level, and above average 
terrain. The effective radiated power should be computed, and horizontal 
and vertical plane patterns of the transmitting antenna should be 
submitted.
    (iv) A list of calibrated equipment used in the field strength 
survey, which, for each instrument, specifies its manufacturer, type, 
serial number and rated accuracy, and the date of its most recent 
calibration by the manufacturer, or by a laboratory. Complete details of 
any instrument not of standard manufacture shall be submitted.
    (v) A detailed description of the calibration of the measuring 
equipment, including field strength meters, measuring antenna, and 
connecting cable.
    (vi) Terrain profiles in each direction in which measurements were 
made, drawn on curved earth paper for equivalent 4/3 earth radius, of 
the largest available scale.
    (c) Collection of field strength data to determine FM broadcast 
service in specific communities.
    (1) Preparation for measurement. (i) The population (P) of the 
community, and its suburbs, if any, is determined by reference to an 
appropriate source, e.g., the 1970 U.S. Census tables of population of 
cities and urbanized areas.
    (ii) The number of locations at which measurements are to be made 
shall be at least 15, and shall be approximately equal to 0.1(P)<SUP>1/
2</SUP>, if this product is a number greater than 15.
    (iii) A rectangular grid, of such size and shape as to encompass the 
boundaries of the community is drawn on an accurate map of the 
community. The number of line intersections on the grid included within 
the boundaries of the community shall be at least equal to the required 
number of measuring locations. The position of each intersection on the 
community map determines the location at which a measurement shall be 
made.
    (2) Measurement procedure. All measurements must be made using a 
receiving antenna designed for reception of the horizontally polarized 
signal component, elevated 9 meters above ground level.
    (i) Each measuring location shall be chosen as close as feasible to 
a point indicated on the map, as previously prepared, and at as nearly 
the same elevation as that point as possible.
    (ii) At each measuring location, after equipment calibration and 
elevation of the antenna, a check is made to determine whether the 
strongest signal arrives from a direction other than from the 
transmitter.
    (iii) At 20 percent or more of the measuring locations, mobile runs, 
as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be made, with no 
less than three such mobile runs in any case. The points at which mobile 
measurements are made shall be well separated. Spot measurements may be 
made at other measuring points.
    (iv) Each actual measuring location is marked exactly on the map of 
the community, and suitably keyed. A written record shall be maintained, 
describing, for each location, factors which may affect the recorded 
field, such as the approximate time of measurement, weather, topography, 
overhead wiring, heights and types of vegetation, buildings and other 
structures. The orientation, with respect to the measuring location 
shall be indicated of objects of such shape and size as to be capable of 
causing shadows or reflections. If the strongest signal received was 
found to arrive from a direction other than that of the transmitter, 
this fact shall be recorded.
    (3) Method of reporting measurements. A report of measurements to 
the Commission shall be submitted in affidavit form, in triplicate, and 
should contain the following information:
    (i) A map of the community showing each actual measuring location, 
specifically identifying the points at which mobile runs were made.
    (ii) A table keyed to the above map, showing the field strength at 
each measuring point, reduced to dBu for the actual effective radiated 
power of the station. Weather, date, and time of each measurement shall 
be indicated.
    (iii) Notes describing each measuring location.

[[Page 136]]

    (iv) A topographic map of the largest available scale on which are 
marked the community and the transmitter site of the station whose 
signals have been measured, which includes all areas on or near the 
direct path of signal propagation.
    (v) Computations of the mean and standard deviation of all measured 
field strengths, or a graph on which the distribution of measured field 
strength values is plotted.
    (vi) A list of calibrated equipment used for the measurements, which 
for each instrument, specifies its manufacturer, type, serial number and 
rated accuracy, and the date of its most recent calibration by the 
manufacturer, or by a laboratory. Complete details of any instrument not 
of standard manufacture shall be submitted.
    (vii) A detailed description of the procedure employed in the 
calibration of the measuring equipment, including field strength meters, 
measuring antenna, and connecting cable.

Sec. 73.315  FM transmitter location.

    (a) The transmitter location shall be chosen so that, on the basis 
of the effective radiated power and antenna height above average terrain 
employed, a minimum field strength of 70 dB above one uV/m (dBu), or 
3.16 mV/m, will be provided over the entire principal community to be 
served.

    Note: The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply 
to noncommercial educational FM broadcast stations operating on reserved 
channels. (Channels 200 through 220)

    (b) The transmitter location should be chosen to maximize coverage 
to the city of license while minimizing interference. This is normally 
accomplished by locating in the least populated area available while 
maintaining the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section. In general, 
the transmitting antenna of a station should be located in the most 
sparsely populated area available at the highest elevation available. 
The location of the antenna should be so chosen that line-of-sight can 
be obtained from the antenna over the principle city or cities to be 
served; in no event should there be a major obstruction in this path.
    (c) The transmitting location should be selected so that the 1 mV/m 
contour encompasses the urban population within the area to be served. 
It is recognized that topography, shape of the desired service area, and 
population distribution may make the choice of a transmitter location 
difficult. In such cases consideration may be given to the use of a 
directional antenna system, although it is generally preferable to 
choose a site where a nondirectional antenna may be employed.
    (d) In cases of questionable antenna locations it is desirable to 
conduct propagation tests to indicate the field strength expected in the 
principal city or cities to be served and in other areas, particularly 
where severe shadow problems may be expected. In considering 
applications proposing the use of such locations, the Commission may 
require site tests to be made. Such tests should include measurements 
made in accordance with the measurement procedures described in 
Sec. 73.314, and full data thereon shall be supplied to the Commission. 
The test transmitter should employ an antenna having a height as close 
as possible to the proposed antenna height, using a balloon or other 
support if necessary and feasible. Information concerning the 
authorization of site tests may be obtained from the Commission upon 
request.
    (e) Cognizance must of course be taken regarding the possible hazard 
of the proposed antenna structure to aviation and the proximity of the 
proposed site to airports and airways. Procedures and standards with 
respect to the Commission's consideration of proposed antenna structures 
which will serve as a guide to persons intending to apply for radio 
station licenses are contained in Part 17 of this chapter (Construction, 
Marking, and Lighting of Antenna Structures).

Sec. 73.316  FM antenna systems.

    (a) It shall be standard to employ horizontal polarization; however, 
circular or elliptical polarization may be employed if desired. 
Clockwise or counterclockwise rotation may be used. The supplemental 
vertically polarized effective radiated power required for circular or 
elliptical polarization shall in no event exceed the effective radiated 
power authorized.
    (b) Directional antennas. A directional antenna is an antenna that 
is designed or altered for the purpose of obtaining a non-circular 
radiation pattern.
    (1) Applications for the use of directional antennas that propose a 
ratio of maximum to minimum radiation in the horizontal plane of more 
than 15 dB will not be accepted.
    (2) Directional antennas used to protect short-spaced stations 
pursuant to Sec. 73.213 or Sec. 73.215 of the rules, that have a 
radiation pattern which varies more than 2 dB per 10 degrees of azimuth 
will not be authorized.
    (c) Applications for directional antennas. Applications proposing 
the use of directional antenna systems must be accompanied by the 
following:
    (1) A complete description of the proposed antenna system, including 
the manufacturer and model number of the proposed directional antenna. 
It is not sufficient to label the antenna with only a generic term such 
as ``dipole''. A specific model number must be provided. In the case of 
individually designed antennas with no model number, or in the case of a 
composite antenna composed of two or more individual antennas, the 
antenna must be described as a ``custom'' or ``composite'' antenna, as 
appropriate. A full description of the design of the antenna must also 
be submitted.
    (2) A relative field horizontal plane pattern of the proposed 
directional antenna. A single pattern encompassing both the horizontal 
and vertical polarization is required, rather than separate patterns for 
horizontal and vertical polarization. A value of 1.0 must be used to 
correspond to the direction of maximum radiation. The plot of the 
pattern must be oriented such that 0 deg. corresponds to the direction 
of maximum radiation or alternatively, in the case of an asymmetrical 
antenna pattern, the plot must be oriented such that 0 deg. corresponds 
to the actual azimuth with respect to true North. The horizontal plane 
pattern must be plotted to the largest scale possible on unglazed 
letter-size polar coordinate paper (main engraving approximately 18 cm x 
25 cm (7 inches x 10 inches)) using only scale divisions and 
subdivisions of 1, 2, 2.5, or 5 times 10-nth. Values of field strength 
less than 10% of the maximum field strength plotted on that pattern must 
be shown on an enlarged scale. In the case of a composite antenna 
composed of two or more individual antennas, the pattern required is 
that for the composite antenna, not the patterns for each of the 
individual antennas.
    (3) A tabulation of the relative field pattern required in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section. The tabulation must use the same zero degree 
reference as the plotted pattern, and must contain values for at least 
every 10 deg.. In addition, tabulated values of all maximas and minimas, 
with their corresponding azimuths, must be submitted.
    (4) Sufficient vertical patterns to indicate clearly the radiation 
characteristics of the antenna above and below the horizontal plane. 
Complete information and patterns must be provided for angles of 
<plus-minus>10 deg. from the horizontal plane and sufficient additional 
information must be included on that portion of the pattern lying 
between +10 deg. and the zenith and -10 deg. and the nadir, to 
conclusively demonstrate the absence of undesirable lobes in these 
areas. The vertical plane pattern must be plotted on rectangular 
coordinate paper with reference to the horizontal plane. In the case of 
a composite antenna composed of two or more individual antennas, the 
pattern required is that for the composite antenna, not the patterns for 
each of the individual antennas.
    (5) A statement that the antenna will be mounted on the top of an 
antenna tower recommended by the antenna manufacturer, or will be side-
mounted on a particular type of antenna tower in accordance with 
specific instructions provided by the antenna manufacturer.
    (6) A statement that the directional antennas will not be mounted on 
the

[[Page 138]]

top of an antenna tower which includes a top-mounted platform larger 
than the nominal cross-sectional area of the tower in the horizontal 
plane.
    (7) A statement that no other antennas of any type are mounted on 
the same tower level as a directional antenna, and that no antenna of 
any type is mounted within any horizontal or vertical distance specified 
by the antenna manufacturer as being necessary for proper directional 
operation.
    (8) In the case of applications for license upon completion of 
antenna construction, a statement from an engineer (as well as a 
statement of the engineer's qualifications) that the antenna has been 
installed pursuant to the manufacturer's instructions and a statement 
from a licensed surveyor that the antenna is installed in the proper 
orientation.
    (9) In the case of an application for license upon completion of 
antenna construction for a station authorized pursuant to Sec. 73.215 or 
Sec. 73.509, a showing that the root mean square (RMS) of the measured 
composite antenna pattern (encompassing both the horizontally and 
vertically polarized radiation components (in relative field)) is at 
least 85 percent of the RMS of the authorized composite directional 
antenna pattern (in relative field). The RMS values, for a composite 
antenna pattern specified in relative field values, may be determined 
from the following formula:

    RMS = the square root of:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30SE97.005
    

where the relative field values are taken from at least 36 evenly spaced 
radials for the entire 360 degrees of azimuth. The application for 
license must also demonstrate that coverage of the community of license 
by the 70 dBu contour is maintained for stations authorized pursuant to 
Sec. 73.215 on Channels 221 through 300, as required by Sec. 73.315(a), 
while noncommercial educational stations operating on Channels 201 
through 220 must show that the 60 dBu contour covers at least a portion 
of the community of license.
    (d) Applications proposing the use of FM transmitting antennas in 
the immediate vicinity (i.e. 60 meters or less) of other FM or TV 
broadcast antennas must include a showing as to the expected effect, if 
any, of such approximate operation.
    (e) Where an FM licensee or permittee proposes to mount its antenna 
on an AM antenna tower, or locate within 3.2 km of an AM antenna tower, 
the FM licensee or permittee must comply with Sec. 73.1692.
    (f) When an FM broadcast antenna is mounted on a nondirectional AM 
broadcast antenna, new resistance measurements must be made of the AM 
broadcast antenna after installation and testing of the FM broadcast 
antenna. During the installation and until the new resistance 
determination is approved, the AM broadcast station licensee should 
operate by the indirect method of power determination. The FM broadcast 
license application will not be considered until the application form 
concerning resistance measurements is filed for the AM broadcast 
station.
    (g) When an FM broadcast antenna is mounted on an element of a AM 
broadcast directional antenna, a full engineering study concerning the 
effect of the FM broadcast antenna on the directional pattern must be 
filed with the application concerning the AM broadcast station. 
Depending upon the individual case, the Commission may require 
readjustment and certain field strength measurements of the AM broadcast 
station following the completion of the FM broadcast antenna system.
    (h) When the proposed FM antenna is to be mounted on a tower in the 
vicinity of an AM station directional antenna system and it appears that 
the operation of the directional antenna system may be affected, an 
engineering study must be filed with the FM application concerning the 
effect of the FM antenna on the AM directional radiation pattern. Field 
strength measurements of the AM station may be required prior to and 
following construction of the FM station antenna, and readjustments made 
as necessary.
    (i) Information regarding data required in connection with AM 
broadcast directional antenna systems may be found in Sec. 73.150 of 
this chapter. (See

[[Page 139]]

also AM Broadcast Technical Standards.)

Sec. 73.317  FM transmission system requirements.

    (a) FM broadcast stations employing transmitters authorized after 
January 1, 1960, must maintain the bandwidth occupied by their emissions 
in accordance with the specification detailed below. FM broadcast 
stations employing transmitters installed or type accepted before 
January 1, 1960, must achieve the highest degree of compliance with 
these specifications practicable with their existing equipment. In 
either case, should harmful interference to other authorized stations 
occur, the licensee shall correct the problem promptly or cease 
operation.
    (b) Any emission appearing on a frequency removed from the carrier 
by between 120 kHz and 240 kHz inclusive must be attenuated at least 25 
dB below the level of the unmodulated carrier. Compliance with this 
requirement will be deemed to show the occupied bandwidth to be 240 kHz 
or less.
    (c) Any emission appearing on a frequency removed from the carrier 
by more than 240 kHz and up to and including 600 kHz must be attenuated 
at least 35 dB below the level of the unmodulated carrier.
    (d) Any emission appearing on a frequency removed from the carrier 
by more than 600 kHz must be attenuated at least 43 + 10 
Log<INF>10</INF> (Power, in watts) dB below the level of the unmodulated

Sec. 73.318  FM blanketing interference.

    Areas adjacent to the transmitting antenna that receive a signal 
with a strength of 115 dBu (562 mV/m) or greater will be assumed to be 
blanketed. In determining the blanketed area, the 115 dBu contour is 
determined by calculating the inverse distance field using the effective 
radiated power of the maximum radiated lobe of the antenna without 
considering its vertical radiation pattern or height. For directional 
antennas, the effective radiated power in the pertinent bearing shall be 
used.
    (a) The distance to the 115 dBu contour is determined using the 
following equation:

D (in kilometers)=0.394<radical> P
D (in miles)=0.245<radical> P

Where P is the maximum effective radiated power (ERP), measured in 
kilowatts, of the maximum radiated lobe.
    (b) After January 1, 1985, permittees or licensees who either (1) 
commence program tests, or (2) replace their antennas, or (3) request 
facilities modifications and are issued a new construction permit must 
satisfy all complaints of blanketing interference which are received by 
the station during a one year period. The period begins with the 
commencement of program tests, or commencement of programming utilizing 
the new antenna. Resolution of complaints shall be at no

[[Page 140]]

cost to the complainant. These requirements specifically do not include 
interference complaints resulting from malfunctioning or mistuned 
receivers, improperly installed antenna systems, or the use of high gain 
antennas or antenna booster amplifiers. Mobile receivers and non-RF 
devices such as tape recorders or hi-fi amplifiers (phonographs) are 
also excluded.
    (c) A permittee collocating with one or more existing stations and 
beginning program tests on or after January 1, 1985, must assume full 
financial responsibility for remedying new complaints of blanketing 
interference for a period of one year. Two or more permittees that 
concurrently collocate on or after January 1, 1985, shall assume shared 
responsibility for remedying blanketing complaints within the blanketing 
area unless an offending station can be readily determined and then that 
station shall assume full financial responsibility.
    (d) Following the one year period of full financial obligation to 
satisfy blanketing complaints, licensees shall provide technical 
information or assistance to complainants on remedies for blanketing 
interference.

Sec. 73.319  FM multiplex subcarrier technical standards.

    (a) The technical specifications in this Section apply to all 
transmissions of FM multiplex subcarriers except those used for 
stereophonic sound broadcasts under the provisions of Sec. 73.322.
    (b) Modulation. Any form of modulation may be used for subcarrier 
operation.
    (c) Subcarrier baseband. (1) During monophonic program 
transmissions, multiplex subcarriers and their significant sidebands 
must be within the range of 20 kHz to 99 kHz.
    (2) During stereophonic sound program transmissions (see 
Sec. 73.322), multiplex subcarriers and their significant sidebands must 
be within the range of 53 kHz to 99 kHz.
    (3) During periods when broadcast programs are not being 
transmitted, multiplex subcarriers and their significant sidebands must 
be within the range of 20 kHz to 99 kHz.
    (d) Subcarrier injection.
    (1) During monophonic program transmissions, modulation of the 
carrier by the arithmetic sum of all subcarriers may not exceed 30% 
referenced to 75 kHz modulation deviation. However, the modulation of 
the carrier by the arithmetic sum of all subcarriers above 75 kHz may 
not modulate the carrier by more than 10%.
    (2) During stereophonic program transmissions, modulation of the 
carrier by the arithmetic sum of all subcarriers may not exceed 20% 
referenced to 75 kHz modulation deviation. However, the modulation of 
the carrier by the arithmetic sum of all subcarriers above 75 kHz may 
not modulate the carrier by more than 10%.
    (3) During periods when no broadcast program service is transmitted, 
modulation of the carrier by the arithmetic sum of all subcarriers may 
not exceed 30% referenced to 75 kHz modulation deviation. However, the 
modulation of the carrier by the arithmetic sum of all subcarriers above 
75 kHz may not modulate the carrier by more than 10%.
    (4) Total modulation of the carrier wave during transmission of 
multiplex subcarriers used for subsidiary communications services must 
comply with the provisions Sec. 73.1570(b).
    (e) Subcarrier generators may be installed and used with a type 
accepted FM broadcast transmitter without specific authorization from 
the FCC provided the generator can be connected to the transmitter 
without requiring any mechanical or electrical modifications in the 
transmitter FM exciter circuits.
    (f) Stations installing multiplex subcarrier transmitting equipment 
must ensure the proper suppression of spurious or harmonic radiations. 
See Secs. 73.317, 73.1590 and 73.1690. If the subcarrier operation 
causes the station's transmissions not to comply with the technical 
provisions for FM broadcast stations or causes harmful interference to 
other communication services, the licensee or permittee must correct the 
problem promptly or cease operation. The licensee may be required to 
verify the corrective measures with supporting data. Such data must be 
retained

Sec. 73.322  FM stereophonic sound transmission standards.

    (a) An FM broadcast station shall not use 19 kHz <plus-minus>20 Hz, 
except as the stereophonic pilot frequency in a transmission system 
meeting the following parameters:
    (1) The modulating signal for the main channel consists of the sum 
of the right and left signals.
    (2) The pilot subcarrier at 19 kHz <plus-minus>2 Hz, must frequency 
modulate the main carrier between the limits of 8 and 10 percent.
    (3) One stereophonic subcarrier must be the second harmonic of the 
pilot subcarrier (i.e. 38 kHz) and must cross the time axis with a 
positive slope simultaneously with each crossing of the time axis by the 
pilot subcarrier. Additional stereophomic subcarriers are not precluded.
    (4) Double sideband, suppressed-carrier, amplitude modulation of the 
stereophonic subcarrier at 38 kHz must be used.
    (5) The stereophonic subcarrier at 38 kHz must be suppressed to a 
level less than 1% modulation of the main carrier.
    (6) The modulating signal for the required stereophonic subcarrier 
must be equal to the difference of the left and right signals.
    (7) The following modulation levels apply:
    (i) When a signal exists in only one channel of a two channel 
(biphonic) sound transmission, modulation of the carrier by audio 
components within the baseband range of 50 Hz to 15 kHz shall not exceed 
45% and modulation of the carrier by the sum of the amplitude modulated 
subcarrier in the baseband range of 23 kHz to 53 kHz shall not exceed 
45%.
    (ii) When a signal exists in only one channel of a stereophonic 
sound transmission having more than one stereophonic subcarrier in the 
baseband, the modulation of the carrier by audio components within the 
audio baseband range of 23 kHz to 99 kHz shall not exceed 53% with total 
modulation not to exceed 90%.
    (b) Stations not transmitting stereo with the method described in 
(a), must limit the main carrier deviation caused by any modulating 
signals occupying the band 19 kHz <plus-minus>20 Hz to 125 Hz.
    (c) All stations, regardless of the stereophonic transmission system 
used, must not exceed the maximum modulation limits specified in 
Sec. 73.1570(b)(2). Stations not using the method described in (a), must 
limit the modulation of the carrier by audio components within the audio 
baseband range of 23 kHz to 99 kHz to not exceed 53%.

                                                       dBu).            
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) An application by a Class D (secondary) station, other than an 
application to change class, will not be accepted if the proposed 
operation would involve overlap of signal strength contours with any 
other station as set forth below:

600 kHz.........................  100 mV/m (100 dBu)  1 mV/m (60 dBu).  
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) The following standards must be used to compute the distances to 
the pertinent contours:
    (1) The distance of the 60 dBu (1 mV/m) contours are to be computed 
using Figure 1 of Sec. 73.333 [F(50,50) curves] of this part.
    (2) The distance to the other contours are to be computed using 
Figure 1a of Sec. 73.333 [F(50,10) curves]. In the event that the 
distance to the contour is below 16 kilometers (approximately 10 miles), 
and therefore not covered by Figure 1a, curves in Figure 1 must be used.
    (3) The effective radiated power (ERP) that is the maximum ERP for 
any elevation plane on any bearing will be used.
    (d) An application for a change (other than a change in channel) in 
the facilities of a NCE-FM broadcast station will be accepted even 
though overlap of signal strength contours, as specified in paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section, would occur with another station in an area 
where such overlap does not already exists, if:
    (1) The total area of overlap with that station would not be 
increased;
    (2) The area of overlap with any other station would not increase;
    (3) The area of overlap does not move significantly closer to the 
station receiving the overlap; and,
    (4) No area of overlap would be created with any station with which 
the overlap does not now exist.
    (e) The provisions of this section concerning prohibited overlap 
will not apply where the area of such overlap lies entirely over water.

Sec. 73.512  Special procedures applicable to Class D noncommercial educational stations.

    (a) All Class D stations seeking renewal of license for any term 
expiring June 1, 1980, or thereafter shall comply with the requirements 
set forth below and shall simultaneously file an application on FCC Form 
340, containing full information regarding such compliance with the 
provisions set forth below.
    (1) To the extent possible, each applicant shall select a commercial 
FM channel on which it proposes to operate in lieu of the station's 
present channel. The station may select any commercial channel provided 
no objectionable interference, as set forth in Sec. 73.509(b), would be 
caused. The application shall include the same engineering information 
as is required to change the frequency of an existing station and any 
other information necessary to establish the fact that objectionable 
interference would not result. If no commerical channel is available 
where the station could operate without causing such interference, the 
application shall set forth the basis upon which this conclusion was 
reached.
    (2) If a commercial channel is unavailable, to the extent possible 
each applicant should propose operation on Channel 200 (87.9 MHz) unless 
the station would be within 402 kilometers (250 miles) of the Canadian 
border or 320 kilometers (199 miles) of the Mexican border or would 
cause interference to an FM station operating on Channels 201, 202, or 
203 or to TV Channel 6, as provided in Sec. 73.509.
    (3) If a channel is not available under either paragraph (a) (1) or 
(2) of this section, the renewal applicant shall study all 20 
noncommercial educational FM channels and shall propose operation on the 
channel which would cause the least preclusion to the establishment of 
new stations or increases in power by existing stations. Full 
information regarding the basis for the selection should be provided.
    (b) At any time before the requirements of paragraph (a) become 
effective, any existing Class D station may file a construction permit 
application on FCC Form 340 to change channel in the manner described 
above which shall be subject to the same requirements. In either case, 
any license granted shall specify that the station's license is for a 
Class D (secondary) station.
    (c) Except in Alaska, no new Class D applications nor major change 
applications by existing Class D stations are acceptable for filing 
except by existing Class D stations seeking to change frequency. Upon 
the grant of such application, the station shall become a Class D 
(secondary) station.
    (d) Class D noncommercial educational (secondary) stations (see 
Sec. 73.506(a)(2)) will be permitted to continue to operate only so long 
as no interference (as defined in Sec. 73.509) is caused to any TV or 
commercial FM broadcast stations. In the event that the Class D 
(secondary) station would cause interference to a TV or commercial FM 
broadcast station after that Class D (secondary) station is authorized, 
the Class D (secondary) station must cease operation when program tests 
for the TV or commercial FM broadcast station commence. The Class D 
(secondary) station may apply for a construction permit (see 
Sec. 73.3533) to change to another frequency or antenna site where it 
would not cause interference (as defined in Sec. 73.509). If the Class D 
(secondary) station must cease operation before the construction permit 
is granted, an application for temporary authorization (pursuant to 
Sec. 73.3542) to operate with the proposed facilities may be submitted; 
where appropriate, such temporary authorization can be granted.

rendered, must comply with the provisions of the following sections of 
subpart B: Secs. 73.201 through 73.213 (Classification of FM Broadcast 
Stations and Allocations of Frequencies) and such other sections of

[[Page 153]]

subpart B as are made specially applicable by the provisions of this 
subpart C. Stations in Alaska authorized before August 11, 1982, using 
Channels 261-300 need not meet the minimum effective radiated power 
requirement specified in Sec. 73.211(a). In all other respects, stations 
operating on Channels 221 through 300 are to be governed by the 
provisions of this subpart and not subpart B.

Sec. 73.525  TV Channel 6 protection.

    The provisions of this section apply to all applications for 
construction permits for new or modified facilities for a NCE-FM station 
on Channels 200-220 unless the application is accompanied by a written 
agreement between the NCE-FM applicant and each affected TV Channel 6 
broadcast station concurring with the proposed NCE-FM facilities.
    (a) Affected TV Channel 6 Station.
    (1) An affected TV Channel 6 station is a TV broadcast station which 
is authorized to operate on Channel 6 that is located within the 
following distances of a NCE-FM station operating on Channels 201-220:

                                 Table A

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Where a NCE-FM application has been accepted for filing or 
granted, the subsequent acceptance of an application filed by a relevant 
TV Channel 6 station will not require revision of the pending NCE-FM 
application or the FM station's authorized facilities, unless the 
provisions of paragraph (e)(3) of this section for TV translator or 
satellite stations apply.
    (b) Existing NCE-FM Stations. (1) A NCE-FM station license 
authorized to operate on channels 201-220 as of December 31, 1984, or a 
permittee, granted a construction permit for a NCE-FM station as of 
December 31, 1984, are not subject to this section unless they propose 
either:
    (i) To make changes in operating facilities or location which will 
increase predicted interference as calculated under paragraph (e) of 
this section to TV Channel 6 reception in any direction; or,
    (ii) To increase its ratio of vertically polarized to horizontally 
polarized transmissions.
    (2) Applicants must comply with the provision of paragraphs (c) or 
(d) of this section unless the application for modification demonstrates 
that, for each person predicted to receive new interference as a result 
of the change, existing predicted interference to two person will be 
eliminated. Persons predicted to receive new interference are those 
located outside the area predicted to receive interference from the 
station's currently authorized facilities (``existing predicted 
interference area'') but within the area predicted to receive 
interference from the proposed facilities (``proposed predicted 
interference area''). Persons for whom predicted interference will be 
eliminated are those located within the existing predicted interference 
area and outside the proposed predicted interference area.
    (i) In making this calculation, the provisions contained at 
paragraph (e) will be used except as modified by paragraph (b)(3) of 
this section.
    (ii) The following adjustment to the population calculation may be 
made: up to 1,000 persons may be subtracted from the population 
predicted to receive new interference if, for each person substracted, 
the applicant effectively installs two filters within 90 days after 
commencing program tests with the proposed facilities and, no later than 
45 days thereafter, provides the affected TV Channel 6 station (as 
defined in paragraph (a) of this section) with a certification 
containing sufficient information to permit verification of such 
installation. The required number of filters will be installed on 
television receivers located within the predicted interference area; 
provided that half of the installations are within

[[Page 154]]

the area predicted to receive new interference.
    (3) Where an NCE-FM applicant wishes to operate with facilities in 
excess of that permitted under the provisions of paragraphs (c) or (d) 
of this section, by proposing to use vertically polarized transmissions 
only, or to increase its ratio of vertically to horizontally polarized 
transmissions, the affected TV Channel 6 station must be given an option 
to pay for the required antenna and, if it takes that option, the NCE-FM 
vertically polarized component of power will be one half (-3 dB) that 
which would be allowed by the provisions of paragraph (e)(4) of this 
section.
    (4) Applications for modification will include a certification that 
the applicant has given early written notice of the proposed 
modification to all affected TV Channel 6 stations (as defined in 
paragraph (a) of this section).
    (5) Where the NCE-FM station demonstrates in its application that it 
must make an involuntary modification (e.g., due to loss of its 
transmitter site) that would not otherwise be permitted under this 
section, its application will be considered on a case-by-case basis. In 
such cases, the provisions of paragaph (b)(3) of this section do not 
apply.
    (c) New NCE-FM Stations. Except as provided for by paragraph (d) of 
this section, applicants for NCE-FM stations proposing to operate on 
Channels 201-220 must submit a showing indicating that the predicted 
interference area resulting from the proposed facility contains no more 
than 3,000 persons.
    (1) In making these calculations, the provisions in paragraph (e) of 
this section will be used.
    (2) The following adjustment to population may be made: up to 1,000 
persons may be subtracted from the population within the predicted 
interference area if, for each person subtracted, the applicant 
effectively installs one filter within 90 days after commencing program 
tests and, no later than 45 days thereafter, provides the affected TV 
Channel 6 station with a certification containing sufficient information 
to permit verification of such installation. The required number of 
filters will be installed on television receivers located within the 
predicted interference area.
    (d) Collocated Stations. As an alternative to the provisions 
contained in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, an application for 
a NCE-FM station operating on Channels 201-220 and located at 0.4 
kilometer (approximately 0.25 mile) or less from a TV Channel 6 station 
will be accepted under the following requirements:
    (1) The effective radiated power cannot exceed the following values:

                                 Table B

210.............           21.4                220             100.0    
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) The NCE-FM application will include a certification that the 
applicant has coordinated its antenna with the affected TV station by 
employing either: The same number of antenna bays with radiation centers 
separated by no more than 30 meters (approximately 100 feet) 
verticially; or, the FM vertical pattern not exceeding the TV vertical 
pattern by more than 2dB.
    (e) Calculation of Predicted Interference Area and Population. 
Predictions of interference required under this section and calculations 
to determine the number of persons within a predicted interference area 
for NCE-FM operation on Channels 201-220 are made as follows:
    (1) The predicted interference area will be calculated as follows:
    (i) The distances to the TV Channel 6 field strength contours will 
be predicted according to the procedures specified in Sec. 73.684, 
``Prediction of coverage,'' using the F(50,50) curves in Figure 9, 
Sec. 73.699.
    (ii) For each TV Channel 6 field strength contour, there will be an 
associated F(50,10) FM interference contour, the value of which (in 
units of dBu) is defined as the sum of the TV Channel 6 field strength 
(in dBu) and the appropriate undesired-to-desired (U/D) signal ratio (in 
dB) obtained from

[[Page 155]]

Figures 1 and 2, Sec. 73.599, corresponding to the channel of the NCE-FM 
applicant and the appropriate F(50,50) field strength contour of the TV 
Channel 6 station.
    (iii) An adjustment of 6 dB for television receiving antenna 
directivity will be added to each NCE-FM interference contour at all 
points outside the Grade A field strength contour (Sec. 73.683) of the 
TV Channel 6 station and within an arc defined by the range of angles, 
of which the FM transmitter site is the vertex, from 110 deg. relative 
to the azimuth from the FM transmitter site to the TV Channel 6 
transmitter site, counterclockwise to 250 deg. relative to that azimuth. 
At all points at and within the Grade A field strength contour of the TV 
Channel 6 station, the 6 dB adjustment is applicable over the range of 
angles from 70 deg. clockwise to 110 deg. and from 250 deg. clockwise to 
290 deg..
    (iv) The distances to the applicable NCE-FM interference contours 
will be predicted according to the procedures specified in Sec. 73.313, 
``Prediction of Coverage,'' using the proposed antenna height and 
horizontally polarized, or the horizontal equivalent of the vertically 
polarized, effective radiated power in the pertinent direction and the 
F(50,10) field strength curves (Figure 1a, Sec. 73.333).
    (v) The predicted interference area will be defined as the area 
within the TV Channel 6 station's 47 dBu field strength contour that is 
bounded by the locus of intersections of a series of TV Channel 6 field 
strength contours and the applicable NCE-FM interference contours.
    (vi) In cases where the terrain in one or more directions departs 
widely from the surrounding terrain average (for example, an intervening 
mountain), a supplemental showing may be made. Such supplemental 
showings must describe the procedure used and should include sample 
calculations. The application must also include maps indicating the 
predicted interference area for both the regular method and the 
supplemental method.
    (vii) In cases where the predicted interference area to Channel 6 
television from a noncommercial educational FM station will be located 
within the 90 dBu F(50,50) contour of the television Channel 6 station, 
the location of the FM interfering contour must be determined using the 
assumption that the Channel 6 field strength remains constant at 90 dBu 
everywhere within the 90 dBu TV contour. The FM to Channel 6 U/D signal 
strength ratio specified in Sec. 73.599 corresponding to the Channel 6 
TV field strength of 90 dBu shall be used.
    (2) The number of persons contained within the predicted 
interference area will be based on data contained in the most recently 
published U.S. Census of Population and will be determined by plotting 
the predicted interference area on a County Subdivision Map of the state 
published for the Census, and totalling the number of persons in each 
County Subdivision (such as, Minor Civil Division (MCD), Census County 
Division (CCD), or equivalent areas) contained within the predicted 
interference area. Where only a portion of County Subdivision is 
contained within the interference area:
    (i) The population of all incorporated places or Census designated 
places will be subtracted from the County Subdivision population;
    (ii) Uniform distribution of the remaining population over the 
remaining area of the County Subdivision will be assumed in determining 
the number of persons within the predicted interference area in 
proportion to the share of the remaining area of the County Subdivision 
that lies within the predicted interference area; and,
    (iii) The population of the incorporated places or Census designated 
places contained within the predicted interference area will then be 
added to the total, again assuming uniform distribution of the 
population within the area of each place and adding a share of the 
population proportional to the share of the area if only a portion of 
such a place is within the predicted interference area.
    (iv) At the option of either the NCE-FM applicant or an affected TV 
Channel 6 station which provides the appropriate analysis, more detailed 
population data may be used.
    (3) Adjustments to the population calculated pursuant to paragraph 
(e)(2) of this section may be made as follows:

[[Page 156]]

    (i) If any part of the predicted interference area is within the 
Grade A field strength contour (Sec. 73.683) of a TV translator station 
carrying the affected TV Channel 6 station, the number of persons within 
that overlap area will be subtracted, provided the NCE-FM construction 
permit and license will contain the following conditions:
    (A) When the TV translator station ceases to carry the affected TV 
Channel 6 station's service and the cessation is not the choice of the 
affected TV Channel 6 station, the NCE-FM station will modify its 
facilities, within a reasonable transition period, to meet the 
requirements of this section which would have applied if no adjustment 
to population for translator service had been made in its application.
    (B) The transition period may not exceed 1 year from the date the 
NCE-FM station is notified by the TV Channel 6 station that the 
translator station will cease to carry the affected TV Channel 6 
station's service or 6 months after the translator station ceases to 
carry the affected TV Channel 6 station's service, whichever is earlier.
    (ii) If any part of the interference area is within the Grade B 
field strength contour (Sec. 73.683) of a satellite station of the 
affected TV Channel 6 station, the number of persons within the overlap 
area will be subtracted, provided the NCE-FM permit and license will 
contain the following conditions:
    (A) If the satellite station ceases to carry the affected TV Channel 
6 station's service and the cessation is not the choice of the affected 
TV Channel 6 station, the NCE-FM station will modify its facilities, 
within a reasonable transition period, to meet the requirements of this 
rule which would have applied if no adjustment to population for 
satellite station service had been made in its application.
    (B) The transition period may not exceed 1 year from the date the 
NCE-FM station is notified by the TV Channel 6 station that the 
satellite station will cease to carry the affected TV Channel 6 
stations's service or 6 months after the satellite station ceases to 
carry the affected TV Channel 6 station's service, whichever is earlier.
    (iii) If any part of the predicted interference area is located 
outside the affected TV Channel 6 station's Area of Dominant Influence 
(ADI), outside the Grade A field strength contour (Sec. 73.683), and 
within the predicted city grade field strength contour (73.685(a)) of a 
TV broadcast station whose only network affiliation is the same as the 
only network affiliation of the affected TV Channel 6 station, the 
number of persons within that part will be subtracted. (For purposes of 
this provision, a network is defined as ABC, CBS, NBC, or their 
successors.) In addition, the ADI of an affected TV Channel 6 station 
and the program network affiliations of all relevant TV broadcast 
stations will be assumed to be as they were on the filing date of the 
NCE-FM application or June 1, 1985, whichever is later.
    (iv) In calculating the population within the predicted interference 
area, an exception will be permitted upon a showing (e.g., as survey of 
actual television reception) that the number of persons within the 
predicted interference area should be reduced to account for persons 
actually experiencing co-channel or adjacent channel interference to 
reception of the affected TV Channel 6 station. The area within which 
such a showing may be made will be limited to the area calculated as 
follows:
    (A) The distances to the field strength contours of the affected TV 
Channel 6 station will be predicted according to the procedures 
specified in Sec. 73.684, ``Prediction of coverage,'' using the F(50,50) 
curves in Figure 9, Sec. 73.699.
    (B) For each field strength contour of the affected TV Channel 6 
station, there will be an associated co-channel or adjacent channel TV 
broadcast station interference contour, the value of which (in units of 
dBu) is defined as the sum of the affected TV Channel 6 station's field 
strength (in dBu) and the appropriate undesired-to-desired signal ratio 
(in dB) as follows:

Co-channel, normal offset, -22 dB
Co-channel, no offset, -39 dB
Adjacent channel, +12 dB

    (C) The distances to the associated co-channel or adjacent channel 
TV broadcast station interference contour

[[Page 157]]

will be predicted according to the procedures specified in Sec. 73.684, 
``Prediction of coverage,'' using the F(50,10) curves in Figure 9a, 
Sec. 73.699.
    (D) The area within which the showing of actual interference may be 
made will be the area bounded by the locus of intersections of a series 
of the affected TV Channel 6 station's field strength contours and the 
associated interference contours of the co-channel or adjacent channel 
TV broadcast station.
    (4) The maximum permissible effective radiated power (ERP) and 
antenna height may be adjusted for vertical polarity as follows:
    (i) If the applicant chooses to use vertically polarized 
transmissions only, the maximum permissible vertically polarized ERP 
will be the maximum horizontally polarized ERP permissible at the same 
proposed antenna height, calculated without the adjustment for 
television receiving antenna directivity specified in paragraph 
(e)(1)(iii) of this section, multiplied by either: 40 if the predicted 
interference area lies entirely outside the limits of a city of 50,000 
persons or more; or 10 if it does not.
    (ii) If the applicant chooses to use mixed polarity, the permissible 
ERP is as follows:

    [H+(V/A)] is no greater than P
Where:
    H is the horizontally polarized ERP in kilowatts for mixed polarity;
    V is the vertically polarized ERP in kilowatts for mixed polarity;
    A is 40 if the predicted interference area lies entirely outside the 
limits of a city of 50,000 persons or more, or 10 if it does not; and
    P is the maximum permitted horizontally polarized-only power in 
kilowatts.

    (f) Channel 200 Applications. No application for use of NCE-FM 
Channel 200 will be accepted if the requested facility would cause 
objectionable interference to TV Channel 6 operations. Such 
objectionable interference will be considered to exist whenever the 15 
dBu contour based on the F(50,10) curves in Sec. 73.333 Figure 1a would 
overlap the 40 dBu contour based on the F(50,50) curves in Sec. 73.699, 
Figure 9.

Sec. 73.558  Indicating instruments.

    The requirements for indicating instruments described in Sec. 73.258 
are applicable to all educational FM broadcast stations licensed with a 
transmitter power greater than 0.01 kw.

[51 FR 17029, May 8, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 73.561  Operating schedule; time sharing.

    (a) All noncommercial educational FM stations will be licensed for 
unlimited time operation except those stations operating under a time 
sharing arrangement. All noncommercial educational FM stations are 
required to operate at least 36 hours per week, consisting of at least 5 
hours of operation per day on at least 6 days of the week; however, 
stations licensed to educational institutions are not required to 
operate on Saturday or Sunday or to observe the minimum operating 
requirements during those days designated on the official school 
calendar as vacation or recess periods.
    (b) All stations, including those meeting the requirements of 
paragraph (a) of this section, but which do not operate 12 hours per day 
each day of the year, will be required to share use of the frequency 
upon the grant of an appropriate application proposing such share time 
arrangement. Such applications shall set forth the intent to share time 
and shall be filed in the same manner as are applications for new 
stations. They may be filed at any time, but in cases where the parties 
are unable to agree on time sharing, action on the application will be 
taken only in connection with the renewal of application for the 
existing station. In order to be considered for this purpose, such an 
application to share time must be filed no later than the deadline for 
filing petitions to deny the renewal application of the existing 
licensee, or, in the case of renewal applications filed by the existing 
licensee on or before May 1, 1995, no later than the deadline for filing 
applications in conflict with the such renewal applications.
    (1) The licensee and the prospective licensee(s) shall endeavor to 
reach an

[[Page 158]]

agreement for a definite schedule of periods of time to be used by each. 
Such agreement shall be in writing and shall set forth which licensee is 
to operate on each of the hours of the day throughout the year. Such 
agreement shall not include simultaneous operation of the stations. Each 
licensee shall file the same in triplicate with each application to the 
Commission for initial construction permit or renewal of license. Such 
written agreements shall become part of the terms of each station's 
license.
    (2) The Commission desires to facilitate the reaching of agreements 
on time sharing. However, if the licensees of stations authorized to 
share time are unable to agree on a division of time, the Commission 
shall be so notified by statement to that effect filed with the 
application proposing time sharing. Thereafter the Commission will 
designate the application for hearing on any qualification issues 
arising regarding the renewal or new applicants. If no such issues 
pertain, the Commission will set the matter for expedited hearing 
limited solely to the issue of the sharing of time. In the event the 
stations have been operating under a time sharing agreement but cannot 
agree on its continuation, a hearing will be held, and pending such 
hearing, the operating schedule previously adhered to shall remain in 
full force and effect.
    (c) A departure from the regular schedule set forth in a time-
sharing agreement will be permitted only in cases where an agreement to 
that effect is reduced to writing, is signed by the licensees of the 
stations affected thereby and filed in triplicate by each licensee with 
the Commission prior to the time of the proposed change. If time is of 
the essence, the actual departure in operating schedule may precede the 
actual filing of written agreement, provided appropriate notice is sent 
to the Commission in Washington, DC.
    (d) In the event that causes beyond the control of a permittee or 
licensee make it impossible to adhere to the operating schedule in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section or to continue operating, the 
station may limit or discontinue operation for a period of not more than 
30 days without further authority from the Commission, Provided, That 
notification is sent to the Commission in Washington, DC no later than 
the 10th day of limited or discontinued operation. During such period, 
the permittee or licensee shall continue to adhere to the requirements 
of the station license pertaining to the lighting of antenna structures. 
In the event normal operation is restored prior to the expiration of the 
30-day period, the permittee or licensee will so notify the Commission 
in Washington, DC, of this date. If the causes beyond the control of the 
permittee or licensee make it impossible to comply within the allowed 
period, informal written request shall be made to the Commission in 
Washington, DC, no later than the 30th day for such additional time as 
may be deemed necessary. The license of a broadcasting station that 
fails to transmit broadcast signals for any consecutive 12-month period 
expires as a matter of law at the end of that period, notwithstanding 
any provision, term, or condition of the license to the contrary.

    Note 1: For allocations purposes, both (all) stations sharing time 
will be treated as unlimited time stations.

    Note 2: See Secs. 73.1705, 73.1715, and 73.1740.

Sec. 73.607  Availability of channels.

    Applications may be filed to construct TV broadcast stations only on 
the channels designated in the Table of Allotments (Sec. 73.606(b)) and 
only in the communities listed therein. Applications which fail to 
comply with this requirement, whether or not accompanied by a petition 
to amend the Table, will not be accepted for filing. However, 
applications specifying channels which accord with publicly announced 
FCC Orders changing the Table of Allotments will be accepted for filing 
even though such applications are tendered before the effective dates of 
such channel changes.

Sec. 73.609  Zones.

    (a) For the purpose of allotment and assignment, the United States 
is divided into three zones as follows:
    (1) Zone I consists of that portion of the United States located 
within the confines of the following lines drawn on the U.S. Albers 
Equal Area Projection Map (based on standard parallels 29\1/2\ deg. and 
45\1/2\ deg.; North American datum): Beginning at the most easterly 
point on the State boundary line between North Carolina and Virginia; 
thence in a straight line to a point on the Virginia-West Virginia 
boundary line located at north latitude 37 deg.49' and west longitude 
80 deg.12'30'; thence westerly along the southern boundary lines of the 
States of West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois to a point at the 
junction of the Illinois, Kentucky, and Missouri State boundary lines; 
thence northerly along the western boundary line of the State of 
Illinois to a point at the junction of the Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin 
State boundary lines; thence easterly along the northern State boundary 
line of Illinois to the 90th meridian; thence north along this meridian 
to the 43.5 deg. parallel; thence east along this parallel to the United 
States-Canada border; thence southerly and following that border until 
it again intersects the 43.5 deg. parallel; thence east along this 
parallel to the 71st meridian; thence in a straight line to the 
intersection of the 69th meridian and the 45th parallel; thence east 
along the 45th parallel to the Atlantic Ocean. When any of the above 
lines pass through a city, the city shall be considered to be located in 
Zone I. (See Figure 1 of Sec. 73.699.)
    (2) Zone II consists of that portion of the United States which is 
not located in either Zone I or Zone III, and Puerto Rico, Alaska, 
Hawaiian Islands and the Virgin Islands.

[[Page 174]]

    (3) Zone III consists of that portion of the United States located 
south of a line, drawn on the United States Albers Equal Area Projection 
Map (based on standard parallels 29.50 and 45.50 North American datum), 
beginning at a point on the east coast of Georgia and the 31st parallel 
and ending at the United States-Mexican border, consisting of arcs drawn 
with a 241.4 kilometer (150 mile) radius to the north from the following 
specified points:

Sec. 73.610  Minimum distance separations between stations.

    (a) The provisions of this section relate to allotment separations 
and station separations. Petitions to amend the Table of Allotments 
(Sec. 73.606(b)) (other than those also expressly requesting amendment 
of this section or Sec. 73.609) will be dismissed and all applications 
for new TV broadcast stations or for changes in the transmitter sites of 
existing stations will not be accepted for filing if they fail to comply 
with the requirements specified in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this 
section.

    Note: Licensees and permittees of television broadcast stations 
which were operating on April 14, 1952 pursuant to one or more 
separations below those set forth in Sec. 73.610 may continue to so 
operate, but in no event may they further reduce the separations below 
the minimum. As the existing separations of such stations are increased, 
the new separations will become the required minimum separations until 
separations are reached which comply with the requirements of 
Sec. 73.610. Thereafter, the provisions of said section shall be 
applicable.

    (b) Minimum co-channel allotment and station separations:
    (1)

III...............................................................    353.2 (219.5 miles)    329.0 (204.5 miles)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) The minimum co-channel distance separation between a station in 
one zone and a station in another zone shall be that of the zone 
requiring the lower separation.
    (c) Minimum allotment and station adjacent channel separations 
applicable to all zones:
    (1) Channels 2-13 95.7 kilometers (59.5 miles). Channels 14-69 87.7 
kilometers (54.5 miles).
    (2) Due to the frequency spacing which exists between Channels 4 and 
5, between Channels 6 and 7, and between Channels 13 and 14, the minimum 
adjacent channel separations specified above shall not be applicable to 
these pairs of channels (see Sec. 73.603(a)).
    (d) In addition to the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) 
of this section, the minimum assignment and station separations between 
stations on Channels 14-69, inclusive, as set forth in Table II of 
Sec. 73.698 must be met in either rule-making proceedings looking 
towards the amendment of the Table of Assignments (Sec. 73.606(b)) or in 
licensing proceedings. No channel listed in column (1) of Table II of 
Sec. 73.698 will be assigned to any city, and no application for an 
authorization to operate on such a channel will be granted, unless the 
distance separations indicated at the top of columns (2) through (7), 
inclusive, are met with respect to each of the channels listed in those 
columns and parallel with the channel in column (1).
    (e) The zone in which the transmitter of a television station is 
located or proposed to be located determines the applicable rules with 
respect to co-channel distance separations where the transmitter is 
located in a different zone from that in which the channel to be 
employed is located.
    (f) The distances listed below apply only to allotments and 
assignments on Channel 6 (82-88 MHz). The Commission

[[Page 175]]

will not accept petitions to amend the Table of Allotments, applications 
for new stations, or applications to change the channel or location of 
existing assignments where the following minimum distances (between 
transmitter sites, in kilometers) from any FM Channel 253 allotment or 
assignment are not met:

Sec. 73.611  Reference points and distance computations.

    (a) In considering petitions to amend the Table of Allotments 
(Sec. 73.606(b)), the following reference points shall be used by the 
Commission in determining assignment separations between communities:
    (1) Where transmitter sites for the pertinent channels have been 
authorized in communities involved in a petition to amend the Table of 
Allotments, separations between such communities shall be determined by 
the distance between the coordinates of the authorized transmitter sites 
in the respective communities as set forth in the Commission's 
authorizations therefor.
    (2) Where an authorized transmitter site is available for use as a 
reference point in one community but not in the other for the pertinent 
channels, separations shall be determined by the distance between the 
coordinates of the transmitter site as set forth in the FCC's 
authorization therefor and the coordinates of the other community as set 
forth in the publication of the United States Department of the Interior 
entitled, Index to The National Atlas of the United States of America. 
If this publication does not contain the coordinates for said other 
community, the coordinates of the main post office thereof shall be 
used.
    (3) Where no authorized transmitter sites are available for use as 
reference points in both communities for the pertinent channels, the 
distance between the two communities listed in the above publication 
shall be used. If said publication does not contain such distance, the 
separation between the two communities shall be determined by the 
distance between the coordinates thereof as set forth in the 
publication. Where such coordinates are not contained in the 
publication, the coordinates of the main post offices of said 
communities shall be used.
    (4) Where the distance between the reference point in a community to 
which a channel is proposed to be assigned and the reference point in 
another community or communities does not meet the minimum separation 
requirements of Sec. 73.610, the channel may be assigned to such 
community upon a showing that a transmitter site is available that would 
meet the minimum separation requirements of Sec. 73.610 and the minimum 
field strength requirements of Sec. 73.685. In such cases, where a 
station is not authorized in the community or communities to which 
measurements from the proposed channel assignment must be made pursuant 
to Sec. 73.610 a showing should also be made that the distance between 
suitable transmitter sites in such other community or communities and 
the proposed transmitter site for the new channel meet the Commission's 
minimum spacing and coverage requirements.
    (b) Station separations in licensing proceedings shall be determined 
by the distance between the coordinates of the proposed transmitter site 
in one community and
    (1) The coordinates of an authorized transmitter site for the 
pertinent channel in the other community; or, where such transmitter 
site is not available for use as a reference point,
    (2) The coordinates of the other community as set forth in the Index 
to The National Atlas of the United States of America; or if not 
contained therein,

[[Page 176]]

    (3) The coordinates of the main post office of such other community.
    (4) In addition, where there are pending applications in other 
communities which, if granted, would have to be considered in 
determining station separations, the coordinates of the transmitter 
sites proposed in such applications must be used to determine whether 
the requirements with respect to minimum separations between the 
proposed stations in the respective cities have been met.
    (c) In measuring assignment and station separations involving cities 
listed in the Table in combination, where there is no authorized 
transmitter site in any of the combination cities on the channel 
involved, separation measurements shall be made from the reference point 
which will result in the lowest separation.
    (d) To calculate the distance between two reference points see 
paragraph (c), Sec. 73.208. However, distances shall be rounded to the 
nearest tenth of a kilometer.

    (a) Permittees and licensees of TV broadcast stations are not 
protected from any interference which may be caused by the grant of a 
new station or of authority to modify the facilities of an existing 
station in accordance with the provisions of this subpart. The nature 
and extent of the protection from interference accorded to TV broadcast 
stations is limited solely to the protection which results from the 
minimum allotment and station separation requirements and the rules and 
regulations with respect to maximum powers and antenna heights set forth 
in this subpart.
    (b) When the Commission determines that grant of an application 
would serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity and the 
instrument of authorization specifies an antenna location in a 
designated antenna farm area which results in distance separation less 
than those specified in this subpart, TV broadcast station permittees 
and licensees shall be afforded protection from interference equivalent 
to the protection afforded under the minimum distance separations 
specified in this subpart.

    Note: The nature and extent of the protection from interference 
accorded to TV broadcast stations which were authorized prior to April 
14, 1952, and which were operating on said date is limited not only as 
specified above but is further limited by any smaller separations 
existing between such stations on said date. Where, as a result of the 
adoption of the Table of Allotments or of changes in transmitter sites 
made by such stations after said date, separations smaller than the 
required minimum are increased but still remain lower than the required 
minimum, protection accorded such stations will be limited to the new 
separations.

Sec. 73.614  Power and antenna height requirements.

    (a) Minimum requirements. Applications will not be accepted for 
filing if they specify less than -10 dBk (100 watts) horizontally 
polarized visual effective radiated power in any horizontal direction. 
No minimum antenna height above average terrain is specified.
    (b) Maximum power. Applications will not be accepted for filing if 
they specify a power which exceeds the maximum permitted boundaries 
specified in the following formulas:
    (1) Channels 2-6 in Zone I:

ERP<INF>Max</INF>=102.57-33.24*Log<INF>10</INF>(HAAT)


And,

    -10 dBk <ls-thn-eq> ERP<INF>Max</INF><ls-thn-eq>20 dBk

    (2) Channels 2-6 in Zones II and III:

ERP<INF>Max</INF>=67.57-17.08* Log<INF>10</INF> (HAAT)

And,

    10 dBk <ls-thn-eq> ERP<INF>Max</INF><ls-thn-eq>20 dBk

    (3) Channels 7-13 in Zone I:

ERP<INF>Max</INF>=107.57-33.24* Log<INF>10</INF> (HAAT)

And,

    -4.0 dBk <ls-thn-eq> ERP<INF>Max</INF> <ls-thn-eq>25 dBk

    (4) Channels 7-13 in Zones II and III:

ERP<INF>Max</INF>=72.57-17.08* Log<INF>10</INF> (HAAT)

And,

    15 dBk <ls-thn-eq> ERP<INF>Max</INF><ls-thn-eq>25 dBk
    (5) Channels 14-69 in Zones I, II, and III:


[[Page 177]]


ERP<INF>Max</INF>=84.57-17.08* Log<INF>10</INF> (HAAT)

And,

    27 dBk <ls-thn-eq> ERP<INF>Max</INF><ls-thn-eq>37 dBk

Where:

ERP<INF>Max</INF>=Maximum Effective Radiated Power measured in decibels 
          above 1 kW (dBk).
HAAT=Height Above Average Terrain measured in meters.


The boundaries specified are to be used to determine the maximum 
possible combination of antenna height and    ERP<INF>dBk</INF>. When 
specifying an ERP<INF>dBk</INF> less than that permitted by the lower 
boundary, any antenna HAAT can be used. Also, for values of antenna HAAT 
greater than 2,300 meters the maximum ERP is the lower limit specified 
for each equation.
    (6) The effective radiated power in any horizontal or vertical 
direction may not exceed the maximum values permitted by this section.
    (7) The effective radiated power at any angle above the horizontal 
shall be as low as the state of the art permits, and in the same 
vertical plane may not exceed the effective radiated power in either the 
horizontal direction or below the horizontal, whichever is greater.
    (c) Determination of applicable rules. The zone in which the 
transmitter of a television station is located or proposed to be located 
determines the applicable rules with respect to maximum antenna heights 
and powers for VHF stations when the transmitter is located in Zone I 
and the channel to be employed is located in Zone II, or the transmitter 
is located in Zone II and the channel to be employed is located in Zone 
I.

Sec. 73.615  Administrative changes in authorizations.

    In the issuance of television broadcast station authorizations, the 
Commission will specify the transmitter output power and effective 
radiated power to the nearest 0.1 dBk. Power specified by kWs shall be 
obtained by converting dBk to kWs to 3 significant figures. Antenna 
heights above average terrain will be specified to the nearest meter. 
Midway figures will be authorized in the lower alternative.

Sec. 73.621  Noncommercial educational TV stations.

    In addition to the other provisions of this subpart, the following 
shall be applicable to noncommercial educational television broadcast 
stations:
    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, 
noncommercial educational broadcast stations will be licensed only to 
nonprofit educational organizations upon a showing that the proposed 
stations will be used primarily to serve the educational needs of the 
community; for the advancement of educational programs; and to furnish a 
nonprofit and noncommercial television broadcast service.
    (1) In determining the eligibility of publicly supported educational 
organizations, the accreditation of their respective state departments 
of education shall be taken into consideration.
    (2) In determining the eligibility of privately controlled 
educational organizations, the accreditation of state departments of 
education or recognized regional and national educational accrediting 
organizations shall be taken into consideration.
    (b) Where a municipality or other political subdivision has no 
independently constituted educational organization such as, for example, 
a board of education having autonomy with respect to carrying out the 
municipality's educational program, such municipality shall be eligible 
for a noncommercial educational television broadcast station. In such 
circumstances, a full and detailed showing must be made that a grant of 
the application will be consistent with the intent and purpose of the 
Commission's rules and regulations relating to such stations.
    (c) Noncommercial educational television broadcast stations may 
transmit educational, cultural and entertainment programs, and programs 
designed for use by schools and school systems in connection with 
regular school courses, as well as routine and administrative material 
pertaining thereto.

[[Page 178]]

    (d) A noncommercial educational television station may broadcast 
programs produced by or at the expense of, or furnished by persons other 
than the licensee, if no other consideration than the furnishing of the 
program and the costs incidental to its production and broadcast are 
received by the licensee. The payment of line charges by another 
station, network, or someone other than the licensee of a noncommercial 
educational television station, or general contributions to the 
operating costs of a station, shall not be considered as being 
prohibited by this paragraph.
    (e) Each station shall furnish a nonprofit and noncommercial 
broadcast service. Noncommercial educational television stations shall 
be subject to the provisions of Sec. 73.1212 to the extent that they are

of, or furnished by others. No promotional announcements on behalf of 
for profit entities shall be broadcast at any time in exchange for the 
receipt, in whole or in part, of consideration to the licensee, its 
principals, or employees. However, acknowledgements of contributions can 
be made. The scheduling of any announcements and acknowledgements may 
not interrupt regular programming.

    Note: Commission interpretation of this rule, including the 
acceptable form of acknowledgements, may be found in the Second Report 
and Order in Docket No. 21136 (Commission Policy Concerning the 
Noncommercial Nature of Educational Broadcast Stations), 86 F.C.C. 2d 
141 (1981); the Memorandum Opinion and Order in Docket No. 21136, 90 FCC 
2d 895 (1982), and the Memorandum Opinion and Order in Docket 21136, 49 
FR 13534, April 5, 1984.

    (f) Telecommunications Service on the Vertical Blanking Interval and 
in the Visual Signal. The provisions governing VBI and visual signal 
telecommunications service in Sec. 73.646 are applicable to 
noncommercial educational TV stations.
    (g) Non-program related data signals transmitted on Line 21 pursuant 
to Sec. 73.682(a)(22)(ii) may be used for remunerative purposes.

Sec. 73.622  Digital television table of allotments.

    (a) General. The following table of allotments contains the digital 
television (DTV) channel allotments designated for the listed 
communities in the United States, its Territories, and possessions. The 
initial DTV Table of Allotments was established on April 3, 1997, to 
provide a second channel for DTV service for all eligible analog 
television broadcasters. Requests for addition of new DTV allotments, or 
requests to change the channels allotted to a community must be made in 
a petition for rule making to amend the DTV Table of Allotments. A 
request to amend the DTV table to change the channel of an allotment in 
the DTV table will be evaluated for technical acceptability using 
engineering criteria set forth in Sec. 73.623(c). A request to amend the 
DTV table to add a new allotment will be evaluated for technical 
acceptability using the geographic spacing criteria set forth in 
Sec. 73.623(d). DTV allotments designated with an asterisk are assigned 
for use by non-commercial educational broadcast stations only. Stations 
operating on DTV allotments designated with a ``c'' are required to 
comply with paragraph (g) of this section.
    (1) Petitions requesting the addition of a new allotment must 
specify a channel in the range of channels 2-51.
    (2) Petitions requesting a change in the channel of an initial 
allotment must specify a channel in the range of channels 2-59.
    (b) DTV Table of Allotments.

    (c) Availability of channels. Applications may be filed to construct 
DTV broadcast stations only on the channels designated in the DTV Table 
of Allotments set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, and only in 
the communities listed therein. Applications that fail to comply with 
this requirement, whether or not accompanied by a petition to amend the 
DTV Table, will not be accepted for filing. However, applications 
specifying channels that accord with publicly announced FCC Orders 
changing the DTV Table of Allotments will be accepted for filing even if 
such applications are tendered before the effective dates of such 
channel change. An application for authority to construct a DTV station 
on an allotment in the initial DTV table may only be filed by the 
licensee or permittee of the analog TV station with which that initial 
allotment is paired, as set forth in Appendix B of the Sixth Report and 
Order in MM Docket 87-268, FCC 97-115, adopted April 3, 1997. Copies of 
the Sixth Report and Order may be inspected during normal business hours 
at the: Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M St., NW., Dockets 
Branch (Room 239), Washington, DC 20554. This document is also available 
through the Internet on the FCC Home Page at http://www.fcc.gov. 
Applications may also be filed to implement an exchange of channel 
allotments between two or more licensees or permittees of analog TV 
stations in the same community, provided, however, that the other 
requirements of this section and of Sec. 73.623 are met with respect to 
each such application.
    (d) Reference points and distance computations. (1) The reference 
coordinates of a DTV allotment included in the initial DTV Table of 
Allotments are the coordinates of the authorized transmitting antenna 
site of the analog TV station with which that initial allotment is 
paired, as set forth in Appendix B of the Sixth Report and Order in MM 
Docket 87-268 (referenced in paragraph (c) of this section). An 
application for authority to construct or modify DTV facilities may 
specify an alternate location for the DTV transmitting antenna that is 
within 5 kilometers of the DTV allotment reference coordinates without 
consideration of electromagnetic interference to other DTV or analog TV 
broadcast stations, allotments or

[[Page 186]]

applications, provided the application complies with paragraph (f)(2) of 
this section. Location of a DTV broadcast station's transmitting antenna 
at a site more than 5 kilometers from the DTV allotment reference 
coordinates must comply with the provisions of Sec. 73.623(c). In the 
case where a DTV station has been granted authority to construct more 
than 5 kilometers from its reference coordinates pursuant to 
Sec. 73.623(c), and its authorized coverage area extends in any 
azimuthal direction beyond the DTV coverage area determined for the DTV 
allotment reference facilities, then the coordinates of such authorized 
site are to be used in addition to the coordinates of the DTV allotment 
to determine protection from new DTV allotments pursuant to 
Sec. 73.623(d) and from subsequent DTV applications filed pursuant to 
Sec. 73.623(c).
    (2) The reference coordinates of a DTV allotment not included in the 
initial DTV Table of Allotments will be designated in the FCC Order 
changing the DTV Table of Allotments and must meet the geographic 
spacing requirements of Sec. 73.623(d). An application for authority to 
construct or modify such DTV facilities must comply with the provisions 
of Sec. 73.623(c). In the case where such a DTV station has been granted 
authority to construct pursuant to Sec. 73.623(c) and its authorized 
coverage area extends in any azimuthal direction beyond the DTV coverage 
area determined for the DTV allotment reference facilities, then the 
coordinates of such authorized site are to be used in addition to the 
coordinates of the DTV allotment to determine protection from new DTV 
allotments pursuant to Sec. 73.623(d) and from subsequent DTV 
applications filed pursuant to Sec. 73.623(c).
    (3) The reference coordinates defined in paragraphs (d)(1) and 
(d)(2) of this section shall be used in considering petitions to amend 
the DTV Table of Allotments and in determining whether interference 
occurs between DTV stations and between DTV and analog TV stations.
    (4) In cases where there are pending applications for DTV stations 
in other communities which, if granted, would have to be considered in 
determining whether proposed or modified stations would meet the 
required technical criteria or separations, as defined in Sec. 73.623, 
the coordinates of the transmitter sites proposed in such applications 
must be used to determine whether those requirements have been met.
    (5) To calculate the distance between two reference points, see 
Sec. 73.208(c). However, distances shall be rounded to the nearest tenth 
of a kilometer.
    (e) DTV Service Areas. The service area of a DTV station is the 
geographic area within which the predicted F(50,90) field strength of 
the station's signal, in dB above 1 microvolt per meter (dBu), exceeds 
the following levels:

                                                                        
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                   dBu  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Channels 2-6...................................................       28
Channels 7-13..................................................       36
Channels 14-69.................................................       41
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    These are the levels at which reception of DTV service is limited by 
noise. Evaluation of field strength in determining service areas shall 
be made using the terrain dependent Longley-Rice point-to-point 
propagation model. Guidance for evaluating coverage areas using the 
Longley-Rice methodology is provided in OET Bulletin No. 69. Copies of 
OET Bulletin No. 69 may be inspected during normal business hours at 
the: Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M St., NW., Dockets Branch 
(Room 239), Washington, DC 20554. This document is also available 
through the Internet on the FCC Home Page at http://www.fcc.gov.
    (f) DTV maximum power and antenna heights. (1) The maximum effective 
radiated power (ERP) and antenna height above average terrain (HAAT) for 
an allotment included in the initial DTV Table of Allotments are set 
forth in Appendix B of the Sixth Report and Order in MM Docket 87-268 
(referenced in paragraph (c) of this section). These limits also appear 
on the construction permit and license issued for each DTV station. In 
each azimuthal direction, the reference ERP value is based on the HAAT 
of the corresponding analog TV station and achieving predicted coverage 
equal to that analog TV station's predicted Grade B contour, as defined 
in Sec. 73.683.

[[Page 187]]

    (2) An application for authority to construct or modify DTV 
facilities will not be subject to further consideration of 
electromagnetic interference to other DTV or analog TV broadcast 
stations, allotments or applications, provided that:
    (i) The proposed ERP in each azimuthal direction is equal to or less 
than the reference ERP in that direction; and
    (ii) The proposed HAAT is equal to or less than the reference HAAT; 
and
    (iii) The application complies with the location provisions in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (3) DTV licensees and permittees may request an increase in either 
ERP in some azimuthal direction or HAAT, or both, that exceed the 
initial technical facilities specified for the allotment in Appendix B 
the Sixth Report and Order, up to the maximum permissible limits on DTV 
power and antenna height set forth in this section or up to that needed 
to provide the same geographic coverage area as the largest station 
within their market. Such requests must be accompanied by a technical 
showing that the increase complies with the technical criteria in 
Sec. 73.623(c), and thereby will not result in new interference, or 
statements agreeing to the change from any co-channel or adjacent 
channel stations that might be affected by potential new interference. 
In the case where a DTV station has been granted authority to construct 
pursuant to Sec. 73.623(c), and its authorized coverage area extends in 
any azimuthal direction beyond the DTV coverage area determined for the 
DTV allotment reference facilities, then the authorized DTV facilities 
are to be used in addition to the assumed facilities of the initial DTV 
allotment to determine protection from new DTV allotments pursuant to 
Sec. 73.623(d) and from subsequent DTV applications filed pursuant to 
Sec. 73.623(c).
    (4) A DTV station that operates on a channel 2-6 allotment created 
subsequent to the initial DTV Table will be allowed a maximum ERP of 10 
kW if its antenna HAAT is at or below 305 meters and it is located in 
Zone I or a maximum ERP of 45 kW if its antenna HAAT is at or below 305 
meters and it is located in Zone II or Zone III.
    (i) At higher HAAT levels, such DTV stations will be allowed to 
operate with lower maximum ERP levels in accordance with the following 
table and formulas:

  Maximum Allowable ERP and Antenna Height for DTV Stations in   Zones  
                    II   or   III   on   Channels 2-6                   
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                   ERP

305............................................................       45
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) The allowable maximum ERP for intermediate values of HAAT is 
determined using linear interpolation based on the units employed in the 
table. For DTV stations located in Zone I that operate on channels 2-6 
with an HAAT that exceeds 305 meters, the allowable maximum ERP 
expressed in decibels above 1 kW (dBk) is determined using the following 
formula, with HAAT expressed in meters:

ERP<INF>max</INF>=92.57-33.24*log<INF>10</INF>(HAAT)

    (iii) For DTV stations located in Zone II or III that operate on 
channels 2-6 with an HAAT that exceeds 610 meters, the allowable maximum 
ERP expressed in decibels above 1 kW (dBk) is determined using the 
following formula, with HAAT expressed in meters:

ERP<INF>max</INF>=57.57-17.08*log<INF>10</INF>(HAAT)

    (5) A DTV station that operates on a channel 7-13 allotment created 
subsequent to the initial DTV Table will be allowed a maximum ERP of 30 
kW if its antenna HAAT is at or below 305 meters and it is located in 
Zone I or a maximum ERP of 160 kW if its antenna HAAT is at or below 305 
meters and it is located in Zone II or Zone III.
    (i) At higher HAAT levels, such DTV stations will be allowed to 
operate with lower maximum ERP levels in accordance with the following 
table and formulas:

[[Page 188]]

305............................................................      160
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) The allowable maximum ERP for intermediate values of HAAT is 
determined using linear interpolation based on the units employed in the 
table. For DTV stations located in Zone I that operate on channels 7-13 
with an HAAT that exceeds 305 meters, the allowable maximum ERP 
expressed in decibels above 1 kW (dBk) is determined using the following 
formula, with HAAT expressed in meters:

ERP<INF>max</INF>=97.35-33.24*log<INF>10</INF>(HAAT)

    (iii) For DTV stations located in Zone II or III that operate on 
channels 7-13 with an HAAT that exceeds 610 meters, the allowable 
maximum ERP expressed in decibels above 1 kW (dBk) is determined using 
the following formula, with HAAT expressed in meters:

ERP<INF>max</INF>=62.34-17.08*log<INF>10</INF>(HAAT)

    (6) A DTV station that operates on a channel 14-59 allotment created 
subsequent to the initial DTV Table will be allowed a maximum ERP of 
1000 kW if their antenna HAAT is at or below 365 meters.
    (i) At higher HAAT levels, such DTV stations will be allowed to 
operate with lower maximum ERP levels in accordance with the following 
table and formulas:

Maximum Allowable ERP and Antenna Height for DTV Stations on Channels 14-
                              59, All Zones

425............................................................      750
395............................................................      900
365............................................................     1000
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) The allowable maximum ERP for intermediate values of HAAT is 
determined using linear interpolation based on the units employed in the 
table. For DTV stations located in Zone I, II or III that operate on 
channels 14-59 with an HAAT that exceeds 610 meters, the allowable 
maximum ERP expressed in decibels above 1 kW (dBk) is determined using 
the following formula, with HAAT expressed in meters:

ERP<INF>max</INF>=72.57-17.08*log<INF>10</INF>(HAAT)

    (g) For DTV stations using a channel allotment designated with a 
``c'' in paragraph (b) of this section, the pilot carrier frequency of 
the DTV signal must be maintained 5.082138 MHz above the visual carrier 
frequency of the analog TV broadcast station operating on the lower 
adjacent channel, located within 88 kilometers of the DTV broadcast 
station. This frequency difference must be maintained within a tolerance 
of <SUP><greek-i></SUP>3 Hz.
    (h)(1) The field strength or voltage of emissions on frequencies 
outside the authorized channel of operation must be attenuated no less 
than the following amounts below the average transmitted power within 
the authorized channel. At the channel edge, emissions must be 
attenuated no less than 46 dB. More than 6 MHz from the channel edge, 
emissions must be attenuated no less than 71 dB. At any frequency 
between 0 and 6 MHz from the channel edge, emissions must be attenuated 
no less than the value determined by the following formula:

Attenuation in dB=46+[(<greek-D>f)<SUP>2</SUP>/1.44];

Where:

<triangle>f=frequency difference in MHz from the edge of the channel.

    (2) This attenuation is based on a measurement bandwidth of 500 kHz. 
Other measurement bandwidths may be used as long as appropriate 
correction

[[Page 189]]

factors are applied. Emissions include sidebands, spurious emissions and 
radio frequency harmonics. Attenuation is to be measured at the output 
terminals of the transmitter (including any filters that may be 
employed). In the event of interference caused to any service, greater 
attenuation may be required.

    Note to paragraph (h): Greater attenuation may be required for 
situations where the DTV station and an adjacent channel analog TV 
station serve the same area and there are expected to be locations 
within that shared area where the analog TV station's field strength is 
less than 12 dB above the DTV station's field strength.

Sec. 73.623  DTV applications and changes to DTV allotments.

    (a) General. This section contains the technical criteria for 
evaluating applications requesting DTV facilities that do not conform to 
the provisions of Sec. 73.622 and petitions for rule making to amend the 
DTV Table of Allotments (Sec. 73.622(b)). Petitions to amend the DTV 
Table (other than those also expressly requesting amendment of this 
section) and applications for new DTV broadcast stations or for changes 
in authorized DTV stations filed pursuant to this section will not be 
accepted for filing if they fail to comply with the requirements of this 
section.
    (b) In considering petitions to amend the DTV Table and applications 
filed pursuant to this section, the Commission will use geographic 
coordinates defined in Sec. 73.622(d) as reference points in determining 
allotment separations and evaluating interference potential.
    (c) Minimum technical criteria for modification of DTV allotments 
included in the initial DTV Table of Allotments and for applications 
filed pursuant to this section. No petition to modify a channel 
allotment included in the initial DTV Table or application for authority 
to construct or modify a DTV station, filed pursuant to this section, 
will be accepted unless it shows compliance with the requirements of 
this paragraph.
    (1) Requests filed pursuant to this paragraph must demonstrate 
compliance with the principal community coverage requirements of 
Sec. 73.625(a).
    (2) Requests filed pursuant to this paragraph must demonstrate that 
there is no increase in the amount of interference caused to any other 
DTV broadcast station, DTV allotment, or analog TV broadcast station. 
For evaluating compliance with this requirement, interference is to be 
predicted based on the procedure set forth in Appendix B of the Sixth 
Report and Order in MM Docket 87-268, FCC 97-115, adopted April 3, 1997, 
including service areas determined in accordance with Sec. 73.622(e), 
consideration of whether F(50,10) undesired signals will exceed the 
following desired-to-undesired (D/U) signal ratios, assumed use of a 
directional receiving antenna, and use of the terrain dependent Longley-
Rice point-to-point propagation model. Guidance for evaluating 
interference using the Longley-Rice methodology is provided in OET 
Bulletin No. 69. Copies of the Sixth Report and Order and OET Bulletin 
No. 69 may be inspected during normal business hours at the: Federal 
Communications Commission, 1919 M St., NW., Dockets Branch (Room 239), 
Washington, DC 20554. These documents are also available through the 
Internet on the FCC Home Page at http://www.fcc.gov. The threshold 
levels at which interference is considered to occur are:

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Note to paragraph (c)(2): The values for co-channel interference to 
DTV service are only valid at locations where the signal-to-noise ratio 
is 28 dB or greater. At the edge of the noise-limited service area, 
where the signal-to-noise ratio is 16 dB, these values are 21 dB and 23 
dB for interference from analog TV and DTV, respectively. Due to the 
frequency spacing that exists between Channels 4 and 5, between Channels 
6 and 7, and between Channels 13 and 14, the minimum adjacent channel 
technical criteria specified in the table shall not be applicable to 
these pairs of channels (see Sec. 73.603(a)).

    (d)(1) Minimum geographic spacing requirements for DTV allotments 
not included in the initial DTV Table of Allotments. No petition to add 
a new channel to the DTV Table of Allotments will be accepted unless it 
demonstrates compliance with the principle community coverage 
requirements of Sec. 73.625(a) and meets the following requirements for 
geographic spacing with regard to all other DTV stations, DTV allotments 
and analog TV stations:

    (f) Negotiated agreements on interference. Notwithstanding the 
minimum technical criteria for DTV allotments specified in paragraph (b) 
of this section, DTV stations operating on allotments that are included 
in the initial DTV Table may operate with increased ERP and/or antenna 
HAAT that would result in additional interference to an analog TV 
station if that station agrees, in writing, to accept the additional 
interference. Such agreements must be submitted with the application for 
authority to construct or modify the DTV station's facilities. The 
larger service area resulting from such a change of ERP and/or antenna 
HAAT will be protected in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 
(c) of this section. Applications submitted pursuant to the provisions 
of this paragraph will be granted only if the Commission finds that such 
action is consistent with the public interest.

<R05>
Sec. 73.624  Digital Television Broadcast Stations.

    (a) Digital television (``DTV'') broadcast stations are assigned 
channels 6 MHz wide. Initial eligibility for licenses for DTV broadcast 
stations is limited to persons that, as of April 3, 1997, are licensed 
to operate a full power television broadcast station or hold a permit to 
construct such a station (or both).
    (b) At any time that a DTV broadcast station permittee or licensee 
transmits a video program signal on its analog television channel, it 
must also transmit at least one over-the-air video program signal at no 
direct charge to viewers on the DTV channel that is licensed with the 
analog channel. The DTV program service provided pursuant to this 
paragraph must be at least comparable in resolution to the analog 
television station programming transmitted to viewers on the analog 
channel but, subject to paragraph (f) of this section, DTV broadcast 
stations are not required to simulcast the analog programming.
    (c) Provided that DTV broadcast stations comply with paragraph (b) 
of this section, DTV broadcast stations are permitted to offer 
telecommunications services of any nature, consistent with the public 
interest, convenience, and necessity, on an ancillary or supplementary 
basis. The kinds of services that may be provided include, but are not 
limited to computer software distribution, data transmissions, teletext, 
interactive materials, aural messages, paging services, audio signals, 
subscription video, and any other services that do not derogate DTV 
broadcast stations' obligations under paragraph (b) of this section. 
Such services may be provided on a broadcast, point-to-point or point-
to-multipoint basis, provided, however, that no video broadcast signal 
provided at no direct charge to viewers shall be considered ancillary or 
supplementary.
    (1) DTV licensees that provide ancillary or supplementary services 
that are analogous to other telecommunications services subject to 
regulation by the Commission must comply with the Commission regulations 
that apply to those services, provided, however, that no ancillary or 
supplementary service shall have any rights to carriage under sections 
614 or 615 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, or be deemed a 
multichannel video programming distributor for purposes of section 628 
of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.
    (2) In all arrangements entered into with outside parties affecting 
telecommunications service operation, the DTV licensee or permittee must 
retain control over all material transmitted in a broadcast mode via the 
station's facilities, with the right to reject any material that it 
deems inappropriate or

[[Page 192]]

undesirable. The license or permittee is also responsible for all 
aspects of technical operation involving such telecommunications 
services.
    (3) In any application for renewal of a broadcast license for a 
television station that provides ancillary or supplementary services, a 
licensee shall establish that all of its program services on the analog 
and the DTV spectrum are in the public interest. Any violation of the 
Commission's rules applicable to ancillary or supplementary services 
will reflect on the licensee's qualifications for renewal of its 
license.
    (d) Digital television broadcast facilities that comply with the FCC 
DTV Standard (section 73.682(d)), shall be constructed in the following 
markets by the following dates:
    (1)(i) May 1, 1999: all network-affiliated television stations in 
the top ten television markets;
    (ii) November 1, 1999: all network-affiliated television stations 
not included in category (1)(i) and in the top 30 television markets;
    (iii) May 1, 2002: all remaining commercial television stations;
    (iv) May 1, 2003: all noncommercial television stations.
    (2) For the purposes of paragraph (d)(1):
    (i) The term, ``network,'' is defined to include the ABC, CBS, NBC, 
and Fox television networks;
    (ii) The term, ``television market,'' is defined as the Designated 
Market Area or DMA as defined by Nielsen Media Research as of April 3, 
1997; and
    (iii) The terms, ``network-affiliated'' or ``network-affiliate,'' 
are defined to include those television stations affiliated with at 
least one of the four networks designated in paragraph (d)(2)(i) as of 
April 3, 1997. In those DMAs in which a network has more than one 
network affiliate, paragraphs (d)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section shall 
apply to its network affiliate with the largest audience share for the 9 
a.m. to midnight time period as measured by Nielsen Media Research in 
its Nielsen Station Index, Viewers in Profile, as of February, 1997.
    (3) Authority delegated. (i) Authority is delegated to the Chief, 
Mass Media Bureau to grant an extension of time of up to six months 
beyond the relevant construction deadline specified in paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section upon demonstration by the DTV licensee or permittee that 
failure to meet that construction deadline is due to circumstances that 
are either unforeseeable or beyond the licensee's control where the 
licensee has taken all reasonable steps to resolve the problem 
expeditiously.
    (ii) Such circumstances shall include, but shall not be limited to: 
(a) inability to construct and place in operation a facility necessary 
for transmitting digital television, such as a tower, because of delays 
in obtaining zoning or FAA approvals, or similar constraints; or (b) the 
lack of equipment necessary to obtain a digital television signal.
    (iii) The Bureau may grant no more than two extension requests upon 
delegated authority. Subsequent extension requests shall be referred to 
the Commission. The Bureau may not on delegated authority deny an 
extension request but must refer recommended denials to the Commission.
    (iv) Applications for extension of time shall be filed at least 30 
days prior to the relevant construction deadline, absent a showing of 
sufficient reasons for filing within less than 30 days of the relevant 
construction deadline.
    (e) The application for construction permit must be filed on Form 
301 (except for noncommercial stations, which must file on Form 340) on 
or before the date on which half of the construction period has elapsed. 
Thus, for example, for applicants in category (d)(1)(i), the application 
for construction period must be filed by May 1, 1998.
    (f)(i) Commencing on April 1, 2003, DTV television licensees and 
permittees must simulcast 50 percent of the video programming of the 
analog channel on the DTV channel.
    (ii) Commencing on April 1, 2004, DTV licensees and permittees must 
simulcast 75% of the video programming of the analog channel on the DTV 
channel.
    (iii) Commencing on April 1, 2005, DTV licensees and permittees must 
simulcast 100% of the video programming of the analog channel on the DTV 
channel.
    (iv) The simulcasting requirements imposed in paragraphs (f) (i)-
(iii) of

[[Page 193]]

this section will terminate when the analog channel terminates operation 
and a 6 MHz channel is returned by the DTV licensee or permittee to the 
Commission.

Sec. 73.625   DTV coverage of principal community and antenna system.

    (a) Transmitter location.
    (1) The DTV transmitter location shall be chosen so that, on the 
basis of the effective radiated power and antenna height above average 
terrain employed, the following minimum F (50,90) field strength in dB 
above one uV/m will be provided over the entire principal community to 
be served:


                                                                        
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Channels 2-6..................................................   L28 dBu
Channels 7-13.................................................    36 dBu
Channels 14-69................................................    41 dBu
                                                                        
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) The location of the antenna must be so chosen that there is not 
a major obstruction in the path over the principal community to be 
served.
    (3) For the purposes of this section, coverage is to be determined 
in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. Under actual 
conditions, the true coverage may vary from these estimates because the 
terrain over any specific path is expected to be different from the 
average terrain on which the field strength charts were based. Further, 
the actual extent of service will usually be less than indicated by 
these estimates due to interference from other stations. Because of 
these factors, the predicted field strength contours give no assurance 
of service to any specific percentage of receiver locations within the 
distances indicated.
    (b) Determining coverage. (1) In predicting the distance to the 
field strength contours, the F (50,50) field strength charts (Figures 9, 
10 and 10b of Sec. 73.699 of this part) and the F (50,10) field strength 
charts (Figures 9a, 10a and 10c of Sec. 73.699 of this part) shall be 
used. To use the charts to predict the distance to a given F (50,90) 
contour, the following procedure is used: Convert the effective radiated 
power in kilowatts for the appropriate azimuth into decibel value 
referenced to 1 kW (dBk). Subtract the power value in dBk from the 
contour value in dBu. Note that for power less than 1 kW, the difference 
value will be greater than the contour value because the power in dBk is 
negative. Locate the difference value obtained on the vertical scale at 
the left edge of the appropriate F (50,50) chart for the DTV station's 
channel. Follow the horizontal line for that value into the chart to the 
point of intersection with the vertical line above the height of the 
antenna above average terrain for the appropriate azimuth located on the 
scale at the bottom of the chart. If the point of intersection does not 
fall exactly on a distance curve, interpolate between the distance 
curves below and above the intersection point. The distance values for 
the curves are located along the right edge of the chart. Using the 
appropriate F (50,10) chart for the DTV station's channel, locate the 
point where the distance coincides with the vertical line above the 
height of the antenna above average terrain for the appropriate azimuth 
located on the scale at the bottom of the chart. Follow a horizontal 
line from that point to the left edge of the chart to determine the F 
(50,10) difference value. Add the power value in dBk to this difference 
value to determine the F (50,10) contour value in dBu. Subtract the F 
(50,50) contour value in dBu from this F (50,10) contour value in dBu. 
Subtract this difference from the F (50,50) contour value in dBu to 
determine the F (50,90) contour value in dBu at the pertinent distance 
along the pertinent radial.
    (2) The effective radiated power to be used is that radiated at the 
vertical angle corresponding to the depression angle between the 
transmitting antenna center of radiation and the radio horizon as 
determined individually for each azimuthal direction concerned. In cases 
where the relative field strength at this depression angle is 90% or 
more of the maximum field strength developed in the vertical plane 
containing the pertaining radial, the maximum radiation shall be used. 
The depression angle is based on the difference in elevation of the 
antenna center of radiation above the average terrain and the radio 
horizon, assuming a smooth

[[Page 194]]

spherical earth with a radius of 8,495.5 kilometers (5,280 miles) and 
shall be determined by the following equation:

A = 0.0277 square root of H
Where:
A is the depression angle in degrees.
H is the height in meters of the transmitting antenna radiation center 
above average terrain of the 3.2-16.1 kilometers (2-10 miles) sector of 
the pertinent radial.
    This formula is empirically derived for the limited purpose 
specified here. Its use for any other purpose may be inappropriate.

    (3) Applicants for new DTV stations or changes in the facilities of 
existing DTV stations must submit to the FCC a showing as to the 
location of their stations' or proposed stations' contour. This showing 
is to include a map showing this contour, except where applicants have 
previously submitted material to the FCC containing such information and 
it is found upon careful examination that the contour locations 
indicated therein would not change, on any radial, when the locations 
are determined under this section. In the latter cases, a statement by a 
qualified engineer to this effect will satisfy this requirement and no 
contour maps need be submitted.
    (4) The antenna height to be used with these charts is the height of 
the radiation center of the antenna above the average terrain along the 
radial in question. In determining the average elevation of the terrain, 
the elevations between 3.2-16.1 kilometers (2-10 miles) from the antenna 
site are employed. Profile graphs shall be drawn for 8 radials beginning 
at the antenna site and extending 16.1 kilometers (10 miles) therefrom. 
The radials should be drawn for each 45 degrees of azimuth starting with 
True North. At least one radial must include the principal community to 
be served even though such community may be more than 16.1 kilometers 
(10 miles) from the antenna site. However, in the event none of the 
evenly spaced radials include the principal community to be served and 
one or more such radials are drawn in addition to the 8 evenly spaced 
radials, such additional radials shall not be employed in computing the 
antenna height above average terrain. Where the 3.2-16.1 kilometers (2-
10 mile) portion of a radial extends in whole or in part over large 
bodies of water (such as ocean areas, gulfs, sounds, bays, large lakes, 
etc., but not rivers) or extends over foreign territory but the contour 
encompasses land area within the United States beyond the 16.1 
kilometers (10 mile) portion of the radial, the entire 3.2-16.1 
kilometers (2-10 mile) portion of the radial shall be included in the 
computation of antenna height above average terrain. However, where the 
contour does not so encompass United States land area and (1) the entire 
3.2-16.1 kilometers (2-10 mile) portion of the radial extends over large 
bodies of water or foreign territory, such radial shall be completely 
omitted from the computation of antenna height above average terrain, 
and (2) where a part of the 3.2-16.1 kilometers (2-10 mile) portion of a 
radial extends over large bodies of water or over foreign territory, 
only that part of the radial extending from the 3.2 kilometer (2 mile) 
sector to the outermost portion of land area within the United States 
covered by the radial shall be employed in the computation of antenna 
height above average terrain. The profile graph for each radial should 
be plotted by contour intervals of from 12.2-30.5 meters (40-100 feet) 
and, where the data permits, at least 50 points of elevation (generally 
uniformly spaced) should be used for each radial. In instances of very 
rugged terrain where the use of contour intervals of 30.5 meters (100 
feet) would result in several points in a short distance, 61.0-122.0 
meter (200-400 foot) contour intervals may be used for such distances. 
On the other hand, where the terrain is uniform or gently sloping the 
smallest contour interval indicated on the topographic map (see 
paragraph (b)(5) of this section) should be used, although only 
relatively few points may be available. The profile graphs should 
indicate the topography accurately for each radial, and the graphs 
should be plotted with the distance in kilometers as the abscissa and 
the elevation in meters above mean sea level as the ordinate. The 
profile graphs should indicate the source of the topographical data 
employed. The graph should also show the elevation of the center of the 
radiating system. The graph may be plotted either on rectangular 
coordinate paper or on special paper which shows the curvature of the 
earth. It is not necessary to take the curvature of the earth into 
consideration in this procedure, as this factor is taken care of in the 
charts showing signal strengths. The average elevation of the 12.9 
kilometer (8 miles) distance between 3.2-16.1 kilometers (2-10 miles) 
from the antenna site should then be determined from the profile graph 
for each radial. This may be obtained by averaging a large number of 
equally spaced points, by using a planimeter, or by obtaining the median 
elevation (that exceeded for 50% of the distance) in sectors and 
averaging those values. In directions where the terrain is such that 
negative antenna heights or heights below 30.5 meters (100 feet) for the 
3.2 to 16.1 kilometers (2 to 10 mile) sector are obtained, an assumed 
height of 30.5 meters (100 feet) shall be used for the prediction of 
coverage. However, where the actual contour distances are critical 
factors, a supplemental showing of expected coverage must be included 
together with a description of the method employed in predicting such 
coverage. In special cases, the Commission may

[[Page 195]]

require additional information as to terrain and coverage.
    (5) In the preparation of the profile graph previously described, 
and in determining the location and height above sea level of the 
antenna site, the elevation or contour intervals shall be taken from the 
United States Geological Survey Topographic Quadrangle Maps, United 
States Army Corps of Engineers' maps or Tennessee Valley Authority maps, 
whichever is the latest, for all areas for which such maps are 
available. If such maps are not published for the area in question, the 
next best topographic information should be used. Topographic data may 
sometimes be obtained from State and Municipal agencies. Data from 
Sectional Aeronautical Charts (including bench marks) or railroad depot 
elevations and highway elevations from road maps may be used where no 
better information is available. In cases where limited topographic data 
is available, use may be made of an altimeter in a car driven along 
roads extending generally radially from the transmitter site. United 
States Geological Survey Topographic Quadrangle Maps may be obtained 
from the United States Geological Survey, Department of the Interior, 
Washington, D.C. 20240. Sectional Aeronautical Charts are available from 
the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, Department of Commerce, 
Washington, D.C. 20235. In lieu of maps, the average terrain elevation 
may be computer generated, except in the cases of dispute, using 
elevations from a 30 second point or better topographic data file. The 
file must be identified and the data processed for intermediate points 
along each radial using linear interpolation techniques. The height 
above mean sea level of the antenna site must be obtained manually using 
appropriate topographic maps.
    (c) Antenna system. (1) The antenna system shall be designed so that 
the effective radiated power at any angle above the horizontal shall be 
as low as the state of the art permits, and in the same vertical plane 
may not exceed the effective radiated power in either the horizontal 
direction or below the horizontal, whichever is greater.
    (2) An antenna designed or altered to produce a noncircular 
radiation pattern in the horizontal plane is considered to be a 
directional antenna. Antennas purposely installed in such a manner as to 
result in the mechanical beam tilting of the major vertical radiation 
lobe are included in this category.
    (3) Applications proposing the use of directional antenna systems 
must be accompanied by the following:
    (i) Complete description of the proposed antenna system, including 
the manufacturer and model number of the proposed directional antenna.
    (ii) Relative field horizontal plane pattern (horizontal 
polarization only) of the proposed directional antenna. A value of 1.0 
should be used for the maximum radiation. The plot of the pattern should 
be oriented so that 0 degrees corresponds to true North. Where 
mechanical beam tilt is intended, the amount of tilt in degrees of the 
antenna vertical axis and the orientation of the downward tilt with 
respect to true North must be specified, and the horizontal plane 
pattern must reflect the use of mechanical beam tilt.
    (iii) A tabulation of the relative field pattern required in 
paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. The tabulation should use the same 
zero degree reference as the plotted pattern, and be tabulated at least 
every 10 degrees. In addition, tabulated values of all maxima and 
minima, with their corresponding azimuths, should be submitted.
    (iv) Horizontal and vertical plane radiation patterns showing the 
effective radiated power, in dBk, for each direction. Sufficient 
vertical plane patterns must be included to indicate clearly the 
radiation characteristics of the antenna above and below the horizontal 
plane. In cases where the angles at which the maximum vertical radiation 
varies with azimuth, a separate vertical radiation pattern must be 
provided for each pertinent radial direction.
    (v) All horizontal plane patterns must be plotted to the largest 
scale possible on unglazed letter-size polar coordinate paper (main 
engraving approximately 18 cm x 25 cm (7 inches x 10 inches)) using only 
scale divisions and subdivisions of 1, 2, 2.5. or 5 times 10-nth. All 
vertical plane patterns must be plotted on unglazed letter-size 
rectangular coordinate paper. Values of field strength on any pattern 
less than 10 percent of the maximum field strength plotted on that 
pattern must be shown on an enlarged scale.
    (vi) The horizontal and vertical plane patterns that are required 
are the patterns for the complete directional antenna system. In the 
case of a composite antenna composed of two or more individual antennas, 
this means that the patterns for the composite antenna, not the patterns 
for each of the individual antennas, must be submitted.
    (4) Where simultaneous use of antennas or antenna structures is 
proposed, the following provisions shall apply:
    (i) In cases where it is proposed to use a tower of an AM broadcast 
station as a supporting structure for a DTV broadcast antenna, an 
appropriate application for changes in the radiating system of the AM 
broadcast station must be filed by the licensee thereof. A formal 
application (FCC Form 301, or FCC Form 340 for a noncommercial 
educational station) will be required if the proposal involves 
substantial change in the physical height or radiation characteristics 
of the AM broadcast antennas; otherwise an informal application will be 
acceptable. (In case of doubt, an informal application (letter) together 
with complete engineering

[[Page 196]]

data should be submitted.) An application may be required for other 
classes of stations when the tower is to be used in connection with a 
DTV station.
    (ii) When the proposed DTV antenna is to be mounted on a tower in 
the vicinity of an AM station directional antenna system and it appears 
that the operation of the directional antenna system may be affected, an 
engineering study must be filed with the DTV application concerning the 
effect of the DTV antenna on the AM directional radiation pattern. Field 
measurements of the AM stations may be required prior to and following 
construction of the DTV station antenna, and readjustments made as 
necessary.

    No television license or renewal of a television license will be 
granted to any person who owns, leases, or controls a particular site 
which is peculiarly suitable for television broadcasting in a particular 
area and (a) which is not available for use by other television 
licensees; and (b) no other comparable site is available in the area; 
and (c) where the exclusive use of such site by the applicant or 
licensee would unduly limit the number of television stations that can 
be authorized in a particular area or would unduly restrict competition 
among television stations.

Sec. 73.642  Subscription TV service.

    (a) Subscription TV service may be provided by:
    (1) Licensees and permittees of commercial TV stations, and
    (2) Licensees and permittees of low power TV stations.
    (b) A licensee or permittee of a commercial TV station or a low 
power TV station may begin subscription TV service upon installation of 
encoding equipment having advance FCC approval. However, the licensee or 
permittee of a TV broadcast station (not applicable to low power TV 
stations) must send a letter to the FCC in Washington, DC, that 
subscription TV service will commence at least 30 days prior to 
commencement of such service. In that letter, to be entitled ``Notice of 
Commencement of STV Operations,'' the licensee or permittee is to state 
that it will comply with the provisions of paragraphs (e)(1) through 
(e)(3) and Sec. 73.644(c) of this chapter and identify the make and type 
of encoding system to be used. A similar notice must be submitted if the 
licensee or permittee commences using another type of encoding system. 
(See section 644(h).) A notice must also be submitted to the FCC in 
Washington, DC, if encoded subscription TV service is to be 
discontinued, at least 30 days prior to such discontinuance.
    (c) The station proof of system compliance measurement data (see 
Sec. 73.644(c)) need not be submitted to the FCC, however, the 
measurement data must be available to the FCC upon request.
    (d) The use of the visual vertical blanking interval or an aural 
subcarrier for transmitting subscriber decoder control code signals 
during periods of normal non-encoded programming may be used only upon 
specific FCC authorization. Letter requests to use either the video 
blanking intervals or aural subcarriers during periods of non-
subscription programming are to be sent to the FCC in Washington, D.C.
    (e) A licensee or permittee of a commercial TV broadcast or low 
power TV station may not transmit a subscription service if it has a 
contract, arrangement, or understanding, expressed or implied, that:
    (1) Prevents or hinders it from rejecting or refusing any 
subscription TV broadcast program that it reasonably believes to be 
unsatisfactory or unsuitable or contrary to the public interests; or 
substituting a subscription or conventional program that, in its 
opinion, is of greater local or national importance; or

[[Page 197]]

    (2) Delegates to any other person the right to schedule the hours of 
transmission of subscription programs. However, this rule does not 
prevent a licensee or permittee from entering into an agreement or 
arrangement whereby it agrees to schedule a specific subscription TV 
broadcast program at a specific time or to schedule a specific number of 
hours of subscription programs during the broadcast day (or segments 
thereof) or weeks; or
    (3) Deprives it of the right of ultimate decision concerning the 
maximum amount of any subscription program charge or fee.
    (4) Has provisions that do not comply with the following policies of 
the FCC:
    (i) Unless a satifactory signal is unavailable at the location where 
service is desired, subscription TV service must be provided to all 
persons desiring it within the Grade A contour of the station 
broadcasting subscription programs. Geographic or other reasonable 
patterns of installation for new subscription services is permitted and, 
for good cause, service may be terminated.
    (ii) Charges, terms and conditions of service to subscribers must be 
applied uniformly. However, subscribers may be divided into reasonable 
classifications approved by the FCC, and the impositions of different 
sets of terms and conditions may be applied to subscribers in different 
classifications. Further, for good cause, within such classification, 
deposits may be required from some subscribers and not of others; and, 
also for good cause, if a subscription system generally uses a credit-
type decoder, cash operated decoders may be installed for some 
subscribers.

<R05>
Sec. 73.644  Subscription TV transmission systems.

    (a) Licensees and permittees of commercial TV broadcast and low 
power TV stations may conduct subscription operations only by using an 
encoding system that has been approved in advance by the FCC. Such 
advance approval may be applied for and granted in accordance with the 
procedures given in Subpart M Part 2 of the Rules.
    (b) The criteria for advance approval of subscription TV 
transmitting systems by the FCC are as follows:
    (1) Spectral energy in the transmitted signal must not exceed the 
limitations given in Sec. 73.687(e).
    (2) No increase in width of the television broadcast channel (6 
MHz.) is permitted.
    (3) The technical system must enable stations to transmit encoded 
subscription TV programs without increasing the RMS output power from 
either the video or audio transmitters over that required to transmit 
the same program material using normal transmission standards.
    (4) Modification of a type accepted TV broadcast or low power TV 
transmitter for encoded transmissions must not render transmitter 
incapable of operating in accordance with the operating specifications 
upon which type acceptance was granted. (See Sec. 2.1001 (b), (k))
    (5) Interference to reception of conventional television either of 
co-channel or adjacent channel stations must not increase over that 
resulting from the transmission of programming with normal transmission 
standards.
    (6) Subscriber decoder devices must meet the provisions, where 
required, of Subpart H of Part 15 of the FCC Rules for TV Interface 
Devices.
    (c) Prior to commencing the transmission of encoded subscription 
programming, the licensee or permittee of a TV broadcast or low power TV 
station must perform such tests and measurements to determine that the 
transmitted encoded signal conforms to the radiated radio frequency and 
demodulated baseband and waveforms, transmitter operating power 
determination, and the occupied bandwidth limitations specified in the 
application for advance FCC approval of the system

[[Page 198]]

being used. A copy of the measurement data is to be maintained in the 
station files and made available to the FCC upon request.
    (d) The licensee of a station transmitting an encoded subscription 
service must have at the transmitter control point the technical 
specifications for the system being used of both the aural and visual 
baseband signals and the transmitted radiofrequency signals, and have 
the necessary measuring and monitoring equipment, including transmitter 
output power measuring equipment, to determine that the transmissions 
conform to the advance approval specifications on file with the FCC. 
Full operating specifications for the system must be available to 
representatives of the FCC upon request.
    (e) The operating power of the transmitters during encoded 
operations must be determined and maintained according to the procedures 
given in the application for advance approval.
    (f) A station using an encoding system in accordance with the 
specifications filed with the application for advance approval is deemed 
to be exempted from those technical regulations of this Subpart and 
Subpart H to the extent they are specifically detailed in the 
application.
    (g) No protection from interference of any kind will be afforded to 
reception of encoded subscription programming over that afforded 
reception of non-encoded signals.
    (h) A licensee or permittee may make no modifications on a 
subscription encoding system that would alter the characteristics of the 
transmitted aural or visual signal from those specified in the 
application for advance approval. A licensee or permittee of a station 
replacing its encoding system must perform the measurements required by 
paragraph (c) of this section. A TV broadcast station licensee or 
permittee must also send a letter advising the FCC of the new system 
being used as required by Sec. 73.642(b) of this chapter.
    (i) The station licensee is fully responsible for all technical 
operations of the station during transmissions of encoded subscription 
programming, regardless of the supplier of the encoding equipment or 
subscription program service.

    Note: Stations transmitting encoded subscription programming prior 
to October 1, 1983, must comply with all technical and operating 
requirements of this Section no later than April 1, 1984. Stations not 
having the information to comply with this Section must obtain such 
information from the manufacturer of the encoding system being used, and 
if necessary, by measurements of the station's transmission system.

    (j) Upon request by an authorized representative of the FCC, the 
licensee of a TV station transmitting encoded programming must make 
available a receiving decoder to the Commission to carry out its 
regulatory responsibilities.

Sec. 73.646  Telecommunications Service on the Vertical Blanking Interval and in the Visual Signal.

    (a) Telecommunications services permitted on the vertical blanking 
interval (VBI) and in the visual signal include the transmission of 
data, processed information, or any other communication in either a 
digital or analog mode.
    (b) Telecommunications service on the VBI and in the visual signal 
is of an ancillary nature and as such is an elective, subsidiary 
activity. No service guidelines, limitations, or performance standards 
are applied to it. The kinds of service that may be provided include, 
but are not limited to, teletext, paging, computer software and bulk 
data distribution, and aural messages. Such services may be provided on 
a broadcast, point-to-point, or point to multipoint basis.
    (c) Telecommunications services that are common carrier in nature 
are subject to common carrier regulation. Licensees operating such 
services are required to apply to the Commission for the appropriate 
authorization and to comply with all policies and rules applicable to 
the particular service.
    (d) Television licensees are authorized to lease their VBI and 
visual signal telecommunications facilities to outside parties. In all 
arrangements entered into with outside parties affecting 
telecommunications service operation, the licensee or permittee must

[[Page 199]]

retain control over all material transmitted in a broadcast mode via the 
station's facilities, with the right to reject any material that it 
deems inappropriate or undesirable. The licensee or permittee is also 
responsible for all aspects of technical operation involving such 
telecommunications services.
    (e) The grant or renewal of a TV station license or permit will not 
be furthered or promoted by proposed or past VBI or visual signal 
telecommunications service operation; the licensee must establish that 
its broadcast operation serves the public interest wholly apart from 
such telecommunications service activities. (Violation of rules 
applicable to VBI and visual signal telecommunications services could, 
of course, reflect on a licensee's qualifications to hold its license or 
permit.)
    (f) TV broadcast stations are authorized to transmit VBI and visual 
telecommunications service signals during any time period, including 
portions of the day when normal programming is not broadcast. Such 
transmissions must be in accordance with the technical provisions of 
Sec. 73.682.

<R05>
Sec. 73.658  Affiliation agreements and network program practices; territorial exclusivity in non-network program arrangements.

    (a) Exclusive affiliation of station. No license shall be granted to 
a television broadcast station having any contract, arrangement, or 
understanding, express or implied, with a network organization under 
which the station is prevented or hindered from, or penalized for, 
broadcasting the programs of any other network organization. (The term 
``network organization'' as used in this section includes national and 
regional network organizations. See ch. VII, J, of Report on Chain 
Broadcasting.)
    (b) Territorial exclusively. No license shall be granted to a 
television broadcast station having any contract, arrangement, or 
understanding, express or implied, with a network organization which 
prevents or hinders another broadcast station located in the same 
community from broadcasting the network's programs not taken by the 
former station, or which prevents or hinders another broadcast station 
located in a different community from broadcasting any program of the 
network organization. This section shall not be construed to prohibit 
any contract, arrangement, or understanding between a station and a 
network organization pursuant to which the station is granted the first 
call in its community upon the programs of the network organization. As 
employed in this paragraph, the term ``community'' is defined as the 
community specified in the instrument of authorization as the location 
of the station.
    (c)  [Reserved]
    (d) Station commitment of broadcast time. No license shall be 
granted to a television broadcast station having any contract, 
arrangement, or understanding, express or implied, with any network 
organization, which provides for optioning of the station's time to the 
network organization, or which has the same restraining effect as time 
optioning. As used in this section, time optioning is any contract, 
arrangement, or understanding, express or implied, between a station and 
a network organization which prevents or hinders the station from 
scheduling programs before the network agrees to utilize the time during 
which such programs are scheduled, or which requires the station to 
clear time already scheduled when the network organization seeks to 
utilize the time.
    (e) Right to reject programs. No license shall be granted to a 
television broadcast station having any contract, arrangement, or 
understanding, express or implied, with a network organization which, 
with respect to programs offered or already contracted for pursuant to 
an affiliation contract, prevents or hinders the station from:

[[Page 200]]

    (1) Rejecting or refusing network programs which the station 
reasonably believes to be unsatisfactory or unsuitable or contrary to 
the public interest, or
    (2) Substituting a program which, in the station's opinion, is of 
greater local or national importance.
    (f)  [Reserved]
    (g) Dual network operation. A television broadcast station may 
affiliate with a person or entity that maintains two or more networks of 
television broadcast stations unless such dual or multiple networks are 
composed of:
    (1) Two or more persons or entities that, on February 8, 1996, were 
``networks.'' For the purposes of this paragraph, the term network means 
any person, entity, or corporation which offers an interconnected 
program service on a regular basis for 15 or more hours per week to at 
least 25 affiliated television licensees in 10 or more states; and/or 
any person, entity, or corporation controlling, controlled by, or under 
common control with such person, entity, or corporation; or
    (2) Any network described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section and an 
English-language program distribution service that, on February 8, 1996, 
provided four or more hours of programming per week on a national basis 
pursuant to network affiliation arrangements with local television 
broadcast stations in markets reaching more than 75 percent of 
television homes (as measured by a national ratings service).
    (h) Control by networks of station rates. No license shall be 
granted to a television broadcast station having any contract, 
arrangement, or understanding, express or implied, with a network 
organization under which the station is prevented or hindered from, or 
penalized for, fixing or altering its rates for the sale of broadcast 
time for other than the network's programs.
    (i) No license shall be granted to a television broadcast station 
which is represented for the sale of non-network time by a network 
organization or by an organization directly or indirectly controlled by 
or under common control with a network organization, if the station has 
any contract, arrangement or understanding, express or implied, which 
provides for the affiliation of the station with such network 
organization: Provided, however, That this rule shall not be applicable 
to stations licensed to a network organization or to a subsidiary of a 
network organization.
    (j)--(l)  [Reserved]
    (m) Territorial exclusivity in non-network arrangements. (1) No 
television station shall enter into any contract, arrangement, or 
understanding, expressed or implied; with a non-network program 
producer, distributor, or supplier, or other person; which prevents or 
hinders another television station located in a community over 56.3 
kilometers (35 miles) away, as determined by the reference points 
contained in Sec. 76.53 of this chapter, (if reference points for a 
community are not listed in Sec. 76.53, the location of the main post 
office will be used) from broadcasting any program purchased by the 
former station from such non-network program producer, distributor, 
supplier, or other person, except that a television station may secure 
exclusivity against a television station licensed to another designated 
community in a hyphenated market specified in the market listing as 
contained in Sec. 76.51 of this chapter for those 100 markets listed, 
and for markets not listed in Sec. 76.51 of this chapter, the listing as 
contained in the ARB Television Market Analysis for the most recent year 
at the time that the exclusivity contract, arrangement or understanding 
is complete under practices of the industry. As used in this paragraph, 
the term ``community'' is defined as the community specified in the 
instrument of authorization as the location of the station.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (m)(1) of this section, a television 
station may enter into a contract, arrangement, or understanding with a 
producer, supplier, or distributor of a non-network program if that 
contract, arrangement, or understanding provides that the broadcast 
station has exclusive national rights such that no other television 
station in the United States may broadcast the program.

    Note 1: Contracts, arrangements, or understandings that are complete 
under the practices of the industry prior to August 7, 1973, will not be 
disturbed. Extensions or renewals

[[Page 201]]

of such agreements are not permitted because they would in effect be new 
agreements without competitive bidding. However, such agreements that 
were based on the broadcaster's advancing ``seed money'' for the 
production of a specific program or series that specify two time 
periods--a tryout period and period thereafter for general exhibition--
may be extended or renewed as contemplated in the basic agreement.

    Note 2: It is intended that the top 100 major television markets 
listed in Sec. 76.51 of this chapter shall be used for the purposes of 
this rule and that the listing of the top 100 television markets 
appearing in the ARB Television Market Analysis shall not be used. The 
reference in this rule to the listing of markets in the ARB Television 
Market Analysis refers to hyphenated markets below the top-100 markets 
contained in the ARB Television Market Analysis. If a community is 
listed in a hyphenated market in Sec. 76.51 and is also listed in one of 
the markets in the ARB listing, the listing in Sec. 76.51 shall govern.

    Note 3: The provisions of this paragraph apply only to U.S. 
commercial television broadcast stations in the 50 states, and not to 
stations in Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands, foreign stations or 
noncommercial educational television or ``public'' television stations 
(either by way of restrictions on their exclusivity or on exclusivity 
against them).

    Note 4: New stations authorized in any community of a hyphenated 
market listed in Sec. 76.51 of this chapter or in any community of a 
hyphenated market listed in the ARB Television Market Analysis (for 
markets below the top-100 markets) are subject to the same rules as 
previously existing stations therein. New stations authorized in other 
communities are considered stations in separate markets unless and until 
Sec. 76.51 is amended by Commission action, or the ARB listing is 
changed.

Secs. 73.659--73.663  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 73.664  Determining operating power.

    (a) The operating power of each TV visual transmitter shall normally 
be determined by the direct method.
    (b) Direct method, visual transmitter. The direct method of power 
determination for a TV visual transmitter uses the indications of a 
calibrated transmission line meter (responsive to peak power) located at 
the RF output terminals of the transmitter. The indications of the 
calibrated meter are used to observe and maintain the authorized 
operating power of the visual transmitter. This meter must be calibrated 
whenever any component in the metering circuit is repaired or replaced 
and as often as necessary to ensure operation in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 73.1560 of this part. The following calibration 
procedures are to be used:
    (1) The transmission line meter is calibrated by measuring the 
average power at the output terminals of the transmitter, including any 
vestigial sideband and harmonic filters which may be used in normal 
operation. For this determination the average power output is measured 
while operating into a dummy load of substantially zero reactance and a 
resistance equal to the transmission line characteristic impedance. 
During this measurement the transmitter is to be modulated only by a 
standard synchronizing signal with blanking level set at 75% of peak 
amplitude as observed in an output waveform monitor, and with this 
blanketing level amplitude maintained throughout the time interval 
between synchronizing pulses.
    (2) If electrical devices are used to determine the output power, 
such devices must permit determination of this power to within an 
accuracy of <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5% of the power indicated by the full 
scale reading of the electrical indicating instrument of the device. If 
temperature and coolant flow indicating devices are used to determine 
the power output, such devices must permit determination of this power 
to within an accuracy of <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>4% of measured average 
power output. The peak power output is the power so measured in the 
dummy load multiplied by the factor 1.68. During this measurement the 
input voltage and current to the final radio frequency amplifier stage 
and the transmission line meter are to be read and compared with similar 
readings taken with the dummy load replaced by the antenna. These 
readings must be in substantial agreement.
    (3) The meter must be calibrated with the transmitter operating at 
80%, 100%, and 110% of the authorized power

[[Page 202]]

as often as may be necessary to maintain its accuracy and ensure correct 
transmitter operating power. In cases where the transmitter is incapable 
of operating at 110% of the authorized power output, the calibration may 
be made at a power output between 100% and 110% of the authorized power 
output. However, where this is done, the output meter must be marked at 
the point of calibration of maximum power output, and the station will 
be deemed to be in violation of this rule if that power is exceeded. The 
upper and lower limits of permissible power deviation as determined by 
the prescribed calibration, must be shown upon the meter either by means 
of adjustable red markers incorporated in the meter or by red marks 
placed upon the meter scale or glass face. These markings must be 
checked and changed, if necessary, each time the meter is calibrated.
    (c) Indirect method, visual transmitter. The operating power is 
determined by the indirect method by applying an appropriate factor to 
the input power to the final radio-frequency amplifier stage of the 
transmitter using the following formula:

    Transmitter output power=Ep x Ip x F

    Where:

Ep=DC input voltage of the final radio-frequency amplifier stage.
Ip=DC input current of the final radio-frequency amplifier stage.
F=Efficiency factor.

    (1) If the above formula is not appropriate for the design of the 
transmitter final amplifier, use a formula specified by the transmitter 
manufacturer with other appropriate operating parameters.
    (2) The value of the efficiency factor, F established for the 
authorized transmitter output power is to be used for maintaining the 
operating power, even though there may be some variation in F over the 
power operating range of the transmitter.
    (3) The value of F is to be determined and a record kept thereof by 
one of the following procedures listed in order of preference:
    (i) Using the most recent measurement data for calibration of the 
transmission line meter according to the procedures described in 
paragraph (b) of this section or the most recent measurements made by 
the licensee establishing the value of F. In the case of composite 
transmitters or those in which the final amplifier stages have been 
modified pursuant to FCC approval, the licensee must furnish the FCC and 
also retain with the station records the measurement data used as a 
basis for determining the value of F.
    (ii) Using measurement data shown on the transmitter manufacturer's 
test data supplied to the licensee, provided that measurements were made 
at the authorized carrier frequency and transmitter output power.
    (iii) Using the transmitter manufacturer's measurement data 
submitted to the FCC for type acceptance as shown in the instruction 
book supplied to the licensee.

    Note: Refer to Sec. 73.1560 for aural transmitter output power 
levels.

[49 FR 18105, Apr. 27, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 73.667  TV subsidiary communications services.

    (a) Subsidiary communications services are those transmitted within 
the TV aural baseband signal, but do not include services which enhance 
the main program broadcast service or exclusively relate to station 
operations (see Sec. 73.665(a), (b), and (c)). Subsidiary communications 
include, but are not limited to, services such as functional music, 
specialized foreign language programs, radio reading services, utility 
load management, market and financial data and news, paging and calling, 
traffic control signal switching, and point-to-point or multipoint 
messages.
    (b) TV subsidiary communications services that are common carrier or 
private radio in nature are subject to common carrier or private radio 
regulation. Licensees operating such services are required to apply to 
the FCC for the appropriate authorization and to comply with all 
policies and rules applicable to the service. Responsibility for making 
the initial determinations of whether a particular activity requires 
separate authority rests with the TV station licensee or permittee. 
Initial determinations by licensees or permittees are subject to FCC 
examination and may be reviewed at the FCC's discretion.
    (c) Subsidiary communications services are of a secondary nature 
under the authority of the TV station authorization, and the authority 
to provide such communications services may not be retained or 
transferred in any manner separate from the station's authorization. The 
grant or renewal of a TV station permit or license is not furthered or 
promoted by proposed or past subsidiary communications services. The 
permittee or licensee must establish that the broadcast operation is in 
the public interest wholly apart from the subsidiary communications 
services provided.
    (d) The station identification, delayed recording, and sponsor 
identification announcement required by Secs. 73.1201, 73.1208, and 
73.1212 are not applicable to leased communications services transmitted 
via services that are not of a general broadcast nature.
    (e) The licensee or permittee must retain control over all material 
transmitted in a broadcast mode via the station's facilities, with the 
right to reject any material that it deems inappropriate or undesirable.

<R05>
Sec. 73.669  TV stereophonic aural and multiplex subcarrier operation.

    (a) A TV broadcast station may without specific authority from the 
FCC, transmit multichannel aural programs upon installation of 
multichannel sound equipment. Prior to commencement of multichannel 
broadcasting, the equipment shall be measured in accordance with 
Sec. 73.1690(e).
    (b) Multiplex subcarriers may be used by a TV station pursuant to 
the provisions of Sec. 73.665 and may be transmitted on a secondary, 
non-interference basis to broadcast programming without specific 
authority from the FCC. Transmissions must be conducted in accordance 
with the technical standards given in Sec. 73.682(c).
    (c) In all arrangements entered into with outside parties affecting 
non-common carrier subcarrier operation, the licensee or permittee must 
retain control over all material transmitted over the station's 
facilities, with the right to reject any material which is deemed 
inappropriate or undesirable. Subchannel leasing arrangements must be 
kept in writing at the station and made available to the FCC upon 
request.

<R05>
Sec. 73.671  Educational and informational programming for children.

    (a) Each commercial and noncommercial educational television 
broadcast station licensee has an obligation to serve, over the term of 
its license, the educational and informational needs of children through 
both the licensee's overall programming and programming specifically 
designed to serve such needs.
    (b) Any special nonbroadcast efforts which enhance the value of 
children's educational and informational television programming, and any 
special effort to produce or support educational and informational 
television programming by another station in the licensee's marketplace, 
may also contribute to meeting the licensee's obligation to serve, over 
the term of its license, the educational and informational needs of 
children.
    (c) For purposes of this section, educational and informational 
television programming is any television programming that furthers the 
educational and informational needs of children 16 years of age and 
under in any respect, including the child's intellectual/cognitive or 
social/emotional needs. Programming specifically designed to serve the 
educational and informational needs of children (``Core Programming'') 
is educational and informational programming that satisfies the 
following additional criteria:
    (1) It has serving the educational and informational needs of 
children ages 16 and under as a significant purpose;
    (2) It is aired between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.;
    (3) It is a regularly scheduled weekly program;
    (4) It is at least 30 minutes in length;
    (5) The educational and informational objective and the target child 
audience are specified in writing in the licensee's Children's 
Television Programming Report, as described in Sec. 73.3526(a)(8)(iii); 
and
    (6) Instructions for listing the program as educational/
informational, including an indication of the age group for which the 
program is intended, are provided by the licensee to publishers of 
program guides, as described in Sec. 73.673(b).

    Note 1 to Sec. 73.671: For purposes of determining under this 
section whether programming has a significant purpose of serving the 
educational and informational needs of children, the Commission will 
ordinarily rely on the good faith judgments of the licensee. Commission 
review of compliance with that element of the definition will be done 
only as a last resort.
    Note 2 to Sec. 73.671: The Commission will use the following 
processing guideline in assessing whether a television broadcast 
licensee has complied with the Children's Television Act of 1990 
(``CTA''). A licensee that has aired at least three hours per week of 
Core Programming (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section and as 
averaged over a six month period) will be deemed to have satisfied its 
obligation to air such programming and shall have the CTA portion of its 
license renewal application approved by the Commission staff. A licensee 
will also be deemed to have satisfied this obligation and be eligible 
for such staff approval if the licensee demonstrates that it has aired a 
package of different types of educational and informational programming 
that, while containing somewhat less than three hours per week of Core 
Programming, demonstrates a level of commitment to educating and 
informing children that is at least equivalent to airing three hours per 
week of Core Programming. In this regard, specials, PSAs, short-form 
programs, and regularly scheduled non-weekly programs with a significant 
purpose of educating and informing children can count toward the three 
hour per week processing guideline. Licensees that do not meet these 
processing guidelines will be referred to the Commission, where they 
will have full opportunity to demonstrate compliance with the CTA (e.g., 
by relying in part on sponsorship of core educational/informational 
programs on other stations in the market that increases the amount of 
core educational and informational programming on the station airing the 
sponsored program and/or on special nonbroadcast efforts which enhance 
the value of children's educational and informational television 
programming).

Sec. 73.681  Definitions.

    Amplitude modulation (AM). A system of modulation in which the 
envelope of the transmitted wave contains a component similar to the 
wave form of the signal to be transmitted.
    Antenna electrical beam tilt. The shaping of the radiation pattern 
in the vertical plane of a transmitting antenna by electrical means so 
that maximum radiation occurs at an angle below the horizontal plane.

heights above the terrain from approximately 3.2 (2 miles) to 16.1 
kilometers (10 miles) from the antenna for the eight directions spaced 
evenly for each 45 degrees of azimuth starting with True North. (In 
general, a different antenna height will be determined in each direction 
from the antenna. The average of these various heights is considered the 
antenna height above the average terrain. In some cases less than 8 
directions may be used. See Sec. 73.684(d)). Where circular or 
elliptical polarization is employed, the antenna height above average 
terrain shall be based upon the height of the radiation center of the 
antenna which transmits the horizontal component of radiation.
    Antenna mechanical beam tilt. The intentional installation of a 
transmitting antenna so that its axis is not vertical, in order to 
change the normal angle of maximum radiation in the vertical plane.
    Antenna power gain. The square of the ratio of the root-mean-square 
free space field strength produced at 1 kilometer in the horizontal 
plane, in millivolts per meter for one kW antenna input power to 221.4 
mV/m. This ratio should be expressed in decibels (dB). (If specified for 
a particular direction, antenna power gain is based on the field 
strength in that direction only.)

short periods without prior Commission authorization or notice to the 
Commission while the main facility is not in operation (e.g., where 
tower work necessitates turning off the main antenna or where lightning 
has caused damage to the main antenna or transmission system) (See 
Sec. 73.1675).

multichannel television sound transmission and audio processing as 
defined in FCC Bulletin OET 60.

separately to the horizontally and vertically polarized components of 
radiation. For assignment purposes, only the effective radiated power 
authorized for the horizontally polarized component will be considered.
    Equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP). The term 
``equivalent isotropically radiated power'' (also known as ``effective 
radiated power above isotropic'') means the product of the antenna input 
power and the antenna gain in a given direction relative to an isotropic 
antenna.
    Field. Scanning through the picture area once in the chosen scanning 
pattern. In the line interlaced scanning pattern of two to one, the 
scanning of the alternate lines of the picture area once.

frequency.
    IRE standard scale. A linear scale for measuring, in IRE units, the 
relative amplitudes of the components of a television signal from a zero 
reference at blanking level, with picture information falling in the 
positive, and synchronizing information in the negative domain.

    Note: When a carrier is amplitude modulated by a television signal 
in accordance with Sec. 73.682, the relationship of the IRE standard 
scale to the conventional measure of modulation is as follows:

Sec. 73.682  TV transmission standards.

    (a) Transmission standards. (1) The width of the television 
broadcast channel shall be 6 MHz.
    (2) The visual carrier frequency shall be nominally 1.25 MHz above 
the lower boundary of the channel.
    (3) The aural center frequency shall be 4.5 MHz higher than the 
visual carrier frequency.
    (4) The visual transmission amplitude characteristic shall be in 
accordance with the chart designated as Figure 5 of Sec. 73.699: 
Provided, however, That for stations operating on Channel 15 through 69 
and employing a transmitter with maximum peak visual power output of 1 
kW or less the visual transmission amplitude characteristic may be in 
accordance with the chart designated as Figure 5a of Sec. 73.699.
    (5) The chrominance subcarrier frequency is 63/88 times precisely 5 
MHz (3.57954545 . . . MHz). The tolerance is <SUP>plus-minus</SUP> 10 Hz 
and the rate of frequency drift must not exceed 0.1 Hz per second 
(cycles per second squared).
    (6) For monochrome and color transmissions the number of scanning 
lines per frame shall be 525, interlaced two to one in successive 
fields. The horizontal scanning frequency shall be 2/455 times the 
chrominance subcarrier frequency; this corresponds nominally to 15,750 
Hz with an actual value of 15,734.264 <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.044 Hz). 
The vertical scanning frequency is 2/525 times the horizontal scanning 
frequency; this corresponds nominally to 60 Hz (the actual value is 
59.94 Hz). For monochrome transmissions only, the nominal values of line 
and field frequencies may be used.
    (7) The aspect ratio of the transmitted television picture shall be 
4 units horizontally to 3 units vertically.
    (8) During active scanning intervals, the scene shall be scanned 
from left to right horizontally and from top to bottom vertically, at 
uniform velocities.
    (9) A carrier shall be modulated within a single television channel 
for both picture and synchronizing signals. The two signals comprise 
different modulation ranges in amplitude in accordance with the 
following:
    (i) Monochrome transmissions shall comply with synchronizing 
waveform specifications in Figure 7 of Sec. 73.699.
    (ii) Color transmissions shall comply with the synchronizing 
waveform specifications in Figure 6 of Sec. 73.699.
    (iii) All stations operating on Channels 2 through 14 and those 
stations operating on Channels 15 through 69 licensed for a peak visual 
transmitter output power greater than one kW shall comply with the 
picture transmission amplitude characteristics shown in Figure 5 of 
Sec. 73.699.
    (iv) Stations operating on Channels 15 through 69 licensed for a 
peak visual transmitter output power of one kW or less shall comply with 
the picture transmission amplitude characteristic shown in Figure 5 or 
5a of Sec. 73.699.
    (10) A decrease in initial light intensity shall cause an increase 
in radiated power (negative transmission).
    (11) The reference black level shall be represented by a definite 
carrier level, independent of light and shade in the picture.
    (12) The blanking level shall be transmitted at 
75<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2.5 percent of the peak carrier level.
    (13) The reference white level of the luminance signal shall be 
12.5<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2.5 percent of the peak carrier level.
    (14) It shall be standard to employ horizontal polarization. 
However, circular or elliptical polarization may be employed if desired, 
in which case clockwise (right hand) rotation, as defined in the IEEE 
Standard Definition 42A65-3E2, and transmission of the horizontal and 
vertical components in time and space quadrature shall be used. For 
either omnidirectional or directional antennas the licensed effective 
radiated power of the vertically polarized component may not exceed the 
licensed effective radiated power of the horizontally polarized 
component. For directional antennas, the maximum effective radiated 
power of the vertically polarized component shall not exceed the maximum 
effective radiated power of the horizontally polarized component in any 
specified horizontal or vertical direction.
    (15) The effective radiated power of the aural transmitter must not 
exceed 22% of the peak radiated power of the visual transmitter.
    (16) The peak-to-peak variation of transmitter output within one 
frame of

[[Page 209]]

video signal due to all causes, including hum, noise, and low-frequency 
response, measured at both scanning synchronizing peak and blanking 
level, shall not exceed 5 percent of the average scanning synchronizing 
peak signal amplitude. This provision is subject to change but is 
considered the best practice under the present state of the art. It will 
not be enforced pending a further determination thereof.
    (17) The reference black level shall be separated from the blanking 
level by the setup interval, which shall be 7.5<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2.5 
percent of the video range from blanking level to the reference white 
level.
    (18) For monochrome transmission, the transmitter output shall vary 
in substantially inverse logarithmic relation to the brightness of the 
subject. No tolerances are set at this time. This provision is subject 
to change but is considered the best practice under the present state of 
the art. It will not be enforced pending a further determination 
thereof.
    (19) The color picture signal shall correspond to a luminance 
component transmitted as amplitude modulation of the picture carrier and 
a simultaneous pair of chrominance components transmitted as the 
amplitude modulation sidebands of a pair of suppressed subcarriers in 
quadrature.
    (20) Equation of complete color signal.
    (i) The color picture signal has the following composition:

            E<INF>M</INF>=E<INF>Y</INF>'+[E<INF>Q</INF>' sin 
     (<greek-oh>t+33 deg.)+E<INF>I</INF>' cos (<greek-oh>t+33 deg.)]

For color-difference frequencies below 500 kHz (see (iii) below), the 
signal can be represented by:

               E<INF>M</INF>=E<INF>Y</INF>'+[(1/1.14)[(1/
                1.78)(E<INF>B</INF>'-E<INF>Y</INF>') sin 
      <greek-oh>t+(E<INF>R</INF>'-E<INF>Y</INF>') cos <greek-oh>t]]

    (ii) The symbols in paragraph (a)(20)(i) of this section have the 
following significance:
    E<INF>M</INF> is the total video voltage, corresponding to the 
scanning of a particular picture element, applied to the modulator of 
the picture transmitter.
    E<INF>Y</INF>' is the gamma-corrected voltage of the monochrome 
(black-and-white) portion of the color picture signal, corresponding to 
the given picture element.

    Note: Forming of the high frequency portion of the monochrome signal 
in a different manner is permissible and may in fact be desirable in 
order to improve the sharpness on saturated colors.

    E<INF>Q</INF>' and E<INF>I</INF>' are the amplitudes of two 
orthogonal components of the chrominance signal corresponding 
respectively to narrow-band and wide-band axes.
    E<INF>R</INF>', E<INF>G</INF>', and E<INF>B</INF>' are the gamma-
corrected voltages corresponding to red, green, and blue signals during 
the scanning of the given picture element.
    <greek-oh> is the angular frequency and is 2 times the frequency of 
the chrominance subcarrier.
    The portion of each expression between brackets in (i) represents 
the chrominance subcarrier signal which carries the chrominance 
information.
    The phase reference in the E<INF>M</INF> equation in (i) is the 
phase of the burst+180 deg., as shown in Figure 8 of Sec. 73.699. The 
burst corresponds to amplitude modulation of a continuous sine wave.

    (iii) The equivalent bandwidth assigned prior to modulation to the 
color difference signals E<INF>Q</INF>' and E<INF>I</INF>' are as 
follows:

Q-channel bandwidth:
    At 400 kHz less than 2 dB down.
    At 500 kHz less than 6 dB down.
    At 600 kHz at least 6 dB down.
I-channel bandwidth:
    At 1.3 MHz less than 2 dB down.
    At 3.6 MHz at least 20 dB down.

    (iv) The gamma corrected voltages E<INF>R</INF>', E<INF>G</INF>', 
and E<INF>B</INF>' are suitable for a color picture tube having primary 
colors with the following chromaticities in the CIE system of 
specification:

                                                                        
                                                                        
                                                             x       y  
                                                                        
Red (R).................................................    0.67    0.33
Green (G)...............................................    0.21    0.71
Blue (B)................................................    0.14    0.08
                                                                        


and having a transfer gradient (gamma exponent) of 2.2 associated with 
each primary color. The voltages E<INF>R</INF>', E<INF>G</INF>', and 
E<INF>B</INF>' may be respectively of the form E<INF>R</INF> 
<SUP>1</SUP>/<greek-g>, E<INF>G</INF> <SUP>1</SUP>/<greek-g>, and 
E<INF>B</INF> <SUP>1</SUP>/<greek-g> although other forms may be used 
with advances in the state of the art.

    Note: At the present state of the art it is considered inadvisable 
to set a tolerance on the value of gamma and correspondingly this 
portion of the specification will not be enforced.


[[Page 210]]


    (v) The radiated chrominance subcarrier shall vanish on the 
reference white of the scene.

    Note: The numerical values of the signal specification assume that 
this condition will be reproduced as CIE Illuminant C (x=0.310, 
y=0.316).

    (vi) E<INF>Y</INF>', E<INF>Q</INF>', E<INF>I</INF>', and the 
components of these signals shall match each other in time to 0.05 
<greek-m> secs.
    (vii) The angles of the subcarrier measured with respect to the 
burst phase, when reproducing saturated primaries and their complements 
at 75 percent of full amplitude, shall be within 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>10 deg. and their amplitudes shall be within 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>20 percent of the values specified above. The 
ratios of the measured amplitudes of the subcarrier to the luminance 
signal for the same saturated primaries and their complements shall fall 
between the limits of 0.8 and 1.2 of the values specified for their 
ratios. Closer tolerances may prove to be practicable and desirable with 
advance in the art.
    (21) The interval beginning with line 17 and continuing through line 
20 of the vertical blanking interval of each field may be used for the 
transmission of test signals, cue and control signals, and 
identification signals, subject to the conditions and restrictions set 
forth below. Test signals may include signals designed to check the 
performance of the overall transmission system or its individual 
components. Cue and control signals shall be related to the operation of 
the TV broadcast station. Identification signals may be transmitted to 
identify the broadcast material or its source, and the date and time of 
its origination. Figures 6 and 7 of Sec. 73.699 identify the numbered 
lines referred to in this paragraph.
    (i) Modulation of the television transmitter by such signals shall 
be confined to the area between the reference white level and the 
blanking level, except where test signals include chrominance subcarrier 
frequencies, in which case positive excursions of chrominance components 
may exceed reference white, and negative excursions may extend into the 
synchronizing area. In no case may the modulation excursions produced by 
test signals extend beyond peak-of-sync, or to zero carrier level.
    (ii) The use of such signals shall not result in significant 
degradation of the program transmission of the television broadcast 
station, nor produce emission outside of the frequency band occupied for 
normal program transmissions.
    (iii) Such signals may not be transmitted during that portion of 
each line devoted to horizontal blanking.
    (iv) Regardless of other provisions of this paragraph, after June 
30, 1994, Line 19, in each field, may be used only for the transmission 
of the ghost-canceling reference signal described in OET Bulletin No. 
68, which is available from the Commission's Office of Engineering and 
Technology, Technical Standards Branch, 2025 M Street NW. Washington, DC 
20554. Notwithstanding the modulation limits contained in paragraph 
(a)(23)(i) of this section, the vertical interval reference signal 
formerly permitted on Line 19 and described in Figure 16 of Sec. 73.699, 
may be transmitted on any of lines 10 through 16 without specific 
Commission authorization, subject to the conditions contained in 
paragraphs (a)(21)(ii) and (a)(22)(ii) of this section.
    (22)(i) Line 21, in each field, may be used for the transmission of 
a program-related data signal which, when decoded, provides a visual 
depiction of information simultaneously being presented on the aural 
channel (captions). Such data signal shall conform to the format 
described in Figure 16 of Sec. 73.699 and may be transmitted during all 
periods of regular operation. On a space available basis, line 21 field 
2 may also be used for text-mode data and extended data service 
information.

    Note: The signals on Fields 1 and 2 shall be distinct data streams, 
for example, to supply captions in different languages or at different 
reading levels.

    (A) A decoder test signal consisting of data representing a repeated 
series of alphanumeric characters may be transmitted at times when no 
program-related data is being transmitted.
    (B) The data signal shall be coded using a non-return-to-zero (NRZ) 
format and shall employ standard ASCII 7 bit plus parity character 
codes.

    Note: For more information on data formats and specific data 
packets, see EIA-608,

[[Page 211]]

``Line 21 Data Services for NTSC,'' available from the Electronics 
Industries Association.

    (ii) At times when Line 21 is not being used to transmit a program 
related data signal, data signals which are not program related may be 
transmitted, Provided: the same data format is used and the information 
to be displayed is of a broadcast nature.
    (iii) The use of Line 21 for transmission of other data signals 
conforming to other formats may be used subject to prior authorization 
by the Commission.
    (iv) The data signal shall cause no significant degradation to any 
portion of the visual signal nor produce emissions outside the 
authorized television channel.
    (v) Transmission of visual emergency messages pursuant to 
Sec. 73.1250 shall take precedence and shall be cause for interrupting 
transmission of data signals permitted under this paragraph.
    (23) Specific scanning lines in the vertical blanking interval may 
be used for the purpose of transmitting telecommunications signals in 
accordance with Sec. 73.646, subject to certain conditions:
    (i) Telecommunications may be transmitted on Lines 10-18 and 20, all 
of Field 2 and Field 1. Modulation level shall not exceed 70 IRE on 
lines 10, 11, and 12; and, 80 IRE on lines 13-18 and 20.
    (ii) No observable degradation may be caused to any portion of the 
visual or aural signals.
    (iii) Telecommunications signals must not produce emissions outside 
the authorized television channel bandwidth. Digital data pulses must be 
shaped to limit spectral energy to the nominal video baseband.
    (iv) Transmission of emergency visual messages pursuant to 
Sec. 73.1250 must take precedence over, and shall be cause for 
interrupting, a service such as teletext that provides a visual 
depiction of information simultaneously transmitted on the aural 
channel.
    (v) A reference pulse for a decoder associated adaptive equalizer 
filter designed to improve the decoding of telecommunications signals 
may be inserted on any portion of the vertical blanking interval 
authorized for data service, in accordance with the signal levels set 
forth in paragraph (a)(23)(i) of this section.
    (vi) All lines authorized for telecommunications transmissions may 
be used for other purposes upon prior approval by the Commission.
    (24) Licensees and permittees of TV broadcast and low power TV 
stations may insert non-video data into the active video portion of 
their TV transmission, subject to certain conditions:
    (i) The active video portion of the visual signal begins with line 
22 and continues through the end of each field, except it does not 
include that portion of each line devoted to horizontal blanking. 
Figures 6 and 7 of Sec. 73.699 identify the numbered line referred to in 
this paragraph;
    (ii) Inserted non-video data may be used for the purpose of 
transmitting a telecommunications service in accordance with 
Sec. 73.646. In addition to a telecommunications service, non-video data 
can be used to enhance the station's broadcast program service or for 
purposes related to station operations. Signals relating to the 
operation of TV stations include, but are not limited to program or 
source identification, relay of broadcast materials to other stations, 
remote cueing and order messages, and control and telemetry signals for 
the transmitting system; and
    (iii) A station may only use systems for inserting non-video 
information that have been approved in advance by the Commission. The 
criteria for advance approval of systems are as follows:
    (A) The use of such signals shall not result in significant 
degradation to any portion of the visual, aural, or program-related data 
(closed captioning) signals of the television broadcast station;
    (B) No increase in width of the television broadcast channel (6 MHz) 
is permitted. Emissions outside the authorized television channel must 
not exceed the limitations given in Sec. 73.687(e). Interference to 
reception of television service either of co-channel or adjacent channel 
stations must not increase over that resulting from the transmission of 
programming without inserted data; and
    (C) Where required, system receiving or decoding devices must meet 
the TV

[[Page 212]]

interface device provisions of Part 15, Subpart H of this chapter.
    (iv) No protection from interference of any kind will be afforded to 
reception of inserted non-video data.
    (v) Upon request by an authorized representative of the Commission, 
the licensee of a TV station transmitting encoded programming must make 
available a receiving decoder to the Commission to carry out its 
regulatory responsibilities.
    (b) Subscription TV technical systems. The FCC may specify, as part 
of the advance approval of the technical system for transmitting encoded 
subscription programming, deviations from the power determination 
procedures, operating power levels, aural or video baseband signals, 
modulation levels or other characteristics of the transmitted signal as 
otherwise specified in this Subpart. Any decision to approve such 
operating deviations shall be solely at the discretion of the FCC.
    (c) TV multiplex subcarrier/stereophonic aural transmission 
standards.
    (1) The modulating signal for the main channel shall consist of the 
sum of the stereophonic (biphonic, quadraphonic, etc.) input signals.
    (2) The instantaneous frequency of the baseband stereophonic 
subcarrier must at all times be within the range 15 kHz to 120 kHz. 
Either amplitude or frequency modulation of the stereophonic subcarrier 
may be used.
    (3) One or more pilot subcarriers between 16 kHz and 120 kHz may be 
used to switch a TV receiver between the stereophonic and monophonic 
reception modes or to activate a stereophonic audio indicator light, and 
one or more subcarriers between 15 kHz and 120 kHz may be used for any 
other authorized purpose; except that stations employing the BTSC system 
of stereophonic sound transmission and audio processing may transmit a 
pilot subcarrier at 15,734 Hz, <plus-minus> 2 Hz. Other methods of 
multiplex subcarrier or stereophonic aural transmission systems must 
limit energy at 15,734 Hz, <plus-minus> 20 Hz, to no more than 
<plus-minus> 0.125 kHz aural carrier deviation.
    (4) Aural baseband information above 120 kHz must be attenuated 40 
dB referenced to 25 kHz main channel deviation of the aural carrier.
    (5) For required transmitter performance, all of the requirements of 
Sec. 73.687(b) shall apply to the main channel, with the transmitter in 
the multiplex subcarrier or stereophonic aural mode.
    (6) For electrical performance standards of the transmitter, the 
requirements of Sec. 73.687(b) apply to the main channel.
    (7) Multiplex subcarrier or stereophonic aural transmission systems 
must be capable of producing and must not exceed <plus-minus> 25 kHz 
main channel deviation of the aural carrier.
    (8) The arithmetic sum of non-multiphonic baseband signals between 
15 kHz and 120 kHz must not exceed <plus-minus>50 kHz deviation of the 
aural carrier.
    (9) Total modulation of the aural carrier must not exced 
<plus-minus> 75 kHz.standard; and adopting a standard for allocation and 
assignment purposes only. In addition, the Commission sought comment on 
requiring use of some layers of the ATSC DTV Standard but making others 
optional. )(1). The SBA defines affiliation in 13 C.F.R. 121.103. In 
this context, the SBA's definition of affiliate is analogous to our 
attribution rules. Generally, under the SBA's definition, concerns are 
affiliates of each other when one concern controls or has the power to 
control the other, or a third party or parties controls or has the power 
to control both. 13 C.F.R. 121.103(a)(1). The SBA considers factors such 
as ownership, management, previous relationships with or ties to another 
concern, and contractual relationships, in determining whether 
affiliation exists. 13 C.F.R. 121.103(a)(2). Instead of making an 
independent determination of whether television stations were affiliated 
based on SBA's definitions, we relied on the data bases available to us 
to provide us with that information.
    (d) Digital broadcast television transmission standard. Transmission 
of digital broadcast television (DTV) signals shall comply with the 
standards for such transmissions set forth in Advanced Television 
Systems Committee (ATSC) Doc. A/52 (``ATSC Standard Digital Audio 
Compression (AC-3), 20 Dec 95'') and ATSC Doc A/53 (``ATSC Digital

Sec. 73.683  Field strength contours.

    (a) In the authorization of TV stations, two field strength contours 
are considered. These are specified as Grade A and Grade B and indicate 
the approximate extent of coverage over average terrain in the absence 
of interference from other television stations. Under actual conditions, 
the true coverage may vary greatly from these estimates because the 
terrain over any specific path is expected to be different from the 
average terrain on which the field strength charts were based. The 
required field strength, F (50,50), in dB above one micro-volt per meter 
(dBu) for the Grade A and Grade B contours are as follows:

                                                                        
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                    Grade A     Grade B 
                                                     (dBu)       (dBu)  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Channels 2-6....................................          68          47
Channels 7-13...................................          71          56
Channels 14-69..................................          74          64
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) It should be realized that the F (50,50) curves when used for 
Channels 14-69 are not based on measured data at distances beyond about 
48.3 kilometers (30 miles). Theory would indicate that the field 
strengths for Channels 14-69 should decrease more rapidly with distance 
beyond the horizon than for Channels 2-6, and modification of the curves 
for Channels 14-69 may be expected as a result of measurements to be 
made at a later date. For these reasons, the curves should be used with 
appreciation of their limitations in estimating levels of field 
strength. Further, the actual extent of service will usually be less 
than indicated by these estimates due to interference from other 
stations. Because of these factors, the predicted field strength 
contours give no assurance of service to any specific percentage of 
receiver locations within the distances indicated. In licensing 
proceedings these variations will not be considered.
    (c) The field strength contours will be considered for the following 
purposes only:
    (1) In the estimation of coverage resulting from the selection of a 
particular transmitter site by an applicant for a TV station.
    (2) In connection with problems of coverage arising out of 
application of Sec. 73.3555.
    (3) In determining compliance with Sec. 73.685(a) concerning the 
minimum field strength to be provided over the principal community to be 
served.

Sec. 73.684  Prediction of coverage.

    (a) All predictions of coverage made pursuant to this section shall 
be made without regard to interference and shall be made only on the 
basis of estimated field strengths. The peak power of the visual signal 
is used in making predictions of coverage.
    (b) Predictions of coverage shall be made only for the same purposes 
as relate to the use of field strength contours as specified in 
Sec. 73.683(c).
    (c) In predicting the distance to the field strength contours, the F 
(50,50) field strength charts (Figures 9 and 10 of Sec. 73.699) shall be 
used. If the 50% field

[[Page 214]]

strength is defined as that value exceeded for 50% of the time, these F 
(50,50) charts give the estimated 50% field strengths exceeded at 50% of 
the locations in dB above 1 uV/m. The charts are based on an effective 
power of 1 kW radiated form a half-wave dipole in free space, which 
produces an unattenuated field strength at 1.61 kilometers (1 mile) of 
about 103 dB above 1 uV/m. To use the charts to predict the distance to 
a given contour, the following procedure is used: Convert the effective 
radiated power in kilowatts for the appropriate azimuth into decibel 
value referenced to 1 kW (dBu). If necessary, convert the selected 
contour to the decibel value (dBu) above 1 microvolt per meter (1 uV/m). 
Subtract the power value in dBk from the contour value in dBu. Note that 
for power less than 1 kW, the difference value will be greater than the 
contour value because the power in dBk is negative. Locate the 
difference value obtained on the vertical scale at the left edge of the 
chart. Follow the horizontal line for that value into the chart to the 
point of intersection with the vertical line above the height of the 
antenna above average terrain for the appropriate azimuth located on the 
scale at the bottom of the chart. If the point of intersection does not 
fall exactly on a distance curve, interpolate between the distance 
curves below and above the intersection point. The distance values for 
the curves are located along the right edge of the chart.
    (1) In predicting the distance to the Grade A and Grade B field 
strength contours, the effective radiated power to be used is that 
radiated at the vertical angle corresponding to the depression angle 
between the transmitting antenna center of radiation and the radio 
horizon as determined individually for each azimuthal direction 
concerned. The depression angle is based on the difference in elevation 
of the antenna center of radiation above the average terrain and the 
radio horizon, assuming a smooth sperical earth with a radius of 8,495.5 
kilometers (5,280 miles) and shall be determined by the following 
equation:

A = 0.0277<radical> H

Where:

A is the depression angle in degrees.
H is the height in meters of the transmitting antenna radiation center 
          above average terrain of the 3.2--16.1 kilometers (2-10 miles) 
          sector of the pertinent radial.

    This formula is empirically derived for the limited purpose 
specified here. Its use for any other purpose may be inappropriate.

    (2) In case where the relative field strength at the depression 
angle determined by the above formula is 90% or more of the maximum 
field strength developed in the vertical plane containing the pertaining 
radial, the maximum radiation shall be used.
    (3) In predicting field strengths for other than the Grade A and 
Grade B contours, the effective radiated power to be used is to be based 
on the appropriate antenna vertical plane radiation pattern for the 
azimuthal direction concerned.
    (4) Applicants for new TV stations or changes in the facilities of 
existing TV stations must submit to the FCC a showing as to the location 
of their stations' or proposed stations' predicted Grade A and Grade B 
contours, determined in accordance with Sec. 73.684. This showing is to 
include maps showing these contours, except where applicants have 
previously submitted material to the FCC containing such information and 
it is found upon careful examination that the contour locations 
indicated therein would not change, on any radial, when the locations 
are determined under this Section. In the latter cases, a statement by a 
qualified engineer to this effect will satisfy this requirement and no 
contour maps need be submitted.
    (d) The antenna height to be used with these charts is the height of 
the radiation center of the antenna above the average terrain along the 
radial in question. In determining the average elevation of the terrain, 
the elevations between 3.2-16.1 kilometers (2-10 miles) from the antenna 
site are employed. Profile graphs shall be drawn for 8 radials beginning 
at the antenna site and extending 16.1 kilometers (10 miles) therefrom. 
The radials should be drawn for each 45 degrees of azimuth starting with 
the True North. At least one radial must include the principal community 
to be served even though such community may be more than 16.1 kilometers 
(10 miles) from the antenna

[[Page 215]]

site. However, in the event none of the evenly spaced radials include 
the principal community to be served and one or more such radials are 
drawn in addition to the 8 evenly spaced radials, such additional 
radials shall not be employed in computing the antenna height above 
average terrain. Where the 3.2-16.1 kilometers (2-10 mile) portion of a 
radial extends in whole or in part over large bodies of water as 
specified in paragraph (e) of this section or extends over foreign 
territory but the Grade B strength contour encompasses land area within 
the United States beyond the 16.1 kilometers (10 mile) portion of the 
radial, the entire 3.2-16.1 kilometers (2-10 mile) portion of the radial 
shall be included in the computation of antenna height above average 
terrian. However, where the Grade B contour does not so encompass United 
States land area and (1) the entire 3.2-16.1 kilometers (2-10 mile) 
portion of the radial extends over large bodies of water of foreign 
territory, such radial shall be completely omitted from the computation 
of antenna height above average terrain, and (2) where a part of the 
3.2-16.1 kilometers (2-10 mile) portion of a radial extends over large 
bodies of water or over foreign territory, only that part of the radial 
extending from the 3.2 kilometer (2 mile) sector to the outermost 
portion of land area within the United States covered by the radial 
shall be employed in the computation of antenna height above average 
terrian. The profile graph for each radial should be plotted by contour 
intervals of from 12.2-30.5 meters (40-100 feet) and, where the data 
permits, at least 50 points of elevation (generally uniformly spaced) 
should be used for each radial. In instances of very rugged terrain 
where the use of contour intervals of 30.5 meters (100 feet) would 
result in several points in a short distance, 61.0-122.0 meter (200-400 
foot) contour intervals may be used for such distances. On the other 
hand, where the terrain is uniform or gently sloping the smallest 
contour interval indicated on the topograhic may (see paragraph (g) of 
this section) should be used, although only relatively few points may be 
available. The profile graphs should indicate the topography accurately 
for each radial, and the graphs should be plotted with the distance in 
kilometers as the abscissa and the elevation in meters above mean sea 
level as the ordinate. The profile graphs should indicate the source of 
the topographical data employed. The graph should also show the 
elevation of the center of the radiating system. The graph may be 
plotted either on rectangular coordinate paper or on special paper which 
shows the curvature of the earth. It is not necessary to take the 
curvature of the earth into consideration in this procedure, as this 
factor is taken care of in the charts showing signal strengths. The 
average elevation of the 12.9 kilometer (8 miles) distance between 3.2-
16.1 kilometers (2-10 miles) from the antenna site should then be 
determined from the profile graph for each radial. This may be obtained 
by averaging a large number of equally spaced points, by using a 
planimeter, or by obtaining the median elevation (that exceeded for 50% 
of the distance) in sectors and averaging those values.

    Note: The Commission will, upon a proper showing by an existing 
station that the application of this rule will result in an unreasonable 
power reduction in relation to other stations in close proximity, 
consider requests for adjustment in power on the basis of a common 
average terrain figure for the stations in question as determined by the 
FCC.

    (e) In instance where it is desired to determine the area in square 
kilometers within the Grade A and Grade B field strength contours, the 
area may be determined from the coverage map by planimeter or other 
approximate means; in computing such areas, exclued (1) areas beyond the 
borders of the United States, and (2) large bodies of water, such as 
ocean areas, gulfs sounds, bays, large lakes, etc., but not rivers.
    (f) In cases where terrain in one or more directions from the 
antenna site departs widely from the average elevation of the 3.2 to 
16.1 kilometers (2 to 10 mile) sector, the prediction method may 
indicate contour distances that are different from what may be expected 
in practice. For example, a

[[Page 216]]

mountain ridge may indicate the practical limit of service although the 
prediction method may indicate otherwise. In such case the prediction 
method should be followed, but a supplemental showing may be made 
concerning the contour distances as determined by other means. Such 
supplemental showing should describe the procedure employed and should 
include sample calculations. Maps of predicted coverage should include 
both the coverage as predicted by the regular method and as predicted by 
a supplemental method. When measurements of area are required, these 
should include the area obtained by the regular predicted method and the 
area obtained by the supplemental method. In directions where the 
terrain is such that negative antenna heights or heights below 30.5 
meters (100 feet) for the 3.2 to 16.1 kilometers (2 to 10 mile) sector 
are obtained, an assumed height of 30.5 meters (100 feet) shall be used 
for the prediction of coverage. However, where the actual contour 
distances are critical factors, a supplemental showing of expected 
coverage must be included together with a description of the method 
employed in predicting such coverage. In special cases, the Commission 
may require additional information as to terrain and coverage.
    (g) In the preparation of the profile graph previously described, 
and in determining the location and height above sea level of the 
antenna site, the elevation or contour intervals shall be taken from the 
United States Geological Survey Topographic Quadrangle Maps, United 
States Army Corps of Engineers' maps or Tennessee Valley Authority maps, 
whichever is the latest, for all areas for which such maps are 
available. If such maps are not published for the area in question, the 
next best topographic information should be used. Topographic data may 
sometimes be obtained from State and Municipal agencies. Data from 
Sectional Aeronautical Charts (including bench marks) or railroad depot 
elevations and highway elevations from road maps may be used where no 
better information is available. In cases where limited topographic data 
is available, use may be made of an altimeter in a car driven along 
roads extending generally radially from the transmitter site. Ordinarily 
the Commission will not require the submission of topographical maps for 
areas beyond 24.1 kilometers (15 miles) from the antenna site, but the 
maps must include the principal community to be served. If it appears 
necessary, additional data may be requested. United States Geological 
Survey Topographic Quadrangle Maps may be obtained from the United 
States Geological Survey, Department of the Interior, Washington, DC 
20240. Sectional Aeronautical Charts are available from the United 
States Coast and Geodetic Survey, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 
20235. In lieu of maps, the average terrain elevation may be computer 
generated, except in the cases of dispute, using elevations from a 30 
second point or better topographic data file. The file must be 
identified and the data processed for intermediate points along each 
radial using linear interpolation techniques. The height above mean sea 
level of the antenna site must be obtained manually using appropriate 
topographic maps.
    (h) The effect of terrain roughness on the predicted field strength 
of a signal at points distant from a television broadcast station is 
assumed to depend on the magnitude of a terrain roughness factor 
(<greek-D> h) which, for a specific propagation path, is determined by 
the characteristics of a segment of the terrain profile for that path 
40.2 kilometers (25 miles) in length, located between 9.7 and 49.9 
kilometers (6 and 31 miles) from the transmitter. The terrain roughness 
factor has a value equal to the difference, in meters, between 
elevations exceeded by all points on the profile for 10 percent and 90 
percent, respectively, of the length of the profile segment (see 
Sec. 73.699, Fig. 10d).
    (i) If the lowest field strength value of interest is initially 
predicted to occur over a particular propagation path at a distance 
which is less than 49.9 kilometers (31 miles) from the transmitter, the 
terrain profile segment used in the determination of the terrain 
roughness factor over that path shall be that included between points 
9.7 kilometers (6 miles) from the transmitter and such lesser distance. 
No terrain roughness correction need be applied when all field strength 
values of

[[Page 217]]

interest are predicted to occur 9.7 kilometers (6 miles) or less from 
the transmitter.
    (j) Profile segments prepared for terrain roughness factor 
determinations should be plotted in rectangular coordinates, with no 
less than 50 points evenly spaced within the segment, using data 
obtained from topographic maps, if available, with contour intervals of 
15.2 meters (50 feet), or less.
    (k) The field strength charts (Sec. 73.699, Figs. 9-10c) were 
developed assuming a terrain roughness factor of 50 meters, which is 
considered to be representative of average terrain in the United States. 
Where the roughness factor for a particular propagation path is found to 
depart appreciably from this value, a terrain roughness correction 
(<greek-D>F) should be applied to field strength values along this path 
as predicted with the use of these charts. The magnitude and sign of 
this correction, for any value of <greek-D>h, may be determined from a 
chart included in Sec. 73.699 as Figure 10e, with linear interpolation 
as necessary, for the frequency of the UHF signal under consideration.
    (l) Alternatively, the terrain roughness correction may be computed 
using the following formula:

                 <greek-D>F=C-0.03(<greek-D>h)(1+f/300)

Where:

<greek-D>F=terrain roughness correction in dB
C=a constant having a specific value for use with each set of field 
          strength charts:
1.9 for TV Channels 2-6
2.5 for TV Channels 7-13
4.8 for TV Channels 14-69
<greek-D>h=terrain roughness factor in meters
f=frequency of signal in megahertz (MHz)

Sec. 73.685  Transmitter location and antenna system.

    (a) The transmitter location shall be chosen so that, on the basis 
of the effective radiated power and antenna height above average terrain 
employed, the following minimum field strength in dB above one uV/m will 
be provided over the entire principal community to be served:

                                                                        
------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Channels 2-6            Channels 7-13           Channels 14-69    
------------------------------------------------------------------------
74 dBu.................             77 dBu                  80 dBu      
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Location of the antenna at a point of high elevation is 
necessary to reduce to a minimum the shadow effect on propagation due to 
hills and buildings which may reduce materially the strength of the 
station's signals. In general, the transmitting antenna of a station 
should be located at the most central point at the highest elevation 
available. To provide the best degree of service to an area, it is 
usually preferable to use a high antenna rather than a low antenna with 
increased transmitter power. The location should be so chosen that line-
of-sight can be obtained from the antenna over the principal community 
to be served; in no event should there be a major obstruction in this 
path. The antenna must be constructed so that it is as clear as possible 
of surrounding buildings or objects that would cause shadow problems. It 
is recognized that topography, shape of the desired service area, and 
population distribution may make the choice of a transmitter location 
difficult. In such cases, consideration may be given to the use of a 
directional antenna system, although it is generally preferable to 
choose a site where a nondirectional antenna may be employed.
    (c) In cases of questionable antenna locations it is desirable to 
conduct propagation tests to indicate the field strength expected in the 
principal community to be served and in other areas, particularly where 
severe shadow problems may be expected. In considering applications 
proposing the use of such locations, the Commission may require site 
tests to be made. Such tests should be made in accordance with the 
measurement procedure in Sec. 73.686, and full data thereon must be 
supplied to the Commission. Test transmitters should employ an antenna 
having a height as close as possible to the proposed antenna height, 
using a balloon or other support if necessary and feasible. Information 
concerning the authorization of site tests may be obtained from the 
Commission upon request.

[[Page 218]]

    (d) Present information is not sufficiently complete to establish 
``blanket areas'' of television broadcast stations. A ``blanket area'' 
is that area adjacent to a transmitter in which the reception of other 
stations is subject to interference due to the strong signal from this 
station. The authorization of station construction in areas where 
blanketing is found to be excessive will be on the basis that the 
applicant will assume full responsibility for the adjustment of 
reasonable complaints arising from excessively strong signals of the 
applicant's station or take other corrective action.
    (e) An antenna designed or altered to produce a noncircular 
radiation pattern in the horizontal plane is considered to be a 
directional antenna. Antennas purposely installed in such a manner as to 
result in the mechanical beam tilting of the major vertical radiation 
lobe are included in this category. Directional antennas may be employed 
for the purpose of improving service upon an appropriate showing of 
need. Stations operating on Channels 2-13 will not be permitted to 
employ a directional antenna having a ratio of maximum to minimum 
radiation in the horizontal plane in excess of 10 dB. Stations operating 
on Channels 14-69 with transmitters delivering a peak visual power 
output of more than 1 kW may employ directive transmitting antennas with 
a maximum to minimum radiation in the horizontal plane of not more than 
15 dB. Stations operating on Channels 14-69 and employing transmitters 
delivering a peak visual power output of 1 kW or less are not limited as 
to the ratio of maximum to minimum radiation.
    (f) Applications proposing the use of directional antenna systems 
must be accompanied by the following:
    (1) Complete description of the proposed antenna system, including 
the manufacturer and model number of the proposed directional antenna.
    (2) Relative field horizontal plane pattern (horizontal polarization 
only) of the proposed directional antenna. A value of 1.0 should be used 
for the maximum radiation. The plot of the pattern should be oriented so 
that 0 deg. corresponds to true North. Where mechanical beam tilt is 
intended, the amount of tilt in degrees of the antenna vertical axis and 
the orientation of the downward tilt with respect to true North must be 
specified, and the horizontal plane pattern must reflect the use of 
mechanical beam tilt.
    (3) A tabulation of the relative field pattern required in paragraph 
(b)(2), of this section. The tabulation should use the same zero degree 
reference as the plotted pattern, and be tabulated at least every 
10 deg.. In addition, tabulated values of all maxima and minima, with 
their corresponding azimuths, should be submitted.
    (4) Horizontal and vertical plane radiation patterns showing the 
effective radiated power, in dBk, for each direction. Sufficient 
vertical plane patterns must be included to indicate clearly the 
radiation characteristics of the antenna above and below the horizontal 
plane. In cases where the angles at which the maximum vertical radiation 
varies with azimuth, a separate vertical radiation pattern must be 
provided for each pertinent radial direction.
    (5) All horizontal plane patterns must be plotted to the largest 
scale possible on unglazed letter-size polar coordinate paper (main 
engraving approximately 18 cm x 25 cm (7 inches x 10 inches)) using only 
scale divisions and subdivisions of 1, 2, 2.5 or 5 times 10-nth. All 
vertical plane patterns must be plotted on unglazed letter-size 
rectangular coordinate paper. Values of field strength on any pattern 
less than 10% of the maximum field strength plotted on that pattern must 
be shown on an enlarged scale.
    (6) The horizontal and vertical plane patterns that are required are 
the patterns for the complete directional antenna system. In the case of 
a composite antenna composed of two or more individual antennas, this 
means that the patterns for the composite antenna, not the patterns for 
each of the individual antennas, must be submitted.
    (g) Applications proposing the use of television broadcast antennas 
within 61.0 meters (200 feet) of other television broadcast antennas 
operating on a channel within 20 percent in frequency of the proposed 
channel, or proposing

[[Page 219]]

the use of television broadcast antennas on Channels 5 or 6 within 61.0 
meters (200 feet) of FM broadcast antennas, must include a showing as to 
the expected effect, if any, of such proximate operation.
    (h) Where a TV licensee or permittee proposes to mount an antenna on 
an AM antenna tower, or locate within 3.2 km of an AM antenna tower, the 
TV licensee or permittee must comply with Sec. 73.1692.

    (h) Where simultaneous use of antennas or antenna structures is 
proposed, the following provisions shall apply:
    (1) In cases where it is proposed to use a tower of an AM broadcast 
station as a supporting structure for a television broadcast antenna, an 
appropriate application for changes in the radiating system of the AM 
broadcast station must be filed by the licensee thereof. A formal 
application (FCC Form 301, or FCC Form 340 for a noncommercial 
educational station) will be required if the proposal involves 
substantial change in the physical height or radiation characteristics 
of the AM broadcast antennas; otherwise an informal application will be 
acceptable. (In case of doubt, an informal application (letter) together 
with complete engineering data should be submitted.) An application may 
be required for other classes of stations when the tower is to be used 
in connection with a television station.
    (2) When the proposed TV antenna is to be mounted on a tower in the 
vicinity of an AM station directional antenna system and it appears that 
the operation of the directional antenna system may be affected, an 
engineering study must be filed with the TV application concerning the 
effect of the TV antenna on the AM directional radiation pattern. Field 
measurements of the AM stations may be required prior to and following 
construction of the TV station antenna, and readjustments made as 
necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 73.686  Field strength measurements.

    (a) Except as provided for in Sec. 73.612, television broadcast 
stations shall not be protected from any type of interference or 
propagation effect. Persons desiring to submit testimony, evidence or 
data to the Commission for the purpose of showing that the technical 
standards contained in this subpart do not properly reflect the levels 
of any given type of interference or propagation effect may do so only 
in appropriate rulemaking proceedings concerning the amendment of such 
technical standards. Persons making field strength measurements for 
formal submission to the Commission in rulemaking proceedings, or making 
such measurements upon the request of the Commission, shall follow the 
procedure for making and reporting such measurements outlined in 
paragraph (b) of this section. In instances where a showing of the 
measured level of a signal prevailing over a specific community is 
appropriate, the procedure for making and reporting field strength 
measurements for this purpose is set forth in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (b) Collection of field strength data for propagation analysis.
    (1) Preparation for measurements. (i) On large scale topographic 
maps, eight or more radials are drawn from the transmitter location to 
the maximum distance at which measurements are to be made, with the 
angles included between adjacent radials of approximately equal size. 
Radials should be oriented so as to traverse representative types of 
terrain. The specific number of radials and their orientation should be 
such as to accomplish this objective.
    (ii) At a point exactly 16.1 kilometers (10 miles) from the 
transmitter, each radial is marked, and at greater distances at 
successive 3.2 kilometer (2 mile) intervals. Where measurements are to 
be conducted at UHF, or over extremely rugged terrain, shorter intervals 
may be employed, but all such intervals shall be of equal length. 
Accessible roads intersecting each radial as nearly as possible at each 
3.2 kilometer (2 mile) marker are selected. These

[[Page 220]]

intersections are the points on the radial at which measurements are to 
be made, and are referred to subsequently as measuring locations. The 
elevation of each measuring location should approach the elevation at 
the corresponding 3.2 kilometer (2 mile) marker as nearly as possible.
    (2) Measurement procedure. The field strength of the visual carrier 
shall be measured with a voltmeter capable of indicating accurately the 
peak amplitude of the synchronizing signal. All measurements shall be 
made utilizing a receiving antenna designed for reception of the 
horizontally polarized signal component, elevated 9.1 meters (30 feet) 
above the roadbed. At each measuring location, the following procedure 
shall be employed.
    (i) The instrument calibration is checked.
    (ii) The antenna is elevated to a height of 30 feet.
    (iii) The receiving antenna is rotated to determine if the strongest 
signal is arriving from the direction of the transmitter.
    (iv) The antenna is oriented so that the sector of its response 
pattern over which maximum gain is realized is in the direction of the 
transmitter.
    (v) A mobile run of at least 30.5 meters (100 feet) is made, which 
is centered on the intersection of the radial and the road, and the 
measured field strength is continuously recorded on a chart recorder 
over the length of the run.
    (vi) The actual measuring location is marked exactly on the 
topographic map, and a written record, keyed to the specific location, 
is made of all factors which may affect the recorded field, such as 
topography, height and types of vegetation, buildings, obstacles, 
weather, and other local features.
    (vii) If, during the test conducted as described in paragraph 
(b)(2)(iii) of this section, the strongest signal is found to come from 
a direction other than from the transmitter, after the mobile run 
prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section is concluded, 
additional measurements shall be made in a ``cluster'' of at least five 
fixed points. At each such point, the field strengths with the antenna 
oriented toward the transmitter, and with the antenna oriented so as to 
receive the strongest field, are measured and recorded. Generally, all 
points should be within 61.0 meters (200 feet) of the center point of 
the mobile run.
    (viii) If overhead obstacles preclude a mobile run of at leat 30.5 
meters (100 feet), a ``cluster'' of five spot measurements may be made 
in lieu of this run. The first measurement in the cluster is identified. 
Generally, the locations for other measurements shall be within 61.0 
meters (200 feet) of the location of the first.
    (3) Method of reporting measurements. A report of measurements to 
the Commission shall be submitted in affidavit form, in triplicate, and 
should contain the following information:
    (i) Tables of field strength measurements, which, for each measuring 
location, set forth the following data:
    (A) Distance from the transmitting antenna.
    (B) Ground elevation at measuring location.
    (C) Date, time of day, and weather.
    (D) Median field in dBu for 0 dBk, for mobile run or for cluster, as 
well as maximum and minimum measured field strengths.
    (E) Notes describing each measuring location.
    (ii) U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps, on which is shown the 
exact location at which each measurement was made. The original plots 
shall be made on maps of the largest available scale. Copies may be 
reduced in size for convenient submission to the Commission, but not to 
the extent that important detail is lost. The original maps shall be 
made available, if requested. If a large number of maps is involved, an 
index map should be submitted.
    (iii) All information necessary to determine the pertinent 
characteristics of the transmitting installation, including frequency, 
geographical coordinates of antenna site, rated and actual power output 
of transmitter, measured transmission line loss, antenna power gain, 
height of antenna above ground, above mean sea level, and above average 
terrain. The effective radiated power should be computed, and horizontal 
and vertical plane patterns of

[[Page 221]]

the transmitting antenna should be submitted.
    (iv) A list of calibrated equipment used in the field strength 
survey, which, for each instrument, specifies its manufacturer, type, 
serial number and rated accuracy, and the date of its most recent 
calibration by the manufacturer, or by a laboratory. Complete details of 
any instrument not of standard manufacture shall be submitted.
    (v) A detailed description of the calibration of the measuring 
equipment, including field strength meters, measuring antenna, and 
connecting cable.
    (vi) Terrain profiles in each direction in which measurements were 
made, drawn on curved earth paper for equivalent 4/3 earth radius, of 
the largest available scale.
    (c) Collection of field strength data to determine television 
service in specific communities.
    (1) Preparation for measurement. (i) The population (P) of the 
community, and its suburbs, if any, is determined by reference to an 
appropriate source, e.g., the 1970 U.S. Census tables of population of 
cities and urbanized areas.
    (ii) The number of locations at which measurements are to be made 
shall be at least 15, and shall be approximately equal to 0.1 (P) \1/2\, 
if this product is a number greater than 15.
    (iii) A rectangular grid, of such size and shape as to encompass the 
boundaries of the community is drawn on an accurate map of the 
community. The number of line intersections on the grid included within 
the boundaries of the community shall be at least equal to the required 
number of measuring locations. The position of each intersection on the 
community map determines the location at which a measurement shall be 
made.
    (2) Measurement procedure. The field strength of the visual carrier 
shall be measured, with a voltmeter capable of indicating accurately the 
peak amplitude of the synchronizing signal. All measurements shall be 
made utilizing a receiving antenna designed for reception of the 
horizontally polarized signal component, elevated 9.1 meter (30 feet) 
above street level.
    (i) Each measuring location shall be chosen as close as feasible to 
a point indicated on the map, as previously prepared, and at as nearly 
the same elevation as that point as possible.
    (ii) At each measuring location, after equipment calibration and 
elevation of the antenna, a check is made to determine whether the 
strongest signal arrives from a direction other than from the 
transmitter.
    (iii) At 20 percent or more of the measuring locations, mobile runs, 
as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be made, with no 
less than three such mobile runs in any case. The points at which mobile 
measurements are made shall be well separated. Spot measurements may be 
made at other measuring points.
    (iv) Each actual measuring location is marked exactly on the map of 
the community, and suitably keyed. A written record shall be maintained, 
describing, for each location, factors which may affect the recorded 
field, such as the approximate time of measurement, weather, topography, 
overhead wiring, heights and types of vegetation, buildings and other 
structures. The orientation, with respect to the measuring location 
shall be indicated of objects of such shape and size as to be capable of 
causing shadows or reflections. If the strongest signal received was 
found to arrive from a direction other than that of the transmitter, 
this fact shall be recorded.
    (3) Method of reporting measurements. A report of measurements to 
the Commission shall be submitted in affidavit form, in triplicate, and 
should contain the following information:
    (i) A map of the community showing each actual measuring location, 
specifically identifying the points at which mobile runs were made.
    (ii) A table keyed to the above map, showing the field strength at 
each measuring point, reduced to dBu for the actual effective radiated 
power of the station. Weather, date, and time of each measurement shall 
be indicated.
    (iii) Notes describing each measuring location.
    (iv) A topographic map of the largest available scale on which are 
marked the community and the transmitter site of the station whose 
signals have been measured, which includes all areas on or near the 
direct path of signal propagation.

[[Page 222]]

    (v) Computations of the mean and standard deviation of all measured 
field strengths, or a graph on which the distribution of measured field 
strength values is plotted.
    (vi) A list of calibrated equipment used for the measurements, which 
for each instrument, specifies its manufacturer, type, serial number and 
rated accuracy, and the date of its most recent calibration by the 
manufacturer, or by a laboratory. Complete details of any instrument not 
of standard manufacture shall be submitted.
    (vii) A detailed description of the procedure employed in the

Sec. 73.687  Transmission system requirements.

    (a) Visual transmitter. (1) The field strength or voltage of the 
lower sideband, as radiated or dissipated and measured as described in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, shall not be greater than -20 dB for a 
modulating frequency of 1.25 MHz or greater and in addition, for color, 
shall not be greater than -42 dB for a modulating frequency of 3.579545 
MHz (the color subcarrier frequency). For both monochrome and color, the 
field strength or voltage of the upper sideband as radiated or 
dissipated and measured as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section 
shall not be greater than -20 dB for a modulating frequency of 4.75 MHz 
or greater. For stations operating on Channels 15-69 and employing a 
transmitter delivering maximum peak visual power output of 1 kW or less, 
the field strength or voltage of the upper and lower sidebands, as 
radiated or dissipated and measured as described in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section, shall depart from the visual amplitude characteristic 
(Figure 5a of Sec. 73.699) by no more than the following amounts:

-2 dB at 0.5 MHz below visual carrier frequency;
-2 dB at 0.5 MHz above visual carrier frequency;
-2 dB at 1.25 MHz above visual carrier frequency;
-3 dB at 2.0 MHz above visual carrier frequency;
-6 dB at 3.0 MHz above visual carrier frequency;
-12 dB at 3.5 MHz above visual carrier frequency;
-8 dB at 3.58 MHz above visual carrier frequency (for color transmission 
          only).

The field strength or voltage of the upper and lower sidebands, as 
radiated or dissipated and measured as described in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section, shall not exceed a level of -20 dB for a modulating 
frequency of 4.75 MHz or greater. If interference to the reception of 
other stations is caused by out-of-channel lower sideband emission, the 
technical requirements applicable to stations operating on Channels 2-13 
shall be met.
    (2) The attenuation characteristics of a visual transmitter shall be 
measured by application of a modulating signal to the transmitter input 
terminals in place of the normal composite television video signal. The 
signal applied shall be a composite signal composed of a synchronizing 
signal to establish peak output voltage plus a variable frequency sine 
wave voltage occupying the interval between synchronizing pulses. (The 
``synchronizing signal'' referred to in this section means either a 
standard synchronizing wave form or any pulse that will properly set the 
peak.) The axis of the sine wave in the composite signal observed in the 
output monitor shall be maintained at an amplitude 0.5 of the voltage at 
synchronizing peaks. The amplitude of the sine wave input shall be held 
at a constant value. This constant value should be such that at no 
modulating frequency does the maximum excursion of the sine wave, 
observed in the composite output signal monitor, exceed the value 0.75 
of peak output voltage. The amplitude of the 200 kHz sideband shall be 
measured and designated zero dB as a basis for comparison. The 
modulation signal frequency shall then be varied over the desired range 
and the field strength or signal voltage of the corresponding sidebands 
measured. As an alternate method of measuring, in those cases in which 
the automatic d-c insertion can be replaced by manual control, the above 
characteristic may be taken by the use of a video sweep

[[Page 223]]

generator and without the use of pedestal synchronizing pulses. The d-c 
level shall be set for midcharacteristic operation.
    (3) A sine wave, introduced at those terminals of the transmitter 
which are normally fed the composite color picture signal, shall produce 
a radiated signal having an envelope delay, relative to the average 
envelope delay between 0.05 and 0.20 MHz, of zero microseconds up to a 
frequency of 3.0 MHz; and then linearly decreasing to 4.18 MHz so as to 
be equal to -0.17 <greek-m> secs at 3.58 MHz. The tolerance on the 
envelope delay shall be <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.05 <greek-m> secs at 3.58 
MHz. The tolerance shall increase linearly to <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.1 
<greek-m> sec down to 2.1 MHz, and remain at <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.1 
<greek-m> sec down to 0.2 MHz. (Tolerances for the interval of 0.0 to 
0.2 MHz are not specified at the present time.) The tolerance shall also 
increase linearly to <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.1 <greek-m> sec at 4.18 MHz.
    (4) The radio frequency signal, as radiated, shall have an envelope 
as would be produced by a modulating signal in conformity with 
Sec. 73.682 and Figure 6 or 7 of Sec. 73.699, as modified by vestigial 
sideband operation specified in Figure 5 of Sec. 73.699. For stations 
operating on Channels 15-69 the radio frequency signal as radiated, 
shall have an envelope as would be produced by a modulating signal in 
conformity with Sec. 73.682 and Figure 6 or 7 of Sec. 73.699.
    (5) The time interval between the leading edges of successive 
horizontal pulses shall vary less than one half of one percent of the 
average interval. However, for color transmissions, Sec. 73.682(a) (5) 
and (6) shall be controlling.
    (6) The rate of change of the frequency of recurrence of the leading 
edges of the horizontal synchronizing signals shall be not greater than 
0.15 percent per second, the frequency to be determined by an averaging 
process carried out over a period of not less than 20, nor more than 100 
lines, such lines not to include any portion of the blanking interval. 
However, for color transmissions, Sec. 73.682(a) (5) and (6) shall be 
controlling.
    (b) Aural transmitter. (1) Pre-emphasis shall be employed as closely 
as practicable in accordance with the impedance-frequency characteristic 
of a series inductance-resistance network having a time constant of 75 
microseconds. (See upper curve of Figure 12 Sec. 73.699.)
    (2) If a limiting or compression amplifier is employed, precaution 
should be maintained in its connection in the circuit due to the use of 
pre-emphasis in the transmitting system.
    (3) Aural modulation levels are specified in Sec. 73.1570.
    (c) Requirements applicable to both visual and aural transmitters. 
(1) Automatic means shall be provided in the visual transmitter to 
maintain the carrier frequency within <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1 kHz of the 
authorized frequency; automatic means shall be provided in the aural 
transmitter to maintain the carrier frequency 4.5 MHz above the actual 
visual carrier frequency within <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1 kHz.
    (2) The transmitters shall be equipped with suitable indicating 
instruments for the determination of operating power and with other 
instruments necessary for proper adjustment, operation, and maintenance 
of the equipment.
    (3) Adequate provision shall be made for varying the output power of 
the transmitters to compensate for excessive variations in line voltage 
or for other factors affecting the output power.
    (4) Adequate provisions shall be provided in all component parts to 
avoid overheating at the rated maximum output powers.
    (d) The construction, installation, and operation of broadcast 
equipment is expected to conform with all applicable local, state, and 
federally imposed safety regulations and standards, enforcement of which 
is the responsibility of the issuing regulatory agency.
    (e) Operation. (1) Spurious emissions, including radio frequency 
harmonics, shall be maintained at as low a level as the state of the art 
permits. As measured at the output terminals of the transmitter 
(including harmonic filters, if required) all emissions removed in 
frequency in excess of 3 MHz above or below the respective channel edge 
shall be attenuated no less than 60 dB. below the visual transmitted 
power. (The 60 dB. value for television transmitters specified in this 
rule should be considered as a temporary requirement which may be 
increased at a later date,

[[Page 224]]

especially when more higher-powered equipment is utilized. Stations 
should, therefore, give consideration to the installation of equipment 
with greater attenuation than 60 dB.) In the event of interference 
caused to any service greater attenuation will be required.
    (2) If a limiting or compression amplifier is used in conjunction 
with the aural transmitter, due operating precautions should be 
maintained because of pre-emphasis in the transmitting system.
    (3) TV broadcast stations operating on Channel 14 and Channel 69 
must take special precautions to avoid interference to adjacent spectrum 
land mobile radio service facilities. Where a TV station is authorized 
and operating prior to the authorization and operation of the land 
mobile facility, a Channel 14 station must attenuate its emissions 
within the frequency range 467 to 470 MHz and a Channel 69 station must 
attentuate its emissions within the frequency range 806 to 809 MHz if 
necessary to permit reasonable use of the adjacent frequencies by land 
mobile licensees.
    (4) The requirements listed below apply to permittees authorized to 
construct a new station on TV Channel 14 or TV Channel 69, and to 
licensees authorized to change the channel of an existing station to 
Channel 14 or to Channel 69, to increase effective radiated power (ERP) 
(including any change in directional antenna characteristics that 
results in an increase in ERP in any direction), or to change the 
transmitting location of an existing station.
    (i) For the purposes of this paragraph, a protected land mobile 
facility is a receiver that is intended to receive transmissions from 
licensed land mobile stations within the frequency band below 470 MHz 
(as relates to Channel 14) or above 806 MHz (as relates to Channel 69), 
and is associated with one or more land mobile stations for which a 
license has been issued by the Commission, or a proper application has 
been received by the Commission prior to the date of the filing of the 
TV construction permit application. However, a land mobile facility will 
not be protected if it is proposed in an application that is denied or 
dismissed and that action is no longer subject to Commission review. 
Further, if the land mobile station is not operating when the TV 
facility commences operation and it does not commence operation within 
the time permitted by its authorization in accordance with part 90 of 
this chapter, it will not be protected.
    (ii) A TV permittee must take steps before construction to identify 
potential interference to normal land mobile operation that could be 
caused by TV emissions outside the authorized channel, land mobile 
receiver desensitization or intermodulation. It must install filters and 
take other precautions as necessary, and submit evidence that no 
interference is being caused before it will be permitted to transmit 
programming on the new facilities pursuant to the provisions of 
Sec. 73.1615 or Sec. 73.1620 of this part. A TV permittee must reduce 
its emissions within the land mobile channel of a protected land mobile 
facility that is receiving interference caused by the TV emission 
producing a vertically polarized signal and a field strength in excess 
of 17 dBu at the land mobile receiver site on the land mobile frequency. 
The TV emission should be measured with equipment set to a 30 kHz 
measurement bandwidth including the entire applicable land mobile 
channel. A TV permittee must correct a desensitization problem if its 
occurrence can be directly linked to the start of the TV operation and 
the land mobile station is using facilities with typical desensitization 
rejection characteristics. A TV permittee must identify the source of an 
intermodulation product that is generated when the TV operation 
commences. If the intermodulation source is under its control, the TV 
permittee must correct the problem. If the intermodulation source is 
beyond the TV permittee's control, it must cooperate in the resolution 
of the problem and should provide whatever technical assistance it can.

Sec. 73.688  Indicating instruments.

    (a) Each TV broadcast station shall be equipped with indicating 
instruments which conform with the specifications described in 
Sec. 73.1215 for measuring the operating parameters of the last radio 
stage of the visual transmitter, and with such other instruments as are 
necessary for the proper adjustment, operation, and maintenance of the 
visual transmitting system.
    (b) The function of each instrument shall be clearly and permanently 
shown on the instrument itself or on the panel immediately adjacent 
thereto.
    (c) In the event that any one of these indicating instruments 
becomes defective, when no substitute which conforms with the required 
specifications is available, the station may be operated without the 
defective instrument pending its repair or replacement for a period not 
in excess of 60 days without further authority of the FCC, provided 
that:
    (1) If the defective instrument is the transmission line meter used 
for determining the output power by the direct method, the operating 
power shall be determined or maintained by the indirect method whenever 
possible or by using the operating parameters of the last radio stage of 
the transmitter during the time the station is operated without the 
transmission line meter.
    (2) If conditions beyond the control of the licensee prevent the 
restoration of the meter to service within the above allowed period, 
informal request in accordance with Sec. 73.3549 may be filed with the 
Engineer in Charge of the radio district in which the station is located 
for such additional time as may be required to complete repairs of the 
defective instrument.

Sec. 73.691  Visual modulation monitoring.

    (a) Each TV station must have measuring equipment for determining 
that the transmitted visual signal conforms to the provisions of this 
subpart. The licensee shall decide the monitoring and measurement 
methods or procedures for indicating and controlling the visual signal.
    (b) In the event technical problems make it impossible to operate in 
accordance with the timing and carrier level tolerance requirements of 
Sec. 73.682 (a)(9)(i), (a)(9)(ii), (a)(12), (a)(13), and (a)(17), a TV 
broadcast station may operate at variance for a period of not more than 
30 days without specific authority from the FCC: provided that, the date 
and time of the initial out-of-tolerance condition has been entered in 
the station log. If the operation at variance will exceed 10 consecutive 
days, a notification must be sent to the FCC in Washington, D.C., not 
later than the 10th day of such operation. In the event normal operation 
is resumed prior to the end of the 30 day period, the licensee must 
notify the FCC upon restoration of normal operation. If causes beyond 
the control of the licensee prevent restoration of normal operation 
within 30 days, a written request must be made to the FCC in Washington, 
D.C., no later than the 30th day for such additional time as may be 
necessary.

               Subpart F--International Broadcast Stations


<R05>
Sec. 73.701  Definitions.

    The following definitions apply to terminology employed in this 
subpart:
    (a) International broadcasting stations. A broadcasting station 
employing frequencies allocated to the broadcasting service between 
5,950 and 26,100 kHz, the transmissions of which are intended to be 
received directly by the general public in foreign countries. (A station 
may be authorized more than one transmitter.) There are both government 
and non-government international broadcasting stations; only the latter 
are licensed by the Commission and are subject to the rules of this 
subpart.
    (b) Transmitter-hour. One frequency used on one transmitter for one 
hour.
    (c) Frequency-hour. One frequency used for one hour regardless of 
the number of transmitters over which it is simultaneously broadcast by 
a station during that hour.
    (d) Multiple operation. Broadcasting by a station on one frequency 
over two or more transmitters simultaneously. If a station uses the same 
frequency simultaneously on each of two (three, etc.) transmitters for 
an hour, it uses one frequency-hour and two (three, etc.) transmitter-
hours.
    (e) Day. Any twenty-four hour period beginning 0100 g.m.t. and 
ending 0100 g.m.t.
    (f) Sunspot number. The 12-month running average of the number of 
sunspots for any month as indicated in the

[[Page 245]]

U.S. Department of Commerce Telecommunications Research and Engineering 
Report No. 13--available from the Superintendent of Documents, 
Washington, DC 20402. The sunspot number varies in an approximate 11-
year cycle.
    (g) March season. That portion of any year commencing 0100 g.m.t. on 
the first Sunday in March and ending at 0100 g.m.t. on the first Sunday 
in May.
    (h) May season. That portion of any year commencing at 0100 G.M.T. 
on the first Sunday in May and ending at 0100 g.m.t. on the first Sunday 
in September.
    (i) September season. That portion of any year commencing at 0100 
g.m.t. on the first Sunday in September and ending at 0100 g.m.t. on the 
first Sunday in November.
    (j) November season. That portion of any year commencing at 0100 
g.m.t. on the first Sunday in November and ending at 0100 g.m.t. on the 
first Sunday in March.
    (k) Seasonal schedule. An assignment, for a season, of a frequency 
or frequencies, and other technical parameters, to be used by a station 
for transmission to particular zones or areas of reception during 
specified hours.
    (l) Reference month. That month of a season which is used for 
determining predicted propagation characteristics for the season. The 
reference month is January, April, July, or October, as related to the 
season in which it occurs.
    (m) Maximum usable frequency (MUF). The highest frequency which is 
returned by ionospheric radio propagation to the surface of the earth 
for a particular path and time of day for 50 percent of the days of the 
reference month.
    (n) Optimum working frequency (FOT). The highest frequency which is 
returned by ionospheric radio propagation to the surface of the earth 
for a particular path and time of day for 90 percent of the days of the 
reference month.

    Note: The international abbreviation for optimum working frequency, 
FOT, is formed with the initial letters of the French words for 
``optimum working frequency'' which are ``frequence optimum de 
travail.''

    (o) Zone of reception. Any geographic zone indicated in Sec. 73.703 
in which the reception of particular programs is specifically intended 
and in which broadcast coverage is contemplated.
    (p) Area of reception. Any geographic area smaller than a zone of 
reception in which the reception of particular programs is specifically 
intended and in which broadcast coverage is contemplated, such areas 
being indicated by countries or parts of countries.
    (q) Delivered median field strength, or field strength. The field 
strength incident upon the zone or area of reception expressed in 
microvolts per meter, or decibels above one microvolt per meter, which 
is exceeded by the hourly median value for 50 percent of the days of the 
reference month.
    (r) Carrier power. The average power supplied to the antenna 
transmission line by a transmitter during one radio frequency cycle 
under conditions of no modulation.

[38 FR 18892, July 16, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 73.702  Assignment and use of frequencies.

    (a) Frequencies will be assigned by the Commission prior to the 
start of each season to authorized international broadcasting stations 
for use during the season at specified hours and for transmission to 
specified zones or areas of reception, with specified power and antenna 
bearing. Six months prior to the start of each season, licensees and 
permittees shall by informal written request, submitted to the 
Commission in triplicate, indicate for the season the frequency or 
frequencies desired for transmission to each zone or area of reception 
specified in the license or permit, the specific hours during which it 
desires to transmit to such zones or areas on each frequency, and the 
power, antenna gain, and antenna bearing it desires to use. Requests 
will be honored to the extent that interference and propagation 
conditions permit and that they are otherwise in accordance with the 
provisions of this section.
    (b) After necessary processing of the requests required by paragraph 
(a) of this section, the Commission will notify each licensee and 
permittee of the frequencies, hours of use thereof to specified zones or 
areas of reception, power, and antenna bearing which it

[[Page 246]]

intends to authorize for the season in question. After receipt of such 
notification, the licensee or permittee shall, in writing, not later 
than two months before the start of the season in question, inform the 
Commission either that it plans to operate in accordance with the 
authorization which the Commission intends to issue, or that it plans to 
operate in another manner. If the licensee or permittee indicates that 
it plans to operate in another manner, it shall furnish explanatory 
details.
    (c) If after submitting the request required under the provisions of 
paragraph (a) of this section, but before receipt of the Commission's 
notification referred to in paragraph (b) of this section, the licensee 
or permittee submits a request for changes of its original request, such 
requests will be accepted for consideration only if accompanied by 
statements showing good cause therefor and will be honored only if 
conditions permit. If the information required to be submitted by the 
licensee or permittee under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this 
section indicates that operation in another manner is contemplated, and 
the explanatory details contain a request for change in the originally 
proposed manner of operation, such requests will be accepted for 
consideration only if accompanied by statements showing good cause 
therefor and will be honored only if conditions permit. If after the 
licensee or permittee submits the information required under the 
provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, but before the start of the 
season in question, the licensee or permittee submits a request for 
changes in its manner of operation for the season in question, the 
request will be accepted for consideration only if accompanied by 
statements showing good cause therefor and will be honored only if 
conditions permit. If after the start of a season the licensee or 
permittee submits a request for changes in the manner of operation as 
authorized, the request will be considered only if accompanied by 
statements showing good cause therefor, and will be honored only if 
conditions permit.
    (d) The provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of the section 
shall apply to licensees, to permittees operating under program test 
authority, and to permittees who anticipate applying for and receiving 
program test authority for operation during the specified season.

    Note: Permittees who during the process of construction wish to 
engage in equipment tests shall by informal written request, submitted 
to the Commission in triplicate not less than 30 days before they desire 
to begin such testing, indicate the frequencies they desire to use for 
testing and the hours they desire to use those frequencies. No equipment 
testing shall occur until the Commission has authorized frequencies and 
hours for such testing. Such authorizations shall be only for one 
season, and if it is desired to continue equipment testing in a 
following season, new requests for frequencies and hours must be 
submitted at least 30 days before it is desired to begin testing in the 
following season.

    (e) Within 14 days after the end of each season, a report shall be 
filed with the Commission by each licensee or permittee operating under 
program test authority who has been issued a seasonal schedule for that 
season. The report shall state whether the licensee or permittee has 
operated the number of frequency-hours authorized by the seasonal 
schedule to each of the zones or areas of reception specified in the 
schedule. If such operation has not occurred, a detailed explanation of 
that fact shall also be submitted which includes specific dates, 
frequency-hours not used, and reasons for the failure to operate as 
authorized. The report shall also contain information that has been 
received by the licensee or permittee as to reception or interference, 
and conclusions with regard to propagation characteristics of 
frequencies that were assigned for the season in question.
    (f) Frequencies assigned by the FCC shall be within the following 
bands which are allocated exclusively to the international broadcast 
service;
    (1) 5,950-6,200 kHz; 9,500-9,775 kHz; 11,700-11,975 kHz; 15,100-
15,450 kHz; 17,700-17,900 kHz; 21,450-21,750 kHz; 25,600-26,100 kHz.
    (2) In addition, the following band is allocated exclusively to the 
international broadcast service in Region 3:
    7,100-7,300 kHz. Assignments in this frequency band will be limited 
to international broadcast stations located in the area designated as 
Region 3 by No.

[[Page 247]]

395 of the International Radio Regulations and authorized only to 
transmit to zones and areas of reception situated outside Region 2 as 
defined in No. 394 of the International Radio Regulations. In addition, 
during the hours of 0800-1600 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) antenna 
gain with reference to an isotropic radiator in any easterly direction 
that would intersect any area in Region 2 shall not exceed 2.15 dBi, 
except in the case where a transmitter power of less than 100 kW is 
used. In this case, antenna gain on restricted azimuths shall not exceed 
that which is determined in accordance with equation below. Stations 
desiring to operate in this band must submit sufficient antenna 
performance information to ensure compliance with these restrictions. 
Permitted Gain for Transmitter powers less than 100 kW:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC13NO91.022

Where:

Gi=maximum gain permitted with reference to an isotropic radiator.
Pa=Transmitter power employed in kW.

    (3) The carrier frequencies assignable shall begin 5 kHz above the 
frequency specified above for the beginning of each band and shall be in 
sucessive steps of 5 kHz to and including 5 kHz below the frequency 
specified as the end of each band.
    (g) Frequencies requested for assignment must be as near as 
practicable to the optimum working frequency (unless otherwise 
justified) for the zone or area of reception for the period and path of 
transmission, and should be chosen so that a given frequency will 
provide the largest period of reliable transmission to the selected zone 
or area of reception. Moreover, at the zone or area of reception 
frequencies shall provide protection to the transmissions of other 
broadcasting stations which, in the opinion of the Commission, have 
priority of assignment.

    Note 1: Requests for frequency-hours shall be accompanied by all 
pertinent technical data with reference to the frequencies and hours of 
operation, including calculated field strengths delivered to the zones 
or areas of reception.
    Note 2: It is preferable that calculated field strengths delivered 
to zones or areas of reception be equal to or greater than those 
required by I.F.R.B. Technical Standards, Series A (and supplements 
thereto), in order for the I.F.R.B. to afford the notified assignment 
protection from interference. Nevertheless, calculated field strengths 
less than those required by the I.F.R.B. standards for protection will 
be acceptable to the Commission. However, licensees should note that if 
such lesser field strengths are submitted no protection from 
interference will be provided by the I.F.R.B. if their technical 
examination of such notifications show incompatibilities with other 
notified assignments fully complying with I.F.R.B. technical standards.
    Note 3: Licensees are permitted to engage in multiple operation as 
defined in Sec. 73.701(d).
    Note 4: Seasonal requests for frequency-hours will be only for 
transmissions to zones or areas of reception specified in the basic 
instrument of authorization. Changes in such zones or areas will be made 
only on separate application for modification of such instruments.

    (h) Not more than one frequency will be assigned for use at any one 
time for any one program transmission except in instances where a 
program is intended for reception in more than one zone or area of 
reception and the intended zones or areas cannot be served by a single 
frequency: Provided, however, That on a showing of good cause a licensee 
may be authorized to operate on more than one frequency at any one time 
to transmit any one program to a single zone or area of reception.
    (i) Any frequency assigned to a licensee or permittee shall also be 
available for assignment to other licensees or permittees.
    (j) All assignments of frequencies and the hours during which they 
will be used will be made with the express understanding that they are 
subject to immediate cancellation or change without hearing whenever the 
Commission determines that interference or propagation conditions so 
require and that each frequency-hour assignment for a given seasonal 
schedule is unique unto itself and not necessarily available for use 
during a subsequent season.
    (k) The total maximum number of frequency-hours which will be 
authorized to all licensees of international broadcasting stations 
during any one day for any season is 100. The number

[[Page 248]]

of frequency-hours allocated to any licensee will depend on past usage, 
availability, and need. If for a forthcoming season the total of the 
requests for daily frequency-hours of all licensees exceeds 100, all 
licensees will be notified and each licensee that makes an adequate 
showing that good cause exists for not having its requested number of 
frequency-hours reduced and that operation of its station without such 
reduction would be consistent with the public interest may be authorized 
the frequency-hours requested.

    Note: The provisions of this paragraph are not to be construed to 
mean that a total of 100 (or more) frequency-hours per day is assured 
licensees. Frequency-hours will only be assigned to the extent that they 
are available. It is the responsibility of each licensee to make all 
technical studies to show that frequency-hours requested by it are 
available and suitable for use as proposed.

Sec. 73.712  Equipment tests.

    (a) During the process of construction of an international 
broadcasting station, the permittee, having obtained authorization for 
frequencies and hours as set forth in the Note to Sec. 73.702(d) may, 
without further authority of the FCC, conduct equipment tests for the 
purpose of such adjustments and measurements as may be necessary to 
assure compliance with the terms of the construction permit, the 
technical provisions of the application therefor and the rules and 
regulations. Such tests shall use voice identification and test tones 
only. No programming shall be conducted during equipment tests.
    (b) The Commission may notify the permittee to conduct no tests or 
may cancel, suspend, or change the date for the beginning of equipment 
tests when and if such action may appear to be in the public interest, 
convenience, and necessity.
    (c) Equipment tests may be continued so long as the construction 
permit shall remain valid: Provided, however, That the procedure set 
forth in paragraph (a) of this section must be repeated prior to the 
conducting of such tests in each season after the season in which the 
testing began.
    (d) The authorization for tests embodied in this section shall not 
be construed as constituting a license to operate but as a necessary 
part of construction.

<R05>
Sec. 73.713  Program tests.

    (a) Upon completion of construction of an international broadcasting 
station in accordance with the terms of the construction permit, the 
technical provisions of the application therefor, and the rules and 
regulations and the applicable engineering standards, and when an 
application for station license has been filed showing the station to be 
in satisfactory operating condition, the permittee may request authority 
to conduct program tests. Such request shall be filed with the FCC at 
least 10 days prior to the date on which it is desired to begin such 
operation. All data necessary to show compliance with the terms and 
conditions of the construction permit must be filed with the license 
application.
    (b) Program tests shall not commence until specific Commission 
authority is received. The Commission reserves the right to change the 
date of the beginning of such tests or to suspend or revoke the 
authority for program tests as and when such action may appear to be in 
the public interest, convenience, and necessity.
    (c) Unless sooner suspended or revoked, program test authority 
continues valid during Commission consideration of the application for 
license and during this period further extension of the construction 
permit is not required. Program test authority shall be automatically

Sec. 73.1030  Notifications concerning interference to radio astronomy, research and receiving installations.

    (a) Radio astronomy and radio research installations. In order to 
minimize harmful interference at the National Radio Astronomy 
Observatory site located at Green, Pocahontas County, West Virginia, and 
at the Naval Radio Research Observatory at Sugar Grove, Pendleton 
County, West Virginia, a licensee proposing to operate a short-term 
broadcast auxiliary station pursuant to Sec. 74.24, or an applicant for 
authority to construct a new broadcast station or for authority to make 
changes in the frequency, power, antenna height, or antenna directivity 
of an existing station within the area bounded by 39 deg.15' N on the 
north, 78 deg.30' W on the east, 37 deg.30' N on the south, and 
80 deg.30' W on the west shall, at the time of filing such application 
with the FCC, simultaneously notify the following:

    Interference Office, National Radio Astronomy Observatory, P.O. Box 
2, Green Bank, West Virginia 24944, Telephone: 304-456-2011.


The notification shall be in writing and set forth the particulars of 
the proposed station, including the geographical coordinates of the 
antenna, antenna height, antenna directivity if any, proposed frequency, 
type of emission and power. In addition, the applicant shall indicate in 
his application to the FCC the date notification was made to the 
observatory. After receipt of such applications, the FCC will allow a 
period of 20 days for comments or objections in response to the 
notifications indicated. If an objection to the proposed operation is 
received during the 20-day period from the National Radio Astronomy 
Observatory for itself or on behalf of the Naval Radio Research 
Observatory, the FCC will consider all aspects of the problem and

[[Page 258]]

take whatever action is deemed appropriate.
    (b) Radio receiving installations. Protection for Table Mountain 
Radio Receiving Zone, Boulder County, Colorado: Applicants for a station 
authorization to operate in the vicinity of Boulder County, Colorado 
under this Part are advised to give due consideration, prior to filing 
applications, to the need to protect the Table Mountain Radio Receiving 
Zone from harmful interference. These are the research laboratories of 
the Department of Commerce, Boulder County, Colorado. To prevent 
degradation of the present ambient radio signal level at the site, the 
Department of Commerce seeks to ensure that the field strengths of any 
radiated signals (excluding reflected signals) received on this 1800 
acre site (within the area bounded by 40 deg.09'10'' N Latitude on the 
north, 105 deg.13'31'' W Longitude on the east, 40 deg.07'05'' N 
Latitude on the south, and 105 deg.15'13'' W Longitude on the west) 
resulting from new assignments (other than mobile stations) or from the 
modification of relocation of existing facilities do not exceed the 
following values:

Above 890 MHz.................................            1     \2\-85.8
------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Equivalent values of power flux density are calculated assuming free
  space characteristic impedance of 376.7=120 ohms.                     
\2\ Space stations shall conform to the power flux density limits at the
  earth's surface specified in appropriate parts of the FCC rules, but  
  in no case should exceed the above levels in any 4 kHz band for all   
  angles of arrival.                                                    

    (1) Advance consultation is recommended particularly for those 
applicants who have no reliable data which indicates whether the field 
strength or power flux density figures in the above table would be 
exceeded by their proposed radio facilities (except mobile stations). In 
such instances, the following is a suggested guide for determining 
whether coordination is recommended:
    (i) All stations within 2.4 km (1.5 statute miles);
    (ii) Stations within 4.8 km (3 statute miles) with 50 watts or more 
effective radiated power (ERP) in the primary plane polarization in the 
azimuthal direction of the Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone;
    (iii) Stations within 16 km (10 statute miles) with 1 kW or more ERP 
in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of Table 
Mountain Receiving Zone;
    (iv) Stations within 80 km (50 statute miles) with 25 kW or more ERP 
in the primary plane polarization in the azimuthal direction of Table 
Mountain Receiving Zone.
    (2) Applicants concerned are urged to communicate with the Radio 
Frequency Management Coordinator, Department of Commerce, Research 
Support Services, NOAA R/E5X2, Boulder Laboratories, Boulder, CO 80303; 
telephone (303) 497-6548, in advance of filing their applications with 
the Commission.
    (3) The Commission will not screen applications to determine whether 
advance consultation has taken place. However, applicants are advised 
that such consultation can avoid objectimns from the Department of 
Commerce or proceedings to modify any authorization which may be granted 
which, in fact, delivers a signal at the site in excess of the field 
strength specified herein.
    (c) Protection for Federal Communications Commission monitoring 
stations. (1) Applicants in the vicinity of a FCC monitoring station for 
a radio station authorization to operate new transmitting facilities or 
changed transmitting facilities which would increase the field strength 
produced over the monitoring station in excess of that previously 
authorized are advised to give consideration, prior to filing 
applications, to the possible need to protect the FCC stations from 
harmful interference. Geographical coordinates of the facilities which 
require protection are listed in Sec. 0.121(c) of the FCC rules. 
Applications for stations (except mobile stations) which will produce on 
any frequency a direct wave fundamental field strength of greater than 
10 mV/m in the authorized bandwidth of service (-65.8 dBW/m\2\ power 
flux density assuming a free space characteristic

[[Page 259]]

impedance of 120 <greek-p> ohms) at the referenced coordinates, may be 
examined to determine extent of possible interference. Depending on the 
theoretical field strength value and existing root-sum-square or other 
ambient radio field signal levels at the indicated coordinates, a clause 
protecting the monitoring station may be added to the station 
authorization.
    (2) In the event that calculated value of expected field exceeds 10 
mV/m (-65.8 dBW/m<SUP>2</SUP>) at the reference coordinates, or if there 
is any question whether field strength levels might exceed the threshold 
value, advance consultation with the FCC to discuss any protection 
necessary should be considered. Prospective applicants may communicate 
with: Chief, Compliance and Information Bureau, Federal Communications 
Commission, Washington, DC 20554, Telephone (202) 632-6980.
    (3) Advance consultation is suggested particularly for those 
applicants who have no reliable data which indicates whether the field 
strength or power flux density figure indicated would be exceeded by 
their proposed radio facilities (except mobile stations). In such 
instances, the following is a suggested guide for determining whether an 
applicant should coordinate:
    (i) All stations within 2.4 kilometers (1.5 statute miles);
    (ii) Stations within 4.8 kilometers (3 statute miles) with 50 watts 
or more average effective radiated power (ERP) in the primary plane of 
polarization in the azimuthal direction of the Monitoring Stations.
    (iii) Stations within 16 kilometers (10 statute miles) with 1 kW or 
more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal 
direction of the Monitoring Station;
    (iv) Stations within 80 kilometers (50 statute miles) with 25 kW or 
more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal 
direction of the Monitoring Station;
    (4) Advance coordination for stations operating above 1000 MHz is 
recommended only where the proposed station is in the vicinity of a 
monitoring station designated as a satellite monitoring facility in 
Sec. 0.121(c) of the Commission's Rules and also meets the criteria 
outlined in paragraphs (b) (2) and (3) of this section.
    (5) The Commission will not screen applications to determine whether 
advance consultation has taken place. However, applicants are advised 
that such consultation can avoid objections from the Federal 
Communications Commission or modification of any authorization which 
will cause harmful interference.

Sec. 73.1120  Station location.

    (a) Each AM, FM and TV broadcast station will be licensed to the 
principal community or other political subdivision which it primarily 
serves. This principal community (city, town or other political 
subdivision) will be considered to be the geographical station location.

<R05>
Sec. 73.1125  Station main studio location.

    (a) Each AM, FM and TV broadcast station shall maintain a main 
studio within the station's principal community contour as defined in 
Sec. 73.24(i) (5 mV/m daytime contour), Sec. 73.315(a) and 
Sec. 73.685(a), respectively, of this chapter, except
    (1) AM stations licensed as synchronous amplifier transmitters (``AM 
boosters'') or,
    (2) An FM station whose main studio is located at the collocated 
main studio-transmitter site of a commonly-owned AM station licensed to 
the same principal community or,
    (3) Any AM, FM or TV broadcast station whose main studio is located 
in the community to which the station is licensed to serve at a point 
situated outside the principal community contour or,
    (4) AM, FM or TV stations, when good cause exists for locating the 
main studio outside the station's principal community contour and that 
to do so would be consistent with the operation of the station in the 
public interest.

[[Page 260]]

    (b) Relocation of the main studio may be made:
    (1) From one point to another within the principal community contour 
or from a point outside the principal community contour to one within 
it, without specific FCC authority, but notification to the FCC in 
Washington shall be made promptly; however,
    (2) Written authority to locate a main studio outside a station's 
principal community contour for the first time must be obtained from the 
Audio Services Division, Mass Media Bureau for AM and FM stations, or 
the Television Branch, Video Services Division, Mass Media Bureau for 
television stations before the studio may be moved to that location. 
Where the main studio is already authorized at a location outside the 
station's principal community contour, and the licensee or permittee 
desires to specify a new location also located outside the station's 
principal community contour, written authority must also be received 
from the Commission prior to the relocation of the main studio. 
Authority for these changes may be requested by filing a letter with an 
explanation of the proposed changes with the appropriate division. 
Licensees or permittees should be aware that the filing of a letter 
request for written authority to locate the main studio outside the 
principal community contour does not imply approval of the relocation 
request, because each request is addressed on a case-by-case basis. A 
filing fee is required for commercial AM, FM, or TV licensees or 
permittees filing a letter request under this section (see Sec. 1.1104).
    (3) Exceptions to paragraph (b)(2) of this section are:
    (i) Relocation of the main studio of an FM station to the collocated 
main studio-transmitter site of a commonly-owned AM station licensed to 
the same principal community; and,
    (ii) Relocation of the main studio from one point to another within 
the principal community of license or from a point outside the principal 
community to one within it.
    (iii) Notification to the FCC in Washington shall be made promptly 
of such relocations described in paragraphs (b)(3) (i) and (ii) of this 
section.
    (c) Each AM, FM and TV broadcast station shall maintain a local 
telephone number in its community of license or a toll-free number.
    (d) Where the principal community to be served does not have 
specifically defined political boundaries, applications will be 
considered on a case-by-case basis by the FCC to determine if the main 
studio is located within the principal community to be served.

    Note: AM stations that simulcast on a frequency in the 535-1605 kHz 
band and on a frequency in the 1605-1705 kHz band need only have the 
studio be located within the 5 mV/m contour of the lower band operation 
during the term of the simultaneous operating authority. Upon 
termination of the 535-1605 kHz band portion of the dual frequency 
operation, the above rule shall then become applicable to the remaining 
operation in the 1605-1705 kHz band.

Sec. 73.1150  Transferring a station.

    (a) In transferring a broadcast station, the licensee may retain no 
right of reversion of the license, no right to reassignment of the 
license in the future, and may not reserve the right to use the 
facilities of the station for any period whatsoever.
    (b) No license, renewal of license, assignment of license or 
transfer of control of a corporate licensee will be granted or 
authorized if there is a contract, arrangement or understanding, express

Sec. 73.1201  Station identification.

    (a) When regularly required. Broadcast station identification 
announcements shall be made: (1) At the beginning and ending of each 
time of operation, and (2) hourly, as close to the hour as feasible, at 
a natural break in program offerings. Television broadcast stations may 
make these announcements visually or aurally.
    (b) Content. (1) Official station identification shall consist of 
the station's call letters immediately followed by the community or 
communities specified in its license as the station's location: 
Provided, That the name of the licensee or the station's frequency or 
channel number, or both, as stated on the station's license may be 
inserted between the call letters and station location. No other 
insertion is permissible.
    (2) A station may include in its official station identification the 
name of any additional community or communities, but the community to 
which the station is licensed must be named first.
    (c) Channel--(1) General. Except as otherwise provided in this 
paragraph, in making the identification announcement the call letters 
shall be given only on the channel identified thereby.
    (2) Simultaneous AM (535-1605 kHz) and AM (1605-1705 kHz broadcasts. 
If the same licensee operates an AM broadcast station in the 535-1605 
kHz band and an AM broadcast station in the 1605-1705 kHz band with both 
stations licensed to the same community and simultaneously broadcasts 
the same programs over the facilities of both such stations, station 
identification announcements may be made jointly for both stations for 
periods of such simultaneous operations.
    (3) Satellite operation. When programming of a broadcast station is 
rebroadcast simultaneously over the facilities of a satellite station, 
the originating station may make identification announcements for the 
satellite station for periods of such simultaneous operation.
    (i) In the case of a television broadcast station, such 
announcements, in addition to the information required by paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, shall include the number of the channel on which 
each station is operating.
    (ii) In the case of aural broadcast stations, such announcements, in 
addition to the information required by paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, shall include the frequency on which each station is operating.
    (d) Subscription television stations (STV). The requirements for 
official station identification applicable to TV stations will apply to 
Subscription TV stations except, during STV-encoded programming such 
station identification is not required. However, a station 
identification announcement will be made immediately prior to and 
following the encoded Subscription TV program period.

    (a) All written comments and suggestions received from the public by 
licensees of commercial AM, FM, and TV broadcast stations regarding 
operation of their station shall be maintained in the local public 
inspection file, unless the letter writer has requested that the letter 
not be made public or when the licensee feels that it should be excluded 
from public inspection because of the nature of its content, such as a 
defamatory or obscene letter.
    (1) Letters shall be retained in the local public inspection file 
for three years from the date on which they are received by the 
licensee.

[[Page 262]]

    (2) Letters received by TV licensees only shall be placed in one of 
the following separated subject categories: programming or non-
programming. If comments in a letter relate to both categories, the 
licensee shall file it under the category to which the writer has given 
the greater attention.

<R05>
Sec. 73.1206  Broadcast of telephone conversations.

    Before recording a telephone conversation for broadcast, or 
broadcasting such a conversation simultaneously with its occurrence, a 
licensee shall inform any party to the call of the licensee's intention 
to broadcast the conversation, except where such party is aware, or may 
be presumed to be aware from the circumstances of the conversation, that 
it is being or likely will be broadcast. Such awareness is presumed to 
exist only when the other party to the call is associated with the 
station (such as as employee or part-time reporter), or where the other 
party originates the call and it is obvious that it is in connection

Sec. 73.1207  Rebroadcasts.

    (a) The term rebroadcast means reception by radio of the programs or 
other transmissions of a broadcast or any other type of radio station, 
and the simultaneous or subsequent retransmission of such programs or 
transmissions by a broadcast station.
    (1) As used in this section, ``program'' includes any complete 
programs or part thereof.
    (2) The transmission of a program from its point of origin to a 
broadcast station entirely by common carrier facilities, whether by wire 
line or radio, is not considered a rebroadcast.
    (3) The broadcasting of a program relayed by a remote pickup 
broadcast station is not considered a rebroadcast.
    (b) No broadcast station may retransmit the program, or any part 
thereof, of another U.S. broadcast station without the express authority 
of the originating station. A copy of the written consent of the 
licensee originating the program must be kept by the licensee of the 
station retransmitting such program and made available to the FCC upon 
request.
    (1) Stations originating emergency communications under a State EAS 
plan are considered to have conferred rebroadcast authority to other 
participating stations.
    (2) Permission must be obtained from the originating station to 
rebroadcast any subsidiary communications transmitted by means of a 
multiplex subcarrier or telecommunications service on the vertical 
blanking interval or in the visual signal of a television signal.
    (3) Programs originated by the Voice of America (VOA) and the Armed 
Forces Radio and Television Services (AFRTS) cannot, in general, be 
cleared for domestic rebroadcast, and may therefore be retransmitted 
only by special arrangements among the parties concerned.
    (4) Except as otherwise provided by international agreement, 
programs originated by foreign broadcast stations may be retransmitted 
without the consent of the originating station.
    (c) The transmissions of non-broadcast stations may be rebroadcast 
under the following conditions:
    (1) Messages originated by privately-owned non-broadcast stations 
other than those in the Amateur and Citizens Band (CB) Radio Services 
may be broadcast only upon receipt of prior permission from the non-
broadcast licensee. Additionally, messages transmitted by common carrier 
stations may be rebroadcast only upon prior permission of the originator 
of the message as well as the station licensee.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, messages 
originated entirely by non-broadcast stations owned and operated by the 
Federal Government may be rebroadcast only upon receipt of prior 
permission from the government agency originating the messages.
    (3) Messages originated by stations in the amateur and Citizens Band 
(CB) radio services may be rebroadcast at the discretion of broadcast 
station licensees.

[[Page 263]]

    (4) Emergency communications originated under a State EAS plan.
    (d) The rebroadcasting of time signals originated by the Naval 
Observatory and the National Bureau of Standards and messages from the 
National Weather Service stations is permitted without specific 
authorization under the following procedures:
    (1) Naval Observatory Time Signals. (i) The time signals rebroadcast 
must be obtained by direct radio reception from a naval radio station, 
or by land line circuits.
    (ii) Announcement of the time signal must be made without reference 
to any commercial activity.
    (iii) Identification of the Naval Observatory as the source of the 
time signal must be made by an announcement, substantially as follows: 
``With the signal, the time will be . . . courtesy of the U.S. Naval 
Observatory.''
    (iv) Schedules of time signal broadcasts may be obtained upon 
request from the Superintendent, U.S. Naval Observatory, Washington, DC 
20390.
    (2) National Bureau of Standards Time Signals. (i) Time signals for 
rebroadcast must be obtained by direct radio reception from a National 
Bureau of Standards (NBS) station.
    (ii) Use of receiving and rebroadcasting equipment must not delay 
the signals by more than 0.05 second.
    (iii) Signals must be rebroadcast live, not from tape or other 
recording.
    (iv) Voice or code announcements of the call signs of NBS stations 
are not to be rebroadcast.
    (v) Identification of the origin of the service and the source of 
the signals must be made by an announcement substantially as follows: 
``At the tone, 11 hours 25 minutes Coordinated Universal Time. This is a 
rebroadcast of a continous service furnished by the National Bureau of 
Standards, Ft. Collins, Colo.'' No commercial sponsorship of this 
announcement is permitted and none may be implied.
    (vi) Schedules of time signal broadcasts may be obtained from, and 
notice of use of NBS time signals for rebroadcast must be forwarded 
semiannually to:

National Bureau of Standards, Radio Stations WWV/WWVB, 2000 East County 
Road 58, Ft. Collins, Colorado 80524.

    (vii) In the rebroadcasting of NBS time signals, announcements will 
not state that they are standard frequency transmissions. Voice 
announcements of Coordinated Universal Time are given in voice every 
minute. Each minute, except the first of the hour, begins with an 0.8 
second long tone of 1000 hertz at WWV and 1200 hertz tone at WWVH. The 
first minute of every hour begins with an 0.8 second long tone of 1500 
hertz at both stations. This tone is followed by a 3-second pause, than 
the announcement, ``National Bureau of Standards Time.'' This is 
followed by another 3-second pause before station identification. This 
arrangement allows broadcast stations sufficient time to retransmit the 
hour time tone and the words ``National Bureau of Standards Time'' 
either by manual or automatic switching.
    (viii) Time signals or scales made up from integration of standard 
frequency signals broadcast from NBS stations may not be designated as 
national standard scales of time or attributed to the NBS as originator. 
For example, if a broadcasting station transmits time signals obtained 
from a studio clock which is periodically calibrated against the NBS 
time signals from WWV or WWVH, such signals may not be announced as NBS 
standard time or as having been originated by the NBS.
    (3) National Weather Service Messages. (i) Messages of the National 
Weather Service must be rebroadcast within 1 hour of receipt.
    (ii) If advertisements are given in connection with weather 
rebroadcast, these advertisements must not directly or indirectly convey 
an endorsement by the U.S. Government of the products or services so 
advertised.
    (iii) Credit must be given to indicate that the rebroadcast message 
originates with the National Weather Service.

Sec. 73.1208  Broadcast of taped, filmed, or recorded material.

    (a) Any taped, filmed or recorded program material in which time is 
of special significance, or by which an affirmative attempt is made to 
create the impression that it is occurring simultaneously with the 
broadcast, shall be announced at the beginning as taped, filmed or 
recorded. The language of the announcement shall be clear and in terms 
commonly understood by the public. For television stations, the 
announcement may be made visually or aurally.
    (b) Taped, filmed, or recorded announcements which are of a 
commercial, promotional or public service nature need not be identified 
as taped, filmed or recorded.

Sec. 73.1210  TV/FM dual-language broadcasting in Puerto Rico.

    (a) For the purpose of this section, dual-language broadcasting 
shall be understood to mean the telecasting of a program in one language 
with the simultaneous transmission, on the main channel of a 
participating FM broadcast station, of companion sound track information 
in a different language.
    (b) Television broadcast licensees in Puerto Rico may enter into 
dual-language time purchase agreements with FM broadcast licensees, 
subject to the following conditions:
    (1) All such agreements shall be reduced to writing and retained by 
the licensee for possible Commission inspection, in accordance with 
Sec. 73.3613 of this chapter.
    (2) All such agreements shall specify that the FM licensee will 
monitor sound track material with a view to rejecting any material 
deemed to be inappropriate or objectionable for broadcast exposure.
    (3) No television or FM broadcast station may devote more than 15 
hours per week to dual-language broadcasting, nor may more than three 
(3) hours of such programming be presented on any given day.
    (4) Noncommercial educational television broadcast stations shall 
take all necessary precautions to assure that the entire operation is 
conducted on a noncommercial basis and otherwise in accordance with 
Sec. 73.621 of this part.

<R05>
Sec. 73.1211  Broadcast of lottery information.

    (a) No licensee of an AM, FM, or television broadcast station, 
except as in paragraph (c) of this section, shall broadcast any 
advertisement of or information concerning any lottery, gift enterprise, 
or similar scheme, offering prizes dependent in whole or in part upon 
lot or chance, or any list of the prizes drawn or awarded by means of 
any such lottery, gift enterprise or scheme, whether said list contains 
any part or all of such prizes. (18 U.S.C. 1304, 62 Stat. 763).
    (b) The determination whether a particular program comes within the 
provisions of paragraph (a) of this section depends on the facts of each 
case. However, the Commission will in any event consider that a program 
comes within the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section if in 
connection with such program a prize consisting of money or other thing 
of value is awarded to any person whose selection is dependent in whole 
or in part upon lot or chance, if as a condition of winning or competing 
for such prize, such winner or winners are required to furnish any money 
or other thing of value or are required to have in their possession any 
product sold, manufactured, furnished or distributed by a sponsor of a 
program broadcast on the station in question. (See 21 FCC 2d 846).
    (c) The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall 
not apply to an advertisement, list of prizes or other information 
concerning:

[[Page 265]]

    (1) A lottery conducted by a State acting under the authority of 
State law which is broadcast by a radio or television station licensed 
to a location in that State or any other State which conducts such a 
lottery. (18 U.S.C. 1307(a); 102 Stat. 3205).
    (2) Fishing contests exempted under 18 U.S. Code 1305 (not conducted 
for profit, i.e., all receipts fully consumed in defraying the actual 
costs of operation).
    (3) Any gaming conducted by an Indian Tribe pursuant to the Indian 
Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.)
    (4) A lottery, gift enterprise or similar scheme, other than one 
described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, that is authorized or not 
otherwise prohibited by the State in which it is conducted and which is:
    (i) Conducted by a not-for-profit organization or a governmental 
organization (18 U.S.C. 1307(a); 102 Stat. 3205); or
    (ii) Conducted as a promotional activity by a commercial 
organization and is clearly occasional and ancillary to the primary 
business of that organization. (18 U.S.C. 1307(a); 102 Stat. 3205).
    (d)(1) For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, ``lottery'' 
means the pooling of proceeds derived from the sale of tickets or 
chances and allotting those proceeds or parts thereof by chance to one 
or more chance takers or ticket purchasers. It does not include the 
placing or accepting of bets or wagers on sporting events or contests.
    (2) For purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the term 
``not-for-profit organization'' means any organization that would

<R05>
Sec. 73.1212  Sponsorship identification; list retention; related requirements.

    (a) When a broadcast station transmits any matter for which money, 
service, or other valuable consideration is either directly or 
indirectly paid or promised to, or charged or accepted by such station, 
the station, at the time of the broadcast, shall announce:
    (1) That such matter is sponsored, paid for, or furnished, either in 
whole or in part, and
    (2) By whom or on whose behalf such consideration was supplied: 
Provided, however, That ``service or other valuable consideration'' 
shall not include any service or property furnished either without or at 
a nominal charge for use on, or in connection with, a broadcast unless 
it is so furnished in consideration for an identification of any person, 
product, service, trademark, or brand name beyond an identification 
reasonably related to the use of such service or property on the 
broadcast.
    (i) For the purposes of this section, the term ``sponsored'' shall 
be deemed to have the same meaning as ``paid for.''
    (ii) In the case of any television political advertisement 
concerning candidates for public office, the sponsor shall be identified 
with letters equal to or greater than four percent of the vertical 
picture height that air for not less than four seconds.
    (b) The licensee of each broadcast station shall exercise reasonable 
diligence to obtain from its employees, and from other persons with whom 
it deals directly in connection with any matter for broadcast, 
information to enable such licensee to make the announcement required by 
this section.
    (c) In any case where a report has been made to a broadcast station 
as required by section 507 of the Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended, of circumstances which would have required an announcement 
under this section had the consideration been received by such broadcast 
station, an appropriate announcement shall be made by such station.
    (d) In the case of any political broadcast matter or any broadcast 
matter involving the discussion of a controversial issue of public 
importance for which any film, record, transcription, talent, script, or 
other material or service of any kind is furnished, either directly or 
indirectly, to a station as an inducement for broadcasting such matter, 
an announcement shall be made both at the beginning and conclusion of 
such broadcast on which such material or service is used that such film, 
record, transcription, talent,

[[Page 266]]

script, or other material or service has been furnished to such station 
in connection with the transmission of such broadcast matter: Provided, 
however, That in the case of any broadcast of 5 minutes' duration or 
less, only one such announcement need be made either at the beginning or 
conclusion of the broadcast.
    (e) The announcement required by this section shall, in addition to 
stating the fact that the broadcast matter was sponsored, paid for or 
furnished, fully and fairly disclose the true identity of the person or 
persons, or corporation, committee, association or other unincorporated 
group, or other entity by whom or on whose behalf such payment is made 
or promised, or from whom or on whose behalf such services or other 
valuable consideration is received, or by whom the material or services 
referred to in paragraph (d) of this section are furnished. Where an 
agent or other person or entity contracts or otherwise makes 
arrangements with a station on behalf of another, and such fact is known 
or by the exercise of reasonable diligence, as specified in paragraph 
(b) of this section, could be known to the station, the announcement 
shall disclose the identity of the person or persons or entity on whose 
behalf such agent is acting instead of the name of such agent. Where the 
material broadcast is political matter or matter involving the 
discussion of a controversial issue of public importance and a 
corporation, committee, association or other unincorporated group, or 
other entity is paying for or furnishing the broadcast matter, the 
station shall, in addition to making the announcement required by this 
section, require that a list of the chief executive officers or members 
of the executive committee or of the board of directors of the 
corporation, committee, association or other unincorporated group, or 
other entity shall be made available for public inspection at the 
location specified by the licensee under Sec. 73.3526 of this chapter. 
If the broadcast is originated by a network, the list may, instead, be 
retained at the headquarters office of the network or at the location 
where the originating station maintains its public inspection file under 
Sec. 73.3526 of this chapter. Such lists shall be kept and made 
available for a period of two years.
    (f) In the case of broadcast matter advertising commercial products 
or services, an announcement stating the sponsor's corporate or trade 
name, or the name of the sponsor's product, when it is clear that the 
mention of the name of the product constitutes a sponsorship 
identification, shall be deemed sufficient for the purpose of this 
section and only one such announcement need be made at any time during 
the course of the broadcast.
    (g) The announcement otherwise required by section 317 of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, is waived with respect to the 
broadcast of ``want ad'' or classified advertisements sponsored by an 
individual. The waiver granted in this paragraph shall not extend to a 
classified advertisement or want ad sponsorship by any form of business 
enterprise, corporate or otherwise. Whenever sponsorship announcements 
are omitted pursuant to this paragraph, the licensee shall observe the 
following conditions:
    (1) Maintain a list showing the name, address, and (where available) 
the telephone number of each advertiser;
    (2) Make this list available to members of the public who have a 
legitimate interest in obtaining the information contained in the list. 
Such list must be retained for a period of two years after broadcast.
    (h) Any announcement required by section 317(b) of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, is waived with respect to 
feature motion picture film produced initially and primarily for theatre 
exhibition.

    Note: The waiver heretofore granted by the Commission in its Report 
and Order adopted November 16, 1960 (FCC 60-1369; 40 F.C.C. 95), 
continues to apply to programs filmed or recorded on or before June 20, 
1963, when Sec. 73.654, the predecessor television rule, went into 
effect.

    (i) Commission interpretations in connection with the provisions of 
the sponsorship identification rules are contained in the Commission's 
Public Notice, entitled ``Applicability of Sponsorship Identification 
Rules,'' dated May 6, 1963 (40 F.C.C. 141), as modified by Public

Sec. 73.1215  Specifications for indicating instruments.

    The following requirements and specifications shall apply to 
indicating instruments used by broadcast stations:
    (a) Linear scale instruments:
    (1) Length of scale shall not be less than 2.3 inches (5.8 cm).
    (2) Accuracy shall be at least 2 percent of the full scale reading.
    (3) The maximum rating of the meter shall be such that it does not 
read off scale during modulation or normal operation.
    (4) Scale shall have at least 40 divisions.
    (5) Full scale reading shall not be greater than five times the 
minimum normal indication.
    (b) Instruments having square-law scales:
    (1) Meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) (1), (2), and (3) of 
this section for linear scale instruments.
    (2) Full scale reading shall not be greater than three times the 
minimum normal indication.
    (3) No scale division above one-third full scale reading shall be 
greater than one-thirtieth of the full scale reading. (Example: An 
ammeter meeting requirement (1) having full scale reading of 6 amperes 
is acceptable for reading currents from 2 to 6 amperes, provided no 
scale division between 2 and 6 amperes is greater than one-thirtieth of 
6 amperes, 0.2 ampere.)
    (c) Instruments having logarithmic scales:
    (1) Meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) (1), (2), and (3) of 
this section for linear scale instruments.
    (2) Full scale reading shall not be greater than five times the 
minimum normal indication.
    (3) No scale division above one-fifth full scale reading (in watts) 
shall be greater than one-thirtieth of the full scale reading. (Example: 
A wattmeter meeting requirement (3) having full scale reading of 1,500 
watts is acceptable for reading power from 300 to 1,500 watts, provided 
no scale division between 300 and 1,500 watts is greater than one-
thirtieth of 1,500 watts or 50 watts.)
    (d) Instruments having expanded scales:
    (1) Shall meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) (1), (2), and (3) 
of this section for linear scale instruments.
    (2) Full scale reading shall not be greater than five times the 
minimum normal indication.
    (3) No scale division above one-fifth full scale reading shall be 
greater than one-fiftieth of the full scale reading. (Example: An 
ammeter meeting the requirement (1) is acceptable for indicating current 
from 1 to 5 amperes, provided no division between 1 and 5 amperes is 
greater than one-fiftieth of 5 amperes, 0.1 ampere.)
    (e) Digital meters, printers, or other numerical readout devices may 
be used in addition to or in lieu of indicating instruments meeting the 
specifications of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section. The 
readout of the device must include at least three digits and must 
indicate the value of the parameter being read to an accuracy of 2%. The 
multiplier, if any, to be applied to the reading of each parameter must 
be indicated at the operating position.
    (f) No instrument which has been broken or appears to be damaged or 
defective, or the accuracy of which is questionable shall be used, until 
it has

[[Page 268]]

been checked, and if necessary repaired and recalibrated by the 
manufacturer or qualified instrument repair service. Repaired 
instruments shall not be used unless a certificate of calibration has 
been provided showing that the instrument conforms to the manufacturer's 
specifications for accuracy.

Sec. 73.1216  Licensee-conducted contests.

    A licensee that broadcasts or advertises information about a contest 
it conducts shall fully and accurately disclose the material terms of 
the contest, and shall conduct the contest substantially as announced or 
advertised. No contest description shall be false, misleading or 
deceptive with respect to any material term.

    Note 1: For the purposes of this rule:
    (a) A contest is a scheme in which a prize is offered or awarded, 
based upon chance, diligence, knowledge or skill, to members of the 
public.
    (b) Material terms include those factors which define the operation 
of the contest and which affect participation therein. Although the 
material terms may vary widely depending upon the exact nature of the 
contest, they will generally include: how to enter or participate; 
eligibility restrictions; entry deadline dates; whether prizes can be 
won; when prizes can be won; the extent, nature and value of prizes; 
basis for valuation of prizes; time and means of selection of winners; 
and/or tie-breaking procedures.

    Note 2: In general, the time and manner of disclosure of the 
material terms of a contest are within the licensee's discretion. 
However, the obligation to disclose the material terms arises at the 
time the audience is first told how to enter or participate and 
continues thereafter. The material terms should be disclosed 
periodically by announcements broadcast on the station conducting the 
contest, but need not be enumerated each time an announcement promoting 
the contest is broadcast. Disclosure of material terms in a reasonable 
number of announcements is sufficient. In addition to the required 
broadcast announcements, disclosure of the material terms may be made in 
a non-broadcast manner.

    Note 3: This rule is not applicable to licensee-conducted contests 
not broadcast or advertised to the general public or to a substantial 
segment thereof, to contests in which the general public is not 
requested or permitted to participate, to the commercial advertisement 
of non-licensee-conducted contests, or to a contest conducted by a non-
broadcast division of the licensee or by a non-broadcast company related 
to the licensee.

<R05>
Sec. 73.1217  Broadcast hoaxes.

    No licensee or permittee of any broadcast station shall broadcast 
false information concerning a crime or a catastrophe if:
    (a) The licensee knows this information is false;
    (b) It is forseeable that broadcast of the information will cause 
substantial public harm, and
    (c) Broadcast of the information does in fact directly cause 
substantial public harm.

Any programming accompanied by a disclaimer will be presumed not to pose 
foreseeable harm if the disclaimer clearly characterizes the program as 
a fiction and is presented in a way that is reasonable under the 
circumstances.

    Note: For purposes of this rule, ``public harm'' must begin 
immediately, and cause direct and actual damage to property or to the 
health or safety of the general public, or diversion of law enforcement 
or other public health and safety authorities from their duties. The 
public harm will be deemed foreseeable if the licensee could expect with 
a significant degree of certainty that public harm would occur. A 
``crime'' is any act or omission that makes the offender subject to 
criminal punishment by law. A ``catastrophe'' is a disaster or imminent 
disaster involving violent or sudden event affecting the public.

Sec. 73.1250  Broadcasting emergency information.

    (a) Emergency situations in which the broadcasting of information is 
considered as furthering the safety of life and property include, but 
are not limited to the following: Tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, tidal 
waves, earthquakes, icing conditions, heavy snows, widespread fires, 
discharge of toxic gasses, widspread power failures, industrial 
explosions, civil disorders and school closing and changes in school bus 
schedules resulting from such conditions. See also Sec. 73.3542, 
Application for Emergency Authorization, for requirements involving 
emergency situations not covered by this section for which prior 
operating authority must be requested.
    (b) If requested by responsible public officials, a station may, at 
its discretion, and without further FCC authority, transmit emergency 
point-to-point messages for the purpose of requesting or dispatching aid 
and assisting in rescue operations.
    (c) If the Emergency Alert System (EAS) is activated for a national 
emergency while a Local Area or State emergency operation is in 
progress, the national level EAS operation must take precedence. If, 
during the broadcasting of Local Area or State emergency information, 
the EAS codes or Attention Signal described in Sec. 11.12 of this 
chapter are used, the broadcasts are considered as being carried out 
under a Local Area or State EAS plan.
    (d) Any emergency operation undertaken in accordance with this 
section may be terminated by the FCC if required in the public interest.
    (e) Immediately upon cessation of an emergency during which 
broadcast facilities were used for the transmission of point-to-point 
messages under paragraph (b) of this section, or when daytime facilities 
were used during nighttime hours by an AM station in accordance with 
paragraph (f) of this section, a report in letter form shall be 
forwarded to the FCC in Washington, DC, setting forth the nature of the 
emergency, the dates and hours of the broadcasting of emergency 
information, and a brief description of the material carried during the 
emergency. A certification of compliance with the noncommercialization 
provision of paragraph (f) of this section must accompany the report 
where daytime facilities are used during nighttime hours by an AM 
station, together with a detailed showing, under the provisisons of that 
paragraph, that no other broadcast service existed or was adequate.
    (f) AM stations may, without further FCC authority, use their full 
daytime facilities during nighttime hours to broadcast emergency 
information (examples listed in paragraph (a) of this section), when 
necessary to the safety of life and property, in dangerous conditions of 
a general nature and when adequate advance warning cannot be given with 
the facilities authorized. Because of skywave interference impact on 
other stations assigned to the same channel, such operation may be 
undertaken only if regular, unlimited-time service, is non-existent, 
inadequate from the standpoint of coverage, or not serving the public 
need. All operation under this paragraph must be conducted on a 
noncommercial basis. Recorded music may be used to the extent necessary 
to provide program continuity.
    (g) Broadcasting of emergency information shall be confined to the 
hours, frequencies, powers and modes of operation specified in the 
station license, except as otherwise provided for AM stations in 
paragraph (f) of this section.

[[Page 271]]

    (h) Any emergency information transmitted by a TV station in 
accordance with this section shall be transmitted both aurally and 
visually or only visually. TV stations may use any method of visual 
presentation which results in a legible message conveying the essential 
emergency information. Methods which may be used include, but are not 
necessarily limited to, slides, electronic captioning, manual methods 
(e.g., hand printing) or mechanical printing processes. However, when an 
emergency operation is being conducted under a national, State or Local 
Area Emergency Alert System (EAS) plan, emergency information shall be 
transmitted both aurally and visually unless only the EAS codes are 
transmitted as specified in Sec. 11.51(b) of this chapter.

Sec. 73.1300  Unattended station operation.

    Broadcast stations may be operated as either attended (where a 
designated person is responsible for the proper operation of the 
transmitting apparatus either at the transmitter site, a remote control 
point or an ATS control point) or unattended (where highly stable 
equipment or automated monitoring of station operating parameters is 
employed). No prior FCC approval is required to operate a station in the 
unattended mode. Regardless of which method of station operation is 
employed, licensees must employ procedures which will ensure compliance 
with Part 11 of this chapter, the rules governing the Emergency Alert 
System (EAS).

[60 FR 55481, Nov. 1, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 73.1350  Transmission system operation.

    (a) Each licensee is responsible for maintaining and operating its 
broadcast station in a manner which complies with the technical rules 
set forth elsewhere in this part and in accordance with the terms of the 
station authorization.
    (b) The licensee must designate a chief operator in accordance with 
Sec. 73.1870. The licensee may designate one or more technically 
competent persons to adjust the transmitter operating parameters for 
compliance with the technical rules and the station authorization.
    (1) Persons so authorized by the licensee may make such adjustments 
directly at the transmitter site or by using control equipment at an 
off-site location.
    (2) The transmitter control personnel must have the capability to 
turn the transmitter off at all times. If the personnel are at a remote 
location, the control system must provide this capability continuously 
or must include an alternate method of acquiring control that can 
satisfy the requirement of paragraph (d) of this section that operation 
be terminated within 3 minutes.
    (c) The licensee must establish monitoring procedures and schedules 
for the station and the indicating instruments employed must comply with 
Sec. 73.1215.
    (1) Monitoring procedures and schedules must enable the licensee to 
determine compliance with Sec. 73.1560 regarding operating power and AM 
station mode of operation, Sec. 73.1570 regarding modulation levels, 
and, where applicable, Sec. 73.1213 regarding antenna tower lighting, 
and Sec. 73.69 regarding the parameters of an AM directional antenna 
system.
    (2) Monitoring equipment must be periodically calibrated so as to 
provide reliable indications of transmitter operating parameters with a 
known degree of accuracy. Errors inherent in monitoring equipment and 
the calibration procedure must be taken into account when adjusting 
operating parameters to ensure that the limits imposed by the technical 
rules and the station authorization are not exceeded.
    (d) In the event that a broadcast station is operating in a manner 
that is not in compliance with the technical rules set forth elsewhere 
in this part or the terms of the station authorization, and the 
condition is not listed in paragraph (e) of this section, broadcast 
operation must be terminated within three hours.
    (1) Examples of conditions that require termination of operation 
include excessive power or excessive modulation.

[[Page 272]]

    (2) Additional examples for AM stations are any mode of operation 
not specified by the station license for the pertinent time of day or 
hours of operation and any condition of antenna parameters or monitoring 
points out of the tolerances specified elsewhere in this part or by the 
station's instrument of authorization. For these conditions, operation 
must be terminated within three minutes unless antenna input power is 
reduced sufficiently to eliminate any excess radiation.
    (3) For AM stations using directional arrays, additional procedures 
apply when array operating parameters are at variance, monitoring points 
exceed specified limits, or authorized directional mode capability is 
lost. See Sec. 73.62, Directional antenna system tolerances; 
Sec. 73.158, Directional antenna monitoring points; and Sec. 73.1680(b), 
Emergency antennas.
    (e) If a broadcast station is operating in a manner that is not in 
compliance with one of the following technical rules, operation may 
continue if the station complies with relevant alternative provisions in 
the specified rule section.
    (1) AM directional antenna system tolerances, see Sec. 73.62;
    (2) AM directional antenna monitoring points, see Sec. 73.158;
    (3) TV visual waveform, see Sec. 73.691(b);
    (4) Reduced power operation, see Sec. 73.1560(d);
    (5) Reduced modulation level, see Sec. 73.1570(a);
    (6) Emergency antennas, see Sec. 73.1680.
    (f) The transmission system must be maintained and inspected in 
accordance with Sec. 73.1580.
    (g) Whenever a transmission system control point is established at a 
location other than at the main studio or transmitter, notification of 
that location must be sent to the FCC in Washington, D.C. within 3 days 
of the initial use of that point. This notification is not required if 
responsible station personnel can be contacted at the transmitter or 
studio site during hours of operation.
    (h) The licensee must ensure that the station is operated in 
compliance with Part 11 of this chapter, the rules governing the 
Emergency Alert System (EAS).

[60 FR 55481, Nov. 1, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 73.1400  Transmission system monitoring and control.

    The licensee of an AM, FM or TV station is responsible for assuring 
that at all times the station operates within tolerances specified by 
applicable technical rules contained in this part and in accordance with 
the terms of the station authorization. Any method of complying with 
applicable tolerances is permissible. The following are typical methods 
of transmission system operation:
    (a) Attended operation. (1) Attended operation consists of ongoing 
supervision of the transmission facilities by a station employee or 
other person designated by the licensee. Such supervision may be 
accomplished by either:
    (i) Direct supervision and control of transmission system parameters 
by a person at the transmitter site; or
    (ii) Remote control of the transmission system by a person at the 
main studio or other location. The remote control system must provide 
sufficient transmission system monitoring and control capability so as 
to ensure compliance with Sec. 73.1350.
    (2) A station may also be monitored and controlled by an automatic 
transmission system (ATS) that is configured to contact a person 
designated by the licensee in the event of a technical malfunction. An 
automatic transmission system consists of monitoring devices, control 
and alarm circuitry, arranged so that they interact automatically to 
operate the station's transmitter and maintain technical parameters 
within licensed values.
    (3) A hybrid system containing some remote control and some ATS 
features is also permissible.
    (4) In the case of remote control or ATS operation, not every 
station parameter need be monitored or controlled if the licensee has 
good reason to believe that its stability is so great that its 
monitoring and control are unnecessary.
    (b) Unattended operation. Unattended operation is either the absence 
of human supervision or the substitution of automated supervision of a 
station's

[[Page 273]]

transmission system for human supervision. In the former case, equipment 
is employed which is expected to operate within assigned tolerances for 
extended periods of time. The latter consists of the use of a self-
monitoring or ATS-monitored and controlled transmission system that, in 
lieu of contacting a person designated by the licensee, automatically 
takes the station off the air within three hours of any technical 
malfunction which is capable of causing interference.

Sec. 73.1510  Experimental authorizations.

    (a) Licensees of broadcast stations may obtain experimental 
authorizations to conduct technical experimentation directed toward 
improvement of the technical phases of operation and service, and for 
such purposes may use a signal other than the normal broadcast program 
signal.
    (b) Experimental authorizations may be requested by filing an 
informal application with the FCC in Washington, DC, describing the 
nature and purpose of the experimentation to be conducted, the nature of 
the experimental signal to be transmitted, and the proposed schedule of 
hours and duration of the experimentation. Experimental authorizations 
shall be posted with the station license.
    (c) Experimental operations are subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The authorized power of the station may not be exceeded, except 
as specifically authorized for the experimental operations.
    (2) Emissions outside the authorized bandwidth must be attenuated to 
the degree required for the particular type of station.
    (3) The experimental operations may be conducted at any time the 
station is authorized to operate, but the minimum required schedule of 
programming for the class and type of station must be met. AM stations 
also may conduct experimental operations during the experimental period 
(12 midnight local time to local sunrise) and at additional hours if 
permitted by the experimental authorization provided no interference is 
caused to other stations maintaining a regular operating schedule within 
such period(s).
    (4) If an experimental authorization permits the use of additional 
facilities or hours of operation for experimental purposes, no sponsored 
programs or commercial announcements may be transmitted during such 
experimentation.
    (5) The licensee may transmit regularly scheduled programming 
concurrently with the experimental transmission if there is no 
significant impairment of service.
    (6) No charges may be made, either directly or indirectly, for the 
experimentation; however, normal charges may be made for regularly 
scheduled programming transmitted concurrently with the experimental 
transmissions.
    (d) The FCC may request a report of the research, experimentation 
and results at the conclusion of the experimental operation.

    (1) Purpose, duration and need for the survey.
    (2) Frequency, transmitter output powers and time of operation.
    (3) A brief description of the test antenna system, its estimated 
effective radiated field and height above ground or average terrain, and 
the geographic coordinates of its proposed location(s).
    (c) Operation under a special field test authorization is subject to 
the following conditions:

[[Page 274]]

    (1) No objectionable interference will result to the operation of 
other authorized radio services; in this connection, the power requested 
shall not exceed that necessary for the purposes of the test.
    (2) The carriers will be unmodulated except for the transmission of 
a test-pattern on a visual TV transmitter, and for hourly voice station 
identification on aural AM, FM and TV transmitters.
    (3) The transmitter output power or antenna input power may not 
exceed those specified in the test authorization and the operating power 
must be maintained at a constant value for each phase of the tests.
    (4) The input power to the final amplifier stage, and the AM antenna 
current or the FM or TV transmitter output power must be observed and 
recorded at half hour intervals and at any time that the power is 
adjusted or changed. Copies of these records must be submitted to the 
FCC with the required report.
    (5) The test equipment may not be permanently installed, unless such 
installation has been separately authorized. Mobile units are not deemed 
permanent installations.
    (6) Test transmitters must be operated by or under the immediate 
direction of an operator holding a commercial radio operator license 
(any class, unless otherwise endorsed).
    (7) A report, containing the measurements, their analysis and other 
results of the survey shall be filed with the FCC in Washington, DC 
within sixty (60) days following the termination of the test 
authorization.
    (8) The test transmission equipment, installation and operation 
thereof need not comply with the requirements of FCC rules and standards 
except as specified in this section if the equipment, installation and 
operation are consistent with good engineering principles and practices.
    (d) A special field test authorization may be modified or terminated 
by notification from the FCC if in its judgment such action will promote 
the public interest, convenience and necessity.

Sec. 73.1560  Operating power and mode tolerances.

    (a) AM stations. (1) Except as provided for in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the antenna input power of an AM station as determined by the 
procedures specified in Sec. 73.51 must be maintained as near as is 
practicable to the authorized antenna input power and may not be less 
than 90% nor more than 105% of the authorized power.
    (2) Whenever the transmitter of an AM station cannot be placed into 
the specified operating mode at the time required, transmissions of the 
station must be immediately terminated. However, if the radiated field 
at any bearing or elevation does not exceed that permitted for that time 
of day, operation in the mode with the lesser radiated field may 
continue under the notification procedures of paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (b) FM stations. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the transmitter output power of an FM station, with power 
output as determined by the procedures specified in Sec. 73.267, which 
is authorized for output power more than 10 watts must be maintained as 
near as practicable to the authorized transmitter output power and may 
not be less than 90% nor more than 105% of the authorized power. FM 
stations operating with authorized transmitter output power of 10 watts 
or less, may operate at less than the authorized power, but not more 
than 105% of the authorized power.
    (c) TV stations. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the visual output power of a TV transmitter, as determined by 
the procedures specified in Sec. 73.663, must be maintained as near as 
is practicable to the authorized transmitter output power and may not be 
less than 80% nor more than 110% of the authorized power.
    (2) The output power of the aural transmitter shall be maintained to 
provide an aural carrier ERP not to exceed 22% of the peak authorized 
visual ERP.
    (3) The FCC may specify deviation from the power of tolerance 
requirements for subscription television operations to the extent it 
deems necessary to permit proper operation.
    (d) Reduced power operation. In the event it becomes technically 
impossible to operate with the authorized power, a broadcast station may 
operate at reduced power for a period of not more than 30 days without 
specific authority from the FCC. If operation at reduced power will 
exceed 10 consecutive days, a notification must be sent to the FCC in 
Washington, D.C., not

Sec. 73.1570  Modulation levels: AM, FM, and TV aural.

    (a) The percentage of modulation is to be maintained at as high a 
level as is consistent with good quality of transmission and good 
broadcast service, with maximum levels not to exceed the values 
specified in paragraph (b). Generally, the modulation should not be less 
than 85% on peaks of frequent recurrence, but where lower modulation 
levels may be required to avoid objectionable loudness or to maintain 
the dynamic range of the program material, the degree of modulation may 
be reduced to whatever level is necessary for this purpose, even though 
under such circumstances, the level may be substantially less than that 
which produces peaks of frequent recurrence at a level of 85%.
    (b) Maximum modulation levels must meet the following limitations:
    (1) AM stations. In no case shall the amplitude modulation of the 
carrier wave exceed 100% on negative peaks of frequent recurrence, or 
125% on positive peaks at any time.
    (i) AM stations transmitting stereophonic programs not exceed the AM 
maximum stereophonic transmission signal modulation specifications of 
stereophonic system in use.
    (ii) For AM stations transmitting telemetry signals for remote 
control or automatic transmission system operation, the amplitude of 
modulation of the carrier by the use of subaudible tones must not be 
higher than necessary to effect reliable and accurate data transmission 
and may not, in any case, exceed 6%.
    (2) FM Stations. The total modulation must not exceed 100 percent on 
peaks of frequent reoccurrence referenced to 75 kHz deviation. However, 
stations providing subsidiary communications services using subcarriers 
under provisions of Sec. 73.319 concurrently with the broadcasting of 
stereophonic or monophonic programs may increase the peak modulation 
deviation as follows:
    (i) The total peak modulation may be increased 0.5 percent for each 
1.0 percent subcarrier injection modulation.
    (ii) In no event may the modulation of the carrier exceed 110 
percent (82.5 kHz peak deviation).

    (3) TV station. In no case shall the total modulation of the aural 
carrier exceed 100% on peaks of frequent recurrence, unless some other 
peak modulation level is specified in an instrument of authorization. 
For monophonic transmissions, 100% modulation is defined as 
<plus-minus>25 kHz.
    (c) If a limiting or compression amplifier is employed to maintain 
modulation levels, precaution must be taken so as not to substantially 
alter the dynamic characteristics of programs.

Sec. 73.1610  Equipment tests.

    (a) During the process of construction of a new broadcast station, 
the permittee, after notifying the FCC in Washington, D.C. may, without 
further authority from the FCC, conduct equipment tests for the purpose 
of making such adjustments and measurements as may be necessary to 
assure compliance with the terms of the construction permit, the 
technical provisions of the application therefore, the rules and 
regulations and the applicable engineering standards. For AM stations, 
equipment tests, including either a directional or nondirectional proof 
of performance required by the construction permit, may be conducted 
during daytime hours provided that the antenna system is first 
substantially tuned during the experimental period. The nondirectional 
proof shall be conducted with power adjusted to 25% of that specified in 
the permit for the authorized directional facilities or, if applicable, 
to such higher power as is specified in the same permit for authorized 
nondirectional facilities. For licensed stations, see Sec. 73.1615,

<R05>
Sec. 73.1615  Operation during modification of facilities.

    When the licensee of an existing AM, FM or TV station is in the 
process of modifying existing facilities as authorized by a construction 
permit and determines it is necessary to either discontinue operation or 
to operate with temporary facilities to continue program service, the 
following procedures apply:
    (a) Licensees holding a construction permit for modification of 
directional or nondirectional FM and TV or nondirectional AM station 
facilities may, without specific FCC authority, for a period not 
exceeding 30 days:
    (1) Discontinue operation, or
    (2) Operate with temporary facilities to maintain, as nearly as 
possible, but not exceed, the size of the presently licensed coverage 
area.
    (b) Licensees of an AM station holding a construction permit which 
involves directional facilities and which does not involve a change in 
operating frequency may, without specific FCC authority, for a period 
not exceeding 30 days:
    (1) Discontinue operation, or
    (2) Operate with reduced power or with parameters at variance from 
licensed tolerances while maintaining monitoring point field strengths 
within licensed limits during the period subsequent to the commencement 
of modifications authorized by the construction permit, or
    (3) Operate in a nondirectional mode during the presently licensed 
hours of directional operation with power reduced to 25% or less of the 
nominal licensed power, or whatever higher power, not exceeding licensed 
power, will insure that the radiated field strength specified by the 
license is not exceeded at any given asimuth for the corresponding hours 
of directional operation, or
    (4) Operate in a nondirectional mode during daytime hours, if not 
already so licensed, only as necessary to conduct a required 
nondirectional proof of performance with a power not to exceed 25% of 
the maximum power authorized by the construction permit for directional 
operation, or
    (5) Operate during daytime hours with either the daytime or 
nighttime directional pattern and with the power authorized by the 
construction permit only as necessary to take proof of performance 
measurements. Operating power shall be promptly reduced to presently 
licensed level during any significant period of time that these 
measurements are not being taken. No daytime operation of construction 
permit directional patterns authorized by this paragraph shall be 
conducted before such patterns have been substantially tuned during the 
experimental period.
    (6) In the event the directional pattern authorized by the 
construction permit replaces a licensed directional pattern, the 
licensee may operate with the substantially adjusted construction permit 
pattern during the corresponding licensed hours of directional operation 
with power not exceeding that specified for the licensed pattern.
    (c) Such operation or discontinuance of operation in accordance with 
the provisions of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section may begin upon 
notification to the FCC in Washington, DC.
    (1) Should it be necessary to continue the procedures in either 
paragraph (a) or (b) of this section beyond 30 days, an informal letter 
request signed by the licensee or the licensee's representative must be 
sent to the FCC in Washington, DC. prior to the 30th day.
    (2) The license of a broadcasting station that fails to transmit 
broadcast signals for any consecutive 12-month period expires as a 
matter of law at the end of that period, notwithstanding any provision, 
term, or condition of the license or construction permit to the 
contrary.
    (d) Licensees of an AM station holding a construction permit which 
authorizes both a change in frequency and directional facilities must 
request and obtain authority from the FCC in Washington, DC. prior to 
using any

[[Page 279]]

new installation authorized by the permit, or using temporary 
facilities.
    (1) The request is to be made at least 10 days prior to the date on 
which the temporary operation is to commence. The request is to be made 
by letter which shall describe the operating modes and facilities to be 
used. Such letter requests shall be signed by the licensee or the 
licensee's representative.
    (2) Discontinuance of operation is permitted upon notification to 
the FCC In Washington, DC. Should it be necessary to discontinue 
operation longer than 30 days, an informal letter request, signed by the 
licensee or the licensee's representatives, must be sent to the FCC in 
Washington, DC prior to the 30th day.
    (e) The FCC may modify or cancel the temporary operation permitted 
under the provisions of paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section 
without prior notice or right to hearing.

Sec. 73.1620  Program tests.

    (a) Upon completion of construction of an AM, FM or TV station in 
accordance with the terms of the construction permit, the technical 
provisions of the application, the rules and regulations and the 
applicable engineering standards, program tests may be conducted in 
accordance with the following:
    (1) The permittee of a nondirectional AM or FM station, or a 
nondirectional or directional TV station, may begin program tests upon 
notification to the FCC in Washington, DC provided that within 10 days 
thereafter, an application for a license is filed with the FCC in 
Washington, DC.
    (2) The permittee of an FM station with a directional antenna system 
must file an application for license on FCC Form 302-FM requesting 
authority to commence program test operations at full power with the FCC 
in Washington, D.C. This license application must be filed at least 10 
days prior to the date on which full power operations are desired to 
commence. The application for license must contain any exhibits called 
for by conditions on the construction permit. The staff will review the 
license application and the request for program test authority and issue 
a letter notifying the applicant whether full power operation has been 
approved. Upon filing of the license application and related exhibits, 
and while awaiting approval of full power operation, the FM permittee 
may operate the directional antenna at one half (50%) of the authorized 
effective radiated power. Alternatively, the permittee may continue 
operation with its existing licensed facilities pending the issuance of 
program test authority at the full effective radiated power by the 
staff.
    (3) FM licensees replacing a directional antenna pursuant to 
Sec. 73.1690 (c)(2) without changes which require a construction permit 
(see Sec. 73.1690(b)) may immediately commence program test operations 
with the new antenna at one half (50%) of the authorized ERP upon 
installation. If the directional antenna replacement is an EXACT 
duplicate of the antenna being replaced (i.e., same manufacturer, 
antenna model number, and measured composite pattern), program tests may 
commence with the new antenna at the full authorized power upon 
installation. The licensee must file a modification of license 
application on FCC Form 302-FM within 10 days of commencing operations 
with the newly installed antenna, and the license application must 
contain all of the exhibits required by Sec. 73.1690(c)(2). After review 
of the modification-of-license application to cover the antenna change, 
the Commission will issue a letter notifying the applicant whether 
program test operation at the full authorized power has been approved 
for the replacement directional antenna.
    (4) The permittee of an AM station with a directional antenna system 
must file an application for license on FCC Form 302-AM requesting 
program test authority with the FCC in Washington, DC at least ten (10) 
days prior to the date on which it desires to commence program test 
operations. The application must provide an AM directional antenna proof 
of performance, containing the exhibits required by Sec. 73.186. After 
review of the application to cover the construction permit, the

[[Page 280]]

Commission will issue a letter notifying the applicant whether program 
test operations may commence. Program test operations may not commence 
prior to issuance of staff approval.
    (b) The Commission reserves the right to revoke, suspend, or modify 
program tests by any station without right of hearing for failure to 
comply adequately with all terms of the construction permit or the 
provisions of Sec. 73.1690(c) for a modification of license application, 
or in order to resolve instances of interference. The Commission may, at 
its discretion, also require the filing of a construction permit 
application to bring the station into compliance the Commission's rules 
and policies.
    (c) Unless sooner suspended or revoked, the program test authority 
continues valid during FCC consideration of the application for license, 
and during this period further extension of the construction permit is 
not required. Program test authority shall be automatically terminated 
by final determination upon the application for station license.
    (d) All operation under program test authority shall be in strict 
compliance with the rules governing broadcast stations and in strict 
accordance with representations made in the application for license 
pursuant to which the tests were authorized.
    (e) Acceptance by the FCC of notification of the station of program 
tests, or the granting of program test authority by the FCC, is not to 
be construed by the permittee as approval by the FCC of the application 
for station license.
    (f) The licensee of a UHF TV station which is not in operation on, 
but assigned to, the same allocated channel which a 1000 watt UHF 
translator station is authorized to use (see Sec. 73.3516, 
``Specification of facilities''), shall notify the licensee of the 
translator station, in writing, at least 10 days prior to commencing or 
resuming operation. The TV station licensee shall also certify to the 
FCC in Washington, DC that such advance notice has been given to the 
translator station licensee.
    (g) Reports required. In their application for a license to cover a 
construction permit and on the first anniversary of the commencement of 
program tests, applicants for new broadcast facilities that were granted 
after designation for a comparative hearing as a result of a post 
designation settlement or a decision favoring them after comparative 
consideration must report.
    (1) Any deviations from comparative proposals relating to 
integration of ownership and management and diversification of the media 
of mass communciation contained in their application for a construction 
permit at the time such application was granted; and
    (2) Any deviations from an active/passive ownership structure 
proposed in their application for a construction permit at the time such 
application was granted.
    (3) The reports referred to in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this 
section shall not be required in any case in which the order granting 
the application relieved the applicant of the obligation to adhere to 
such proposals.

Sec. 73.1635  Special temporary authorizations (STA).

    (a) A special temporary authorization (STA) is the authority granted 
to a permittee or licensee to permit the operation of a broadcast 
facility for a limited period at a specified variance from the terms of 
the station authorization or requirements of the FCC rules applicable to 
the particular class of station.
    (1) A request for a STA should be filed with FCC in Washington, DC 
at least 10 days prior to the date of the proposed operation.
    (2) The request is to be made by letter and shall fully describe the 
proposed operation and the necessity for the requested STA. Such letter 
requests shall be signed by the licensee or the licensee's 
representative.
    (3) A request for a STA necessitated by unforeseen equipment damage 
or failure may be made without regard to the procedural requirements of 
this section (e.g. via telegram or telephone). Any request made pursuant 
to this paragraph shall be followed by a written confirmation request 
conforming to the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section. 
Confirmation requests shall be submitted within 24 hours. (See also 
Sec. 73.1680 Emergency Antennas).
    (4) An STA may be granted for an initial period not to exceed 180 
days. A limited number of extensions of such authorizations may be 
granted for additional periods not exceeding 180 days per extension. An 
STA necessitated by technical or equipment problems, however, may, in 
practice, be granted for an initial period not to exceed 90 days with a 
limited number of extensions not to exceed 90 days per extension. The 
permittee or licensee must demonstrate that any further extensions 
requested are necessary and that all steps to resume normal operation 
are being undertaken in an expeditions and timely fashion. The license 
of a broadcasting station that fails to transmit broadcast signals for 
any consecutive 12-month period expires as a matter of law at the end of 
that period, notwithstanding any STA or provision, term, or condition of 
the license to the contrary.
    (5) Certain rules specify special considerations and procedures in 
situations requiring an STA or permit temporary operation at variance 
without prior authorization from the FCC when notification is filed as 
prescribed in the particular rules. See Sec. 73.62, Directional antenna 
system tolerances; Sec. 73.157, Antenna testing during daytime;

Sec. 73.1680, Emergency antennas; and Sec. 73.1740, Minimum operating 
schedule.
    (b) An STA may be modified or cancelled by the FCC without prior 
notice or right to hearing.
    (c) No request by an AM station for temporary authority to extend 
its hours of operation beyond those authorized by its regular 
authorization will be accepted or granted by the FCC except in emergency 
situations conforming with the requirements of Sec. 73.3542, Application 
for Emergency Authorization. See also Sec. 73.1250, Broadcasting

Sec. 73.1670  Auxiliary transmitters.

    (a) A licensee of a broadcast station may, without further authority 
from the FCC, install and use with the main antenna system one or more 
auxiliary transmitters for the following purposes:
    (1) The transmission of regular programs upon failure of the main 
transmitter.
    (2) The transmission of regular programs during maintenance or 
modification of the main transmitter.
    (3) Emergency broadcast system operation.
    (4) The transmission of regular programs by an AM station authorized 
for Presunrise (PSRA) and/or Postsunset (PSSA) operation.
    (5) The transmission of tests to determine the operating condition 
of the auxiliary transmitter or auxiliary antenna.
    (6) For testing, upon the request of representatives of the FCC.
    (b) Authorization to install an auxiliary transmitter for use with 
other than the main antenna or authorized auxiliary antenna must be 
obtained by filing an application for a construction permit on FCC form 
301 (FCC form 340 for noncommercial educational stations).
    (c) The following technical and operating standards apply to 
auxiliary transmitters:
    (1) The auxiliary transmitter may be operated on only the station's 
authorized frequency and within the required carrier frequency departure 
tolerance for the type of station.
    (2) The carrier frequency of the auxiliary transmitter must be 
measured as often as necessary to ensure that it is maintained within 
the prescribed tolerance.
    (3) When using an auxiliary transmitter, the operating power may be 
less than the authorized power but may not exceed the authorized power 
within the permitted tolerance for the type of station. If operation 
with an auxiliary transmitter at reduced power continues for a period 
exceeding 10 days, the FCC in Washington, DC must be notified. (See 
Sec. 73.51, AM; Sec. 73.267, FM; Sec. 73.567, NCE-FM; and Sec. 73.663,

Sec. 73.1675  Auxiliary antennas.

    (a) An auxiliary antenna is one that is permanently installed and 
available for use when the main antenna is out

[[Page 284]]

of service for repairs or replacement. An auxiliary antenna may be 
located at the same transmitter site as the station's main antenna or at 
a separate site. In either case, however, the coverage area when 
operating with the auxiliary antenna may not extend beyond the coverage 
area of the main antenna. An application for an auxiliary antenna 
authorization filed under the procedures given in paragraph (b) or (c) 
of this section must contain a map showing the following contours for 
both the main and auxiliary antenna radiation:
    (1) AM stations: The 0.5 mv/m field strength contours.
    (2) FM stations: The 1.0 mv/m field strength contours.
    (3) TV stations: The Grade B coverage contours.
    (b) An application for a construction permit to install a new 
auxiliary antenna, or to make changes in an existing auxiliary antenna 
for which prior FCC authorization is required (see Sec. 73.1690), must 
be filed on FCC Form 301 (FCC Form 340 for noncommercial educational 
stations).
    (c)(1) Where an FM or TV licensee proposes to use a formerly 
licensed main facility as an auxiliary facility, or proposes to modify a 
presently authorized auxiliary facility, and no changes in the height of 
the antenna radiation center are required in excess of the limits in 
Sec. 73.1690(c)(1), the FM or TV licensee may apply for the proposed 
auxiliary facility by filing a modification of license application. The 
modified auxiliary facility must operate on the same channel as the 
licensed main facility. An exhibit must be provided with this license 
application to demonstrate compliance with Sec. 73.1675(a). All FM and 
TV licensees may request a decrease from the authorized facility's ERP 
in the license application. An FM or TV licensee may also increase the 
ERP of the auxiliary facility in a license modification application, 
provided the application contains an analysis demonstrating compliance 
with the Commission's radiofrequency radiation guidelines, and an 
analysis showing that the auxiliary facility will comply with 
Sec. 73.1675(a). Auxiliary facilities mounted on an AM antenna tower 
must also demonstrate compliance with Sec. 73.1692 in the license 
application.
    (2) Where an AM licensee proposes to use a former licensed main 
facility as an auxiliary facility with an ERP less than or equal to the 
ERP specified on the former main license, the AM station may apply to 
license the proposed auxiliary facility by filing a modification of 
license application on Form 302-AM. The proposed auxiliary facilities 
must have been previously licensed on the same frequency as the present 
main facility. The license application must contain an exhibit to 
demonstrate compliance with Sec. 73.1675(a).

Sec. 73.1680  Emergency antennas.

    (a) An emergency antenna is one that is erected for temporary use 
after the authorized main and auxiliary antennas are damaged and cannot 
be used.
    (b) Prior authority from the FCC is not required to erect and 
commence using an emergency antenna to restore program service to the 
public. However, an informal request to continue operation with the 
emergency antenna must be made to the FCC in Washington, DC within 24 
hours after commencement of its use. The request is to include a 
description of the damage to the authorized antenna, a description of 
the emergency antenna, and the station operating power with the 
emergency antenna.
    (1) AM stations. AM stations may use a horizontal or vertical wire 
or a nondirectional vertical element of a directional antenna as an 
emergency antenna. AM stations using an emergency nondirectional antenna 
or a horizontal

[[Page 285]]

or vertical wire pursuant to this section, in lieu or authorized 
directional facilities, shall operate with power reduced to 25% or less 
of the nominal licensed power, or, a higher power, not exceeding 
licensed power, while insuring that the radiated filed strength does not 
exceed that authorized in any given azimuth for the corresponding hours 
of directional operation.
    (2) FM and TV stations. FM and TV stations may erect any suitable 
radiator, or use operable sections of the authorized antenna(s) as an 
emergency antenna.
    (c) The FCC may prescribe the output power, radiation limits, or 
other operating conditions when using an emergency antenna, and 
emergency antenna authorizations may be modified or terminated in the 
event harmful interference is caused to other stations or services by 
the use of an emergency antenna.

Sec. 73.1690  Modification of transmission systems.

    The following procedures and restrictions apply to licensee 
modifications of authorized broadcast transmission system facilities.
    (a) The following changes are prohibited:
    (1) Those that would result in the emission of signals outside of 
the authorized channel exceeding limits prescribed for the class of 
service.
    (2) Those that would cause the transmission system to exceed the 
equipment performance measurements prescribed for the class of service, 
(AM, Sec. 73.44; FM, Secs. 73.317, 73.319, and 73.322; TV, Secs. 73.682 
and 73.687).
    (b) The following changes may be made only after the grant of a 
construction permit application on FCC Form 301 for commercial stations 
or Form 340 for noncommercial educational stations:
    (1) Any construction of a new tower structure for broadcast 
purposes, except for replacement of an existing tower with a new tower 
of identical height and geographic coordinates.
    (2) Any change in station geographic coordinates, including 
coordinate corrections. FM and TV directional stations must also file a 
construction permit application for any move of the antenna to another 
tower structure located at the same coordinates.
    (3) Any change which would require an increase along any azimuth in 
the composite directional antenna pattern of an FM station from the 
composite directional antenna pattern authorized (see Sec. 73.316), or 
any increase from the authorized directional antenna pattern for a TV 
station (see Sec. 73.685).
    (4) Any change in the directional radiation characteristics of an AM 
directional antenna system. See Sec. 73.45 and Sec. 73.150.
    (5) Any decrease in the authorized power of an AM station or the ERP 
of a TV station, or any decrease or increase in the ERP of an FM 
commercial station, which is intended for compliance with the multiple 
ownership rules in Sec. 73.3555.
    (6) For FM noncommercial educational stations, any of the following:
    (i) Any increase in the authorized maximum ERP, whether horizontally 
or vertically polarized, for a noncommercial educational FM station 
operating on Channels 201 through 220, or a Class D FM station operating 
on Channel 200.
    (ii) For those FM noncommercial educational stations on Channels 201 
to 220, or a Class D FM station operating on Channel 200, which are 
within the separation distances specified in Table A of Sec. 73.525 with 
respect to a Channel 6 television station, any increase in the 
horizontally or vertically polarized ERP from the presently authorized 
ERP.
    (iii) For those FM noncommercial educational stations on Channels 
201 through 220 which are located within the separation distances in 
Sec. 73.525 with respect to a Channel 6 television station, or a Class D 
FM station operating on Channel 200, any decrease in the presently 
authorized horizontal effective radiated power which would eliminate the 
horizontal ERP to result in use of vertical ERP only.
    (iv) For those FM noncommercial educational stations which employ 
separate antennas for the horizontal ERP

[[Page 286]]

and the vertical ERP, mounted at different heights, the station may not 
increase or decrease either the horizontal ERP or the vertical ERP 
without a construction permit.
    (7) Any increase in the authorized ERP of a television station, FM 
commercial station, or noncommercial educational FM station, except as 
provided for in Secs. 73.1690(c)(4), (c)(5), or (c)(7), or 
Sec. 73.1675(c)(1) in the case of auxiliary facilities.
    (8) A commercial TV or noncommercial educational TV station 
operating on Channels 14 or Channel 69 may increase its horizontally or 
vertically polarized ERP only after the grant of a construction permit. 
A television station on Channels 15 through 21 within 341 km of a 
cochannel land mobile operation, or 225 km of a first-adjacent channel 
land mobile operation, must also obtain a construction permit before 
increasing the horizontally or vertically polarized ERP (see part 74, 
Sec. 74.709(a) and (b) for tables of urban areas and corresponding 
reference coordinates of potentially affected land mobile operations).
    (c) The following FM and TV station modifications may be made 
without prior authorization from the Commission. A modification of 
license application must be submitted to the Commission within 10 days 
of commencing program test operations pursuant to Sec. 73.1620. With the 
exception of applications filed solely pursuant to Sections (c)(6), 
(c)(9), or (c)(10), the modification of license application must contain 
an exhibit demonstrating compliance with the Commission's radiofrequency 
radiation guidelines. In addition, except for applications solely filed 
pursuant to Sections (c)(6) or (c)(9), where the installation is located 
within 3.2 km of an AM tower or is located on an AM tower, an exhibit 
demonstrating compliance with Sec. 73.1692 is also required.
    (1) Replacement of an omnidirectional antenna with one of the same 
or different number of antenna bays, provided that the height of the 
antenna radiation center is not more than 2 meters above or 4 meters 
below the authorized values. Any concurrent change in ERP must comply 
with Sec. 73.1675(c)(1), 73.1690(4), (c)(5), or (c)(7). Program test 
operations at the full authorized ERP may commence immediately upon 
installation pursuant to Sec. 73.1620(a)(1).
    (2) Replacement of a directional FM antenna, where the measured 
composite directional antenna pattern does not exceed the licensed 
composite directional pattern at any azimuth, where no change in 
effective radiated power will result, and where compliance with the 
principal coverage requirements of Sec. 73.315(a) will be maintained by 
the measured directional pattern. The antenna must be mounted not more 
than 2 meters above or 4 meters below the authorized values. The 
modification of license application on Form 302-FM to cover the antenna 
replacement must contain all of the data in the following sections (i) 
through (v). Program test operations at one half (50%) power may 
commence immediately upon installation pursuant to Sec. 73.1620(a)(3). 
However, if the replacement directional antenna is an exact replacement 
(i.e., no change in manufacturer, antenna model number, AND measured 
composite antenna pattern), program test operations may commence 
immediately upon installation at the full authorized power.
    (i) A measured directional antenna pattern and tabulation on the 
antenna manufacturer's letterhead showing both the horizontally and 
vertically polarized radiation components and demonstrating that neither 
of the components exceeds the authorized composite antenna pattern along 
any azimuth.
    (ii) Contour protection stations authorized pursuant to Sec. 73.215 
or Sec. 73.509 must attach a showing that the RMS (root mean square) of 
the composite measured directional antenna pattern is 85% or more of the 
RMS of the authorized composite antenna pattern. See Sec. 73.316(c)(9). 
If this requirement cannot be met, the licensee may include new relative 
field values with the license application to reduce the authorized 
composite antenna pattern so as to bring the measured composite antenna 
pattern into compliance with the 85 percent requirement.
    (iii) A description from the manufacturer as to the procedures used 
to measure the directional antenna pattern. The antenna measurements 
must

[[Page 287]]

be performed with the antenna mounted on a tower, tower section, or 
scale model equivalent to that on which the antenna will be permanently 
mounted, and the tower or tower section must include transmission lines, 
ladders, conduits, other antennas, and any other installations which may 
affect the measured directional pattern.
    (iv) A certification from a licensed surveyor that the antenna has 
been oriented to the proper azimuth.
    (v) A certification from a qualified engineer who oversaw 
installation of the directional antenna that the antenna was installed 
pursuant to the manufacturer's instructions.
    (3) A directional TV station on Channels 2 through 13 or 22 through 
68, or a directional TV station on Channels 15 through 21 which is in 
excess of 341 km (212 miles) from a cochannel land mobile operation or 
in excess of 225 km (140 miles) from a first-adjacent channel land 
mobile operation (see Part 74, Sec. 74.709(a) and (b) for tables of 
urban areas and reference coordinates of potentially affected land 
mobile operations), may replace a directional TV antenna by a license 
modification application, if the proposed horizontal theoretical 
directional antenna pattern does not exceed the licensed horizontal 
directional antenna pattern at any azimuth and where no change in 
effective radiated power will result. The modification of license 
application on Form 302-TV must contain all of the data set forth in 
Sec. 73.685(f).
    (4) Commercial and noncommercial educational FM stations operating 
on Channels 221 through 300 (except Class D), NTSC TV stations operating 
on Channels 2 through 13 and 22 through 68, and TV stations operating on 
Channels 15 through 21 that are in excess of 341 km (212 miles) from a 
cochannel land mobile operation or in excess of 225 km (140 miles) from 
a first-adjacent channel land mobile operation [see Part 74, 
Sec. 74.709(a) and (b) for tables of urban areas and reference 
coordinates of potentially affected land mobile operations], which 
operate omnidirectionally, may increase the vertically polarized 
effective radiated power up to the authorized horizontally polarized 
effective radiated power in a license modification application. 
Noncommercial educational FM licensees and permittees on Channels 201 
through 220, that do not use separate antennas mounted at different 
heights for the horizontally polarized ERP and the vertically polarized 
ERP, and are located in excess of the separations from a Channel 6 
television station listed in Table A of Sec. 73.525(a)(1), may also 
increase the vertical ERP, up to (but not exceeding) the authorized 
horizontally polarized ERP via a license modification application. 
Program test operations may commence at full power pursuant to 
Sec. 73.1620(a)(1).
    (5) Those Class A FM commercial stations which were permitted to 
increase ERP pursuant to MM Docket No. 88-375 by a modification of 
license application remain eligible to do so, provided that the station 
meets the requirements of Sec. 73.1690 (c)(1) and is listed on one of 
the Public Notices as authorized to increase ERP, or by a letter from 
the Commission's staff authorizing the change. These Public Notices were 
released on November 3, 1989; November 17, 1989; December 8, 1989; March 
2, 1990; and February 11, 1991. The increased ERP must comply with the 
multiple ownership requirements of Sec. 73.3555. Program test operations 
may commence at full power pursuant to Sec. 73.1620(a)(1).
    (6) FM contour protection stations authorized pursuant to 
Sec. 73.215 which have become fully spaced under Sec. 73.207 may file a 
modification of license application to delete the Sec. 73.215 contour 
protection designation with an exhibit to demonstrate that the station 
is fully spaced in accordance with Sec. 73.207. The contour protection 
designation will be removed upon grant of the license application. 
Applications filed under this rule section will be processed on a first 
come / first served basis with respect to conflicting FM commercial 
minor change applications and modification of license applications 
(including those filed pursuant to Sec. 73.1690 (b) and (c)(6) and 
(c)(7)).
    (7) FM omnidirectional commercial stations, and omnidirectional 
noncommercial educational FM stations operating on Channels 221 through 
300 (except Class D), which are not designated as contour protection 
stations pursuant to Sec. 73.215 and which meet the

[[Page 288]]

spacing requirements of Sec. 73.207, may file a license modification 
application to increase ERP to the maximum permitted for the station 
class, provided that any change in the height of the antenna radiation 
center remains in accordance with Sec. 73.1690(c)(1). Program test 
operations may commence at full power pursuant to Sec. 73.1620(a)(1). 
All of the following conditions also must be met before a station may 
apply pursuant to this section:
    (i) The station may not be a ``grandfathered'' short-spaced station 
authorized pursuant to Sec. 73.213 or short-spaced by a granted waiver 
of Sec. 73.207;
    (ii) If the station is located in or near a radio quiet zone, radio 
coordination zone, or a Commission monitoring station (see Sec. 73.1030 
and Sec. 0.121(c)), the licensee or permittee must have secured written 
concurrence from the affected radio quiet zone, radio coordination zone, 
or the Commission's Compliance and Information Bureau in the case of a 
monitoring station, to increase effective radiated power PRIOR to 
implementation. A copy of that concurrence must be submitted with the 
license application to document that concurrence has been received;
    (iii) The station does not require international coordination as the 
station does not lie within the border zones, or clearance has been 
obtained from Canada or Mexico for the higher power operation within the 
station's specified domestic class and the station complies with 
Sec. 73.207(b)(2) and (3) with respect to foreign allotments and 
allocations;
    (iv) The increased ERP will not cause the station to violate the 
multiple ownership requirements of Sec. 73.3555.
    (8) FM commercial stations and FM noncommercial educational stations 
may decrease ERP on a modification of license application provided that 
exhibits are included to demonstrate that all six of the following 
requirements are met:
    (i) Commercial FM stations must continue to provide a 70 dBu 
principal community contour over the community of license, as required 
by Sec. 73.315(a). Noncommercial educational FM stations must continue 
to provide a 60 dBu contour over at least a portion of the community of 
license. The 60 and 70 dBu contours must be predicted by use of the 
standard contour prediction method in Sec. 73.313(b), (c), and (d).
    (ii) For both commercial FM and noncommercial educational FM 
stations, the location of the main studio remains within the 70 dBu 
principal community contour, as required by Sec. 73.1125, or otherwise 
complies with that rule. The 70 dBu contour must be predicted by use of 
the standard contour prediction method in Sec. 73.313(b), (c), and (d).
    (iii) For commercial FM stations only, there is no change in the 
authorized station class as defined in Sec. 73.211.
    (iv) For commercial FM stations only, the power decrease is not 
necessary to achieve compliance with the multiple ownership rule, 
Sec. 73.3555.
    (v) Commercial FM stations, noncommercial educational FM stations on 
Channels 221 through 300, and noncommercial educational FM stations on 
Channels 200 through 220 which are located in excess of the distances in 
Table A of Sec. 73.525 with respect to a Channel 6 TV station, may not 
use this rule to decrease the horizontally polarized ERP below the value 
of the vertically polarized ERP.
    (vi) Noncommercial educational FM stations on Channels 201 through 
220 which are within the Table A distance separations of Sec. 73.525, or 
Class D stations on Channel 200, may not use the license modification 
process to eliminate an authorized horizontally polarized component in 
favor of vertically polarized-only operation. In addition, noncommercial 
educational stations operating on Channels 201 through 220, or Class D 
stations on Channel 200, which employ separate horizontally and 
vertically polarized antennas mounted at different heights, may not use 
the license modification process to increase or decrease either the 
horizontal ERP or vertical ERP without a construction permit.
    (9) The licensee of an AM, FM, or TV commercial station may propose 
to change from commercial to noncommercial educational on a modification 
of license application, provided that the application contains completed 
Sections II and IV of FCC Form

[[Page 289]]

340. In addition, a noncommercial educational AM licensee, a TV licensee 
on a channel not reserved for noncommercial educational use, or an FM 
licensee on Channels 221 to 300 (except Class D FM) on a channel not 
reserved for noncommercial educational use, may apply to change from 
educational to commercial via a modification of license application, and 
no exhibits are required with the application. The change will become 
effective upon grant of the license application.
    (10) Replacement of a transmission line with one of a different type 
or length which changes the transmitter operating power (TPO) from the 
authorized value, but not the ERP, must be reported in a license 
modification application to the Commission.
    (d) The following changes may be made without authorization from the 
FCC, however informal notification of the changes must be made according 
to the rule sections specified:
    (1) Change in studio location within the principal community 
contour. See Sec. 73.1125.
    (2) Commencement of remote control operation pursuant to 
Secs. 73.1400 and 73.1410.
    (3) Modification of an AM directional antenna sampling system. See 
Sec. 73.68.
    (e) Any electrical and mechanical modification to authorized 
transmitting equipment that is not otherwise restricted by the preceding 
provisions of this section, may be made without FCC notification or 
authorization. Equipment performance measurements must be made within 
ten days after completing the modifications (See Sec. 73.1590). An 
informal statement, diagram, etc., describing the modification must be 
retained at the transmitter site for as long as the equipment is in use.

Sec. 73.1692  Broadcast station construction near or installation on an AM broadcast tower.

    Where a broadcast licensee or permittee proposes to mount a 
broadcast antenna on an AM station tower, or where construction is 
proposed within 0.8 km of an AM nondirectional tower or within 3.2 km of 
an AM directional station, the broadcast licensee or permittee is 
responsible for ensuring that the construction does not adversely affect 
the AM station, as follows:
    (a) Installations on an AM nondirectional tower. During installation 
of the broadcast antenna and related equipment, the AM station shall 
determine operating power by the indirect method (see Sec. 73.51). Upon 
the completion of the installation, antenna impedance measurements on 
the AM antenna shall be made, and, prior to or simultaneously with the 
filing of the license application covering the broadcast station 
installation, an application on FCC Form 302-AM (including a tower 
sketch of the installation) shall be filed with the Commission for the 
AM station to return to direct power measurement.
    (b) Installations on an AM directional array. Prior to commencing 
construction, the broadcast permittee or licensee shall notify the AM 
station so that, if necessary, the AM station may determine operating 
power by the indirect method (see Sec. 73.51) and request special 
temporary authority pursuant to Sec. 73.1635 to operate with parameters 
at variance in order to maintain monitoring point field strengths within 
authorized limits. Both prior to the commencement of construction and 
upon completion of construction, a partial proof of performance (as 
defined by Sec. 73.154) shall be conducted to establish that the AM 
array has not been adversely affected. Prior to or simultaneously with 
filing of the license application to cover the broadcast station 
construction, the results of the partial proof of performance shall be 
filed with the Commission on Form 302-AM.
    (c) Tower erections or modifications within 0.8 km of an AM 
nondirectional tower. Prior to commencing the construction of tower 
modifications, or the erection of a new tower, within 0.8 km of an AM 
nondirectional tower, the broadcast permittee or licensee is required to 
notify the AM station so that the AM station may commence determining 
operating power by the indirect method (see Sec. 73.51). The broadcast 
licensee or permittee shall be responsible for the installation and 
continued maintenance of detuning apparatus necessary to prevent adverse 
effects on the radiation pattern of the AM station. Both prior to 
construction of the tower modifications and upon completion of 
construction, antenna impedance measurements of the AM station shall be 
made. In addition, sufficient field strength measurements taken at a 
minimum of 10 locations along each of 8 equally spaced radials, shall be 
made to establish that the AM radiation pattern is essentially 
omnidirectional. Prior or simultaneously with the filing of the 
application for license to cover this permit, the results of the 
impedance measurements and the field strength measurements shall be 
filed with the Commission on FCC Form 302-AM for the AM station to 
return to the direct method of power determination.
    (d) Tower erections or modifications within 3.2 km of an AM 
directional station. Prior to commencing construction of tower 
modifications, or the erection of a new tower structure, within 3.2 km 
of an AM directional array, the broadcast permittee or licensee shall 
notify the AM station so that, if necessary, the AM station may 
determine operating power by the indirect method (see Sec. 73.51) and 
request special temporary authority pursuant to Sec. 73.1635 to operate 
with parameters at variance in order to maintain monitoring point field 
strengths within authorized limits. The broadcast licensee or permittee 
shall be responsible for the installation and continued maintenance of 
detuning apparatus necessary to prevent adverse effects upon the 
radiation pattern of the AM station. Both prior to the commencement of 
construction

[[Page 291]]

and upon completion of construction, a partial proof of performance (as 
defined by Sec. 73.154) shall be conducted to establish that the AM 
array has not been adversely affected. Prior to or simultaneously with 
filing of the license application to cover the broadcast station 
construction, the results of the partial proof of performance shall be 
filed with the Commission on Form 302-AM.

Sec. 73.1715  Share time.

    Operation is permitted by two or more broadcast stations using the 
same channel in accordance with a division of hours mutually agreed upon 
and considered part of their licenses.
    (a) If the licenses of stations authorized to share time do not 
specify hours of operation, the licensees shall endeavor to reach an 
agreement for a definite schedule of periods of time to be used by each. 
Such agreement shall be in writing and each licensee shall file it in 
duplicate original with each application to the FCC in Washington, DC 
for renewal of license. If and when

[[Page 292]]

such written agreements are properly filed in conformity with this 
Section, the file mark of the FCC will be affixed thereto, one copy will 
be retained by the FCC, and one copy returned to the licensee to be 
posted with the station license and considered as a part thereof. If the 
license specifies a proportionate time division, the agreement shall 
maintain this proportion. If no proportionate time division is specified 
in the license, the licensees shall agree upon a division of time. Such 
division of time shall not include simultaneous operation of the 
stations unless specifically authorized by the terms of the license.
    (b) If the licensees of stations authorized to share time are unable 
to agree on a division of time, the FCC in Washington, DC shall be so 
notified by a statement filed with the applications for renewal of 
licenses. Upon receipt of such statement, the FCC will designate the 
applications for a hearing and, pending such hearing, the operating 
schedule previously adhered to shall remain in full force and effect.
    (c) A departure from the regular schedule in a time-sharing 
agreement will be permitted only in cases where an agreement to that 
effect is put in writing, is signed by the licensees of the stations 
affected thereby and filed in triplicate by each licensee with the FCC 
in Washington, DC prior to the time of the time of the proposed change. 
If time is of the essence, the actual departure in operating schedule 
may precede the actual filing of written agreement, provided appropriate 
notice is sent to the FCC.
    (d) If the license of an AM station authorized to share time does 
not specify the hours of operation, the station may be operated for the 
transmission of regular programs during the experimental period provided 
an agreement thereto is reached with the other stations with which the 
broadcast day is shared: And further provided, Such operation is not in 
conflict with Sec. 73.72 (Operating during the experimental period). 
Time-sharing agreements for operation during the experimental period 
need not be submitted to the FCC.
    (e) Noncommercial educational FM stations are authorized for share 
time operation according to the provisions of Sec. 73.561.

placed in the station's local public inspection file as part of an 
application; or filed with reports to the FCC must be reproduced in 
fullsize form when complying with these requirements.

Sec. 73.1930  Political editorials.

    (a) Where a licensee, in an editorial,

Sec. 73.1940  Legally qualified candidates for public office.

    (a) A legally qualified candidate for public office is any person 
who:
    (1) Has publicly announced his or her intention to run for 
nomination or office;
    (2) Is qualified under the applicable local, State or Federal law to 
hold the office for which he or she is a candidate; and
    (3) Has met the qualifications set forth in either paragraph (b), 
(c), (d), or (e) of this section.
    (b) A person seeking election to any public office including that of 
President or Vice President of the United States, or nomination for any 
public office except that of President or Vice President, by means of a 
primary, general or special election, shall be considered a legally 
qualified candidate if, in addition to meeting the criteria set forth in 
paragraph (a) of this section, that person:
    (1) Has qualified for a place on the ballot; or
    (2) Has publicly committed himself or herself to seeking election by 
the write-in method and is eligible under applicable law to be voted for 
by sticker, by writing in his or her name on the ballot or by other 
method, and makes a substantial showing that he or she is a bona fide 
candidate for nomination or office.
    (c) A person seeking election to the office of President or Vice 
President of the United States shall, for the purposes of the 
Communications Act and the rules in 47 CFR chapter I, be considered 
legally qualified candidates only in those States or territories (or the 
District of Columbia) in which they have met the requirements set forth 
in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section: Except, that any such person 
who has met the requirements set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section in at least 10 States (or 9 and the District of Columbia) shall 
be considered a legally qualified candidate for election in all States, 
territories, and the District of Columbia for the purposes of this Act.
    (d) A person seeking nomination to any public office, except that of 
President or Vice President of the United States, by means of a 
convention, caucus or similar procedure, shall be considered a legally 
qualified candidate if, in addition to meeting the requirements set 
forth in paragraph (a) of this section, that person makes a substantial 
showing that he or she is a bona fide candidate for such nomination: 
Except, that no person shall be considered a legally qualified candidate 
for nomination by the means set forth in this

[[Page 299]]

paragraph prior to 90 days before the beginning of the convention, 
caucus or similar procedure in which he or she seeks nomination.
    (e) A person seeking nomination for the office of President or Vice 
President of the United States shall, for the purposes of the 
Communications Act and the rules thereunder, be considered a legally 
qualified candidate only in those States or territories (or the District

of Columbia; except, that any such person meeting the requirements set 
forth in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section in at least 10 States 
(or 9 and the District of Columbia) shall be considered a legally 
qualified candidate for nomination in all States, territories and the 
District of Columbia for purposes of this Act.
    (f) The term ``substantial showing'' of a bona fide candidacy as 
used in paragraphs (b), (d) and (e) of this section means evidence that 
the person claiming to be a candidate has engaged to a substantial 
degree in activities commonly associated with political campaigning. 
Such activities normally would include making campaign speeches, 
distributing campaign literature, issuing press releases, maintaining a 
campaign committee, and establishing campaign headquarters (even though 
the headquarters in some instances might be the residence of the 
candidate or his or her campaign manager). Not all of the listed 
activities are necessarily required in each case to demonstrate a 
substantial showing, and there may be activities not listed herein which 
would contribute to such a showing.

Sec. 73.1941  Equal opportunities.

    (a) General requirements. Except as otherwise indicated in 
Sec. 73.1944, no station licensee is required to permit the use of its 
facilities by any legally qualified candidate for public office, but if 
any licensee shall permit any such candidate to use its facilities, it 
shall afford equal opportunities to all other candidates for that office 
to use such facilities. Such licensee shall have no power of censorship 
over the material broadcast by any such candidate. Appearance by a 
legally qualified candidate on any:
    (1) Bona fide newscast;
    (2) Bona fide news interview;
    (3) Bona fide news documentary (if the appearance of the candidate 
is incidental to the presentation of the subject or subjects covered by 
the news documentary); or
    (4) On-the-spot coverage of bona fide news events (including, but 
not limited to political conventions and activities incidental thereto) 
shall not be deemed to be use of broadcasting station. (section 315(a) 
of the Communications Act.)
    (b) Uses. As used in this section and Sec. 73.1942, the term ``use'' 
means a candidate appearance (including by voice or picture) that is not 
exempt under paragraphs 73.1941 (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section.
    (c) Timing of request. A request for equal opportunities must be 
submitted to the licensee within 1 week of the day on which the first 
prior use giving rise to the right of equal opportunities occurred: 
Provided, however, That where the person was not a candidate at the time 
of such first prior use, he or she shall submit his or her request 
within 1 week of the first subsequent use after he or she has become a 
legally qualified candidate for the office in question.
    (d) Burden of proof. A candidate requesting equal opportunities of 
the licensee or complaining of noncompliance to the Commission shall 
have the burden of proving that he or she and his or her opponent are 
legally qualified candidates for the same public office.
    (e) Discrimination between candidates. In making time available to 
candidates for public office, no licensee shall make any discrimination 
between candidates in practices, regulations, facilities, or services 
for or in connection with the service rendered pursuant to this part,

[[Page 300]]

or make or give any preference to any candidate for public office or 
subject any such candidate to any prejudice or disadvantage; nor shall 
any licensee make any contract or other agreement which shall have the 
effect of permitting any legally qualified candidate for any public 
office to broadcast to the exclusion of other legally qualified 
candidates for the same public office.

Sec. 73.1942  Candidate rates.

    (a) Charges for use of stations. The charges, if any, made for the 
use of any broadcasting station by any person who is a legally qualified 
candidate for any public office in connection with his or her campaign 
for nomination for election, or election, to such office shall not 
exceed:
    (1) During the 45 days preceding the date of a primary or primary 
runoff election and during the 60 days preceding the date of a general 
or special election in which such person is a candidate, the lowest unit 
charge of the station for the same class and amount of time for the same 
period.
    (i) A candidate shall be charged no more per unit than the station 
charges its most favored commercial advertisers for the same classes and 
amounts of time for the same periods. Any station practices offered to 
commercial advertisers that enhance the value of advertising spots must 
be disclosed and made available to candidates on equal terms. Such 
practices include but are not limited to any discount privileges that 
affect the value of advertising, such as bonus spots, time-sensitive 
make goods, preemption priorities, or any other factors that enhance the 
value of the announcement.
    (ii) The Commission recognizes non-premptible, preemptible with 
notice, immediately preemptible and run-of-schedule as distinct classes 
of time.
    (iii) Stations may establish and define their own reasonable classes 
of immediately preemptible time so long as the differences between such 
classes are based on one or more demonstrable benefits associated with 
each class and are not based solely upon price or identity of the 
advertiser. Such demonstrable benefits include, but are not limited to, 
varying levels of preemption protection, scheduling flexibility, or 
associated privileges, such as guaranteed time-sensitive make goods. 
Stations may not use class distinctions to defeat the purpose of the 
lowest unit charge requirement. All classes must be fully disclosed and 
made available to candidates.
    (iv) Stations may establish reasonable classes of preemptible with 
notice time so long as they clearly define all such classes, fully 
disclose them and make available to candidates.
    (v) Stations may treat non-preemptible and fixed position as 
distinct classes of time provided that stations articulate clearly the 
differences between such classes, fully disclose them, and make them 
available to candidates.
    (vi) Stations shall not establish a separate, premium-period class 
of time sold only to candidates. Stations may sell higher-priced non-
preemptible or fixed time to candidates if such a class of time is made 
available on a bona fide basis to both candidates and commercial 
advertisers, and provided such class is not functionally equivalent to 
any lower-priced class of time sold to commercial advertisers.
    (vii)  [Reserved]
    (viii) Lowest unit charge may be calculated on a weekly basis with 
respect to time that is sold on a weekly basis, such as rotations 
through particular programs or dayparts. Stations electing to calculate 
the lowest unit charge by such a method must include in that calculation 
all rates for all announcements scheduled in the rotation, including 
announcements aired under long-term advertising contracts. Stations may 
implement rate increases during election periods only to the extent that 
such increases constitute ``ordinary business practices,'' such as 
seasonal program changes or changes in audience ratings.
    (ix) Stations shall review their advertising records periodically 
throughout the election period to determine whether compliance with this 
section requires that candidates receive rebates or credits. Where 
necessary, stations shall issue such rebates or credits promptly.

[[Page 301]]

    (x) Unit rates charged as part of any package, whether individually 
negotiated or generally available to all advertisers, must be included 
in the lowest unit charge calculation for the same class and length of 
time in the same time period. A candidate cannot be required to purchase 
advertising in every program or daypart in a package as a condition for 
obtaining package unit rates.
    (xi) Stations are not required to include non-cash promotional 
merchandising incentives in lowest unit charge calculations; provided, 
however, that all such incentives must be offered to candidates as part 
of any purchases permitted by the licensee. Bonus spots, however, must 
be included in the calculation of the lowest unit charge calculation.
    (xii) Makes goods, defined as the rescheduling of preempted 
advertising, shall be provided to candidates prior to election day if a 
station has provided a time-sensitive make good during the year 
preceding the pre-election periods, perspectively set forth in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, to any commercial advertiser who purchased time 
in the same class.
    (xiii) Stations must disclose and make available to candidates any 
make good policies provided to commercial advertisers. If a station 
places a make good for any commercial advertiser or other candidate in a 
more valuable program or daypart, the value of such make good must be 
included in the calculation of the lowest unit charge for that program 
or daypart.
    (2) At any time other than the respective periods set forth in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, stations may charge legally qualified 
candidates for public office no more than the changes made for 
comparable use of the station by commercial advertisers. The rates, if 
any, charged all such candidates for the same office shall be uniform 
and shall not be rebated by any means, direct or indirect. A candidate 
shall be charged no more than the rate the station would charge for 
comparable commercial advertising. All discount privileges otherwise 
offered by a station to commercial advertisers must be disclosed and 
made available upon equal terms to all candidate for public office.
    (b) If a station permits a candidate to use its facilities, the 
station shall make all discount privileges offered to commercial 
advertisers, including the lowest unit charges for each class and length 
of time in the same time period, and all corresponding discount 
privileges, available upon equal terms to all candidates. This duty 
includes an affirmative duty to disclose to candidates information about 
rates, terms conditions and all value-enhancing discount privileges 
offered to commercial advertisers. Stations may use reasonable 
discretion in making the disclosure; provided, however, that the 
disclosure includes, at a minimum, the following information:
    (1) A description and definition of each class of time available to 
commercial advertisers sufficiently complete to allow candidates to 
identify and understand what specific attributes differentiate each 
class;
    (2) A description of the lowest unit charge and related privileges 
(such as priorities against preemption and make goods prior to specific 
deadlines) for each class of time offered to commercial advertisers;
    (3) A description of the station's method of selling preemptible 
time based upon advertiser demand, commonly known as the ``current 
selling level,'' with the stipulation that candidates will be able to 
purchase at these demand-generated rates in the same manner as 
commercial advertisers;
    (4) An approximation of the likelihood of preemption for each kind 
of preemptible time; and
    (5) An explanation of the station's sales practices, if any, that 
are based on audience delivery, with the stipulation that candidates 
will be able to purchase this kind of time, if available to commercial 
advertisers.
    (c) Once disclosure is made, stations shall negotiate in good faith 
to actually sell time to candidates in accordance with the disclosure.
    (d) This rule (Sec. 73.1942) shall not apply to any station licensed 
for non-commercial operation.

broadcast time made by or on behalf of a candidate for public office, 
together with an appropriate notation showing the disposition made by 
the licensee of such requests, and the charges made, if any, if the 
request is granted. The ``disposition'' includes the schedule of time 
purchased, when spots actually aired, the rates charged, and the classes 
of time purchased.
    (b) When free time is provided for use by or on behalf of 
candidates, a record of the free time provided shall be placed in the 
political file.
    (c) All records required by this paragraph shall be placed in the 
political file as soon as possible and shall be retained for a period of 
two years. As soon as possible means immediately absent unusual 
circumstances.

willful or repeated failure to allow reasonable access to, or to permit 
purchase of, reasonable amounts of time for the use of a broadcasting 
station by a legally qualified candidate for Federal elective office on 
behalf of his candidacy.
    (b) Weekend Access. For purposes of providing reasonable access, a 
licensee shall make its facilities available for use by federal 
candidates on the weekend before the election if the licensee has 
provided similar access to commercial advertisers during the year 
preceding the relevant election period. Licensees shall not discriminate 
between candidates with regard to weekend access.

Sec. 73.2080  Equal employment opportunities.

    (a) General EEO policy. Equal opportunity in employment shall be 
afforded by all licensees or permittees of commercially or 
noncommercially operated AM, FM, TV, or international broadcast stations 
(as defined in this part) to all qualified persons, and no person shall 
be discriminated against in employment by such stations because of race, 
color, religion, national origin, or sex.
    (b) EEO program. Each broadcast station shall establish, maintain, 
and carry out a positive continuing program of specific practices 
designed to ensure equal opportunity in every aspect of station 
employment policy and practice. Under the terms of its program, a 
station shall:
    (1) Define the responsibility of each level of management to ensure 
a positive application and vigorous enforcement of its policy of equal 
opportunity, and establish a procedure to review and control managerial 
and supervisory performance;
    (2) Inform its employees and recognized employee organizations of 
the positive equal employment opportunity policy and program and enlist 
their cooperation;
    (3) Communicate its equal employment opportunity policy and program 
and its employment needs to sources of qualified applicants without 
regard to race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, and solicit 
their recruitment assistance on a continuing basis;
    (4) Conduct a continuing program to exclude all unlawful forms of 
prejudice or discrimination based upon race, color, religion, national 
origin, or sex from its personnel policies and practices and working 
conditions; and
    (5) Conduct a continuing review of job structure and employment 
practices and adopt positive recruitment, job design, and other measures 
needed to ensure genuine equality of opportunity to participate fully in 
all organizational units, occupations, and levels of responsibility.
    (c) EEO program requirements. A broadcast station's equal employment 
opportunity program should reasonably address itself to the specific 
areas set forth below, to the extent possible, and to the extent that 
they are appropriate in terms of the station's size, location, etc.:
    (1) Disseminate its equal opportunity program to job applicants and 
employees. For example, this requirement may be met by:

[[Page 303]]

    (i) Posting notices in the station's office and other places of 
employment, informing employees, and applicants for employment, of their 
equal employment opportunity rights. Where it is appropriate, such equal 
employment opportunity notices should be posted in languages other than 
English;
    (ii) Placing a notice in bold type on the employment application 
informing prospective employees that discrimination because of race, 
color, religion, national origin, or sex is prohibited;
    (iii) Seeking the cooperation of labor unions, if represented at the 
station, in the implementation of its EEO program and the inclusion of 
non-discrimination provisions in union contracts;
    (iv) Utilizing media for recruitment purposes in a manner that will 
contain no indication, either explicit or implicit, of a preference for 
one sex over another and that can be reasonably expected to reach 
minorities and women.
    (2) Use minority organizations, organizations for women, media, 
educational institutions, and other potential sources of minority and 
female applicants, to supply referrals whenever job vacancies are 
available in its operation. For example, this requirement may be met by:
    (i) Placing employment advertisements in media that have significant 
circulation among minorities residing and/or working in the recruiting 
area;
    (ii) Recruiting through schools and colleges, including those 
located in the station's local area, with significant minority-group 
enrollments;
    (iii) Contacting, both orally and in writing, minority and human 
relations organizations, leaders, and spokesmen and spokeswomen to 
encourage referral of qualified minority or female applicants;
    (iv) Encouraging current employees to refer minority or female 
applicants;
    (v) Making known to recruitment sources in the employer's immediate 
area that qualified minority members and females are being sought for 
consideration whenever you hire and that all candidates will be 
considered on a nondiscriminatory basis.
    (3) Evaluate its employment profile and job turnover against the 
availability of minorities and women in its recruitment area. For 
example, this requirement may be met by:
    (i) Comparing the composition of the relevant labor area with 
composition of the station's workforce;
    (ii) Where there is underrepresentation of either minorities and/or 
women, examining the company's personnel policies and practices to 
assure that they do not inadvertently screen out any group and take 
appropriate action where necessary. Data on representation of minorities 
and women in the available labor force are generally available on a 
metropolitan statistical area (MSA) or county basis.
    (4) Undertake to offer promotions of qualified minorities and women 
in a nondiscriminatory fashion to positions of greater responsibility. 
For example, this requirement may be met by:
    (i) Instructing those who make decisions on placement and promotion 
that qualified minority employees and females are to be considered 
without discrimination, and that job areas in which there is little or 
no minority or female representation should be reviewed;
    (ii) Giving qualified minority and female employees equal 
opportunity for positions which lead to higher positions. Inquiring as 
to the interest and skills of all lower paid employees with respect to 
any of the higher paid positions.
    (5) Analyze its efforts to recruit, hire, and promote minorities and 
women and address any difficulties encountered in implementing its equal 
employment opportunity program. For example, this requirement may be met 
by:
    (i) Avoiding use of selection techniques or tests that have the 
effect of discriminating against qualified minority groups or females;
    (ii) Reviewing seniority practices to ensure that such practices are 
nondiscriminatory;
    (iii) Examining rates of pay and fringe benefits for employees 
having the same duties, and eliminating any inequities based upon race 
or sex discrimination.
    (d) Mid-term review for television broadcast stations. The 
Commission will conduct a mid-term review of the employment practices of 
each broadcast television station at two and one half

[[Page 304]]

years following the station's most recent license expiration date as 
specified in Sec. 73.1020. The Commission will use the employment 
profile information provided on the first two Form 395-B reports 
submitted following such license expiration date to determine whether 
television station's employment profiles as compared to the applicable 
labor force data, are in compliance with the Commission's processing 
criteria. Television broadcast stations which employment profiles fall 
below the processing criteria will receive a letter noting any necessary 
improvements identified as a result of the review.

particular form on which the application is required to be filed, unless 
the information called for is inapplicable, in which case this fact

<R05>
Sec. 73.3516  Specification of facilities.

    (a) An application for facilities in the AM, FM, or TV broadcast 
services or low power TV service shall be limited to one frequency, or 
channel, and no application will be accepted for filing if it requests 
an alternate frequency or channel. Applications specifying split 
frequency AM operations using one frequency during daytime hours 
complemented by a different frequency during nighttime hours will not be 
accepted for filing.

[[Page 306]]

    (b) An application for facilities in the experimental and auxiliary 
broadcast services may request the assignment of more than one frequency 
if consistent with applicable rules in Part 74. Such applications must 
specify the frequency or frequencies requested and may not request 
alternate frequencies.
    (c) An application for a construction permit for a new broadcast 
station, the facilities for which are specified in an outstanding 
construction permit or license, will not be accepted for filing.
    (d) An application for facilities in the International broadcast 
service may be filed without a request for specific frequency, as the 
FCC will assign frequencies from time to time in accordance with 
Secs. 73.702 and 73.711.
    (e) An application for construction permit for a new broadcast 
station or for modification of construction permit or license of a 
previously authorized broadcast station will not be accepted for filing 
if it is mutually exclusive with an application for renewal of license 
of an existing broadcast station unless the application for renewal of 
license is filed on or before May 1, 1995 and unless the mutually 
exclusive construction permit application is tendered for filing by the 
end of the first day of the last full calendar month of the expiring 
license term. A petition to deny an application for renewal of license 
of an existing broadcast station will be considered as timely filed if 
it is tendered for filing by the end of the first day of the last full 
calendar month of the expiring license term.
    (1) If the license renewal application is not timely filed as 
prescribed in Sec. 73.3539, the deadline for filing petitions to deny 
thereto is the 90th day after the FCC gives public notice that it has 
accepted the late-filed renewal application for filing. In the case of a 
renewal application filed on or before May 1, 1995, if the license 
renewal application is not timely filed as prescribed in Sec. 73.3539, 
the deadline for filing applications mutually exclusive therewith is the 
90th day after the FCC gives public notice that it has accepted the 
late-filed renewal application for filing.
    (2) If any deadline falls on a nonbusiness day, the cutoff shall be 
the close of business of the first full business day thereafter.
    (3) The dates when the licenses of all broadcast and broadcast 
auxiliary services regularly expire are listed in Secs. 73.733, 73.1020 
and 74.15.

<R05>
Sec. 73.3517  Contingent applications.

    Contingent applications for new stations and for changes in 
facilities of existing stations are not acceptable for filing. 
Contingent applications will be accepted for filing under circumstances 
described below:
    (a) Upon filing of an application for the assignment of a license or 
construction permit, or for a transfer of control of a licensee or 
permittee, the proposed assignee or transferee may, upon payment of the 
processing fee prescribed in Subpart G, Part 1 of this chapter, file 
applications in its own name for authorization to make changes in the 
facilities to be assigned or transferred contingent upon approval and 
consummation of the assignment or transfer. Any application filed 
pursuant to this paragraph must be accompanied by a written statement 
from the existing licensee which specifically grants permission to the 
assignee or permittee to file such application. The processing fee will 
not be refundable should the assignment or transfer not be approved. The 
existing licensee or permittee may also file a contingent application in 
its own name, but fees in such cases also not refundable.
    (b) Whenever the FCC determines that processing of any application 
filed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, would be contrary to 
sound administrative practice or would impose an unwarranted burden on 
its staff and resources, the FCC may defer processing of such 
application until the assignment or transfer has been granted and 
consummated.
    (c) Upon payment of the filing fees prescribed in Sec. 1.1111 of 
this chapter, the Commission will accept two or more applications filed 
by existing AM licensees for modification of facilities that are 
contingent upon granting of

[[Page 307]]

both, if granting such contingent applications will reduce interference 
to one or more AM stations or will otherwise increase the area of 
interference-free service. The applications must state that they are 
filed pursuant to an interference reduction arrangement and must cross-
reference all other contingent applications.
    (d) Modified proposals curing conflicts between mutually exclusive 
clusters of applications filed in accordance with paragraphs (c) of this 
section will be accepted for 60 days following issuance of a public 
notice identifying such conflicts.

    Note 1: No application to move to a frequency in the 1605-1705 kHz 
band may be part of any package of contingent applications associated 
with a voluntary agreement.

    Note 2: In cases where no modified proposal is filed pursuant to 
paragraph (d) of this section, the Commission will grant the application 
resulting in the greatest net interference reduction.

<R05>
Sec. 73.3518  Inconsistent or conflicting applications.

    While an application is pending and undecided, no subsequent 
inconsistent or conflicting application may be filed by or on behalf of 
or for the benefit of the same applicant, successor or assignee.

<R05>
Sec. 73.3519  Repetitious applications.

    (a) Where the FCC has denied an application for a new station or for 
any modification of services or facilities, or dismissed such 
application with prejudice, no like application involving service of the 
same kind for substantially the same area by substantially the same 
applicant, or his successor or assignee, or on behalf or for the benefit 
of the original parties in interest, may be filed within 12 months from 
the effective date of the FCC's action. However, applicants whose 
applications have been denied in a comparative hearing may apply 
immediately for another available facility.
    (b) Where an appeal has been taken from the action of the FCC in 
denying a particular application, another application for the same class 
of broadcast station and for the same area, in whole or in part, filed 
by the same applicant, or his successor or assignee, or on behalf of, or 
for the benefit of the original parties in interest, will not be 
considered until final disposition of such appeal.

<R05>
Sec. 73.3520  Multiple applications.

    Where there is one application for new or additional facilities 
pending, no other application for new or additional facilities for a 
station of the same class to serve the same community may be filed by 
the same applicant, or successor or assignee, or on behalf of, or for 
the benefit of the original parties in interest. Multiple applications 
may not be filed simultaneously.

Sec. 73.3521  Mutually exclusive applications for low power television, television translators and television booster stations.

    When there is a pending application for a new low power television, 
television translator, or television booster station, or for major 
changes in an existing station, no other application which would be 
directly mutually exclusive with the pending application may be filed by 
the same applicant or by any applicant in which any individual in common 
with the pending application has any interest, direct or indirect, 
except that interests or less than 1% will not be considered.

Sec. 73.3522  Amendment of applications.

    (a) Predesignation amendment. (1) Subject to the provisions of 
Secs. 73.3525, 73.3571, 73.3572, 73.3573, and 73.3580, and except as 
provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, any application, other 
than an application for a low power TV, TV translator, TV booster or a 
nonreserved band FM station may be amended as a matter of right prior to 
the adoption date of an order designating such applications for 
hearings,

[[Page 308]]

merely by filing the appropriate number of copies of the amendments in 
question duly executed in accordance with Sec. 73.3513. If a petition to 
deny (or to designate for hearing) has been filed, the amendment shall 
be served on the petitioner.
    (2) Subject to the provisions of Secs. 73.3525, 73.3571, 73.3572, 
73.3573 and 73.3580, and except for applications for low power TV, TV 
translator, TV booster or non-reserved band FM stations, mutually 
exclusive broadcast applications may be amended as a matter of right by 
the date specified (not less than 30 days after issuance) in the FCC's 
Public Notice announcing the acceptance for filing of the last-filed 
mutually exclusive application. Subsequent amendments prior to 
designation of the proceeding for hearing will be considered only upon a 
showing of good cause for late filing or pursuant to Sec. 1.65 or 
Sec. 73.3514. Unauthorized or untimely amendments are subject to return 
by the FCC's staff without consideration.
    (3) Subject to the provisions of Secs. 73.3525, 73.3572 and 73.3580, 
any application for a low power TV, TV translator or TV booster station 
may be amended as a matter of right during the application window filing 
period pursuant to Sec. 73.3564(d). If it is determined that a low power 
TV, TV translator or TV booster application is substantially complete 
but contains some defect(s) or omission(s), a deficiency letter will be 
issued affording the applicant 30 days to correct the defect.
    (4) No applicant for a low power TV, TV translator or TV booster 
station which is mutually exclusive can improve its status with respect 
to Sec. 1.1622 by amendment of its application subsequent to the release 
of the initial Public Notice announcing the public lottery that will 
resolve the applicant's mutual exclusivity pursuant to Sec. 1.1601 et 
seq., not withstanding the requirements of Sec. 1.65.
    (5) Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are not applicable to 
applications for low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster stations.
    (6) Subject to the provisions of Sec. 73.3525, 73.3573, and 73.3580, 
applications for non-reserved band FM stations (other than Class D 
stations) may be amended as a matter of right during the appropriate 
window filing period pursuant to Sec. 73.3564(d). For a period of 30 
days following the FCC's issuance of a Public Notice announcing the 
tender of the application, minor amendments may be filed as a matter of 
right. For applications received on or after August 7, 1992, an 
applicant whose application is found to meet minimum filing requirements 
but nevertheless is not complete and acceptable shall have the 
opportunity in the 30-day period specified in the FCC staff's deficiency 
letter to correct all deficiencies in the tenderability and 
acceptability of the underlying application, including any deficiency 
not specifically identified by the staff. [For minimum filing 
requirements see Sec. 73.3564(a). Examples of tender defects appear at 
50 FR 19936 at 19945-46 (May 13, 1985), reprinted as Appendix D, Report 
and Order, MM Docket No. Docket No. 91-347, 7 FCC Red 5074, 5083-88 
(1992). For examples of acceptance defects see 49 FR 47331.] Prior to 
the end of the period specified in the deficiency letter, a submission 
seeking to correct a tender and/or acceptance defect in an application 
meeting minimum filing requirements will be treated as an amendment for 
good cause if it would successfully and directly correct the defect. 
Other amendments prior to designation for hearing or grant will be 
considered only upon a showing of good cause for late filing or pursuant 
to Sec. 1.65 or Sec. 73.3514. Unauthorized or untimely amendments are 
subject to return by the Commission without consideration. However, an 
amendment to a non-reserved band application will not be accepted after 
the close of the appropriate filing window if the effect of such 
amendment is to alter the proposed facility's coverage area so as to 
produce a conflict with an applicant who files subsequent to the initial 
applicant but prior to the amendment application. Similarly, an 
applicant subject to ``first come/first serve'' processing will not be 
permitted to amend its application and retain filing priority if the 
result of such amendment is to alter the facility's coverage area so as 
to produce a conflict with an applicant who files subsequent to the 
initial applicant but prior to the amendment.

[[Page 309]]

    (b) Postdesignation amendment. (1) Except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, requests to amend an application after it has 
been designated for hearing will be considered only upon written 
petition properly served upon the parties of record in accordance with 
Sec. 1.47 and, where applicable, compliance with the provisions of 
Sec. 73.3525, and will be considered only upon a showing of good cause 
for late filing. In the case of requests to amend the engineering 
proposal (other than to make changes with respect to the type of 
equipment specified), good cause will be considered to have been shown 
only if, in addition to the usual good cause consideration, it is 
demonstrated:
    (i) That the amendment is necessitated by events which the applicant 
could not reasonably have foreseen (e.g., notification of a new foreign 
station or loss of transmitter site by condemnation); and
    (ii) That the amendment does not require an enlargement of issues or 
the addition of new parties to the proceeding.
    (2) In comparative broadcast cases (including comparative renewal 
proceedings), amendments relating to issues first raised in the 
designation order may be filed as a matter of right within 30 days after 
that Order or a summary thereof is published in the Federal Register, or 
by a date certain to be specified in the Order.
    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, 
and subject to compliance with the provisions of Sec. 73.3525, a 
petition for leave to amend may be granted, provided it is requested 
that the application as amended be removed from the hearing docket and 
returned to the processing line. See Sec. 73.3571.

    Note 1: When two or more broadcast applications are tendered for 
filing which are mutually exclusive with each other but not in conflict 
with any previously filed applications which have been accepted for 
filing, the FCC, where appropriate, will announce acceptance of the 
earliest tendered application and place the later filed application or 
applications on a subsequent public notice of acceptance for filing in 
order to establish a deadline for the filing of amendments as a matter 
of right for all applicants in the group.

<R05>
Sec. 73.3525  Agreements for removing application conflicts.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 73.3523 regarding dismissal of 
applications in comparative renewal proceedings, whenever applicants for 
a construction permit for a broadcast station enter into an agreement to 
procure the removal of a conflict between applications pending before 
the FCC by withdrawal or amendment of an application or by its dismissal 
pursuant to Sec. 73.3568, all parties thereto shall, within 5 days after 
entering into the agreement, file with the FCC a joint request for 
approval of such agreement. The joint request shall be accompanied by a 
copy of the agreement, including any ancillary agreements, and an 
affidavit of each party to the agreement setting forth:
    (1) The reasons why it is considered that such agreement is in the 
public interest;
    (2) A statement that its application was not filed for the purpose 
of reaching or carrying out such agreement;
    (3) A certification that neither the applicant nor its principals 
has received any money or other consideration in excess of the 
legitimate and prudent expenses of the applicant; Provided That this 
provision shall not apply to bona fide merger agreements;
    (4) The exact nature and amount of any consideration paid or 
promised;
    (5) An itemized accounting of the expenses for which it seeks 
reimbursement; and

[[Page 311]]

    (6) The terms of any oral agreement relating to the dismissal or 
withdrawal of its application.
    (b) Whenever two or more conflicting applications for construction 
permits for broadcast stations pending before the FCC involve a 
determination of fair, efficient and equitable distribution of service 
pursuant to section 307(b) of the Communications Act, and an agreement 
is made to procure the withdrawal (by amendment to specify a different 
community or by dismissal pursuant to Sec. 73.3568) of the only 
application or applications seeking the same facilities for one of the 
communities involved, all parties thereto shall file the joint request 
and affidavits specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (1) If upon examination of the proposed agreement the FCC finds that 
withdrawal of one of the applications would unduly impede achievement of 
a fair, efficient and equitable distribution of radio servce among the 
several States and communities, then the FCC shall order that further 
opportunity be afforded for other persons to apply for the facilities 
specified in the application or applications to be withdrawn before 
acting upon the pending request for approval of the agreement.
    (2) Upon release of such order, any party proposing to withdraw its 
application shall cause to be published a notice of such proposed 
withdrawal at least twice a week for 2 consecutive weeks within the 3-
week period immediately following release of the FCC's order, in a daily 
newspaper of general circulation published in the community in which it 
was proposed to locate the station. However, if there is no such daily 
newspaper published in the community, the notice shall be published as 
follows:
    (i) If one or more weekly newspapers of general circulation are 
published in the community in which the station was proposed to be 
located, notice shall be published in such a weekly newspaper once a 
week for 3 consecutive weeks within the 4-week period immediately 
following the release of the FCC's order.
    (ii) If no weekly newspaper of general circulation is published in 
the community in which the station was proposed to be located, notice 
shall be published at least twice a week for 2 consecutive weeks within 
the 3-week period immediately following the release of the FCC's order 
in the daily newspaper having the greatest general circulation in the 
community in which the station was proposed to be located.
    (3) The notice shall state the name of the applicant; the location, 
frequency and power of the facilities proposed in the application; the 
location of the station or stations proposed in the applications with 
which it is in conflict; the fact that the applicant proposes to 
withdraw the application; and the date upon which the last day of 
publication shall take place.
    (4) Such notice shall additionally include a statement that new 
applications for a broadcast station on the same frequency, in the same 
community, with substantially the same engineering characteristics and 
proposing to serve substantially the same service area as the 
application sought to be withdrawn, timely filed pursuant to the FCC's 
rules, or filed, in any event, within 30 days from the last date of 
publication of the notice (notwithstanding any provisions normally 
requiring earlier filing of a competing application), will be entitled 
to comparative consideration with other pending mutually exclusive 
affidavits.
    (5) Within 7 days of the last day of publication of the notice, the 
applicant proposing to withdraw shall file a statement in triplicate 
with the FCC giving the dates on which the notice was published, the 
text of the notice and the name and location of the newspaper in which 
the notice was published.
    (6) Where the FCC orders that further opportunity be afforded for 
other persons to apply for the facilities sought to be withdrawn, no 
application of any party to the agreement will be acted upon by the FCC 
less than 30 days from the last day of publication of the notice 
specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Any applications for a 
broadcast station on the same frequency in the same community, with 
substantially the same engineering characteristics and proposing to 
serve substantially the same service area as the application sought to 
be withdrawn, filed

[[Page 312]]

within the 30-day period following the last date of publication of the 
notice (notwithstanding any provisions normally requiring earlier filing 
of a competing application), or otherwise timely filed, will be entitled 
to comparative consideration with other pending mutually exclusive 
applications. If the application of any party to which the new 
application may be in conflict has been designated for hearing, any such 
new application will be entitled to consolidation in the proceeding.
    (c) Except where a joint request is filed pursuant to paragraph (a) 
of this section, any applicant filing an amendment pursuant to 
Sec. 73.3522(a) or a request for dismissal pursuant to Sec. 73.3568(a) 
which would remove a conflict with another pending application; or a 
petition for leave to amend pursuant to Sec. 73.3522 (b) or (c) which 
would permit a grant of the amended applcation or an application 
previously in conflict with the amended application; or a request for 
dismissal pursuant to Sec. 73.3568(c), shall file with it an affidavit 
as to whether or not consideration (including an agreement for merger of 
interests) has been promised to or received by such applicant, directly 
or indirectly, in connection with the amendment, petition or request.
    (d) Upon the filing of a petition for leave to amend or to dismiss 
an application for broadcast facilities which has been designated for 
hearing or upon the dismissal of such application on the FCC's own 
motion pursuant to Sec. 73.3568(b), each applicant or party remaining in 
hearing, as to whom a conflict would be removed by the amendment or 
dismissal shall submit for inclusion in the record of that proceeding an 
affidavit stating whether or not he has directly or indirectly paid or 
promised consideration (including an agreement for merger of interests) 
in connection with the removal of such conflict.
    (e) Where an affidavit filed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section states that consideration has been paid or promised, the 
affidavit shall set forth in full all relevant facts, including, but not 
limited to, the material listed in paragraph (a) of this section for 
inclusions in affidavits.
    (f) Affidavits filed pursuant to this section shall be executed by 
the applicant, permittee or licensee, if an individual; a partner having 
personal knowledge of the facts, if a partnership; or an officer having 
personal knowledge of the facts, if a corporation or association.
    (g) Requests and affidavits which relate to an application which has 
not been designated for hearing shall bear the file number of such 
application. If the affiant is also an applicant, the affidavit shall 
also bear the file number of affiant's pending application(s). Requests 
and affidavits which relate to an application which is designated for 
hearing shall bear the file number of that application and the hearing 
docket number and will be acted on by the presiding officer.
    (h) For the purposes of this section an application shall be deemed 
to be ``pending'' before the FCC and a party shall be considered to have 
the status of an ``applicant'' from the time an application is filed 
with the FCC until an order of the FCC granting or denying it is no 
longer subject to reconsideration by the FCC or to review by any court.
    (i) For purposes of this section, ``legitimate and prudent 
expenses'' are those expenses reasonably incurred by an applicant in 
preparing, filing, prosecuting, and settling its application for which 
reimbursement is being sought.
    (j) For purposes of this section, ``other consideration'' consists 
of financial concessions, including, but not limited to the transfer of 
assets or the provision of tangible pecuniary benefit, as well as non-
financial concessions that confer any type of benefit on the recipient.
    (k) For purposes of this section, an ``ancillary agreement'' means 
any agreement relating to the dismissal of an application or settling of 
a proceeding, including any agreement on the part of an applicant or 
principal of an applicant to render consulting services to another party 
or principal of another party in the poroceeding.

    Note: Although Sec. 74.780 of the Rules makes this section generally 
applicable to low power TV, TV translators, and TV booster

[[Page 313]]

stations, paragraph (b) of this section shall not be applicable to such 
stations.


[56 FR 28097, June 19, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 73.3526  Local public inspection file of commercial stations.

    (a) Records to be maintained. Every applicant for a construction 
permit for a new station in the commercial broadcast services shall 
maintain for public inspection a file containing the material described 
in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Every permittee or licensee of an 
AM, FM or TV station in the commercial broacast services shall maintain 
for public inspection a file containing the material described in 
paragraphs (a)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) and (10) of this 
section. In addition, every permittee or licensee of a TV station shall 
maintain for public inspection a file containing material described in 
paragraph (a)(8) of this section; every permittee or licensee of an AM 
or FM station shall maintain for public inspection a file containing 
material described in paragraph (a)(9) of this section. The material to 
be contained in the file is as follows:
    (1) A copy of every application tendered for filing, with respect to 
which local public notice is required to be given under the provisions 
of Sec. 73.3580 or Sec. 73.3594; and all exhibits, letters and other 
documents tendered for filing as part thereof; all amendments thereto, 
copies of all documents incorporated therein by reference, all 
correspondence between the FCC and the applicant pertaining to the 
application after it has been tendered for filing, and copies of Initial 
Decisions and Final Decisions in hearing cases pertaining thereto, which 
according to the provisions of Secs. 0.451 through 0.461 of the rules 
are open for public inspection at the offices of the FCC. Information 
incorporated by reference which is already in the local file need not be 
duplicated if the entry making the reference sufficienty identifies the 
information so that it may be found in the file, and if there has been 
no change in the document since the date of filing and the applicant, 
after making the reference, so states. If petitions to deny are filed 
against the application, and have been duly served on the applicant, a 
statement that such a petition has been filed shall appear in the local 
file together with the name and address of the party filing the 
petition. The file shall also contain a copy of every written citizen 
agreement. For purposes of this section, a citizen agreement is a 
written agreement between a broadcast applicant, permittee, or licensee, 
and one or more citizens or citizen groups, entered for primarily 
noncommercial purposes. This definition includes those agreements that 
deal with goals or proposed practices directly or indirectly affecting 
station operation in the public interest, in areas such as--but not 
limited to--community ascertainment, programming, and employment. It 
excludes common commercial agreements such as advertising contracts; 
union, employment, and personal services contracts; network affiliation, 
syndication, program supply contracts and so on. However, the mere 
inclusion of commercial terms in a primarily noncommercial agreement--
such as a provision for payment of fees for future services of the 
citizen-parties (see ``Report and Order,'' Docket 19518, 57 FCC 2d 494 
1976))--would not cause the agreement to be considered commercial for 
purposes of this section.

    Note: Applications tendered for filing on or before May 13, 1965, 
which are subsequently designated for hearing after May 13, 1965, with 
local notice being given pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 73.3594, and 
material related to such applications, need not be placed in the file 
required to be kept by this section. Applications tendered for filing 
after May 13, 1965, which contain major amendments to applications 
tendered for filing on or before May 13, 1965, with local notice of the 
amending application being given pursuant to the provisions of 
Sec. 73.3580, need not be placed in the file requred to be kept by this 
section.

    (2) A copy of every application tendered for filing by the licensee 
or permittee for such station which is not included in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section and which involves changes in program service, which 
requests an extension of time in which to complete construction of a new 
station, or which requests consent to involuntary assignment or 
transfer, or to voluntary assignment or transfer not resulting in a 
substantial change in ownership or control and which may be applied for

[[Page 314]]

on FCC Form 316; and copies of all exhibits, letters, and other 
documents filed as part thereof, all amendments thereto, all 
correspondence between the FCC and the applicant pertaining to the 
application after it has been tendered for filing, and copies of all 
documents incorporated therein by reference, which according to the 
provisions of Secs. 0.451 through 0.461 of the rules are open for public 
inspection at the offices of the FCC. Information incorporated by 
reference which is already in the local file need not be duplicated if 
the entry making the reference sufficiently identifies the information 
so that it may be found in the file, and there has been no change in the 
document since the date of filing and the licensee, after making the 
reference, so states. If petitions to deny are filed against the 
application, and have been duly served on the applicant, a statement 
that such a petition has been filed shall appear in the local file 
together with the name and address of the party filing the petition.

    Note: The engineering section of the applications mentioned in 
paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, and material related to the 
engineering section, need not be kept in the file required to be 
maintained by this paragraph. If such engineering section contains 
service contour maps submitted with that section, copies of such maps 
and information (State, county, city, street address, or other 
identifying information) showing main studio and transmitter location 
shall be kept in the file.

    (3) A copy of every ownership report or supplemental ownership 
report filed by the licensee or permittee for such station after May 13, 
1965, pursuant to the provisions of this part; and copies of all 
exhibits, letters, and other documents filed as part thereof, all 
amendments thereto, all correspondence between the permittee or licensee 
and the FCC pertaining to the reports after they have been filed, and 
all documents incorporated therein by reference, including contracts 
listed in such reports in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 73.3615(a)(4)(i) and which according to the provisions of 
Secs. 0.451 through 0.461 of the rules are open for public inspection at 
the offices of the FCC. Information incorporated by reference which is 
already in the local file need not be duplicated if the entry making the 
reference sufficiently identifies the information so that it may be 
found in the file, and if there has been no change in the document since 
the date of filing and the licensee or permittee, after making the 
reference, so states.
    (4) Such records as are required to be kept by Sec. 73.1940 
concerning broadcasts by candidates for public office.
    (5) A copy of every annual employment report filed by the licensee 
or permittee for such station pursuant to the provisions of this part; 
and copies of all exhibits, letters and other documents filed as part 
thereof, all amendments thereto, and all correspondence between the 
permittee or licensee and the FCC pertaining to the reports after they 
have been filed and all documents incorporated therein by reference and 
which according to the provisions of Secs. 0.451 through 0.461 of the 
rules are open for public inspection at the offices of the FCC.
    (6) The Public and Broadcasting--A Procedure Manual (see FCC 74-942, 
39 FR 32288, September 5, 1974).
    (7) Letters received from members of the public as are required to 
be retained by Sec. 73.1202.
    (8)(i) For commerical TV broadcast stations, every three months a 
list of programs that have provided the station's most significant 
treatment of community issues during the preceding three month period. 
The list for each calendar quarter is to be filed by the tenth day of 
the succeeding calendar quarter (e.g., January 10 for the quarter 
October-December, April 10 for the quarter January-March, etc.). The 
list include a brief narrative describing what issues were given 
significant treatment and the programming that provided this treatment. 
The description of the programs should include, but is not limited to, 
the time, date, duration and title of each program in which the issue 
was treated.
    (ii) For commercial TV broadcast stations, records sufficient to

quarter, and efforts planned for the next quarter, to serve the 
educational and informational needs of children. The Report for each 
quarter is to be filed by the tenth day of the succeeding calendar 
quarter. The Report shall identify the licensee's educational and 
informational programming efforts, including programs aired by the

publicize in an appropriate manner the existence and location of these 
Reports. For an experimental period of three years, licensees shall file 
these Reports with the Commission on an annual basis, i.e., four 
quarterly reports filed jointly each year, preferably in electronic

December, April 10 for the quarter January-March, etc.). The list shall 
include a brief narrative describing what issues were given significant 
treatment and the programming that provided this treatment. The 
description of the programs should include, but is not limited to, the 
time, date, duration and title of each program in which the issue was

announcements required pursuant to Sec. 73.3580(h), place in the 
station's local public inspection file a statement certifying compliance 
with this requirement. The dates and times that the pre-filing and post-
filing notices were broadcast and the text thereof shall be made part of 
the certifying statement.
    (11) Every television broadcast station owned or controlled by a 
television network shall maintain the records required by Sec. 73.661.

assignment was filed. The assignee is responsible for obtaining copies 
of the necessary documents from the assignor or from the FCC files.
    (2) In cases involving applications for consent to transfer of 
control of a permittee or licensee of a broadcast station, the file 
mentioned in paragraph (a) of this section shall be maintained by the 
permittee or licensee.
    (c) Station to which reports pertain. The file need contain only

pertain to other stations with regard to which they may be applicants, 
permittees, or licensees, except to the extent that such information is 
reflected in the materials required to be kept under the provisions of 
this section.
    (d) Location of records. The file shall be maintained at the main 
studio of the station, where such studio is located in the community to

shall apply.)
    (2) The permittee or licensee shall maintain such a file so long as 
an authorization to operate the station is outstanding, and shall permit 
public inspection of the material as long as it is retained by the 
licensee even though the request for inspection is made after the 
conclusion of the required retention period specified in this paragraph. 
However, material which is voluntarily retained after the required 
retention time may be kept in a form and place convenient to the 
licensee and shall be made available to the inquiring party, in good 
faith after written request, at a time and place convenient to both the 
party and the licensee.

the claim has been satisfied or is barred by statute of limitations. 
Where an application or related material incorporates by reference 
material in earlier applications and material concerning programming and 
related matters (section IV and related material), the material so

less than 30 days prior to the expiration date.
    (b) Applications for extension of time to construct broadcast 
stations, with the exception of International Broadcast and 
Instructional TV Fixed stations, will be granted only if one of the 
following three circumstances have occurred:
    (1) Construction is complete and testing is underway looking toward 
prompt filing of a license application;
    (2) Substantial progress has been made i.e., demonstration that 
equipment is on order or on hand, site acquired, site cleared and 
construction proceeding toward completion; or
    (3) No progress has been made for reasons clearly beyond the control 
of the permittee (such as delays caused by governmental budgetary 
processes and zoning problems) but the permittee has taken all possible 
steps to expeditiously resolve the problem and proceed with 
construction.
    (c) Applications for extension of time to construct International 
Broadcast and Instructional TV Fixed stations will be granted upon a 
specific and detailed showing that the failure to complete was due to 
causes not under the control of the permittee, or upon a specific and 
detailed showing of other sufficient to justify an extension.
    (d) If an application for extension of time within which to 
construct a station is approved, such an extension will be limited to a 
period of no more than 6 months except when as assignment or transfer 
has been approved that provides for a longer period up to a maximum of 
12 months from the date of consummation.
    (e) Application for a construction permit to replace an expired 
construction permit shall be filed on FCC Form 307. Such applications 
must be filed within 30 days of the expiration date of the authorization 
sought to be replaced. If approved, such authorization shall specify a 
period of not more than

Sec. 73.3535  Application to modify authorized but unbuilt facilities, or to assign or transfer control of an unbuilt facility.

    (a) If a permittee finds it necessary to file either an application 
to modify its authorized, but unbuilt facilities, or an assignment/
transfer application, such application shall be filed within the first 9 
months of the issuance of the original construction permit for radio and 
other broadcast and auxiliary stations, or within 12 months of the 
issuance of the original construction permit for television facilities. 
Before such an application can be granted, the permittee or assignee 
must certify that it will immediately begin building after the 
modification is granted or the assignment is consummated.
    (b) Modification and assignment applications filed after the time 
periods stated in paragraph (a) will not be granted absent a showing 
that one of the following three criteria apply: (1) Construction is 
complete and testing is underway looking toward prompt filing of a 
license application; (2) substantial progress has been made i.e., 
demonstration that equipment is on order or on hand, site acquired, site 
cleared and construction proceeding toward completion; or (3) no 
progress has been made for reasons clearly beyond the control of the 
permittee (such as delays caused by governmental budgetary processes and 
zoning problems) but the permittee has taken all possible steps to 
expeditiously resolve the problem and proceed with construction. A 
certification by the permittee or the assignee that it immediately will 
begin building after the modification is granted or the assignment is 
consummated is also necessary. A seller must make the ``one of three 
criteria'' showing in an assignment application.
    (c) If a modification is granted, the time period allowed for 
construction will be 6 months from the issuance of the authorization to 
modify or the remainder of the construction period, whichever is longer. 
Also, in the case of an assignment, the time period allowed for 
construction will be 12 months from the consummation of the assignment 
or the remainder of the construction period, whichever is longer. The 
extension will be given subject to the condition that the modification 
is completed or the assignment is consummated. Failure to modify or 
consummate within the time allowed will result in cancellation of the 
construction permit.
    (d) We will not entertain an application for modification of an 
authorized but unbuilt facility or an application for assignment or 
transfer of control of an unbuilt facility if filed after the expiration 
of the initial construction period.

Sec. 73.3550  Requests for new or modified call sign assignments.

    (a) Requests for new or modified call sign assignments for broadcast 
stations shall be made by letter to the Secretary, FCC, Washington, DC 
20554. An original and one copy of the letter shall be submitted. 
Incomplete or otherwise defective filings will be returned by the FCC. 
As many as five call sign choices, listed in decending order of 
preference, may be included in a single request. A call sign may not be 
reserved.
    (b) No request for a new call sign assignment will be accepted from 
an applicant for a new station until the FCC has granted a construction 
permit. Failure by the permittee of a new station to request the 
assignment of a specific call sign within 30 days of grant of the 
construction permit will result in the FCC, on its own motion, assigning 
an appropriate call sign. All initial construction permits for low power 
TV stations will be issued with a five-character low power TV call sign.
    (c) An applicant for transfer or assignment of an outstanding 
construction permit or license may, in accordance with this section, 
request a new call sign assignment at the time the application for 
transfer or assignment is filed, or at any time thereafter. In the 
absence of written consent of the proposed transferor or assignor, no 
change in call sign assignment will be made effective until such 
application is granted by the FCC and the transaction consummated.
    (d) Where an application is granted by the FCC for transfer or 
assignment of the construction permit or license of a station whose 
existing call sign conforms to that of a commonly owned station not part 
of the transaction, the licensee shall, within 30 days after 
consummation, request a different call sign or submit a statement of 
written consent to retain the conforming call sign from the existing 
owner and the licensee of any other station that may be using the 
station's call sign. In such cases, should a suitable application or 
proper consent statement not be submitted within that period of time, 
the FCC will, on its own motion, select an appropriate call sign and 
effect the change in call sign assignment.
    (e) Call signs beginning with the letter ``K'' will not be assigned 
to stations located east of the Mississippi River, nor will call signs 
beginning with the letter ``W'' be assigned to stations located west of 
the Mississippi River.
    (f) Only four-letter call signs (plus an LP suffix or FM or TV 
suffixes, if used) will be assigned. However, subject to the other 
provisions of this section, a call sign of a station may be conformed to 
a commonly owned station holding a three-letter call assignment (plus 
FM, TV or LP suffixes, if used).
    (g) Subject to the foregoing limitations, applicants may request 
call signs of their choice if the combination is available. Objections 
to the assignment of requested call signs will not be entertained at the 
FCC. However, this does not hamper any party from asserting such rights 
as it may have under private law in some other forum. Should it be 
determined by an appropriate forum that a station should not utilize a 
particular call sign, the initial assignment of a call sign will not 
serve as a bar to the making of a different assignment.
    (h) Call signs are assigned on a ``first-come-first-served'' basis. 
Receipt by

[[Page 328]]

the FCC of a request for an available call sign blocks the acceptance of 
competing requests until the first received request is processed to 
completion. In the case of requests for the same call sign being 
received on the same date at the FCC, the assignment (if otherwise 
grantable) will be made to the station having the longest continuous 
record of broadcasting operation under substantially unchanged ownership 
and control. However, involuntary and pro forma assignments will not be 
taken into account in determining priority. If a low-power TV operator 
and an AM, FM or full-power TV operator apply for the same call sign on 
the same date at the FCC, the AM, FM or full-power TV operator will 
prevail.

    Note: The provisions of paragraph (h) of this section shall not 
apply to a licensee requesting a transfer to another frequency where the 
existing and new facilities serve substantially the same area (i.e., 
where at least one of the stations serves both communities of license).

    (i) Stations in different broadcast services (or operating jointly 
in the 535-1605 kHz band and in the 1605-1705 kHz band) which are under 
common control may request that their call signs be conformed by the 
assignment of the same basic call sign if that call sign is not being 
used by a non-commonly owned station. For the purposes of this 
paragraph, 50% or greater common ownership shall constitute a prima 
facie showing of common control.
    (j) The provisions of this section shall not apply to International 
broadcast stations, to stations authorized under Part 74 of the rules 
(except as provided in Sec. 74.783 of this chapter), nor to FM or TV 
stations seeking to modify an existing call sign only to the extent of 
adding or deleting an ``-FM'' or ``-TV'' suffix. The latter additions 
and deletions may be effective upon notification to the Commission.
    (k) Unless subject to a pending transfer or assignment application, 
a change in call sign assignment will be made effective on the date 
specified in the telegram authorizing the change. In this regard, the 
applicant may include with its application a request for a specific 
effective date to take place within 45 days of the submission of its 
application for a call sign. Postponement of the effective date will be 
granted only in response to a timely request and for only the most 
compelling reasons.
    (l) Four-letter combinations commencing with ``W'' or ``K'' which 
are assigned as call signs to ships or to other radio services are not 
available for assignment to broadcast stations, with or without the ``-
FM'' or ``-TV'' suffix.
    (m) Users of nonlicensed, low-power devices operating under Part 15 
of the FCC rules may use whatever identification is currently desired, 
so long as propriety is observed and no confusion results with a station 
for which the FCC issues a license.
    (n) Where a requested call sign, without the ``-FM,'' ``-TV'' or ``-
LP'' suffix, would conform to the call sign of any other non-commonly 
owned station(s) operating in a different service, the applicant must 
obtain and submit with the application for the call sign the written 
consent of the licensee(s) of such stations.

Sec. 73.3555  Multiple ownership.

    (a)(1) Radio contour overlap rule. No license for an AM or FM 
broadcasting station shall be granted to any party (including all 
parties under common control) if the grant of such license will result 
in overlap of the principal community contour of that station and the 
principal community contour of any other broadcasting station directly 
or indirectly owned, operated, or controlled by the same party, except 
that such license may be granted in connection with a transfer or 
assignment from an existing party with such interests, or in the 
following circumstances:
    (i) In a radio market with 45 or more commercial radio stations, a 
party may own, operate, or control up to 8 commercial radio stations, 
not more than 5 of which are in the same service (AM or FM);
    (ii) In a radio market with between 30 and 44 (inclusive) commercial 
radio stations, a party may own, operate, or

[[Page 329]]

control up to 7 commercial radio stations, not more than 4 of which are 
in the same service (AM or FM);
    (iii) In a radio market with between 15 and 29 (inclusive) 
commercial radio stations, a party may own, operate, or control up to 6 
commercial radio stations, not more than 4 of which are in the same 
service (AM or FM); and
    (iv) In a radio market with 14 or fewer commercial radio stations, a 
party may own, operate, or control up to 5 commercial radio stations, 
not more than 3 of which are in the same service (AM or FM), except that 
a party may not own, operate, or control more than 50 percent of the 
stations in such market.
    (2) Overlap between two stations in different services is 
permissible if neither of those two stations overlaps a third station in 
the same service.
    (3) (i) Where the principal community contours of two radio stations 
overlap and a party (including all parties under common control) with an 
attributable ownership interest in one such station brokers more than 15 
percent of the broadcast time per week of the other such station, that 
party shall be treated as if it has an interest in the brokered station 
subject to the limitations set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section. This limitation shall apply regardless of the source of the 
brokered programming supplied by the party to the brokered station.
    (ii) Every time brokerage agreement of the type described in 
paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section shall be undertaken only pursuant to 
a signed written agreement that shall contain a certification by the 
licensee or permittee of the brokered station verifying that it 
maintains ultimate control over the station's facilities, including 
specifically control over station finances, personnel and programming, 
and by the brokering station that the agreement complies with the 
provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.
    (4) For purposes of this paragraph (a):
    (i) The ``principal community contour'' for AM stations is the 
predicted or measured 5 mV/m groundwave contour computed in accordance 
with Sec. 73.183 or Sec. 73.186 and for FM stations is the predicted 
3.16 mV/m contour computed in accordance with Sec. 73.313.
    (ii) The number of stations in a radio market is the number of 
commercial stations whose principal community contours overlap, in whole 
or in part, with the principal community contours of the stations in 
question (i.e., the station for which an authorization is sought and any 
station in the same service that would be commonly owned whose principal 
community contour overlaps the principal community contour of that 
station). In addition, if the area of overlap between the stations in 
question is overlapped by the principal community contour of a commonly 
owned station or stations in a different service (AM or FM), the number 
of stations in the market includes stations whose principal community 
contours overlap the principal community contours of such commonly owned 
station or stations in a different service.
    (iii) ``Time brokerage'' is the sale by a licensee of discrete 
blocks of time to a ``broker'' that supplies the programming to fill 
that time and sells the commercial spot announcements in it.
    (b) Television contour overlap (duopoly) rule. No license for a TV 
broadcast station shall be granted to any party (including all parties 
under common control) if the grant of such license will result in 
overlap of the Grade B contour of that station (computed in accordance 
with Sec. 73.684) and the Grade B contour of any other TV broadcast 
station directly or indirectly owned, operated, or controlled by the 
same party.
    (c) One-to-a-market ownership rule. No license for an AM, FM or TV 
broadcast station shall be granted to any party (including all parties 
under common control) if such party directly or indirectly owns, 
operates or controls one or more such broadcast stations and the grant 
of such license will result in:
    (1) The predicted or measured 2 mV/m groundwave contour of an 
existing or proposed AM station, computed in accordance with Sec. 73.183 
or Sec. 73.186, encompassing the entire community of license of an 
existing or proposed TV broadcast station(s), or the Grade A contour(s) 
of the TV broadcast station(s), computed in accordance with Sec. 73.684, 
encompassing the entire community of license of the AM station; or
    (2) The predicted 1 mV/m contour of an existing or proposed FM 
station,

[[Page 330]]

computed in accordance with Sec. 73.313, encompassing the entire 
community of license of an existing or proposed TV broadcast station(s), 
or the Grade A contour(s) of the TV broadcast station(s), computed in 
accordance with Sec. 73.684, encompassing the entire community of 
license of the FM station.
    (d) Daily newspaper cross-ownership rule. No license for an AM, FM 
or TV broadcast station shall be granted to any party (including all 
parties under common control) if such party directly or indirectly owns, 
operates or controls a daily newspaper and the grant of such license 
will result in:
    (1) The predicted or measured 2 mV/m contour of an AM station, 
computed in accordance with Sec. 73.183 or Sec. 73.186, encompassing the 
entire community in which such newspaper is published; or
    (2) The predicted 1 mV/m contour for an FM station, computed in 
accordance with Sec. 73.313, encompassing the entire community in which 
such newspaper is published; or
    (3) The Grade A contour of a TV station, computed in accordance with 
Sec. 73.684, encompassing the entire community in which such newspaper 
is published.
    (e)(1) National television multiple ownership rule. No license for a 
commercial TV broadcast station shall be granted, transferred or 
assigned to any party (including all parties under common control) if 
the grant, transfer or assignment of such license would result in such 
party or any of its stockholders, partners, members, officers or 
directors, directly or indirectly, owning, operating or controlling, or 
having a cognizable interest in TV stations which have an aggregate 
national audience reach exceeding thirty-five (35) percent.
    (2) For purposes of this paragraph (e):
    (i) National audience reach means the total number of television 
households in the Arbitron Area of Dominant Influence (ADI) markets in 
which the relevant stations are located divided by the total national 
television households as measured by ADI data at the time of a grant, 
transfer or assignment of a license. For purposes of making this 
calculation, UHF television stations shall be attributed with 50 percent 
of the television households in their ADI market. Where the relevant 
application forms require a showing with respect to audience reach and 
the application relates to an area where Arbitron ADI market data are 
unavailable, then the applicant shall make a showing as to the number of 
television households in its market. Upon such a showing, the Commission 
shall make a determination as to the appropriate audience reach to be 
attributed to the applicant.
    (ii) TV broadcast station or TV station excludes stations which are 
primarily satellite operations.
    (f) This section is not applicable to noncommercial educational FM 
and noncommercial educational TV stations.

    Note 1: The word ``control'' as used herein is not limited to 
majority stock ownership, but includes actual working control in 
whatever manner exercised.

    Note 2: In applying the provisions of this section, ownership and 
other interests in broadcast licensees, cable television systems and 
daily newspapers will be attributed to their holders and deemed 
cognizable pursuant to the following criteria:

    (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, partnership and direct 
ownership interests and any voting stock interest amounting to 5% or 
more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporate broadcast licensee, 
cable television system or daily newspaper will be cognizable;
    (b) No minority voting stock interest will be cognizable if there is 
a single holder of more than 50% of the outstanding voting stock of the 
corporate broadcast licensee, cable television system or daily newspaper 
in which the minority interest is held;
    (c) Investment companies, as defined in 15 U.S.C. 80a-3, insurance 
companies and banks holding stock through their trust departments in 
trust accounts will be considered to have a cognizable interest only if 
they hold 10% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporate 
broadcast licensee, cable television system or daily newspaper, or if 
any of the officers or directors of the broadcast licensee, cable 
television system or daily newspaper are representatives of the 
investment company, insurance company or bank concerned. Holdings by a 
bank or insurance company will be aggregated if the bank or insurance 
company has any right to determine how the stock will be voted. Holdings 
by investment companies will be aggregated if under common management.
    (d) Attribution of ownership interests in a broadcast licensee, 
cable television system or daily newspaper that are held indirectly

[[Page 331]]

by any party through one or more intervening corporations will be 
determined by successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for 
each link in the vertical ownership chain and application of the 
relevant attribution benchmark to the resulting product, except that 
wherever the ownership percentage for any link in the chain exceeds 50%, 
it shall not be included for purposes of this multiplication. [For 
example, if A owns 10% of company X, which owns 60% of company Y, which 
owns 25% of ``Licensee,'' then X's interest in ``Licensee'' would be 25% 
(the same as Y's interest since X's interest in Y exceeds 50%), and A's 
interest in ``Licensee'' would be 2.5% (0.1 x 0.25). Under the 5% 
attribution benchmark, X's interest in ``Licensee'' would be cognizable, 
while A's interest would not be cognizable.]
    (e) Voting stock interests held in trust shall be attributed to any 
person who holds or shares the power to vote such stock, to any person 
who has the sole power to sell such stock, and to any person who has the 
right to revoke the trust at will or to replace the trustee at will. If 
the trustee has a familial, personal or extra-trust business 
relationship to the grantor or the beneficiary, the grantor or 
beneficiary, as appropriate, will be attributed with the stock interests 
held in trust. An otherwise qualified trust will be ineffective to 
insulate the grantor or beneficiary from attribution with the trust's 
assets unless all voting stock interests held by the grantor or 
beneficiary in the relevant broadcast licensee, cable television system 
or daily newspaper are subject to said trust.
    (f) Holders of non-voting stock shall not be attributed an interest 
in the issuing entity. Holders of debt and instruments such as warrants, 
convertible debentures, options or other non-voting interests with 
rights of conversion to voting interests shall not be attributed unless 
and until conversion is effected.
    (g)(1) A limited partnership interest shall be attributed to a 
limited partner unless that partner is not materially involved, directly 
or indirectly, in the management or operation of the media-related 
activities of the partnership and the licensee or system so certifies.
    (2) In order for a licensee or system to make the certification set 
forth in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, it must verify that the 
partnership agreement or certificate of limited partnership, with 
respect to the particular limited partner exempt from attribution, 
establishes that the exempt limited partner has no material involvement, 
directly or indirectly, in the management or operation of the media 
activities of the partnership. The criteria which would assume adequate 
insulation for purposes of this certification are described in the 
Memorandum Opinion and Order in MM Docket No. 83-46, FCC 85-252 
(released June 24, 1985), as modified on reconsideration in the 
Memorandum Opinion and Order in MM Docket No. 83-46, FCC 86-410 
(released November 28, 1986). Irrespective of the terms of the 
certificate of limited partnership or partnership agreement, however, no 
such certification shall be made if the individual or entity making the 
certification has actual knowledge of any material involvement of the 
limited partners in the management or operation of the media-related 
businesses of the partnership.
    (h) Officers and directors of a broadcast licensee, cable television 
system or daily newspaper are considered to have a cognizable interest 
in the entity with which they are so associated. If any such entity 
engages in businesses in addition to its primary business of 
broadcasting, cable television service or newspaper publication, it may 
request the Commission to waive attribution for any officer or director 
whose duties and responsibilities are wholly unrelated to its primary 
business. The officers and directors of a parent company of a broadcast 
licensee, cable television system or daily newspaper, with an 
attributable interest in any such subsidiary entity, shall be deemed to 
have a cognizable interest in the subsidiary unless the duties and 
responsibilities of the officer or director involved are wholly 
unrelated to the broadcast licensee, cable television system or daily 
newspaper subsidiary, and a statement properly documenting this fact is 
submitted to the Commission. [This statement may be included on the 
appropriate Ownership Report.] The officers and directors of a sister 
corporation of a broadcast licensee, cable television system or daily 
newspaper shall not be attributed with ownership of these entities by 
virtue of such status.
    (i) Discrete ownership interests will be aggregated in determining 
whether or not an interest is cognizable under this section. An 
individual or entity will be deemed to have a cognizable investment if:
    (1) The sum of the interests held by or through ``passive 
investors'' is equal to or exceeds 10 percent; or
    (2) The sum of the interests other than those held by or through 
``passive investors'' is equal to or exceeds 5 percent; or
    (3) The sum of the interests computed under paragraph (i)(1) of this 
section plus the sum of the interests computed under paragraph (i)(2) of 
this section is equal to or exceeds 10 percent.

    Note 3: In cases where record and beneficial ownership of voting 
stock is not identical (e.g., bank nominees holding stock as record 
owners for the benefit of mutual funds, brokerage houses holding stock 
in street names for the benefit of customers, investment advisors 
holding stock in their own names for the benefit of clients, and 
insurance companies holding stock), the party having the right to 
determine how the stock

[[Page 332]]

will be voted will be considered to own it for purposes of these rules.

    Note 4: Paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section will not be 
applied so as to require divestiture, by any licensee, of existing 
facilities, and will not apply to applications for increased power for 
Class C stations, to applications for assignment of license or transfer 
of control filed in accordance with Sec. 73.3540(f) or Sec. 73.3541(b), 
or to applications for assignment of license or transfer of control to 
heirs or legatees by will or intestacy if no new or increased overlap 
would be created between commonly owned, operated or controlled 
broadcast stations in the same service and if no new encompassment of 
Communities proscribed in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section as to 
commonly owned, operated or controlled broadcast stations or daily 
newspaper would result. Said paragraphs will apply to all applications 
for new stations, to all other applications for assignment or transfer, 
and to all applications for major changes in existing stations except 
major changes that will result in overlap of contours of broadcast 
stations in the same service with each other no greater than already 
existing. (The resulting areas of overlap of contours of such broadcast 
stations with each other in such major change cases may consist partly 
or entirely of new terrain. However, if the population in the resulting 
areas substantially exceeds that in the previously existing overlap 
areas, the Commission will not grant the application if it finds that to 
do so would be against the public interest, convenience or necessity.) 
Commonly owned, operated or controlled broadcast stations with 
overlapping contours or with community-encompassing contours prohibited 
by this section may not be assigned or transferred to a single person, 
group or entity, except as provided above in this note and by 
Sec. 73.3555(a). If a commonly owned, operated or controlled broadcast 
station and daily newspaper fall within the encompassing proscription of 
this section, the station may not be assigned to a single person, group 
or entity if the newspaper is being simultaneously sold to such single 
person, group or entity.

    Note 5: Paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section will not be 
applied to cases involving television stations that are ``satellite'' 
operations. Such cases will be considered in accordance with the 
analysis set forth in the Report and Order in MM Docket No. 87-8, FCC 
91-182( released July 8, 1991), in order to determine whether common 
ownership, operation, or control of the stations in question would be in 
the public interest. An authorized and operating ``satellite'' 
television station, the Grade B contour of which overlaps that of a 
commonly owned, operated, or controlled ``non-satellite'' parent 
television broadcast station, or the Grade A contour of which completely 
encompasses the community of publication of a commonly owned, operated, 
or controlled daily newspaper, or the community of license of a commonly 
owned, operated, or controlled AM or FM broadcast station, or the 
community of license of which is completely encompassed by the 2 mV/m 
contour of such AM broadcast station or the 1 mV/m contour of such FM 
broadcast station, may subsequently become a ``non-satellite'' station 
under the circumstances described in the aforementioned Report and Order 
in MM Docket No. 87-8. However, such commonly owned, operated, or 
controlled ``non-satellite'' television stations and AM or FM stations 
with the aforementioned community encompassment, may not be transferred 
or assigned to a single person, group, or entity except as provided in 
Note 4 of this section. Nor shall any application for assignment or 
transfer concerning such ``non-satellite'' stations be granted if the 
assignment or transfer would be to the same person, group or entity to 
which the commonly owned, operated, or controlled newspaper is proposed 
to be transferred, except as provided in Note 4 of this section.

    Note 6: For the purposes of this section a daily newspaper is one 
which is published four or more days per week, which is in the English 
language and which is circulated generally in the community of 
publication. A college newspaper is not considered as being circulated 
generally.

    Note 7: The Commission will entertain requests to waive the 
restrictions of paragraph (c) of this section on a case-by-case basis. 
The Commission will look favorably upon waiver applications that meet 
either of the following two standards:

    (1) Those involving radio and television station combinations in the 
top 25 television markets where there will be at least 30 separately 
owned, operated and controlled broadcast licensees after the proposed 
combination, as determined by counting television licensees in the 
relevant ADI television market and radio licensees in the relevant 
television metropolitan market;
    (2) Those involving ``failed'' broadcast stations that have not been 
operated for a substantial period of time, e.g., four months, or that 
are involved in bankruptcy proceedings. For the purposes of determining 
the top 25 ADI television markets, the relevant ADI television market, 
and the relevant television metropolitan market for each prospective 
combination, we will use the most recent Arbitron Ratings Television ADI 
Market Guide. We will determine that number of radio stations in the 
relevant television metropolitan market and the number of television 
licensees within the relevant ADI television market based on the most 
recent Commission ownership records.

[[Page 333]]

    Other waiver requests will be evaluated on a more rigorous case-by-
case basis, as set forth in the Second Report and Order in MM Docket No. 
87-7, FCC 88-407, released February 23, 1989, and Memorandum Opinion and 
Order in MM Docket No. 87-7, FCC 89-256, released August 4, 1989.

    Note 8: Paragraph (a)(1) of this section will not apply to an 
application for an AM station license in the 535-1605 kHz band where 
grant of such application will result in the overlap of 5 mV/m 
groundwave contours of the proposed station and that of another AM 
station in the 535-1605 kHz band that is commonly owned, operated or 
controlled if the applicant shows that a significant reduction in 
interference to adjacent or co-channel stations would accompany such 
common ownership. Such AM overlap cases will be considered on a case-by-
case basis to determine whether common ownership, operation or control 
of the stations in question would be in the public interest. Applicants 
in such cases must submit a contingent application of the major or minor 
facilities change needed to achieve the interference reduction along 
with the application which seeks to create the 5 mV/m overlap situation.

    Note 9: Paragraph (a)(1) of this section will not apply to an 
application for an AM station license in the 1605-1705 kHz band where 
grant of such application will result in the overlap of the 5 mV/m 
groundwave contours of the proposed station and that of another AM 
station in the 535-1605 kHz band that is commonly owned, operated or 
controlled. Paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (d)(1)(ii) of this section will not 
apply to an application for an AM station license in the 1605-1705 kHz 
band by an entity that owns, operates, controls or has a cognizable 
interest in AM radio stations in the 535-1605 kHz band.

    Note 10: Authority for joint ownership granted pursuant to Note 9 
will expire at 3 a.m. local time on the fifth anniversary for the date 
of issuance of a construction permit for an AM radio station in the 
1605-1705 kHz band.

<R05>
Sec. 73.3556  Duplication of programming on commonly owned or time brokered stations.

    (a) No commercial AM or FM radio station shall operate so as to 
devote more than 25 percent of the total hours in its average broadcast 
week to programs that duplicate those of any station in the same service 
(AM or FM) which is commonly owned or with which it has a time brokerage 
agreement if the principal community contours (predicted or measured 5 
mV/m groundwave for AM stations and predicted 3.16 mV/m for FM stations) 
of the stations overlap and the overlap constitutes more than 50 percent 
of the total principal community contour service area of either station.
    (b) For purposes of this section, duplication means the broadcasting 
of identical programs within any 24 hour period.
    (c) Any party engaged in a time brokerage arrangement which 
conflicts with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section on 
September 16, 1992, shall bring that arrangement into compliance within 
one year thereafter.

[57 FR 18093, Apr. 29, 1992, as amended at 57 FR 42706, Sept. 16, 1992]

    Effective Date Note:  At 57 FR 18093, Apr. 29, 1992, Sec. 73.3556 
was added, effective August 1, 1992. At 57 FR 35763, Aug. 11, 1992, the 
effective date was deferred pending action by the agency. At 57 FR

Sec. 73.3561  Staff consideration of applications requiring Commission action.

    Upon acceptance of an application, the complete file is reviewed by 
the staff and, except where the application is acted upon by the staff 
pursuant to delegation of authority, a report containing the 
recommendations of the staff and any other documents required is 
prepared and placed on the Commission's agenda.

Sec. 73.3562  Staff consideration of applications not requiring action by the Commission.

    Those applications which do not require action by the Commission but 
which, pursuant to the delegations of authority set forth in subpart B 
of part 0, may be acted upon by the Chief, Mass Media Bureau, are 
forwarded to the Mass Media Bureau for necessary action. If the 
application is granted, the formal authorization is issued. In any case 
where it is recommended that

Sec. 73.3564  Acceptance of applications.

    (a) Applications tendered for filing are dated upon receipt and then 
forwarded to the Mass Media Bureau, where an administrative examination 
is made to ascertain whether the applications are complete. Except for 
non-reserved band FM (except for Class D) applications, those found to 
be complete or substantially complete are accepted for filing and are 
given file numbers.In the case of minor defects as to completeness, the 
applicant will be required to supply the missing or correct information. 
Applications that are not substantially complete will be returned to the 
applicant. In the case of non-reserved band FM applications received on 
or after August 7, 1992, applications will be placed on public notice if 
they meet the following two-tiered minimum filing requirement prior to 
close of the filing window in window proceedings and as initially filed 
in first come/first served proceedings:
    (1) The application must include:
    (i) Applicant's name and address,
    (ii) Applicant's original signature,
    (iii) Principal community,
    (iv) Channel or frequency,
    (v) Class of station, and
    (vi) Transmitter site coordinates; and
    (2) The application must not omit more than 3 of the second tier 
items specified in appendix C, Report and Order, MM Docket No. 91-347, 
FCC 92-328, 7 FCC Rcd 5074 (1992). Applications found not to meet 
minimum filing requirements will be returned to the applicant. 
Applications found to meet minimum filing requirements but that contain 
deficiencies in tender and/or acceptance information shall be given an 
opportunity for corrective amendment pursuant to Sec. 73.3522. 
Applications found to be substantially complete and in accordance with 
the Commission's core legal and technical requirements will be accepted 
for filing. Applications with uncorrected tender and/or acceptance 
defects remaining after the opportunity for corrective amendment will be 
dismissed with no further opportunity for corrective amendment. In the 
case of low power TV, TV translator and TV booster applications, those 
found to be substantially complete will be listed on a Commission public 
notice as tendered for filing and given file numbers. Those that are not 
substantially complete will be returned to the applicant. If it is 
determined that a low power TV, TV translator or TV booster application 
is substantially complete but contains some defect(s) or omission(s), a 
deficiency letter will be issued affording the applicant 30 days to 
correct the defect. If the defect is not corrected within 30 days of the 
date on the deficiency letter, the application will be returned with no 
further opportunity to amend.

    Note: For non-reserved band FM applications received prior to August 
7, 1992 applications with deficiencies in tender and/or acceptance 
information will be returned to the applicant without an opportunity for 
corrective amendment. See 50 FR 19936 (May 13, 1985).

    (b) Acceptance of an application for filing merely means that it has 
been the subject of a preliminary review by the FCC's administrative 
staff as to completeness. Such acceptance will not preclude the 
subsequent dismissal of the application if it is found to be patently 
not in accordance with the FCC's rules.
    (c) At regular intervals, the FCC will issue a Public Notice listing 
all applications and major amendments thereto which have been accepted 
for filing, except for low power TV, TV translator, TV booster, and non-
reserved band FM stations. Pursuant to Secs. 73.3571(c), 73.3572(c) and 
73.3573(d) such notice shall establish a cut-off date (not less than 30 
days from the date of issuance) for the filing of mutually exclusive 
applications and petitions to deny. However, no application will be 
accepted for filing unless certification of compliance with the local 
notice requirements of Sec. 73.3580(h) has been made in the tendered 
application.
    (d) New and major change applications for non-reserved band FM 
stations (except for Class D stations) and for low power TV and TV 
translator stations will be accepted only on

[[Page 335]]

date(s) specified by the Commission. Low power TV and TV translator 
station filing period(s) will be designated by the Commission in a 
Public Notice. No more than five (5) applications for new low power TV 
or TV translator stations may be tendered for filing by any applicant, 
or by any individual or entity having an interest of one (1) percent or 
greater in any applicant(s) in a single filing period. This restriction 
does not apply to applications for major or minor changes in low power 
TV or TV translator stations as defined by Sec. 73.3572. Non-reserved 
band FM facilities and major change applications will have filing dates 
designated by the Commission in the following manner:
    (1) For all vacant non-reserved band FM allocations listed on the FM 
Table of Allotments, Sec. 73.202, as of March 14, 1985, a one-time 
filing period or ``window'' will open for 30 days, beginning on the 31st 
day after the date of publication of the Report and Order in MM Docket 
No. 84-750 in the Federal Register and will close on the 60th day after 
such publication. (This filing window does not apply to the 689 FM 
channels added to the FM Table of Allotments by the Commission's 
decision in MM Docket No. 84-231).
    (2) The 689 FM allocations added to the FM Table of Allotments by MM 
Docket 84-231 will be subject to a series of windows. The Audio Services 
Division of the Mass Media Bureau will establish, by Public Notice, the 
window filing dates for this group of allotments.
    (3) Each Report and Order specifying a new non-reserved FM band 
allocation will identify the window filing period which will begin upon 
the effective date of that Order and continue for at least 30 days.
    (4) Where no applications are tendered during a window filing 
period, applications may be tendered any time after the window closes. 
These applications will be processed on a ``first come/first serve'' 
basis and will be treated as simultaneously filed if filed on the same 
day. Any applications received after the filing of a lead applicant will 
be placed in a queue, according to filing date, behind the lead 
applicant.
    (5) If a non-reserved band FM channel allotment is vacant after the 
grant of a construction permit becomes final, because of a lapsed 
construction permit or for any other reason, the FCC will, by Public 
Notice, announce a subsequent filing window for the acceptance of new 
applications for such channels.
    (6) However, no application will be accepted for tender unless 
certification of compliance with the local notice requirements of 
Sec. 73.3580(h) has been made in the tendered application.
    (e) Applications for operation in the 1605-1705 kHz band will be 
accepted only if filed pursuant to the terms of Sec. 73.30(b).

Sec. 73.3566  Defective applications.

    (a) Applications which are determined to be patently not in 
accordance with the FCC rules, regulations, or other requirements, 
unless accompanied by an appropriate request for waiver, will be 
considered defective and will not be accepted for filing or if 
inadvertently accepted for filing will be dismissed. Requests for waiver 
shall show the nature of the waiver or exception desired and shall set 
forth the reasons in support thereof.
    (b) If an applicant is requested by the FCC to file any additional 
documents or information not included in the prescribed application 
form, a failure to comply with such request will be deemed to render the 
application defective, and such application will be dismissed.

Sec. 73.3568  Dismissal of applications.

    (a) Subject to the provisions of Sec. 73.3523 (Dismissal of 
applications in renewal proceedings) and Sec. 73.3525 (Agreements for 
removing application conflicts), any application may, upon request of 
the applicant be dismissed without prejudice as a matter of right prior 
to the designation of such application for hearing. An applicant's 
request for the return of an application that has been accepted for 
filing will be regarded as a request for dismissal.

[[Page 336]]

    (b) Failure to prosecute an application, or failure to respond to 
official correspondence or request for additional information, will be 
cause for dismissal. Subject to the provisions of Sec. 73.3525, such 
dismissal will be without prejudice where an application has not yet 
been designated for hearing, but may be made with prejudice after 
designation for hearing.
    (c) Subject to the provisions of Sec. 73.3523 (Dismissal of 
applications in renewal proceedings) and Sec. 73.3525 (Agreements for 
removing application conflicts), requests to dismiss an application 
without prejudice after it has been designated for hearing will be 
considered only upon written petition properly served upon all parties 
of record. Such requests shall be granted only upon a showing that the 
request is based on circumstances wholly beyond the applicant's control 
which preclude further prosecution of his application.

<R05>
Sec. 73.3571  Processing of AM broadcast station applications.

    (a) Applications for AM broadcast facilities are divided into three 
groups.
    (1) In the first group are applications for new stations or for 
major changes in the facilities of authorized stations. A major change 
is any increase in power except where accompanied by a complimentary 
reduction of antenna efficiency which leads to the same amount, or less, 
radiation in all directions (in the horizontal and vertical planes when 
skywave propagation is involved, and in the horizontal plane only for 
daytime considerations), relative to the presently authorized radiation 
levels, or any change in frequency, hours of operation, or community of 
license. However, the FCC may, within 15 days after the acceptance for 
filing of any other application for modification of facilities, advise 
the applicant that such application is considered to be one for a major 
change and therefore is subject to the provisions of Secs. 73.3580 and 
1.1111 of this chapter pertaining to major changes.
    (2) The second group consists of applications for licenses and all 
other changes in the facilities of authorized stations.
    (3) The third group consists of applications for operation in the 
1605-1705 kHz band which are filed subsequent to Commission notification 
that allotments have been awarded to petitioners under the procedure 
specified in Sec. 73.30.
    (b) If an application is amended so as to effect a major change as 
defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or so as to result in a 
situation where the original party or parties to the application do not 
retain more than 50% ownership interest in the application as originally 
filed, Sec. 73.3580 will apply to such amended application.
    (c) Applications for new stations or for major changes in the 
facilities of authorized stations are processed as nearly as possible in 
the order in which they are filed. Such applications will be placed in 
the processing line in numerical sequence, and are drawn by the staff 
for study, the lowest file number first. Thus, the file number 
determines the order in which the staff's work is begun on a particular 
application or group of conflicting applications. In order that those 
applications which are entitled to be grouped for processing may be 
fixed prior to the time processing of the earliest filed application is 
begun, the FCC will periodically release a Public Notice listing 
applications which have been accepted for filing and announcing a date 
(not less than 30 days after release) on which the listed applications 
will be considered available and ready for processing and by which all 
mutually exclusive applications and/or petitions to deny the listed 
applications must be filed.
    (1) In order to grant a major or minor change application made 
contingent upon the grant of another licensee's request for a facility 
modification, the Commission will not consider mutually exclusive 
applications by other parties that would not protect the currently 
authorized facilities of the contingent applicants. Such major change 
applications remain, however, subject to the provisions of Secs. 73.3580 
and 1.1111. The Commission shall grant contingent requests for 
construction permits for station modifications only upon a finding that 
such action will promote the public interest, convenience and necessity.

[[Page 337]]

    (2) In addition to announcing the acceptance of mutually exclusive 
applications and establishing a date for the filing of petitions to deny 
such applications, the public notice referred to in paragraph (c) of 
this section will also announce the date on which all mutually exclusive 
applicants (including the previously accepted lead applicant) will be 
required to pay the hearing fee established in part 1 of these rules, 47 
CFR 1.1104(2)(c) of this chapter. The date for fee payment shall be at 
least 30 days after the date established for peitions to deny.
    (3) Whenever the public notice announces the acceptance of an 
application that is mutually exclusive with a renewal application, it 
shall also announce that the mutually exclusive applicants and the 
renewal applicant will be required to pay the hearing fee on the date 
established in the public notice.
    (d) Applications proposing to increase the power of an AM station 
are subject to the following requirements:
    (1) In order to be acceptable for filing, any application which does 
not involve a change in site must propose at least a 20% increase in the 
station's nominal power.
    (2) Applications involving a change in site are not subject to the 
requirements in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (3) Applications for nighttime power increases for Class D stations 
are not subject to the requirements of this section and will be 
processed as minor changes.
    (4)  [Reserved]
    (5) The following special procedures will be followed in authorizing 
Class II-D daytime-only stations on 940 and 1550 kHz, and Class III 
daytime-only stations on the 41 regional channels listed in 
Sec. 73.26(a), to operate unlimited-time.
    (i) Each eligible daytime-only station in the foregoing categories 
will receive an Order to Show Cause why its license should not be 
modified to specify operation during nighttime hours with the facilities 
it is licensed to start using at local sunrise, using the power stated 
in the Order to Show Cause, that the Commission finds is the highest 
nighttime level--not exceeding 0.5 kW--at which the station could 
operate without causing prohibited interference to other domestic or 
foreign stations, or to co-channel or adjacent channel stations for 
which pending applications were filed before December 1, 1987.
    (ii) Stations accepting such modification shall be reclassified. 
Those authorized in such Show Cause Orders to operate during nighttime 
hours with a power of 0.25 kW or more, or with a power that, although 
less than 0.25 kW, is sufficient to enable them to attain RMS field 
strengths of 141 mV/m or more at 1 kilometer, shall be redesignated as 
Class II-B stations if they are assigned to 940 or 1550 kHz, and as 
unlimited-time Class III stations if they are assigned to regional 
channels.
    (iii) Stations accepting such modification that are authorized to 
operate during nighttime hours at powers less than 0.25 kW, and that 
cannot with such powers attain RMS field strengths of 141 mV/m or more 
at 1 kilometer, shall be redesignated as Class II-S stations if they are 
assigned to 940 or 1550 kHz, and as Class III-S stations if they are 
assigned to regional channels.
    (iv) Applications for new stations may be filed at any time on 940 
and 1550 kHz and on the regional channels. Also, stations assigned to 
940 or 1550 kHz, or to the regional channels, may at any time, 
regardless of their classifications, apply for power increases up to the 
maximum generally permitted. Such applications for new or changed 
facilities will be granted without taking into account interference 
caused to Class II-S or Class III-S stations, but will be required to 
show interference protection to other classes of stations, including 
stations that were previously classified as Class II-S or Class III-S, 
but were later reclassified as Class II-B or Class III unlimited-time 
stations as a result of subsequent facilities modifications that 
permitted power increases qualifying them to discountinue their ``S'' 
subclassification.
    (e) Applications other than those for new stations or for major 
changes in the facilities of authorized stations are not placed on the 
processing line but are processed as nearly as possible in the order in 
which they are filed.
    (f) Applications for change of license to change hours of operation 
of a Class

[[Page 338]]

C station, to decrease hours of operation of any other class of station, 
or to change station location involving no change in transmitter site 
will be considered without reference to the processing line.
    (g) If, upon examination, the FCC finds that the public interest, 
convenience and necessity will be served by the granting of an 
application, the same will be granted. If the FCC is unable to make such 
a finding and it appears that a hearing may be required, the procedure 
set forth in Sec. 73.3593 will be followed.
    (h) When an application which has been designated for hearing has 
been removed from the hearing docket, the application will be returned 
to its proper position (as determined by the file number) in the 
processing line. Whether or not a new file number will be assigned will 
be determined pursuant to paragraph (i) of this section, after the 
application has been removed from the hearing docket.
    (i)(1) A new file number will be assigned to an application for a 
new station, or for major changes in the facilities of an authorized 
station, when it is amended to change frequency, to increase power, to 
increase hours of operation, or to change station location. Any other 
amendment modifying the engineering proposal, except an amendment 
regarding the type of equipment specified, will also result in the 
assignment of a new file number unless such amendment is accompanied by 
a complete engineering study showing that the amendments would not 
involve new or increased interference problems with existing stations or 
other applications pending at the time the amendment is filed. If, after 
submission and acceptance of such an engineering amendment, subsequent 
examination indicates new or increased interference problems within 
either existing stations or other applications pending at the time the 
amendment was received at the FCC, the application will then be assigned 
a new file number and placed in the processing line according to the 
numerical sequence of the new file number.
    (2) A new file number will be assigned where an application for a 
new station is amended (whether by a single amendment or by a series of 
amendments) so as to result in a situation where the original party or 
parties to the application do not retain more than 50% ownership 
interest in the application as originally filed, and Sec. 73.3580 will 
apply to such amended application.
    (3) Where an amendment to an application would require a new file 
number pursuant to paragraph (j)(1) or (j)(2) of this section, the 
applicant will have an opportunity to withdraw the amendment at any time 
prior to designation for a hearing if applicable; and may be afforded, 
subject to the discretion of the Administrative Law Judge, an 
opportunity to withdraw the amendment after designation for a hearing.
    (4) An application for changes in the facilities of an existing 
station will continue to carry the same file number even though 
(pursuant to FCC approval) an assignment of license or transfer of 
control of said licensee or permittee has taken place if, upon 
consummation, the application is amended to reflect the new ownership.
    (j) When an application is reached for processing, and it is 
necessary to address a letter to the applicant asking further 
information, the application will not be processed until the information 
requested is received, and the application will be placed in the pending 
file to await the applicant's response.
    (k) When an application is placed in the pending file, the applicant 
will be notified of the reason for such action.

<R05>
Sec. 73.3572  Processing of TV broadcast, low power TV, TV translator and TV booster station applications.

    (a) Applications for TV stations are divided into two groups:
    (1) In the first group are applications for new stations or major 
changes in the facilities of authorized stations. A major change for TV 
broadcast stations authorized under this part is any change in frequency 
or community of

[[Page 339]]

license which is in accord with a present allotment contained in the 
Table of Allotments (Sec. 73.606). Other requests for change in 
frequency or community of license for TV broadcast stations must first 
be submitted in the form of a petition for rulemaking to amend the Table 
of Allotments. In the case of low power TV, TV translator, and TV 
booster stations authorized under Part 74 of this chapter, a major 
change is any change in:
    (i) Frequency (output channel) assignment (does not apply to TV 
boosters);
    (ii) Transmitting antenna system including the direction of the 
radiation, directive antenna pattern or transmission line;
    (iii) Antenna height;
    (iv) Antenna location exceeding 200 meters; or
    (v) Authorized operating power.
    (2) However, if the proposed modification of facilities, other than 
a change in frequency, will not increase the signal range of the low 
power TV, TV translator or TV booster station in any horizontal 
direction, the modification will not be considered a major change. 
Provided, that in the case of an authorized low power TV, TV translator 
or TV booster station which is predicted to cause or receive 
interference to or from an authorized TV broadcast station pursuant to 
Sec. 74.705 or interferes with broadcast or other services under 
Sec. 74.703 or Sec. 74.709, that an application for a change in output 
channel, together with technical modifications which are necessary to 
avoid interference (including a change in antenna location of less than 
16.1 km), will not be considered as an application for a major change in 
those facilities. Provided further, that the FCC may, within 15 days 
after the acceptance of any other application for modification of 
facilities, advise the applicant that such application is considered to 
be one for a major change and therefore subject to the provisions of 
Secs. 73.3580 and 1.1111 pertaining to major changes.
    (b) A new file number will be assigned to an application for a new 
station or for major changes in the facilities of an authorized station, 
when it is amended so as to effect a major change, as defined in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or result in a situation where the 
original party or parties to the application do not retain more than 50% 
ownership interest in the application as originally filed and 
Sec. 73.3580 will apply to such amended application. An application for 
change in the facilities of any existing station will continue to carry 
the same file number even though (pursuant to FCC approval) an 
assignment of license or transfer of control of such licensee or 
permittee has taken place if, upon consummation, the application is 
amended to reflect the new ownership.
    (c) Where an amendment to an application would require a new file 
number pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the applicant will 
have the opportunity to withdraw the amendment at any time prior to 
designation for a hearing if applicable; and may be afforded, subject to 
the discretion of the Administrative Law Judge, an opportunity to 
withdraw the amendment after designation for a hearing.
    (d) Applications for TV stations, other than low power TV, TV 
translator and TV booster stations, will be processed as nearly as 
possible in the order in which they are filed. Such applications will be 
placed in the processing line in numerical sequence, and will be drawn 
by the staff for study, the lowest file number first. In order that 
those applications which are entitled to be grouped for processing may 
be fixed prior to the time processing of the earliest filed application 
is begun, the FCC will periodically release a Public Notice listing 
applications which have been accepted for filing and announcing a date 
(not less than 30 days after issuance) on which the listed applications 
will be considered available and ready for processing and by which all 
mutually exclusive applications and petitions to deny the listed 
applications must be filed.
    (1) In addition to announcing the acceptance of mutually exclusive 
applications and establishing a date for the filing of petitions to deny 
such applications, the public notice referred to in paragraph (c) of 
this section will also announce the date on which all mutually exclusive 
applicants (including the previously accepted lead applicant) will be 
required to pay the hearing fee

[[Page 340]]

established in part 1 of these rules, 47 CFR 1.1104(1)(c) of this 
chapter. The date for fee payment shall be at least 30 days after the 
date established for petitions to deny.
    (2) Whenever the public notice announces the acceptance of an 
application that is mutually exclusive with a renewal application, it 
shall also announce that the mutually exclusive applicants and the 
renewal applicant will be required to pay the hearing fee on the date 
established in the public notice.
    (e) Except for applications for low power TV, TV translator and TV 
booster stations, regardless of the number of applications filed for 
channels in a city or the number of assignments available in that city, 
those applications which are mutually exclusive, i.e., which request the 
same channel, will be designated for hearing. All other applications for 
channels will, if the applicants are duly qualified, receive grants. For 
example, if channels 6, 13, 47 and 53 have been assigned to City X and 
there are pending two applications for Channel 6 and one application for 
each of the remaining channels, the latter three applications will be 
considered grants without hearing and the two mutually exclusive 
applications requesting Channel 6 will be designated for hearing. If 
there are two pending applications for Channel 6 and two applications 
for Channel 13, separate hearings will be held.
    (f) Where applications, other than applications for low power TV, TV 
translator, and TV booster stations, are mutually exclusive because the 
distance between the respective proposed transmitter sites is contrary 
to the station separation requirements set forth in Sec. 73.610, such 
applications will be processed and designated for hearing at the time 
the application with the lower file number is reached for processing. In 
order to be considered mutually exclusive with a lower file number 
application, the higher file number application must have been accepted 
for filing at least one day before the lower file number application has 
been acted upon by the FCC.
    (g) Processing of applications for low power TV and TV translator 
stations. (1) Applications for low power TV and TV translator stations 
will be processed as nearly as possible in the order in which they are 
filed. Such applications will be placed in the processing line in 
numerical sequence, and will be drawn by the staff for study, the lowest 
file number first. The FCC will specify, by Public Notice, a period for 
filing low power TV or TV translator applications. The filing period 
will open no less than 30 days after release of the Public Notice and 
remain open for an least five work days.
    (2) Subsequently, the FCC will release a Public Notice: (i) 
Establishing a date, time, and place for a public lottery; (ii) 
accepting for filing mutually exclusive applications which were timely 
filed during the filing period previously specified by the FCC; (iii) 
designating the listed mutually exclusive applications for public 
lottery pursuant to the procedures set forth in Sec. 1.1601 et seq.; and 
(iv) describing each applicant's certified perferences and selection 
probabilities and assigning to each applicant a number block. (It will 
be the applicant's responsibility to notify the FCC, within 30 days of 
the release of the Public Notice, or any omissions of applications or 
clerical or mathematical errors in preferences or probabilities. The FCC 
will not entertain appeals involving these matters if timely 
notification to the FCC has not been made.) If necessary, the FCC will 
release subsequent Public Notices correcting only clerical or 
mathematical errors and including any previously omitted mutually 
exclusive applications. The public lottery pursuant to the procedures 
set forth in Sec. 1.1601 et seq., will be held no less than 30 days 
subsequent to the initially released Public Notice announcing the 
lottery. Subsequent to the lottery, the FCC will release a Public Notice 
announcing the selection of a tentative selectee resulting from the 
lottery and providing and opportunity for the filing of Petitions to 
Deny pursuant to the requirements of Sec. 73.3584(c). If, upon 
examination, the FCC finds that the public interest, convenience and 
necessity will be served by the granting of a tentative selectee's 
application, the same will be granted. Those applications which, due to 
the lottery, are no longer mutually exclusive with other applications 
will

[[Page 341]]

be announced in a Public Notice proposing the grant of those 
applications and providing an opportunity for the filing of Petitions to 
Deny pursuant to Sec. 73.3584(c). Groups of mutually exclusive 
applicants remaining after a lottery will be designated for lottery. 
Applications which are are not grantable due to mutual exclusivity with 
the permittee selected by lottery will be dismissed.
    (3) If, upon examination, the FCC is unable to find that the public 
interest, convenience and necessity will be served by the granting of a 
lottery tentative selectee's applications, and it appears that a hearing 
may be required, the procedure set forth in Sec. 73.3593 will be 
followed. No further action will be taken with reference to the other 
applications in the lottery group from which the tentative selectee was 
selected until the tentative selectee's qualifications to be a permittee 
are resolved. If the tentative selectee is ultimately found to be 
unqualified to be a permittee, the procedure set forth in paragraph 
(f)(2) of this section will be followed.
    (4) The FCC will periodically release a Public Notice accepting for 
filing and proposing for grant those applications which were timely 
filed during the filing period specified by the FCC in a Public Notice 
for filing low power TV or TV translator applications, but which are not 
mutually exclusive with any other application, and providing an 
opportunity for the filing of Petitions to Deny pursuant to 
Sec. 73.3584.

    Note 1: Notwithstanding paragraph (f)(1) and Sec. 73.3522(a)(3), 
applications for low power TV and TV translator stations will be

Sec. 73.3573  Processing FM broadcast station applications.

    (a) Applications for FM broadcast stations are divided into two 
groups:
    (1) In the first group are applications for new stations or for 
major changes in the facilities of authorized stations. A major change 
for FM station authorized under this part is any change in frequency or 
community of license which is in accord with a present allotment 
contained in the Table of Allotments (73.202 (b)). Other requests for 
change in frequency or community of license for FM stations must first 
be submitted in the form of a petition for rule making to amend the 
Table of Allotments. Applications filed on a first come, first served 
basis may propose a higher or lower class adjacent, intermediate 
frequency or co-channel in an application for a new FM broadcast 
station. A licensee or permittee may seek the higher or lower class 
adjacent, intermediate frequency or co-channel or the same class 
adjacent channel of its existing FM broadcast station authorization by 
filing a minor change application. For noncommercial educational FM 
stations, a major change is any change in frequency or community of 
license or any change in power

[[Page 342]]

or antenna location or height above average terrain (or combination 
thereof) which would result in a change of 50% or more in the area 
within the station's predicted 1 mV/m field strength contour. (A change 
in area is defined as the sum of the area gained and the area lost as a 
percentage of the original area). However, the FCC may within 15 days 
after the acceptance of the application for modification of facilities, 
advise the applicant that such application is considered to be one for a 
major change and therefore subject to the provisions of Secs. 73.3580 
and 1.1111 of this chapter pertaining to major changes.
    (2) The second group consists of applications for licenses and all 
other changes in the facilities of authorized stations.
    (b) A new file number will be assigned to an application for a new 
station or for major changes in the facilities of an authorized station, 
when it is amended so as to effect a major change, as defined in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or result in a situation where the 
original party or parties to the application do not retain more than 50% 
ownership interest in the application as originally filed, and 
Sec. 73.3580 will apply to such amended application. An application for 
changes in the facilities of any existing station will continue to carry 
the same file number even though (pursuant to FCC approval) an 
assignment of license or transfer of control of such licensee or 
permittee has taken place if, upon consummation, the application is 
amended to reflect the new ownership.
    (c) Where an amendment to an application would require a new file 
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the applicant will have the 
opportunity to withdraw the amendment at any time prior to designation 
for a hearing if applicable; and may be afforded, subject to the 
discretion of the Administrative Law Judge, an opportunity to withdraw 
the amendment after designation for a hearing.
    (d) If, upon examination, the FCC finds that the public interest, 
convenience and necessity will be served by the granting of an 
application for FM broadcast facilities, the same will be granted. If 
the FCC is unable to make such a finding and it appears that a hearing 
may be required, the procedure given in Sec. 73.3593 will be followed.
    (e) Applications for reserved band and Class D FM broadcast stations 
will be processed as nearly as possible in the order in which they are 
filed. Such applications will be placed in the processing line in 
numerical sequence, and will be drawn by the staff for study, the lowest 
file number first. In order that those applications which are entitled 
to be grouped for processing may be fixed prior to the time processing 
of the earliest filed application is begun, the FCC will periodically 
release a Public Notice listing applications which have been accepted 
for filing and announcing a date (not less than 30 days after 
publication) on which the listed applications will be considered 
available and ready for processing and by which all mutually exclusive 
applications and/or petitions to deny the listed applications must be 
filed.
    (f) Where reserved band plus Class D applications are mutually 
exclusive because the distance between their respective proposed 
transmitter sites is contrary to the station separation requirements set 
forth in Sec. 73.507, such applications will be processed and designated 
for hearing at the time the application with the lower file number is 
reached for processing. In order to be considered mutually exclusive 
with a lower file number application, the higher file number application 
must have been accepted for filing at least one day before the lower 
file number application has been acted upon by the FCC.
    (g) Processing non-reserved FM broadcast station applications.
    (1) Applications for non-reserved FM broadcast stations will be 
processed as nearly as possible in the order in which they are tendered. 
Such applications will be placed in the processing line in numerical 
sequence, and will be drawn by the staff for study, the lowest file 
number first. The FCC will specify, pursuant to Sec. 73.3564(d), the 
filing periods for non-reserved band FM applications.
    (2) All applications received during the appropriate filing period 
or ``window'' which are found to be mutually exclusive will be 
designated for hearing. All other applications will, if the

[[Page 343]]

applicants are duly qualified, receive grants. The FCC will periodically 
release a Public Notice listing applications pending hearings or grant 
and announcing a date (not less than 30 days after issuance) by which 
petitions to deny must be filed.
    (i) In addition to announcing the acceptance of mutually exclusive 
applications and establishing a date for the filing of petitions to deny 
such applications, the public notice referred to in paragraph (g)(2) of 
this section will also announce the date on which all mutually exclusive 
applicants will be required to pay the hearing fee established in part 1 
of these rules, 47 CFR 1.1104(2)(c) of this chapter. The date for fee 
payment shall be at least 30 days after the date established for 
petitions to deny.
    (ii) Whenever the public notice announces the acceptance of an 
application that is mutually exclusive with a renewal application, it 
shall also announce that the mutually exclusive applicants and the 
renewal applicant will be required to pay the hearing fee on the date 
established in the public notice.
    (3) If, after the close of the appropriate window filing period, a 
non-reserved FM allotment remains vacant, processing for that channel 
will be on a ``first come/first serve'' basis with the first acceptable 
application cutting off the filing rights of subsequent applicants. All 
applications received on the same day will be treated as simultaneously 
tendered and, if they are found to be mutually exclusive, will be 
designated for hearing. Applications received after the tender of a lead 
application will be grouped, according to filing date, behind the lead 
application in a queue. The priority rights of the lead applicant, as 
against all other applicants, are determined by the date of filing but 
the filing date for subsequent applicants for that channel and community 
only reserves a place in the queue. The rights of an applicant in a 
queue ripen only upon a final determination that the lead applicant is 
unacceptable and if the queue member is reached and found acceptable. 
The queue will remain behind the lead applicant until a construction 
permit is finally granted, at which time the queue dissolves. If there 
is no queue or if no queue member is found acceptable, that allotment 
remains subject to ``first come/first serve'' processing. The FCC will 
periodically release a Public Notice listing those pending hearings or 
grant and announcing a date (not less than 30 days after issuance) by 
which petitions to deny must be filed.
    (h) Resolving processing conflicts between the reserved and non-
reserved bands. The reserved bands include Class D stations.
    (1) Reserved band applicants, applying for a channel on the non-
reserved band are subject to the processing procedures in paragraph (f).
    (2) If a reserved band applicant has generated a cut-off list that 
overlaps a non-reserved band window filing period, the non-reserved band 
applicant must file within the cut-off if he seeks mutually exclusive 
status with the reserved band applicant.
    (3) Following the close of a non-reserved band application filing 
window, the non-reserved band applicant is subject to the ``first come/
first serve'' rules and would lose to a pre-filed reserved band 
applicant.

    Note  1: Applications to modify the channel and/or class of an FM 
broadcast station to an adjacent channel, intermediate frequency (IF) 
channel, or co-channel shall not require any other amendments to the 
Table of Allotments. Such applications may resort to the provisions of 
the Commission's Rules permitting short spaced stations as set forth in 
Sec. 73.215 as long as the applicant shows by separate exhibit attached 
to the application the existence of an allotment reference site which 
meets the allotment standards, the minimum spacing requirements of 
Sec. 73.207 and the city grade coverage requirements of Sec. 73.315. 
This exhibit must include a site map or, in the alternative, a statement 
that the transmitter will be located on an existing tower. Examples of 
unsuitable allotment reference sites include those which are offshore, 
in a national or state park in which tower construction is prohibited, 
on an airport, or otherwise in an area which would necessarily present a 
hazard to air navigation.
    Note 2: Processing of applications for new low power educational FM 
applications:
    Pending the Commission's restudy of the impact of the rule changes 
pertaining to the allocations of 10-watt and other low power 
noncommercial educational FM stations, applications for such new 
stations, or major changes in existing ones, will not be accepted for 
filing. Exceptions are: (1) In Alaska,

[[Page 344]]

applications for new Class D stations or major changes in existing ones 
are acceptable for filing; and (2) applications for existing Class D 
stations to change frequency are acceptable for filing. In (2), upon the 
grant of such application, the station shall become a Class D 
(secondary) station. (See First Report and Order, Docket 20735, FCC 78-
386, 43 FR 25821, and Second Report and Order, Docket 20735, FCC 78-384, 
43 FR 39704.) Effective date of this FCC imposed ``freeze'' was June 15, 
1978. Applications which specify facilities of at least 100 watts 
effective radiated power will be accepted for filing.
    Note 3: For rules on processing FM translator and booster stations, 
see Sec. 74.1233 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 73.3574  Processing of international broadcast station applications.

    (a) Applications for International station facilities are divided 
into two groups.
    (1) In the first group are applications for new stations, or for 
major changes in the facilities of authorized stations. A major change 
is any change in or addition to authorized zones or areas of reception, 
any change in transmitter location other than one in the immediate 
vicinity of existing antennas of the station, or any change in power, or 
antenna directivity. However, the FCC may, within 15 days after the 
acceptance for filing of any other application for modification, advise 
the applicant that such application is considered to be one for a major 
change and therefore is subject to Secs. 1.1111 and 73.3580 pertaining 
to major changes.
    (2) The second group consists of applications for licenses and all 
other changes in the facilities of authorized stations.
    (b) If an application is amended so as to effect a major change as 
defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or so as to result in an 
assignment or transfer of control which, in the case of an authorized 
station, would require the filing of an application therefor on FCC Form 
314 or 315 (see Sec. 73.3540), Sec. 73.3580 will apply to such amended 
application.
    (c) Applications for International stations will be processed as 
nearly as possible in the order in which they are filed.

[44 FR 38504, July 2, 1979]


<R05>
Sec. 73.3578  Amendments to applications for renewal, assignment or transfer of control.

    (a) Any amendments to an application for renewal of any instrument 
of authorization shall be considered to be a minor amendment. However, 
the FCC may, within 15 days after tender for filing of any amendment, 
advise the applicant that the amendment is considered to be a major 
amendment and therefore is subject to the provisions of Sec. 73.3580.
    (b) Any amendment to an application for assignment of construction 
permit or license, or consent to the transfer of control of a 
corporation holding such a construction permit or license, shall be 
considered to be a minor amendment, except that any amendment which 
seeks a change in the ownership interest of the proposed assignee or 
transferee which would result in a change in control, or any amendment 
which would require the filing of FCC Forms 314, 315, or 345 (see 
Sec. 73.3540), if the changes sought were made in an original 
application for assignment or transfer of control, shall be considered 
to be a major amendment. However, the FCC may, within 15 days after the 
acceptance for filing of any other amendment, advise the applicant that 
the amendment is considered to be a major amendment and therefore is 
subject to the provisions of Sec. 73.3580.

[44 FR 38504, July 2, 1979, as amended at 51 FR 18451, May 20, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 73.3580  Local public notice of filing of broadcast applications.

    (a) All applications for instruments of authorization in the 
broadcast service (and major amendments thereto, as indicated in 
Secs. 73.3571, 73.3572, 73.3573, 73.3574 and 73.3578) are subject to the 
local public notice provisions of this section, except applications for:
    (1) A minor change in the facilities of an authorized station, as 
indicated in Secs. 73.3571, 73.3572, 73.3573 and 73.3574.

filing in a newspaper. Exceptions to this requirement are applications 
for renewal of AM, FM, TV and International broadcasting stations; low 
power TV stations; TV and FM translator stations, TV booster stations; 
FM booster stations; and applications subject to paragraph (e) of this 
section. The local public notice must be completed within 30 days of the 
tendering of the application. In the event the FCC notifies the 
applicant that a major change is involved, requiring the applicant to 
file public notice pursuant to Secs. 73.3571, 73.3572, 73.3573 or 
73.3578, this filing notice shall be given in a newspaper following this

section.
    (d) The licensee of an operating broadcast station who files an 
application or amendment thereto which is subject to the provisions of 
this section must gibe notice as follows:
    (1) An applicant who files for renewal of a broadcast station 
license, other than a low power TV station license not locally 
originating programming as defined by Sec. 74.701(h), an FM translator 
station or a TV translator station license, must give notice of this 
filing by broadcasting announcements on applicant's station. (Sample and 
schedule of announcements are below.) Newspaper publication is not 
required. An applicant who files for renewal of a low power TV station 
license not locally

[[Page 346]]

originating programming as defined by Sec. 74.701(h), an FM translator 
station or a TV translator station license will comply with (g) below.
    (2) An applicant who files an amendment of an application for 
renewal of a broadcast station lincense will comply with paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section.
    (3) An applicant who files for modification, assignment or transfer 
of a broadcast station license (except for International broadcast, low 
power TV, TV translator, TV booster, FM translator and FM booster 
stations) shall give notice of the filing in a newspaper as described in 
paragraph (c) of this section, and also broadcast the same notice over 
the station as follows:
    (i) At least once daily on four days in the second week immediately 
following either the tendering for filing of the application or 
immediately following notification to the applicant by the FCC that 
Public Notice is required pursuant to Secs. 73.3571, 73.3572, 73.3573 or 
Sec. 73.3578. For commercial radio stations these announcements shall be 
made between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. and/or 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. For stations 
which neither operate between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. nor between 4 p.m. and 6 
p.m., these announcements shall be made during the first two hours of 
broadcast operation. For commercial TV stations, these announcements 
shall be made between 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. (5 p.m. and 10 p.m. Central and

    (i) Pre-filing announcements. During the period and beginning on the 
first day of the sixth calendar month prior to the expiration of the 
license, and continuing to the date on which the application is filed, 
the following announcement shall be broadcast on the 1st and 16th day of 
each calendar month. Stations broadcasting primarily in a foreign 
language should broadcast the announcements in that language.

    On (date of last renewal grant) (Station's call letters) was granted 
a license by the Federal Communication Commission to serve the public 
interest as a public trustee until (expiration date).
    Our license will expire on (date). We must file an application for 
renewal with the FCC (date four calendar months prior to expiration 
date). When filed, a copy of this application will be available for 
public inspection during our regular business hours. It contains 
information concerning this station's performance during the last 
(period of time covered by the application).
    Individuals who wish to advise the FCC of facts relating to our 
renewal application and to whether this station has operated in the 
public interest should file comments and petitions with the FCC by (date 
first day of last full calendar month prior to the month of expiration).
    Further information concerning the FCC's broadcast license renewal 
process is available at (address of location of the station's public 
inspection file) or may be obtained from the FCC, Washington, DC 20554.

    (A) An applicant who files for renewal of a low power TV station 
locally originating programming (as defined by Sec. 74.701(h)) shall 
broadcast this announcement, except that statements indicating there is 
a public inspection file at the station containing the renewal 
application and other information on the license renewal process, shall 
be omitted.
    (B) This announcement shall be made during the following time 
periods:
    (1) For commercial TV stations--at least two of the required 
announcements between 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. (5 p.m. and 10 p.m. Central and

    (2) For commercial radio stations--at least two of the required 
announcements between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. and/or 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. For 
stations which neither operate between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. nor between 4 
p.m. and 6 p.m., at least two of the required announcements shall be 
made during the first two hours of broadcast operation.
    (3) For noncommercial educational stations, at the same time as 
commercial stations, except that such stations need not broadcast the 
announcement during any month during which the station does not operate.
    (4) For low power TV stations locally originating programming (as 
defined by Sec. 74.701(h)), at the same time as for commercial TV 
stations, or as close to that time as possible.
    (ii) Post-filing announcements. During the period beginning of the 
date on which the renewal application is filed

[[Page 347]]

to the sixteenth day of the next to last full calendar month prior to 
the expiration of the license, all applications for renewal of broadcast 
station licenses shall broadcast the following announcement on the 1st 
and 16th day of each calendar month. Stations broadcasting primarily in 
a foreign language should broadcast the announcements in that language.

    On (date of last renewal grant) (Station's call letters) was granted 
a license by the Federal Communications Commission to serve the public 
interest as a public trustee until (expiration date).
    Our license will expire on (date). We have filed an application for 
renewal with the FCC.
    A copy of this application is available for public inspection during 
our regular business hours. It contains information concerning this 
station's performance during the last (period of time covered by 
application).
    Individuals who wish to advise the FCC of facts relating to our 
renewal application and to whether this station has operated in the 
public interest should file comments and petitions with the FCC by (date 
first day of last full calendar month prior to the month of expiration).
    Further information concerning the FCC's broadcast license renewal 
process is available at (address of location of the station's public 
inspection file) or may be obtained from the FCC, Washington, DC 20554.

    (A) An applicant who files for renewal of a low power TV station 
locally originating programming (as defined by Sec. 74.701(h)) shall 
broadcast this announcement, except that statements indicating there is

announcement between noon and 4 p.m., and at least one announcement 
between 7 p.m. and midnight. For stations which do not operate between 7 
a.m. and 9 a.m. or between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m., at least three of the 
required announcements shall be made during the first two hours of 
broadcast operation.
    (3) For noncommercial educational stations, at the same time as 
commercial stations, except that such stations need not broadcast the 
announcement during any month during which the station does not operate. 
In such instances noncommercial educational stations shall meet the 
requirements in the exact order specified in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) (1) 
or (2) of this section (e.g., if only four renewal notices are broadcast 
by an educational TV licensee, 3 must be broadcast between 6 p.m. and 11 
p.m. and the fourth between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m.).
    (4) For low power TV stations locally originating programming (as 
defined by Sec. 74.701(h)), at the same time as for commercial TV 
stations, or as close to that time as possible.
    (iii) TV broadcast stations (commercial and noncommercial 
educational), in presenting the pre- and post-filing announcements, must 
use visuals with the licensee's and the FCC's addresses when this 
information is being orally presented by the announcer.
    (iv) Stations which have not received a renewal grant since the 
filing of their previous renewal application, shall use the following 
first paragraph for the pre-filing and the post-filing announcements:

(Station's call letters) is licensed by the Federal Communications 
Commission to serve the public interest as a public trustee.

    (e) When the station in question is the only operating station in 
its broadcast service which is located in the community involved, or if 
it is a noncommercial educational station, publication of the notice in 
a newspaper, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section is not 
required, and publication by broadcast over that station as provided in 
paragraph (d) of this section shall be deemed sufficient to meet the 
notice requirements of this section. Noncommercial educational broadcast 
stations which do not broadcast during

Sec. 73.3584  Procedure for filing petitions to deny.

    (a) Except in the case of applications for new low power TV, TV 
translator or TV booster stations, for major changes in the existing 
facilities of such stations, or for applications for a change in output 
channel tendered by displaced low power TV and TV translator stations 
pursuant to Sec. 73.3572(a)(1), any party in interest may file with the 
Commission a Petition to Deny any application (whether as originally 
filed or if amended so as to require a new file number pursuant to 
Secs. 73.3571(j), 73.3572(b), 73.3573(b), 73.3574(b) or 73.3578) for 
which local notice pursuant to Sec. 73.3580 is required, provided such 
petitions are filed prior to the day such applications are granted or 
designated for hearing; but where the FCC issues a public notice 
pursuant to the provisions of Secs. 73.3571(c), 73.3572(c) or 
Sec. 73.3573(d), establishing a ``cut-off'' date, such petitions must be 
filed by the date specified. In the case of applications for transfers 
and assignments of construction permits or station licenses, Petitions 
to Deny must be filed not later than 30 days after issuance of a public 
notice of the acceptance for filing of the applications. In the case of 
applications for renewal of license, Petitions to Deny may be filed at 
any time up to the deadline established in Sec. 73.3516(e). Requests for 
extension of time to file Petitions to Deny applications for new 
broadcast stations or major changes in the facilities of existing 
stations or applications for renewal of license will not be granted 
unless all parties concerned, including the applicant, consent to such 
requests, or unless a compelling showing can be made that unusual 
circumstances make the filing of a timely petition impossible and the 
granting of an extension warranted.
    (b) Except in the case of applications for new low power TV or TV 
translator stations, or for major changes in the existing facilities of 
such stations, the applicant may file an opposition to any Petition to 
Deny, and the Petitioner a reply to such opposition in which allegations 
of fact or denials thereof shall be supported by affidavit of a person 
or persons with personal knowledge thereof. The times for filing such 
oppositions and replies shall be those provided in Sec. 1.45 except that 
as to a Petition to Deny an application for renewal of license, an 
opposition thereto may be filed within 30 days after the Petition to 
Deny is filed, and the party that filed the Petition to Deny may reply 
to the opposition within 20 days after opposition is due or within 20 
days after the opposition is filed, whichever is longer. The failure to 
file an opposition or a reply will not necessarily be construed as an 
admission of fact or argument contained in a pleading.
    (c) In the case of applications for new low power TV, TV translator, 
or TV booster stations, for major changes in the existing facilities of 
such stations,

[[Page 350]]

or for applications for a change in output channel tendered by displaced 
low power TV and TV translator stations pursuant to Sec. 73.3572(a)(1), 
any party in interest may file with the FCC a Petition to Deny any 
applcation (whether as originally filed or if amended so as to require a 
new file number pursuant to Sec. 73.3572(b)) for which local notice 
pursuant to Sec. 73.3580 is required, provided such petitions are filed 
within 30 days of the FCC Public Notice proposing the application for 
grant (applicants may file oppositions within 15 days after the Petition 
to Deny is filed); but where the FCC selects a tentative permittee 
pursuant to Section 1.1601 et seq., Petitions to Deny shall be accepted 
only if directed against the tentative selectee and filed after issuance 
of and within 15 days of FCC Public Notice announcing the tentative 
selectee. The applicant may file an opposition within 15 days after the 
Petition to Deny is filed. In cases in which the minimum diversity 
preference provided for in Sec. 1.1623(f)(1) has been applied, an 
``objection to diversity claim'' and opposition thereto, may be filed 
against any applicant receiving a diversity preference, within the same 
time period provided herein for Petitions and Oppositions. In all 
pleadings, allegations of fact or denials thereof shall be supported by 
appropriate certification. However, the FCC may announce, by the Public 
Notice announcing the acceptance of the last-filed mutually exclusive 
application, that a notice of Petition to Deny will be required to be 
filed no later than 30 days after issuance of the Public Notice.
    (d) Untimely Petitions to Deny, as well as other pleadings in the 
nature of a Petition to Deny, and any other pleadings or supplements 
which do not lie as a matter of law or are otherwise procedurally 
defective, are subject to return by the FCC's staff without 
consideration.

Sec. 73.3587  Procedure for filing informal objections.

    Before FCC action on any application for an instrument of 
authorization, any person may file informal objections to the grant. 
Such objections may be submitted in letter form (without extra copies) 
and shall be signed. The limitation on pleadings and time for filing 
pleadings provided for in Sec. 1.45 of the rules shall not be applicable 
to any objections duly filed under this section.

[44 FR 38507, July 2, 1979]


<R05>
Sec. 73.3588  Dismissal of petitions to deny or withdrawal of informal objections.

    (a) Whenever a petition to deny or an informal objection has been 
filed against any application, and the filing party seeks to dismiss or 
withdraw the petition to deny or the informal objection, either 
unilaterally or in exchange for financial consideration, that party must 
file with the Commission a request for approval of the dismissal or 
withdrawal, a copy of any written agreement related to the dismissal or 
withdrawal, and an affidavit setting forth:
    (1) A certification that neither the petitioner nor its principals 
has received or will receive any money or other consideration in excess 
of legitimate and prudent expenses in exchange for the dismissal or 
withdrawal of the petition to deny;
    (2) The exact nature and amount of any consideration received or 
promised;
    (3) An itemized accounting of the expenses for which it seeks 
reimbursement; and
    (4) The terms of any oral agreement related to the dismissal or 
withdrawal of the petition to deny.

In addition, within 5 days of petitioner's request for approval, each 
remaining party to any written or oral agreement must submit an 
affidavit setting forth:
    (5) A certification that neither the applicant nor its principals 
had paid or will pay money or other consideration in excess of the 
legitimate and prudent expenses of the petitioner in exchange for 
dismissing or withdrawing the petition to deny; and
    (6) The terms of any oral agreement relating to the dismissal or 
withdrawal of the petition to deny.

[[Page 351]]

    (b) Citizens' agreements. For purposes of this section, citizens 
agreements include agreements arising whenever a petition to deny or 
informal objection has been filed against any application and the filing 
party seeks to dismiss or withdraw the petition or objection in exchange 
for nonfinancial consideration (e.g., programming, ascertainment or 
employment initiatives). The parties to such an agreement must file with 
the Commission a joint request for approval of the agreement, a copy of 
any written agreement, and an affidavit executed by each party setting 
forth:
    (1) Certification that neither the petitioner, nor any person or 
organization related to the petitioner, has received or will receive any 
money or other consideration in connection with the citizens' agreement 
other than legitimate and prudent expenses incurred in prosecuting the 
petition to deny;
    (2) Certification that neither the petitioner, nor any person or 
organization related to petitioner is or will be involved in carrying 
out, for a fee, any programming, ascertainment, employment or other non-
financial initiative referred to in the citizens' agreement; and
    (3) The terms of any oral agreement.
    (c) For the purposes of this section:
    (1) Affidavits filed pursuant to this section shall be executed by 
the applicant, permittee or licensee, if an individual; a partner having 
personal knowledge of the facts, if a partnership; or an officer having 
personal knowledge of the facts, if a corporation or association.
    (2) A petition shall be deemed to be pending before the Commission 
from the time a petition is filed with the Commission until an order of 
the Commission granting or denying the petition is no longer subject to 
reconsideration by the Commission or to review by any court.
    (3) ``Legitimate and prudent expenses'' are those expenses 
reasonably incurred by a petitioner in preparing, filing, and 
prosecuting its petition for which reimbursement is being sought.
    (4) ``Other consideration'' consists of financial concessions, 
including but not limited to the transfer of assets or the provision of 
tangible pecuniary benefit, as well as non-financial concessions that 
confer any type of benefit on the recipient.

Sec. 73.3589  Threats to file petitions to deny or informal objections.

    (a) No person shall make or receive any payments in exchange for 
withdrawing a threat to file or refraining from filing a petition to 
deny or an informal objection. For the purposes of this section, 
reimbursement by an applicant of the legitimate and prudent expenses of 
a potential petitioner or objector incurred reasonably and directly in 
preparing to file a petition to deny will not be considered to be 
payment for refraining from filing a petition to deny or informal 
objection. Payments made directly to a potential petitioner or objector, 
or a person related to a potential petitioner or objector, to implement 
nonfinancial promises are prohibited unless specifically approved by the 
Commission.
    (b) Whenever any payment is made in exchange for withdrawing a 
threat to file or refraining from filing a petition to deny or informal 
objection, the licensee must file with the Commission a copy of any 
written agreement related to the dismissal or withdrawal, and an 
affidavit setting forth:
    (1) Certification that neither the would-be petitioner, nor any 
person or organization related to the would-be petitioner, has received 
or will receive any money or other consideration in connection with the 
citizens' agreement other than legitimate and prudent expenses 
reasonably incurred in preparing to file the petition to deny;
    (2) Certification that unless such arrangement has been specifically 
approved by the Commission, neither the would-be petitioner, nor any 
person or organization related to the would-be petitioner, is or will be 
involved in carrying out, for a fee, any programming ascertainment, 
employment or other nonfinancial initiative referred to in the citizens' 
agreement; and
    (3) The terms of any oral agreement.
    (c) For purposes of this section:

[[Page 352]]

    (1) Affidavits filed pursuant to this section shall be executed by 
the licensee, if an individual; a partner having personal knowledge of 
the facts, if a partnership; or an officer having personal knowledge of 
the facts, if a corporation or association.
    (2) ``Legitimate and prudent expenses'' are those expenses 
reasonably incurred by a would-be petitioner in preparing to file its 
petition for which reimbursement is being sought.
    (3) ``Other consideration'' consists of financial concessions, 
including but not limited to the transfer of assets or the provision of 
tangible pecuniary benefit, as well as non-financial concessions that 
confer any type of benefit on the recipient.

Sec. 73.3591  Grants without hearing.

    (a) Except for renewal applications filed after May 1, 1995 which 
will be subject to paragraph (d) of this section, in the case of any 
application for an instrument of authorization, other than a license 
pursuant to a construction permit, the FCC will make the grant if it 
finds (on the basis of the application, the pleadings filed or other 
matters which it may officially notice) that the application presents no 
substantial and material question of fact and meets the following 
requirements:
    (1) There is not pending a mutually exclusive application filed in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section;
    (2) The applicant is legally, technically, financially, and 
otherwise qualified;
    (3) The applicant is not in violation of provisions of law, the FCC 
rules, or established policies of the FCC; and
    (4) A grant of the application would otherwise serve the public 
interest, convenience and necessity.
    (b) In making its determinations pursuant to the provisions of 
paragraph (a) of this section, the FCC will not consider any other 
application, or any application if amended so as to require a new file 
number, as being mutually exclusive or in conflict with the application 
under consideration unless such other application was substantially 
complete, and tendered for filing by:
    (1) The close of business on the day preceding the day designated by 
Public Notice as the day the listed application is to be available and 
ready for processing;
    (2) The date prescribed in Sec. 73.3516(e) in the case of 
applications which are mutually exclusive with applications for renewal 
of license of broadcast stations; or
    (3) The close of business on the day designated by the FCC pursuant 
to Sec. 73.3564(d) as the date(s) for filing low power TV or TV 
translator applications.
    (c) If a petition to deny the application has been filed in 
accordance with Sec. 73.3584 and the FCC makes the grant in accordance 
with paragraph (a) of this section, the FCC will deny the petition and 
issue a concise statement setting forth the reasons for denial and 
disposing of all substantial issues raised by the petition.
    (d) Renewal applications filed after May 1, 1995 will be governed by 
the criteria established in 47 U.S.C. Sec. 309(k).

<R05>
Sec. 73.3592  Conditional grant.

    (a) Where a grant of an application would preclude the grant of any 
application or applications mutually exclusive with it, the FCC may, if 
the public interest will be served thereby, make a conditional grant of 
one of the applications and designate all of the mutually exclusive 
applications for hearing. Such conditional grant will be made upon the 
express condition that such grant is subject to being withdrawn if, at 
the hearing, it is shown that public interest will be better served by a 
grant of one of the other applications. Such conditional grants will be 
issued only where it appears:
    (1) That some or all of the applications were not filed in good 
faith but were filed for the purpose of delaying or hindering the grant 
of another application; or
    (2) That public interest requires the prompt establishment of 
broadcast service in a particular community or area; or
    (3) That a grant of one or more applications would be in the public 
interest, and that a delay in making a grant to

[[Page 353]]

any applicant until after the conclusion of a hearing on all 
applications might jeopardize the rights of the United States under the 
provisions of international agreement to the use of the frequency in 
question; or
    (4) That a grant of one application would be in the public interest, 
and that it appears from an examination of the remaining applications 
that they cannot be granted because they are in violation of provisions 
of the Communications Act, other statutes, or the provisions of the FCC 
rules.
    (b) When two or more applications for the same AM, FM or TV 
assignment have been designated for hearing, the FCC may, if the public 
interest will be served thereby, make a conditional grant to a group 
composed of any two or more of the competing applicants, such grant to 
terminate when the successful applicant commences operation under the 
terms of a regular authorization. No conditional grant will be made 
unless all of the competing applicants have been afforded a reasonable 
opportunity to participate in the group seeking the conditional grant. 
In its application, the group shall include a special showing as to the 
need for the service pending operation by the successful applicant under 
the terms of a regular authorization; the effect, if any, of a grant on 
the position of any applicant which is not a member of the group; and 
any other factors which are deemed pertinent to the public interest 
judgment.

<R05>
Sec. 73.3593  Designation for hearing.

    If the FCC is unable, in the case of any application for an 
instrument of authorization, to make the findings specified in 
Sec. 73.3591(a), it will formally designate the application for hearing 
on the grounds or reasons then obtaining and will forthwith notify the 
applicant and all known parties in interest of such action and the 
grounds and reasons therefor, specifying with particularity the matters 
and things in issue but not including issues or requirements phrased 
generally.

<R05>
Sec. 73.3594  Local public notice of designation for hearing.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section 
when an application subject to the provisions of Sec. 73.3580 (except 
for applications for International broadcast, low power TV, TV 
translator, FM translator, and FM booster stations) is designated for 
hearing, the applicant shall give notice of such designation as follows: 
Notice shall be given at least twice a week, for 2 consecutive weeks 
within the 3-week period immediately following release of the FCC's 
order, specifying the time and place of the commencement of the hearing,

in which the station is located or proposed to be located.
    (1) However, if there is no such daily newspaper published in the 
community, the notice shall be given as follows:
    (i) If one or more weekly newspapers of general circulation are 
published in the community in which the station is located or proposed 
to be located, notice shall be given in such a weekly newspaper once a 
week for 3 consecutive weeks within the 4-week period immediately 
following the release of the FCC's order, specifying the time and place 
of the commencement of the hearing;
    (ii) If no weekly newspaper of general circulation is published in 
the community in which the station is located or proposed to be located, 
notice shall be given at least twice a week for 2 consecutive weeks 
within the 3-week period immediately following the release of the FCC's 
orders, specifying the time and place of the commencement of the hearing 
in the daily newspaper having the greatest general circulation in the 
community in which the station is located or proposed to be located.
    (2) In the case of an application for a permit pursuant to Section 
325(c) of the Communications Act, the notice shall be given at least 
twice a week for 2 consecutive weeks within the 3-week period 
immediately following release of the FCC's order, specifying the time

general circulation in the largest city in the

[[Page 354]]

principal area to be served in the United States by the foreign radio 
broadcast station.
    (3) In the case of an application for change in the location of a 
station, the notice shall be given both in the community in which the 
station is located and in the community in which the station is proposed 
to be located.
    (b) When an application which is subject to the provisions of 
Sec. 73.3580 and which seeks modification, assignment, transfer, or 
renewal of an operating broadcast station is designated for hearing 
(except for applications for an International broadcast, low power TV, 
TV translator, FM translator, or FM booster stations), the applicant 
shall, in addition to giving notice of such designation as provided in 
paragraph (a) of this section, cause the same notice to be broadcast 
over that station at least once daily for 4 days in the second week 
immediately following the release of the FCC's order, specifying the 
time and place of the commencement of the hearing. In the case of both 
commercial and noncommercial TV broadcast stations such notice shall be 
broadcast orally with the camera focused on the announcer. The notice 
required by this paragraph shall be broadcast during the following 
periods:
    (1) For commercial TV stations, between 7:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m.
    (2) For commercial AM and FM stations, between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00

    (3) For noncommercial educational TV stations, between 7:00 p.m. and 
10:00 p.m., but if the period of broadcast of notice falls within a

such stations need not comply with the provisions of this paragraph.
    (4) For noncommercial educational AM and FM stations, between 3:00 
p.m. and 10:00 p.m., but if the period of broadcast of notice falls 
within a portion of the year during which such stations do not

this paragraph.
    (c) If the station in question is the only operating station in its 
broadcast service which is located in the community involved, or if it 
is a noncommerical educational station, publication of the notice in a 
newspaper, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, is not 
required, and publication by broadcast over that station as provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section shall be deemed sufficient to meet the 
requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. However, 
noncommercial educational stations which do not broadcast during the 
portion of the year in which the period of broadcast of notice falls 
must comply with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) The notice required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section 
shall state:
    (1) The name of the applicant or applicants designated for hearing.

the Federal Communications Commission on (date). After considering this 
application, the FCC has determined that it is necessary to hold a 
hearing to decide the following questions:

    (2) Immediately following the listing of the issues in the hearing:

    The hearing will be held at (place of hearing) commencing at (time),

    (Here the applicant shall insert, as the date on or before which 
members of the public who desire to give evidence should write to the 
FCC, the date 30 days after the date of release of the FCC's order 
specifying the time and place of the commencement of the hearing.)

    (f) When an application for a low power TV, TV translator, FM

Sec. 73.3580 is designated for hearing, the applicant shall give notice 
of such designation as follows: Notice shall be given at least once 
during the 2-week period immediately following release of the FCC's 
order, specifying the time and place of the commencement of the hearing 
in a daily, weekly or biweekly publication having general circulation in 
the community or area to be served. However, if there is no publication 
of general circulation in the community or area to be served, the 
applicant shall determine an appropriate means of providing the required 
notice to the general public, such as posting in the local post office 
or other public place. The notice shall state:
    (1) The name of the applicant or applicants designated for hearing.
    (2) The call letters, if any, of the station or stations involved, 
the output channel or channels of such stations, and, for any 
rebroadcasting, the call letters, channel and location of the station or

finding that applicant has complied (or proposes to comply) with the 
provisions of Section 311(a)(2) of the Communications Act, and that the 
public interest, convenience and necessity will be served thereby, the 
presiding officer may authorize an applicant, upon a showing of special 
circumstances, to publish notice in a manner other than that prescribed

Sec. 73.3597  Procedures on transfer and assignment applications.

    (a) If, upon the examination of an application for FCC consent to an 
assignment of a broadcast construction permit or license or for a 
transfer of control of a corporate permittee or licensee, it appears 
that the station involved has been operated on-air by the current 
licensee or permittee for less than one year, the application will be 
designated for hearing on appropriate issues unless the FCC is able to 
find that:
    (1) The permit or license was not authorized either through the 
Minority Ownership Policy or after a comparative hearing or, in the case 
of low power TV and TV translator stations, the permit or license was 
not authorized after a lottery in which the permittee or licensee 
benefited from minority or diversity preferences;

[[Page 356]]

    (2) The application involves an FM translator station or FM booster 
station only;
    (3) The application involves a pro forma assignment or transfer of 
control; or
    (4) The assignor or transferor has made an affirmative factual 
showing, supported by affidavits of a person or persons with personal 
knowledge thereof, which establishes that, due to unavailability of 
capital, to death or disability of station principals, or to other 
changed circumstances affecting the licensee or permittee occurring 
subsequent to the acquisition of the license or permit, FCC consent to 
the proposed assignment or transfer of control will serve the public 
interest, convenience and necessity.
    (5) the assignee or transferee has made an affirmative factual 
showing, supported by affidavits of a person or persons with personal 
knowledge thereof, which established that the proposed transaction would 
involve an assignment or transfer to a minority-owned or minority 
controlled entity in furtherance of our Minority Ownership Policy.
    (b)(1) The commencement date of the one-year period set forth in 
paragraph (a) of this section shall be the date on which the station 
initiated program tests in accordance with Sec. 73.1620 or Sec. 74.14.
    (2) In determining whether the station has been operating on-air for 
one year, the FCC will calculate the period between the date of 
initiation of program tests (as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section) and the date the application for transfer or assignment is 
tendered for filing with the FCC.
    (c)(1) As used in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section:
    (i) Unbuilt station refers to an AM, FM, or TV broadcast station or 
a low power TV or TV translator station for which a construction permit 
is outstanding, and, regardless of the stage of physical completion, as 
to which program tests have not commenced or, if required, been 
authorized.
    (ii) Seller includes the assignor(s) of a construction permit for an 
unbuilt station, the transferor(s) of control of the holder of such 
construction permit, and any principal or such assignor(s) or 
transferor(s) who retains an interest in the permittee or acquires or 
reacquires such interest within 1 year after commencing program tests.
    (2) The FCC will not consent to the assignment or transfer of 
control of the construction permit of an unbuilt station if the 
agreements or understandings between the parties provide for, or permit, 
payment to the seller of a sum in excess of the aggregate amount clearly 
shown to have been legitimately and prudently expended and to be 
expended by the seller, solely for preparing, filing, and advocating the 
grant of the construction permit for the station, and for other steps 
reasonably necessary toward placing the station in operation.
    (3)(i) Applications for consent to the assignment of a construction 
permit or transfer of control shall, in the case of unbuilt stations, be 
accompanied by declarations both by the assignor (or transferor) and by 
the assignee (or transferee) that, except as clearly disclosed in detail 
in the applications, there are no agreements or understandings for 
reimbursement of the seller's expenses or other payments to the seller, 
for the seller's retention of any interest in the station, for options 
or any other means by which the seller may acquire such an interest, or 
for any other actual or potential benefit to the seller in the form of 
loans, the subsequent repurchase of the seller's retained interest, or 
otherwise.
    (ii) When the seller is to receive reimbursement of his expenses, 
the applications of the parties shall include an itemized accounting of 
such expenses, together with such factual information as the parties 
rely upon for the requisite showing that those expenses represent 
legitimate and prudent outlays made solely for the purposes allowable 
under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (d)(1) Whenever an agreement for the assignment of the construction 
permit of an unbuilt station or for the transfer of control of the 
permittee of an unbuilt station, or any arrangement or understanding 
incidental thereto, provides for the retention by the seller of any 
interest in the station, or for any other actual or potential benefit to 
the seller in the form of loans or otherwise, the question is raised as 
to whether the

[[Page 357]]

transaction involves actual or potential gain to the seller over and 
above the legitimate and prudent out-of-pocket expenses allowable under 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section. In such cases the FCC will designate 
the assignment or transfer applications for evidentiary hearing. 
However, a hearing is not mandatory in cases coming within paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section.
    (2) It is not intended to forbid the seller to retain an equity 
interest in an unbuilt station which he is transferring or assigning if 
the seller obligates himself, for the period ending 1 year after 
commencing program tests, to provide that part of the total capital made 
available to the station, up to the end of that period, which is 
proportionate to the seller's equity share in the permittee, taking into 
account equity capital, loan capital, and guarantees of interest and 
amortization payments for loan capital provided by the seller before the 
transfer or assignment. This condition will be satisfied:
    (i) In the case of equity capital: By paid-in cash capital 
contributions proportionate to the seller's equity share;
    (ii) In cases where any person who has an equity interest in the 
permittee provides loan capital: By the seller's provision of that part 
of the total loan capital provided by equity holders which is 
proportionate to the seller's equity share; and
    (iii) In cases where any person cosigns or otherwise guarantees 
payments under notes given for loan capital provided by nonequity 
holders: By similar guarantees by the seller covering that part of such 
payments as is proportionate to the seller's equity share. However, this 
condition shall not be deemed to be met if the guarantees given by 
persons other than the seller cover, individually or collectively, a 
larger portion of such payments than the ratio of the combined equities 
of persons other than the seller to the total equity.
    (3) In cases which are subject to the requirements of paragraphs 
(d)(2) (i), (ii) and (iii) of this section:
    (i) The assignee's (or transferee's) application shall include a 
showing of the anticipated capital needs of the station through the 
first year of its operation and the seller's financial capacity to 
comply with the above requirements, in the light of such anticipated 
capital needs.
    (ii) The FCC will determine from its review of the applications 
whether a hearing is necessary to ensure compliance with the above 
requirements.
    (iii) Compliance with the above requirements will be subject to 
review by the FCC at any time, either when considering subsequently 
filed applications or whenever the FCC may otherwise find it desirable.
    (iv) Within 30 days after any time when a seller is required to 
provide equity or loan capital or execute guarantees, the permittee 
shall furnish the FCC a written report containing sufficient details as 
to the sources and amounts of equity capital paid in, loan capital made 
available, or guarantees obtained as to enable the FCC to ascertain 
compliance with the above requirements.
    (v) No steps shall be taken by the permittee to effectuate 
arrangements for the provision of equity or loan capital from sources 
not previously identified and disclosed to the FCC, until 30 days after 
the permittee has filed with the FCC a report of such arrangements and 
of provisions made for the seller's compliance with the above 
requirement.
    (vi) The provisions of paragraphs (d)(3) (iv) and (v) of this 
section shall cease to apply 1 year after commencing program tests.
    (4) Applications subject to this paragraph (d) of this section will, 
in any event, be designated for evidentiary hearing in any case where 
the agreements, arrangements or understandings with the seller provide 
for the seller's option to acquire equity in the station or to increase 
equity interests he retains at the time of the assignment or transfer of 
control. An evidentiary hearing will similarly be held in any case in 
which the assignee(s), transferee(s) or any of their principals, or any 
person in privity therewith, has an option to purchase all or part of 
the

[[Page 358]]

seller's retained or subsequently acquired equity interests in the 
station.

notwithstanding the waivers, the presentation of oral testimony is 
necessary, the parties will be so notified and the case will be retained 
on the hearing docket. If the FCC concludes that the case can 
appropriately be decided without the presentation of oral testimony, the 
record will be considered as closed as of the date the waivers of all

decision. Such information shall be served upon all parties. The waiver 
previously executed by the parties shall be considered in effect unless 
within 10 days of the service of such information the waiver is 
withdrawn.
    (c) Any decision by the FCC rendered pursuant to this section will 
be in the nature of a final decision, unless otherwise ordered by the 
FCC.
    (d) By agreeing to the waiver procedure prescribed in this section, 
no party shall be deemed to waive the right to petition for 
reconsideration or rehearing, or to appeal to the courts from any 
adverse final decision of the FCC.

removed by an agreement for an engineering amendment to an application, 
the amended application shall be removed from hearing status upon final 
approval of the agreement and acceptance of the amendment.

licensees in 10 or more states; and/or any person, entity, or 
corporation controlling, controlled by, or under common control with

    (2) Each such filing on or after May 1, 1969, initially shall 
consist of a written instrument containing all of the terms and 
conditions of such contract, agreement or understanding without 
reference to any other paper or document by incorporation or otherwise. 
Subsequent filings may simply set forth renewal, amendment or change, as

    (b) Ownership or control: Contracts, instruments or documents 
relating to the present or future ownership or control of the licensee

agreements, options to purchase stock and other executory agreements are 
required to be filed. However, trust agreements or abstracts thereof are 
not required to be filed, unless requested specifically by the FCC. 
Should the FCC request an abstract of the trust agreement in lieu of the 
trust agreement, the licensee or permittee will submit the following 
information concerning the trust:
    (A) Name of trust;
    (B) Duration of trust;
    (C) Number of shares of stock owned;
    (D) Name of beneficial owner of stock;

received, and the percentage of outstanding stock represented by each 
proxy shall be submitted by the licensee or permittee within 30 days 
after the stockholders' meeting in which the stock covered by such 
proxies has been voted. However, when the licensee or permittee is a 
corporation having more than 50 stockholders, such complete information 
need be filed only with respect to proxies given by stockholders who are 
officers or directors, or who have 1% or more of the corporation's 
voting stock. When the licensee or permittee is a corporation having 
more than 50 stockholders and the stockholders giving the proxies are 
not officers or directors or do not hold 1% or more of the corporation's 
stock, the only information required to be filed is the name of any 
person voting 1% or more of the stock by proxy, the number of shares 
voted by proxy by such person, and the total number of shares voted at 
the particular stockholders' meeting in which the shares were voted by 
proxy.

be filed: Agreements with persons regularly employed as general or 
station managers or salesmen; contracts with program managers or program 
personnel; contracts with attorneys, accountants or consulting radio 
engineers; contracts with performers; contracts with station 
representatives; contracts with labor unions; or any similar agreements.
    (d) Time brokerage agreements: Time brokerage agreements involving

control) is the brokering entity, there is a principal community contour 
(predicted or measured 5 mV/m groundwave for AM stations and predicted 
3.16 mV/m for FM stations) overlap with the brokered station, and more 
than 15 percent of the time of the brokered station, on a weekly basis, 
is brokered by that licensee. Confidential or proprietary information 
may be redacted where appropriate but such information shall be made

composed entirely of natural persons, each licensee of a commercial AM, 
FM, or TV broadcast station shall file an Ownership Report on FCC Form 
323 once a year, on the anniversary of the date that its renewal 
application is required to be filed. Licensees owning multiple stations 
with different anniversary dates need file only one Report per year on 
the anniversary of their choice, provided that their Reports are not

Report and that it is accurate, in lieu of filing a new Report. 
Ownership Reports shall provide the following information as of a date 
not more than 60 days prior to the filing of the Report:
    (1) In the case of an individual, the name of such individual;
    (2) In the case of a partnership, the name of each partner and the 
interest of each partner. Except as specifically noted below, the names 
of limited partners shall be reported. A limited partner need not be 
reported, regardless of the extent of its ownership, if the

[[Page 362]]

limted partner is not materially involved, directly or indirectly, in 
the management or operation of the licensee and the licensee so 
certifies.
    (i) Any change in partners or in their rights will require prior 
consent of the FCC upon an application for consent to assignment of 
license or permit. If such change involves less than a controlling 
interest, the application for FCC consent to such changes may be made 
upon FCC Form 316.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (3) In the case of a corporation, association, trust, estate or 
receivership, the data applicable to each:
    (i)(A) The name, residence, citizenship, and stockholding of every 
officer, director, trustee, executor, administrator, receiver and member 
of an association, and any stockholder which holds stock accounting for 
5 percent or more of the votes of the corporation, except that an 
investment company, insurance company, or bank trust department need be 
reported only if it holds stock amounting to 10 percent or more of the 
votes, provided that the licensee certifies that such entity has made no 
attempt to influence, directly or indirectly, the management or 
operation of the licensee, and that there is no representation on the 
licensee's board or among its officers by any person professionally or 
otherwise associated with the entity.
    (B) A licensee shall report any separate interests known to the 
licensee to be held ultimately by the same individual or entity, whether 
those interests are held in custodial accounts, by individual holding 
corporations or otherwise, if, when aggregated:
    (1) The sum of all interests except those held by or through 
``passive investors'' is equal to or exceeds 5 percent; or
    (2) The sum of all interests held by or through ``passive 
investors'' is equal to or exceeds 10 percent; or
    (3) The sum of the interests computed under paragraph 
(a)(3)(i)(B)(1) of this section plus the sum of the interests computed 
under paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B)(2) of this section is equal to or exceeds 
10 percent.
    (C) If the majority of the voting stock of a corporate licensee is 
held by a single individual or entity, no other stockholding need be 
reported for that licensee;
    (ii) Full information as to family relationship or business 
association between two or more officials and/or stockholders, trustees, 
executors, administrators, receivers, and members of any association;
    (iii) Capitalization with a description of the classes and voting 
power of stock authorized by the corporate charter or other appropriate 
legal instrument and the number of shares of each class issued and 
outstanding; and
    (iv) Full information with respect to the interest and identity of 
any person having any direct, indirect, fiduciary, or beneficial 
interest in the licensee or in its stock accounting for 5% or more of 
its votes. For example:
    (A) Where A is the trustee of stock held for beneficiary B, A shall 
be reported if A votes the stock or has the sole or shared power to 
dispose of the stock; B or any other party shall be reported if B or 
such party votes the stock or has sole power to dispose of the stock or 
has the power to revoke the trust or replace the trustee at will;
    (B) Where X is not a natural person and has attributable ownership 
interest in the licensee under Sec. 73.3555 of the rules, regardless of 
its position in the vertical ownership chain, an Ownership Report shall 
be filed for X which, except as specifically noted below, must contain 
the same information as required of a licensee. If X has a voting 
stockholder interest in the licensee, only those voting interests of X 
that are cognizable after application of the ``multiplier'' described in 
Note 2(d) of Sec. 73.3555 of the rules, if applicable, shall be 
reported. If X is a corporation, whether or not its interest in the 
licensee is by virtue of its ownership of voting stock, the officers and 
directors shall be reported. With respect to those officers and 
directors whose duties and responsibilities are wholly unrelated to the 
licensee, and who wish to be relieved of attribution in the licensee, 
the name, title and duties of these officers and directors, with 
statements properly documenting that their duties do not involve the 
licensee, shall be reported.
    (4) In the case of all licensees:

[[Page 363]]

    (i) A list of all contracts still in effect required to be filed 
with the FCC by Sec. 73.3613 showing the date of execution and 
expiration of each contract; and
    (ii) Any interest which the licensee may have in any other broadcast 
station.
    (b) Except as specifically noted below, each permittee of a 
commercial AM, FM or TV broadcast station shall file an Ownership Report 
on FCC Form 323 (1) within 30 days of the date of grant by the FCC of an 
application for original construction permit and (2) on the date that it 
applies for a station license. The Ownership Report of the permittee 
shall give the information required by the applicable portions of 
paragraph (a) of this section. A permittee with a current and unamended 
Report on file at the Commission may certify that it has reviewed its 
current Report and it is accurate, in lieu of filing a new Report.
    (c) Before any change is made in the organization, capitalization, 
officers, directors, or stockholders of a corporation other than 
licensee or permittee, which results in a change in the control of the 
licensee or permittee, prior FCC consent must be received under 
Sec. 73.3540. A transfer of control takes place when an individual or 
group in privity, gains or loses affirmative or negative (50%) control. 
See instructions on FCC Form 323 (Ownership Report).
    (d) Each licensee of a noncommercial educational AM, FM or TV 
broadcast station shall file an Ownership Report on FCC Form 323-E at 
the time the application for renewal of station license is required to 
be filed. Licensees owning more than one noncommercial educational AM, 
FM or TV broadcast station need file only one Ownership Report at 5 year 
intervals for TV stations and 7 year intervals for AM and FM stations. 
Ownership Reports shall give the following information as of a date not 
more than 30 days prior to the filing of the Ownership Report:
    (1) The following information as to all officers, members of 
governing board, and holders of 1% or more ownership interest (if any): 
Name, residence, office held, citizenship, principal profession or 
occupation, and by whom appointed or elected.
    (2) Full information with respect to the interest and identity of 
any individual, organization, corporation, association, or any other 
entity which has direct or indirect control over the licensee or 
permittee.
    (3) A list of all contracts still in effect required by Sec. 73.3613 
to be filed with the FCC, showing the date of execution and expiration 
of each contract.
    (4) Any interest which the licensee or permittee or any of its 
officers, members of the governing board, and holders of 1% or more 
ownership interest (if any) held in any other broadcast station.
    (e) Each permittee of a noncommercial educational AM, FM or TV 
broadcast station shall file an Ownership Report on FCC Form 323-E 
within 30 days of the date of grant by the FCC of an application for 
original construction permit. The Ownership Report of the permittee 
shall give the information required by the applicable form.
    (f) A supplemental Ownership Report on FCC Form 323-E shall be filed 
by each licensee or permittee within 30 days after any change occurs in 
the information required by the Ownership Report from that previously 
reported. Such report should include, without limitation:
    (1) Any change in organization;
    (2) Any change in officers or directors;
    (3) Any transaction affecting the ownership (direct or indirect) or 
voting rights with respect to the licensee or permittee (or with respect 
to any stock interest therein).
    (g) A copy of all ownership and supplemental ownership reports and 
related material filed pursuant to this section shall be maintained and 
made available for public inspection locally as required by 
Secs. 73.3526 and 73.3527.

Sec. 74.21  Broadcasting emergency information.

    (a) In an emergency where normal communication facilities have been 
disrupted or destroyed by storms, floods or other disasters, the 
stations licensed under this part may be operated for the purpose of 
transmitting essential communications intended to alleviate distress, 
dispatch aid, assist in rescue operations, maintain order, or otherwise 
promote the safety of life and property. In the course of such 
operation, a station of any class may communicate with stations of other 
classes and in other services. However, such operation shall be 
conducted only on the frequency or frequencies for which the station is 
licensed and the used power shall not exceed the maximum authorized in 
the station license. When such operation involves the use of frequencies 
shared with other stations, licensees are expected to cooperate fully to 
avoid unnecessary or disruptive interference.
    (b) Whenever such operation involves communications of a nature 
other than those for which the station is licensed to perform, the 
licensee shall, at the earliest practicable time, notify the FCC in 
Washington, DC of the nature of the emergency and the use to which the 
station is being put and shall subsequently notify the same offices when 
the emergency operation has been terminated.
    (c) Emergency operation undertaken pursuant to the provisions of 
this section shall be discontinued as soon as substantially normal 
communications facilities have been restored. The Commission may at any 
time order discontinuance of such operation.

Sec. 74.23  Interference jeopardizing safety of life or protection of property.

    (a) The licensee of any station authorized under this part that 
causes harmful interference, as defined in Sec. 2.1 of the Commission's 
rules, to radio communications involving the safety of life or 
protection of property shall promptly eliminate the interference.
    (b) If harmful interference to radio communications involving the 
safety of life or protection of property cannot be promptly eliminated 
and the Commission finds that there exists an imminent danger to safety 
of life or protection of property, pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 312 (b) and (e) 
and 5 U.S.C. 558, operation of the offending equipment shall temporarily 
be suspended and shall not be resumed until the harmful interference has 
been eliminated or the threat to the safety of life or property has 
passed. In situations where the protection of property alone is 
jeopardized, before taking any action under this paragraph, the 
Commission shall balance the nature and extent of the possible property 
damage against the potential harm to a licensee or the public caused by 
suspending part 74 operations. When specifically authorized, short test 
operations may be made during the period of suspended operation to check 
the efficacy of remedial measures.

Sec. 74.24  Short-term operation.

    The classes of broadcast auxiliary stations provided for in subparts 
D, E, F and H of this part may be operated on a short-term basis under 
the authority conveyed by a part 73 license without prior authorization 
from the FCC, subject to the following conditions:
    (a) The part 73 licensee of this chapter must be eligible to operate 
the particular class of broadcast auxiliary station.
    (b) The short-term broadcast auxiliary station shall be operated in 
conformance with all normally applicable regulations to the extent they 
are not superceded by specific provisions of this section.
    (c) Short-term operation is on a secondary, non-interference basis 
to regularly authorized stations and shall be discontinued immediately 
upon notification that perceptible interference is being caused to the 
operation of a regularly authorized station. Short-term station 
operators shall, to the extent practicable, use only the effective 
radiated power and antenna height necessary for satisfactory system 
performance.
    (d) Short-term operation by a part 73 licensee shall not exceed 720 
hours annually per frequency.


    Note: Certain frequencies shared with other services which are 
normally available for permanent broadcast auxiliary station assignment 
may not be available for short-term operation. Refer to any note(s) 
which may be applicable to the use of a specific frequency prior to 
initiating operation.

    (e) The antenna height of a station operated pursuant to this 
section shall not increase the height of any man-made antenna supporting 
structure, or increase by more than 6.1 meters (20 feet) the height of 
any other type of man-made structure or natural formation. However, the 
facilities of an authorized broadcast auxiliary station belonging to 
another licensee may be operated in accordance with the terms of its 
outstanding authorization.
    (f) Stations operated pursuant to this section shall be identified 
by the transmission of the call sign of the associated broadcast 
station.
    (g) The part 73 licensee of this chapter, prior to operating 
pursuant to the provisions of this section shall, for the intended 
location or area-of-operation,

[[Page 385]]

notify the appropriate frequency coordination committee or any 
licensee(s) assigned the use of the proposed operating frequency, 
concerning the particulars of the intended operation and shall provide 
the name and telephone number of a person who may be contacted in the 
event of interference. Information on active frequency coordination 
committees may be obtained by contacting the FCC's Auxiliary Services 
Branch at (202) 634-6307 between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. 
Except as provided below, this notification provision shall not apply 
where an unanticipated need for immediate short-term mobile station 
operation would render compliance with the provisions of this paragraph 
impractical.
    (1) A CARS licensee shall always be given advance notification prior 
to the commencement of short-term operation on or adjacent to an 
assigned frequency.
    (h) Short-term operation is limited to areas south or west of the 
United States-Canada border as follows:
    (1) Use of broadcast auxiliary service frequencies below 470 MHz is 
limited to areas of the United States south of Line A or west of Line C 
unless the effective radiated power of the station is 5 watts or less.

    Note: Line A is a line above which frequency assignments made by the 
Federal Communications Commission are coordinated with the Canadian 
Department of Communications and which begins at Aberdeen, Washington, 
running by great circle arc to the intersection of 48 deg. N., 120 deg. 
W., then along parallel 48 deg. N., to the intersection of 95 deg. W., 
then by great circle arc through the southernmost point of Duluth, 
Minnesota, then by great circle arc to 45 deg. N., 85 deg. W., then 
southward along meridian 85 deg. W., to its intersection with parallel 
41 deg. N., then along parallel 41 deg. N., to its intersection with 
meridian 82 deg. W., then by great circle arc through the southernmost 
point of Bangor, Maine, then by great circle arc through the 
southernmost point of Searsport, Maine, at which point it terminates. 
Line C is a line east of which frequency assignments are similarly 
coordinated and which begins at the intersection of 70 deg. N., 144 deg. 
W., then by great circle arc to the intersection of 60 deg. N., 143 deg. 
W., then by great circle arc so as to include all of the Alaskan 
Panhandle.

    (2) A broadcast auxiliary service station operating on frequencies 
between 470 MHz and 1 GHz must be at least 56.3 kilometers (35 miles) 
south (or west, as appropriate of the United States-Canada border if the 
antenna looks within a 200 deg. sector toward the border; or, the 
station must be at least 8.1 kilometers (5 miles) south (or west, as 
appropriate) if the antenna looks within a 160 deg. sector away from the 
border. However, operation is not permitted in either of these two 
situations if the station would be within the coordination distance of a 
receiving earth station in Canada which uses the same frequency band. 
(The coordination distance is the distance, calculated for any station, 
according to Appendix 28 of the International Radio Regulations.)
    (3) A broadcast auxiliary service station operating on frequencies 
above 1 GHz shall not be located within the coordination distance of a 
receiving earth station in Canada which uses the same frequency band. 
(The coordination distance is the distance, calculated for any station, 
according to Appendix 28 of the international Radio Regulations.)
    (i) Short-term operation of a remote pickup broadcast base station, 
a remote pickup automatic relay station, an aural broadcast STL station, 
an aural broadcast intercity relay station, a TV STL station, a TV 
intercity relay station or a TV translator relay station in the National 
Radio Quiet Zone, the Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone, or near FCC 
monitoring stations is subject to the same advance notification 
procedures applicable to regular applications as provided for in 
Secs. 73.1030 and 74.12, except that inasmuch as short-term operation 
does not involve an application process, the provisions relating to 
agency objection procedures shall not apply. It shall simply be 
necessary for the part 73 licensee of this chapter to contact the 
potentially affected agency and obtain advance approval for the proposed 
short-term operation. Where protection to FCC monitoring stations is 
concerned, approval for short-term operation may be given by the local 
Engineer-in-Charge.

established stations shall be selected.
    (d) In a case of important experimentation which cannot be feasibly 
conducted on frequencies allocated to broadcasting or the various 
categories of auxiliary stations, the FCC may authorize an experimental 
station of any class to operate on other frequencies upon a satisfactory 
showing of the need therefore and a showing that the proposed operation 
can be conducted without causing harmful interference to established 
services. However, experimental operation which looks toward the 
development of radio transmitting apparatus or the rendition of any type 
of regular service using such frequencies will not be authorized prior 
to a determination by the FCC that the development of such apparatus or 
the rendition of such service would serve the public interest.

Sec. 74.432  Licensing requirements and procedures.

    (a) A license for a remote pickup station will be issued to: the 
licensee of an AM, FM, noncommercial FM, TV, international broadcast or 
low power TV station; broadcast network-entity; or cable network-entity.
    (b) Base stations may operate as automatic relay stations on the 
frequencies listed in Sec. 74.402(a) (6) and (8) under the provisions of 
Sec. 74.436, however, one licensee may not operate such stations on more 
than two frequencies in a single area.
    (c) Base stations may use voice communications between the studio 
and transmitter or points of any intercity relay system on frequencies 
in Groups I and J.
    (d) Base stations may be authorized to establish standby circuits 
from places where official broadcasts may be made during times of 
emergency and circuits to interconnect an emergency survival 
communications system.
    (e) In Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, 
base stations may provide program circuits between the studio and 
transmitter or to relay programs between broadcasting stations. A base 
station may be operated unattended in accordance with the following:
    (1) The station must be designed, installed, and protected so that 
the transmitter can only be activated or controlled by persons 
authorized by the licensee.
    (2) The station must be equipped with circuits to prevent 
transmitter operation when no signal is received from the station which 
it is relaying.
    (f) Remote pickup stations may use only those frequencies and 
bandwidths which are necessary for operation.
    (g) An application for a remote pickup broadcast station or system 
shall specify the broadcasting station or stations (where more than one 
broadcasting station is specified, all such broadcasting stations shall 
be licensed to the applicant and to the same community) with which the 
remote pickup broadcast facility is to be principally used

[[Page 396]]

and the licensed area of operation for a system which includes mobile 
stations shall be the area considered to be served by the associated 
broadcasting station or stations. Mobile stations may be operated 
outside the licensed area of operation pursuant to Sec. 74.431(d). Where 
the applicant for remote pickup broadcast facilities is the licensee of 
more than one class of broadcasting station (AM, FM, TV), all licensed 
to the same community, designation of one or more such stations as the 
associated broadcasting station or stations will not preclude use of the 
remote pickup broadcast facilities with those broadcasting stations not 
included in the designation and such additional use shall be at the 
discretion of the licensee.
    (h) In cases where a series of broadcasts are to be made from the 
same location, portable or mobile transmitters may be left at such 
location for the duration of the series of broadcasts: Provided, The 
transmitting apparatus is properly secured so that it may not be 
operated by unauthorized persons when unattended. Prior Commission 
authority shall be obtained for the installation of any transmitting 
antenna which requires notification to the FAA, pursuant to Sec. 17.7 of 
the Commission's rules and regulations, and which will be in existence 
for more than 2 days.
    (i) The location of each remote pickup broadcast base station will 
be specified in the station or system license and such stations may not 
be operated at any other location without prior authority of the 
Commission.
    (j) The license shall be retained in the licensee's files at the 
address shown on the authorization, posted at the transmitter, or posted 
at the control point of the station.
    (k) In the case of permanent discontinuance of operation of a 
station or system licensed under this subpart, the licensee shall 
forward the station or system license to the FCC at Federal 
Communications Commission, 1270 Fairfield Road, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania 
17325 for cancellation. For purposes of this section, a station which is 
not operated for a period of one year is considered to have been 
permanently discontinued.

    Note: Licensees of remote pickup broadcast stations licensed prior 
to August 31, 1976, should not file applications to consolidate 
individually licensed transmitters under a single system license until 
the renewal application of the associated broadcast station is filed. 
Applications filed between August 31, 1976, and the date of filing of 
the renewal applications to obtain authorization to use additional 
transmitters or modification of existing stations shall be restricted to 
a single system application necessary to accomplish the desired change, 
but may include consolidation of previously-licensed transmitters within 
the system license. Applications submitted for system licensing prior to 
the time when renewal applications would normally be filed which are 
unnecessary for either administrative or operational purposes will be 
returned as unacceptable for filing.

Sec. 74.482  Station identification.

    (a) Each remote pickup broadcast station shall be identified by the 
transmission of the assigned station or system call sign, or by the call 
sign of the associated broadcast station. For systems, the licensee 
(including a part 73-only licensee where operation takes place pursuant 
to Sec. 74.24) shall assign a unit designator to each station in the 
system. The call sign (and unit designator, where appropriate) shall be 
transmitted at the beginning and end of each period of operation. A 
period of operation may consist of a single continuous transmission, or 
a series of intermittent transmissions pertaining to a single event.
    (b) In cases where a period of operation is of more than one hour 
duration identification of remote pickup broadcast stations 
participating in the

[[Page 401]]

operation shall be made at approximately one-hour intervals. 
Identification transmissions during operation need not be made when to 
make such transmissions would interrupt a single consecutive speech, 
play, religious service, symphony, concert, or any type of production. 
In such cases, the identification transmissions shall be made at the 
first interruption in the program continuity and at the conclusion 
thereof. Hourly identification may be accomplished either by 
transmission of the station or system call sign and unit designator 
assigned to the individual station or identification of an associated 
broadcasting station or network with which the remote pickup broadcast 
station is being used.
    (c) In cases where an automatic relay station is a part of the 
circuit, the call sign of the relay transmitter may be transmitted 
automatically by the relay transmitter or by the remote pickup broadcast 
base or mobile station that actuates the automatic relay station.
    (d) Automatically activated equipment may be used to transmit 
station identification in International Morse Code, provided that the 
modulation tone is 1200 Hz<plus-minus>800 Hz, the level of modulation of 
the identification signal is maintained at 40%<plus-minus>10%, and that 
the code transmission rate is maintained between 20 and 25 words per 
minute.
    (e) For stations using the F3Y emission, identification shall be 
transmitted in the unscrambled analog (F3) mode or in International 
Morse Code pursuant to the provisions of (d) of this section at 
intervals not to exceed 15 minutes. For purposes of rule enforcement, 
all licensees using F3Y emissions shall provide, upon request by the 
Commission, a full and complete description of the encoding methodology 
they currently use.

    Note: Stations are encouraged to identify using their associated 
part 73 station call sign.

Authorization (SCA). An aural broadcast STL or intercity relay station 
may not be operated solely for the transmission of operational, 
teleprinter or subsidiary communications. Operational communications 
include cues, orders, and other communications directly related to the 
operation of the broadcast station as well as special signals used for 
telemetry or the control of apparatus used in conjunction with the 
broadcasting operations.
    (g) All program material, including subsidiary communications, 
transmitted over an aural broadcast STL or intercity relay station shall 
be intended for use by broadcast stations owned or under common control 
of the licensee or licensees of the STL or intercity relay station. 
Other broadcast stations may simultaneously utilize such program 
material with permission of the STL or intercity relay station licensee.
    (h) In any case where multiplexing, is employed on an aural 
broadcast STL station for the simultaneous transmission of more than one 
aural channel, the STL transmitter must be capable of transmitting the 
multiple channels within the channel on which the STL station is 
authorized to operate and with adequate technical quality so that each 
broadcast station utilizing the circuit can meet the technical 
performance standards stipulated in the rules governing that class of 
broadcasting station. If multiplex operation is employed during the 
regular operation of the STL station, the additional circuits shall be 
in operation at the time that the required periodic performance 
measurements are made of the overall broadcasting system from the studio 
microphone input circuit to the broadcast transmitter output circuit.

Sec. 74.532  Licensing requirements.

    (a) An aural broadcast STL or an aural broadcast intercity relay 
station will be licensed only to the licensee or licensees of broadcast 
stations, other than international broadcast stations, and for use with 
broadcast stations owned entirely by or under common control of the 
licensee or licensees. An aural broadcast intercity relay station also 
will be licensed for use by noncommercial educational FM translator 
stations assigned to reserved channels (Channels 201-220) and owned and 
operated by their primary station, by FM translator stations operating 
within the coverage contour of their primary stations, and by FM booster 
stations.
    (b) More than one aural broadcast STL or intercity relay station may 
be licensed to a single licensee upon a satisfactory showing that the 
additional stations are needed to provide different program circuits to 
more than one broadcast station, to provide program circuits from other 
studios, or to provide one or more intermediate relay stations over a 
path which cannot be covered with a single station due to terrain or 
distance.
    (c) If more than one broadcast station or class of broadcast station 
is to be served by a single aural broadcast auxiliary station, this 
information must be stated in the application for construction permit or 
license.
    (d) Licensees of aural broadcast STL and intercity relay stations 
may be authorized to operate one or more aural broadcast microwave 
booster stations for the purpose of relaying signals over a path that 
cannot be covered with a single station.

    Note: Applications for aural broadcast microwave booster stations 
will not be accepted for filing prior to January 1, 1985.

    (e) Each aural broadcast auxiliary station will be licensed at a 
specified transmitter location to communicate with a specified receiving 
location, and the direction of the main radiation lobe of the 
transmitting antenna will be a term of the station authorization.
    (f) In case of permanent discontinuance of operation of a station 
licensed under this subpart, the licensee shall forward the station 
license to the Federal Communications Commission,

Sec. 74.535  Emission and bandwidth.

    (a) For frequency modulation, the mean power of emissions shall be 
attenuated below the mean transmitter power (P) in accordance with the 
following schedule:
    (1) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more 
than 50% and up to 100% of the authorized bandwidth: at least 25 dB.
    (2) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more 
than 100% and up to 150% of the authorized bandwidth: at least 35 dB.
    (3) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more 
than 150% of the authorized bandwidth: at least 43 + 10 Log(P) dB.
    (b) For all emissions except frequency modulation, the peak power of 
emissions shall be attenuated below the peak envelope transmitter power 
(P) in accordance with the following schedule:
    (1) On any frequency 500 Hz inside the channel edge up to and 
including 2500 Hz outside the same edge, the following formula will 
apply:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC13NO91.023


or 50 dB whichever is the lesser attenuation. Where: D is the 
displacement frequency (kHz) from the center of the authorized 
bandwidth; and W is the channel bandwidth (kHz).
    (2) On any frequency removed from the channel edge by more than 2500 
Hz: At least 43+10 Log (P) dB.
    (c) In the event a station's emissions outside its authorized 
channel cause harmful interference, the Commission may require the 
licensee to take such further steps as may be necessary to eliminate the 
interference.
    (d) For operation in the 18 GHz band: Aural broadcast STL, intercity 
relay stations and booster stations may be authorized to employ either 
digital or frequency modulation.
    (e) For operation in the 18 GHz band: The mean power of emission 
shall be attenuated below the mean output power of the transmitter in 
accordance with the following schedule:
    (1) When using frequency modulation:
    (i) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more 
than 50 percent up to and including 100 percent of the authorized 
bandwidth: At least 25 decibels;
    (ii) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more 
than 100 percent up to and including 250 percent of the authorized 
bandwidth: At least 35 decibels;
    (iii) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more 
than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: At least 43+10 log!<INF>10</INF> 
(mean output power in watts) decibels, or 80 decibels, whichever is the 
lesser attenuation.
    (2) When using digital modulation:
    (i) In any 1 MHz band, the center frequency of which is removed from 
the assigned frequency by more than 50 percent up to and including 250 
percent of the authorized bandwidth: As specified by the following 
equation but in no event less than 11 decibels.

A = 11 + 0.4 (P-50) + 10 log<INF>10</INF> B

Where:
A = Attenuation (in decibels) below the mean output power level.
P = Percent removed from the carrier frequency.
B = Authorized bandwidth in MHz.

    [Attenuation greater than 56 decibels is not required.]
    (ii) In any 4 kHz band, the center frequency of which is removed 
from the assigned frequency by more than 250 percent of the authorized 
bandwidth: At least 43 + 10 log<INF>10</INF> (mean output power in 
watts) decibels, or 80 decibels, whichever is the lesser attenuation.
    (f) For operation in the 18 GHz band: When an emission outside of 
the authorized bandwidth causes harmful interference, the Commission 
may, at its discretion require greater attenuation than specified above.
    (g) The following limitations apply to the operation of aural 
broadcast microwave booster stations:

[[Page 407]]

    (1) The booster station must receive and amplify the signals of the 
originating station and retransmit them on the same frequency without 
significantly altering them in any way. The characteristics of the 
booster transmitter output signal shall meet the requirements applicable 
to the signal of the originating station.
    (2) The licensee is responsible for correcting any condition of 
interference that results from the radiation of radio frequency energy 
outside the assigned channel. Upon notice by the FCC to the station 
licensee that interference is being caused, operation of the apparatus 
must be immediately suspended and may not be resumed until the 
interference has been eliminated or it can be demonstrated that the 
interference is not due to spurious emissions. However, short term test 
transmissions may be made during the period of suspended operation to 
determine the efficacy of remedial measures.
    (3) In each instance where suspension of operation is required, the 
licensee must submit a full report to the FCC after operation is 
resumed. The report must contain details of the nature of the 
interference, the source of interfering signals, and the remedial steps 
taken to eliminate the interference.

Sec. 74.536  Directional antenna required.

    (a) Aural broadcast STL and ICR stations are required to use a 
directional antenna with the minimum beamwidth necessary, consistent 
with good engineering practice, to establish the link.
    (b) An aural broadcast STL or intercity relay station operating in 
the 17.7-19.7 GHz band shall employ an antenna that meets the 
performance standards for Category A, except that in areas not subject 
to frequency congestion, antennas meeting standards for Category B may 
be employed. However, the Commission may require the replacement, at the 
licensee's expense, of any antenna or periscope antenna system of a 
permanent fixed station that does not meet performance Standard A, which 
is specified in the table in paragraph (c) of this section, upon a 
showing that said antenna causes or is likely to cause interference to 
(or receive interference from) any other authorized or proposed station; 
provided that an antenna meeting performance Standard A is unlikely to 
involve such interference.
    (c) Licensees shall comply with the antenna standards table shown in 
this paragraph in the following manner:
    (1) With either the maximum beamwidth to 3 dB points requirement or 
with the minimum antenna gain requirement; and
    (2) With the minimum radiation suppression to angle requirement.

Sec. 74.537  Temporary authorizations.

    (a) Special temporary authority may be granted for aural broadcast 
STL or intercity relay station operation which cannot be conducted in 
accordance with Sec. 74.24. Such authority will normally be granted only 
for operations of a temporary nature. Where operation is seen as likely 
on a continuing annual basis, an application for a regular authorization 
should be submitted.
    (b) A request for special temporary authorization for the operation 
of an aural broadcast STL or intercity relay station may be made by 
informal application which shall be filed with the FCC at least 10 days 
prior to the date of the proposed operation. However, an application 
filed within less than 10 days of the proposed operation may be accepted 
upon a satisfactory showing of the reasons for the delay in submitting 
the request.
    (c) An informal request for special temporary authority requiring 
payment of a fee shall be addressed to the FCC at Federal Communications 
Commission, Broadcast Auxiliary Radio Services, P.O. Box 358700, 
Pittsburgh, PA 15251-5700. An informal request for special temporary 
authority not requiring payment of a fee shall be addressed to the FCC 
at Federal Communications Commission, Broadcast Auxiliary Radio 
Services, 1270 Fairfield Road, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania 17325. All 
requests must include full particulars including: licensee's name, call 
letters of the associated broadcast station(s), name and address of 
individual designated to receive the return authorization, call letters 
of the aural broadcast STL or intercity relay station, if assigned, type 
and manufacturer of equipment, power output, emission, frequency or 
frequencies proposed for use, commencement and termination date and 
location of the proposed operation, and purpose for which request is 
made including any particular justification.
    (d) A request for special temporary authorization shall specify a 
frequency or frequencies consistent with the provisions of Sec. 74.502. 
However, in the case of events of widespread interest and importance 
which cannot be transmitted successfully on these frequencies, 
frequencies assigned to other services may be requested upon a showing 
that operation thereon will not cause interference to established 
stations. In no case will operation of an aural broadcast STL or 
intercity relay station be authorized on frequencies employed for the 
safety of life or property.
    (e) When the transmitting equipment utilized is not licensed to the 
user, the user shall nevertheless have full control over the use of the 
equipment during the period it is operated.
    (f) Special temporary authorization to permit operation of aural 
broadcast STL or intercity relay stations or systems pending FCC action 
on an application for regular authority will normally not be granted.

Sec. 74.550  Equipment authorization.

    Each authorization for aural broadcast STL, ICR, and booster 
stations shall require the use of notified or type accepted equipment. 
Equipment which has not been type approved under the equipment 
authorization program and which was in service prior to July 1, 1993, 
may be retained solely for temporary uses necessary to restore or 
maintain regular service provided by approved equipment, because the 
main or primary unit has failed or requires servicing. Such temporary 
uses may not interfere with or impede the establishment of other aural 
broadcast auxiliary links and may not occur during more than 720 
cumulative hours per year. Should interference occur, the licensee must 
take all steps necessary to eliminate it, up to and including cessation 
of operation of the auxiliary transmitter. All unapproved equipment 
retained for temporary use must have been in the possession of the 
licensee prior to July 1, 1993, and may not be obtained from other 
sources. Requirements for obtaining a grant of equipment authorization 
are contained in subpart J of part 2 of the Rules. Equipment designed 
exclusively for fixed operation shall be authorized under notification 
procedures (see Sec. 2.904(d) of this chapter).

    Note: Consistent with the note to Sec. 74.502(a), grandfathered 
equipment in the 942-944 MHz band and STL/ICR users of these frequencies 
in Puerto Rico are also required

[[Page 409]]

to come into compliance by July 1, 1993. The backup provisions described 
above apply to these stations also.

services licensed as of July 25, 1985, or on a subsequent date following 
as a result of submitting an application for license on or before July 
25, 1985, may continue to operate on a primary basis to the 
radiodetermination satellite service.
    (b) Subject to the conditions of paragraph (a) of this section, 
frequency assignments will normally be made as requested, provided that 
the frequency selection provisions of Sec. 74.604 have been followed and 
that the frequency requested will cause no interference to existing 
users in the area. The Commission reserves the right to assign 
frequencies other than those requested if, in its opinion, such action 
is warranted.
    (c) Fixed link stations will be authorized to operate on one channel 
only.
    (d) Community antenna relay stations may be assigned channels in 
Band D between 12,700 and 13,200 MHz subject to the condition that no 
harmful interference is caused to TV STL and TV relay stations 
authorized at the time of such grants. Similarly, new TV STL and TV 
relay stations must not cause harmful interference to community antenna 
relay stations authorized at the time of such grants. The use of 
channels between 12,700 and 13,200 MHz by TV pickup stations is subject 
to the condition that no harmful interference is caused to community 
antenna relay, TV STL and TV relay stations, except as provided for in 
Sec. 74.602(a) Note 2. Band D channels are also shared with certain 
Private Operational Fixed Stations, see Sec. 74.638.
    (e) Communication common carriers in the Local Television 
Transmission Service (Part 21) may be assigned frequencies available to 
television broadcast station licensees and broadcast network entities 
for the purpose of providing service to television broadcast stations 
and broadcast network--entities, respectively.
    (f) TV auxiliary stations licensed to low power TV stations and 
translator relay stations will be assigned on a secondary basis, i.e., 
subject to the condition that no harmful interference is caused to other 
TV auxiliary stations assigned to TV broadcast stations, or to community 
antenna relay stations (CARS) operating between 12,700 and 13,200 MHz. 
Auxiliary stations licensed to low power TV stations and translator 
relay stations must accept any interference caused by stations having 
primary use of TV auxiliary frequencies.
    (g) The following frequencies are available for assignment to 
television STL, television relay stations and television translator 
relay stations. The provisions of Section 74.604 do not

apply to the use of these frequencies. These frequencies are shared on a 
co-equal basis with other stations in the fixed service (see Parts 21, 
78 and 94). Applicants may use either a two-way link or one or both 
frequencies of a frequency pair for a one-way link and shall coordinate 
proposed operations pursuant to procedures required in Sec. 21.100(d).

Sec. 74.603  Sound channels.

    (a) The frequencies listed in Sec. 74.602(a) may be used for the 
simultaneous transmission of the picture and sound portions of TV 
broadcast programs and for cue and order circuits, either by means of 
multiplexing or by the use of a separate transmitter within the same 
channel. When multiplexing of a TV STL station is contemplated, 
consideration should be given to the requirements of Sec. 73.687 of this 
Chapter regarding the overall system performance requirements. 
Applications for new TV pickup, TV STL, TV relay and TV translator relay 
stations shall clearly indicate the nature of any mutliplexing proposed. 
Multiplexing equipment may be installed on licensed equipment without 
authority of the FCC, provided the installation of such apparatus on a

[[Page 415]]

TV STL station shall not result in degradation of the overall system 
performance of the TV broadcast station below that permitted by 
Sec. 73.687 of this chapter.
    (b) The aural portion of television broadcast program material may 
be transmitted over an aural broadcast STL or intercity relay station 
licensed under the provisions of Subpart E of this part, but only on a 
secondary, non-interference basis to the programming of aural broadcast 
stations. A TV station licensee may continue such operation until the 
channel assigned to its Subpart E station is requested by an aural 
broadcast licensee after a showing that no other vacant channels are 
available or satisfactory. Upon Commission concurrence with the aural 
broadcast licensee request, the TV station licensee will be required to 
discontinue operation on the requested frequency. In areas where only a 
portion of the Subpart E frequencies used by TV station licensees are 
required by aural broadcast licensees, the Commission will assist all 
affected parties in arriving at an equitable solution. The provisions of 
this paragraph do not preclude continued use of Subpart E facilities for 
relay of TV sound where the facilities are authorized to an aural 
broadcast licensee and the primary purpose of the station is to relay 
aural broadcast programming.
    (c) Aural STL or intercity relay stations licensed as of July 10, 
1970, to operate in the frequency band 942-947 MHz, may continue to so 
operate pending a decision as to their disposition through a future rule 
making proceeding.
    (d) Remote pickup broadcast stations may be used in conjunction with 
television pickup stations for the transmission of the aural portion of 
television programs or events that occur outside a television studio and 
for the transmission of cues, orders, and other related communications 
necessary thereto. The rules governing remote pickup broadcast stations 
are contained in Subpart D of this part.

Sec. 74.604  Interference avoidance.

    (a) Because the Commission does not undertake frequency 
coordination, applicants for new TV broadcast auxiliary authorizations 
are responsible for selecting the frequency assignments that are least 
likely to result in mutual interference with other licensees in the same 
area. Applicants may consult local coordination committees, where they 
exist, for information on frequencies available in the area. In 
selecting frequencies, consideration should be given to the relative 
locations of receiving points, normal transmission paths, and the nature 
of the contemplated operation.
    (b) Where two or more licensees are assigned a common channel for TV 
pickup, TV STL, or TV relay purposes in the same area and simultaneous 
operation is contemplated, they shall take such steps as may be 
necessary to avoid mutual interference, including consultation with the 
local coordination committee, if one exists. If a mutual agreement to 
this effect cannot be reached, the Commission must be notified and it 
will take such action as may be necessary, including time sharing 
arrangements, to assure an equitable distribution of available 
frequencies.
    (c) For those interference disputes brought to the Commission for 
resolution, TV broadcast auxiliary channels will have the following 
priority for purposes of interference protection:
    (1) All fixed links for full service broadcast stations and cable 
systems.
    (2) TV and CARS pickup stations.
    (3) Fixed or mobile stations serving translator or low power TV 
stations.
    (4) Backup facilities; TV pickup stations used outside a licensee's 
local service area.
    (5) Any transmission, pursuant to Sec. 74.631(f), that does not 
involve the delivery of program material to a licensee's associated TV 
broadcast station.
    (d) Interference between two stations having the same priority shall 
be resolved in favor of the station licensed first on a particular path.

[48 FR 17091, Apr. 21, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 74.631  Permissible service.

    (a) The licensee of a television pickup station authorizes the 
transmission

[[Page 416]]

of program material, orders concerning such program material, and 
related communications necessary to the accomplishment of such 
transmissions, from the scenes of events occurring in places other than 
a television studio, to its associated television broadcast station, to 
such other stations as are broadcasting the same program material, or to 
the network or networks with which the television broadcast station is 
affiliated. Television pickup stations may be operated in conjunction 
with other television broadcast stations not aformentioned in this 
paragraph: Provided, That the transmissions by the television pickup 
station are under the control of the licensee of the television pickup 
station and that such operation shall not exceed a total of 10 days in 
any 30-day period. Television pickup stations may be used to provide 
temporary studio-transmitter links or intercity relay circuits 
consistent with Sec. 74.632 without further authority of the Commission: 
Provided, however, That prior Commission authority shall be obtained if 
the transmitting antenna to be installed will increase the height of any 
natural formation or man-made structure by more than 6.1 meters (20 
feet) and will be in existence for a period of more than 2 consecutive 
days.

    Note:  As used in this subpart, ``associated television broadcast 
station'' means a television broadcast station licensed to the licensee 
of the television auxiliary broadcast station and with which the 
television auxiliary station is licensed as an auxiliary facility.

    (b) A television broadcast STL station is authorized to transmit 
visual program material between the studio and the transmitter of a 
television broadcast station for simultaneous or delayed broadcast.
    (c) A TV relay station is authorized to transmit visual program 
material between TV broadcast stations for simultaneous or delayed 
broadcast, or may be used to transmit visual program material from a 
remote pickup receiver site of a single station.
    (d) The transmitter of an STL, TV relay station or TV translator 
relay station may be multiplexed to provide additional communication 
channels. A TV broadcast STL or TV relay station will be authorized only 
in those cases where the principal use is the transmission of television 
broadcast program material for use by its associated TV broadcast 
station. However, STL or TV relay stations so licensed may be operated 
at any time for the transmission of multiplexed communications whether 
or not visual program material is being transmitted, provided that such 
operation does not cause harmful interference to TV broadcast pickup, 
STL or TV relay stations transmitting television broadcast program 
material.
    (e) Except as provided in paragraphs (a), (d), (f) and (j) of this 
section, all program material transmitted over a TV pickup, STL, or TV 
relay station shall be used by or intended for use by a TV broadcast 
station owned by or under the common control of the licensee of the TV 
pickup, STL, or TV relay station. Program material transmitted over a TV 
pickup, STL or TV relay station and so used by the licensee of such 
facility may, with the permission of the licensee of the broadcast 
auxiliary facility, be used by other TV broadcast stations and by non-
broadcast closed circuit educational TV systems operated by educational 
institutions.
    (f) A TV broadcast pickup, STL, or TV relay station may be used for 
the transmission of material to be used by others, including but not 
limited to other broadcast stations, cable television systems, and 
educational institutions. This use shall not interfere with the use of 
these broadcast auxiliary facilities for the transmission of programs 
and associated material intended to be used by the television station or 
stations licensed to or under common control of the licensee of the TV 
pickup, STL, or TV relay station. This use of the broadcast auxiliary 
facilities must not cause harmful interference to broadcast auxiliary 
stations operating in accordance with the basic frequency allocation, 
and the licensee of the TV pickup, STL, or TV relay station must retain 
exclusive control over the operation of the facilities. Prior to 
operating pursuant to the provisions of this section, the licensee 
shall, for the intended location or area-of-operation, notify the 
appropriate

[[Page 417]]

frequency coordinatioin committee or any licensee(s) assigned the use of 
the proposed operating frequency, concerning the particulars of the 
intended operation and must provide the name and telephone number of a 
person who may be contacted in the event of interference.
    (g) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, a 
television translator relay station is authorized for the purpose of 
relaying the programs and signals of a television broadcast station to 
television broadcast translator stations for simultaneous 
retransmission.
    (h) A TV microwave booster station is authorized to retransmit the 
signals of a TV pickup, TV STL, TV relay, or TV translator relay 
station.
    (i) TV broadcast auxiliary stations authorized pursuant to this 
subpart may additionally be authorized to supply programs and signals of 
TV broadcast stations to cable television systems or CARS stations. 
Where the licensee of a TV broadcast auxiliary station supplies programs 
and signals to cable television systems or CARS stations, the TV 
auxiliary licensee must have exclusive control over the operation of the 
TV auxiliary stations licensed to it. Contributions to capital and 
operating expenses may be accepted only on a cost-sharing, non-profit 
basis, prorated on an equitable basis among all parties being supplied 
with program material.
    (j) A broadcast network-entity may use television auxiliary service 
stations to transmit their own television program materials to broadcast 
stations, other broadcast network-entities, cable systems and cable 
network-entities: Provided, however, that the bands 1990-2110 MHz, 6425-
6525 MHz and 6875-7125 MHz may be used by broadcast network-entities 
only for television pick-up stations.

by more than 250% of the authorized bandwidth: At least 43+10 log 10 
(mean output power in watts) dB, or 80 dB, whichever is the lesser 
attenuation.
    (2) When using digital modulation:
    (i) In any 1 NHz band, the center frequency of which is removed from 
the assigned frequency by more than 50% up to and including 250% of the 
authorized bandwidth: As specified by the following equation but in no 
event less than 11 dB.

                  A=11+0.4 (P-50)+10 log<INF>10</INF> B

where:

A=Attenuation (in dB) below the mean output power level
P=Percent removed from the carrier frequency
B=Authorized bandwidth in MHz

    [Attenuation greater than 56 decibels is not required.]
    (ii) In any 4 kHz band, the center frequency of which is removed 
from the assigned frequency by more than 250% of the authorized 
bandwidth: At least 43=10 log<INF>10</INF> (mean output power in watts) 
dB, or 80 dB, whichever is the lesser attenuation.
    (3) Amplitude Modulation.
    For vestigial sideband AM video: On any frequency removed from the 
center frequency of the authorized band by more than 50%: at least 50 dB 
below peak power of the emission.
    (d) In the event that interference to other stations is caused by 
emissions outside the authorized channel, the FCC may require greater 
attenuation than that specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (e) The following limitations also apply to the operation of TV 
microwave booster stations:
    (1) The booster station must receive and amplify the signals of the 
originating station and retransmit them on the same frequency without 
significantly altering them in any way. The characteristics of the 
booster transmitter output signal shall meet the requirements applicable 
to the signal of the originating station.
    (2) The licensee is responsible for correcting any condition of 
interference that results from the radiation of radio

[[Page 421]]

frequency energy outside the assigned channel. Upon notice by the FCC to 
the station licensee that interference is being caused, operation of the 
apparatus must be immediately suspended and may not be resumed until the 
interference has been eliminated or it can be demonstrated that the 
interference is not due to spurious emissions. However, short term test 
transmissions may be made during the period of suspended operation to 
determine the efficacy of remedial measures.
    (3) In each instance where suspension of operation is required, the 
licensee must submit a full report to the FCC after operation is 
resumed. The report must contain details of the nature of the 
interference, the source of interfering signals, and the remedial steps 
taken to eliminate the interference.
    (f) In the event a station's emissions outside its authorized 
channel cause harmful interference, the Commission may require the 
licensee to take such further steps as may be necessary to eliminate the 
interference.
    (g) The maximum bandwidth which will be authorized per frequency 
assignment is set out in the table which follows. Regardless of the 
maximum authorized bandwidth specified for each frequency band, the 
Commission reserves the right to issue a license for less than the 
maximum bandwidth if it appears that less bandwidth would be sufficient 
to support an applicant's intended communications.

Sec. 74.638  Frequency coordination.

    (a) Channels in Band D are shared with certain Private Operational 
Fixed Stations authorized under Part 94, Sec. 94.93 after September 9, 
1983. After this date all Broadcast Auxiliary use of these bands is 
subject to coordination using the following procedure:
    (1) Before filing an application for new or modified facilities 
under this part the applicant must perform a frequency engineering 
analysis to ensure that the proposed facilities will not cause 
interference to existing or previously applied for stations in this band 
of a magnitude greater than that specified below.
    (2) The general criteria for determining allowable adjacent or co-
channel interference protection to be afforded, regardless of system 
length or type of modulation, multiplexing or frequency band, shall be 
such that the interfering signal shall not produce more than 1.0 dB 
degradation of the practical threshold of the protected receiver. 
Degradation is determined by calculating the ratio in dB between the 
desired carrier signal and undesired interfering signal (C/I ratio) 
appearing at the input to the receiver under investigation (the victim 
receiver). The development of the C/I ratios from the criteria for 
maximum allowable interference level per exposure and the methods used 
to perform path calculations shall follow generally acceptable good 
engineering practices. Procedures as may be developed by the Electronics 
Industries Association (EIA), the Institute of Electrical and 
Electronics Engineers, Inc. (IEEE), the American National Standards 
Institute (ANSI) or any other recognized authority will be acceptable to 
the FCC.
    (3) Where the development of the carrier to interference ratio (C/I) 
is not covered by generally acceptable procedures or where the applicant 
does not wish to develop the carrier to interference ratio, the 
applicant shall employ the following C/I protection ratios.
    (i) Co-channel interference: For both sideband and carrier-beat, 
(applicable to all bands), the previously authorized system shall be 
afforded a carrier to interfering signal protection ratio of at least 90 
dB.
    (ii) Adjacent channel interference: The existing or previously 
authorized system shall be afforded a carrier to

[[Page 422]]

interfering signal protection ratio of at least 56 dB.
    (b) Coordination of assignments in the 6425-6525 MHz and 17.7-19.7 
GHz bands will be in accordance with the procedure established in 
Sec. 21.100(d) except that the prior coordination process for mobile 
(temporary fixed) assignments may be completed orally and the period 
allowed for response to a coordination notification may be less than 30 
days if the parties agree.

Sec. 74.641  Antenna systems.

    (a) For fixed stations operating between 1990 MHz and 31.3 GHz and 
aeronautical mobile stations operating between 31.0 GHz and 31.3 GHz, 
the following standards apply:
    (1) Fixed TV broadcast auxiliary stations shall use directional 
antennas that meet the performance standards indicated in the following 
table. Upon adequate showing of need to serve a larger sector, or more 
than a single sector, greater beamwidth or multiple antennas may be 
authorized. Applicants shall request, and authorization for stations in 
this service will specify, the polarization of each transmitted signal. 
Booster station antennas having narrower beamwidths and reduced sidelobe 
radiation may be required in congested areas, or to resolve interference 
problems.
    (i) Stations must employ an antenna that meets the performance 
standards for Category B. In areas subject to frequency congestion, 
where proposed facilities would be precluded by continued use of a 
Category B antenna, a Category A antenna must be employed. The 
Commission may require the use of a high performance antenna where 
interference problems can be resolved by the use of such antennas.
    (ii) Licensees shall comply with the antenna standards table shown 
in this paragraph in the following manner:
    (A) With either the maximum beamwith to 3 dB points requirement or 
with the minimum antenna gain requirement; and
    (B) With the minimum radiation suppression to angle requirement.

                                                                    Antenna Standards

    (2) New periscope antenna systems will be authorized upon a 
certification that the radiation, in a horizontal plane, from an 
illuminating antenna and reflector combination meets or exceeds the 
antenna standards of this section. This provision similarly applies to 
passive repeaters employed to redirect or repeat the signal from a 
station's directional antenna system.
    (3) The choice of receiving antennas is left to the discretion of 
the licensee. However, licensees will not be protected from interference 
which results from the use of antennas with poorer performance than 
identified in the table of this section.

[[Page 423]]

    (4) [Reserved]
    (5) Pickup stations are not subject to the performance standards 
herein stated. The provisions of this paragraph are effective for all 
new applications accepted for filing after October 1, 1981.
    (b) Any fixed station licensed pursuant to an application accepted 
for filing prior to October 1, 1981, may continue to use its existing 
antenna system, subject to periodic renewal until April 1, 1992, After 
April 1, 1992, all licensees are to use antenna systems in conformance 
with the standards of this section. TV auxiliary broadcast stations are 
considered to be located in an area subject to frequency congestion and 
must employ a Category A antenna when:
    (1) A showing by an applicant of a new TV auxiliary broadcast 
station or Cable Television Relay Service (CARS) station, which shares 
the 12.7-13.20 GHz band with TV auxiliary broadcast, indicates that use 
of a category B antenna limits a proposed project because of 
interference, and
    (2) That use of a category A antenna will remedy the interference 
thus allowing the project to be realized.
    (c) As an exception to the provisions of this section, the FCC may 
approve requests for use of periscope antenna systems where a persuasive 
showing is made that no frequency conflicts exist in the area of 
proposed use. Such approvals shall be conditioned to a standard antenna 
as required in paragraph (a) of this section when an applicant of a new 
TV auxiliary broadcast or Cable Television Relay station indicates that 
the use of the existing antenna system will cause interference and the 
use of a category A or B antenna will remedy the interference.
    (d) As a further exception to the provision of paragraph (a) of this 
section, the Commission may approve antenna systems not conforming to 
the technical standards where a persuasive showing is made that:
    (1) Indicates in detail why an antenna system complying with the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section cannot be installed, and
    (2) Includes a statement indicating that frequency coordination as 
required in Sec. 74.604 (a) was accomplished.

Sec. 74.643  Interference to geostationary-satellites.

    These limitations are necessary to minimize the probability of 
harmful interference to reception in the bands 6425-6525 MHz, 6875-7075 
MHz and 12.7-12.75 GHz on board geostationary space stations in the 
fixed-satellite service (Part 25).
    (a) 6425 to 6525 and 6875 to 7075 MHz. No directional transmitting 
antenna utilized by a fixed station operating in these bands shall be 
aimed within 2 degrees of the geostationary-satellite orbit, taking into 
account atmospheric refraction. However, exception may be made in 
unusual circumstances upon a showing that there is no reasonable 
alternative to the transmission path proposed. If there is no evidence 
that such exception would cause possible harmful interference to an 
authorized satellite system, said transmission path may be authorized on 
waiver basis where the maximum value of the equivalent isotropically 
radiated power (EIRP) does not exceed:
    (1) +47 dBW for any antenna beam directed within 0.5 degrees of the 
stationary satellite orbit or
    (2) +47 to +55 dBW, on a linear decibel scale (8 dB per degree) for 
any antenna beam directed between 0.5 degrees and 1.5 degrees of the 
stationary orbit.
    (b) 12.7 to 12.75 GHz. No directional transmitting antenna utilized 
by a fixed station operating in this band shall be aimed within 1.5 
degrees of the geostationary-satellite orbit, taking into account 
atmospheric refraction. However, exception may be made in unusual 
circumstances upon a showing that there is no reasonable alternative to 
the transmission path proposed. If there is no evidence that such 
exception would cause possible harmful interference to an authorized 
satellite system, said transmission path may be

[[Page 424]]

authorized on waiver basis where the maximum value of the equivalent 
isotropically radiated power (EIRP) does not exceed +45 dBW for any 
antenna beam directed within 1.5 degrees of the stationary satellite 
orbit.

    (b) For paths shorter than those specified in the Table, the EIRP 
shall not exceed the value derived from the following equation.

EIRP=30--20 log [A/B], dBW

    where:
EIRP=equivalent isotropic radiated power in dBW.
A=Minimum path length from the Table for the frequency band in 
          kilometers.
B=The actual path length in kilometers.

    (c) Upon an appropriate technical showing, applicants and licensees 
unable to meet the minimum path length requirement may be granted an 
exception to these requirements.

    Note: Links authorized prior to April 1, 1987, are excluded from 
this requirement, except that, effective April 1, 1992, the Commission 
will require compliance with the criteria where an existing link would 
otherwise preclude establishment of a new link.

Sec. 74.655  Authorization of equipment.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), all transmitting equipment 
first marketed for use under this subpart or placed into service after 
October 1, 1981, must be type accepted or notified, as detailed in 
paragraph (g) of this section. Equipment which is used at a station 
licensed prior to October 1, 1985, which is not type accepted or 
notified, as detailed in paragraph (g) of this section, may continue to 
be used by the licensee or its successors or assignees, provided that if 
operation of such equipment causes harmful interference due to its 
failure to comply with the technical standards set forth in this 
subpart, the FCC may, at its discretion, require the licensee to take 
such corrective action as is necessary to eliminate the interference. 
However, such equipment may not be further marketed or reused under Part 
74 after October 1, 1985. Transmitters designed for use in the 31.0 to 
31.3 GHz band shall be authorized under the notification procedure.
    (b) Type acceptance or notification is not required for transmitters 
used in conjunction with TV pickup stations operating with a peak output 
power not greater than 250 mW. Pickup stations operating in excess of 
250 mW licensed pursuant to applications accepted for filing prior to 
October 1, 1980 may continue operation subject to periodic renewal. If 
operation of such equipment causes harmful interference the FCC may, at 
its discretion, require the licensee to take such corrective action as 
is necessary to eliminate the interference.
    (c) The license of a TV auxiliary station may replace transmitting 
equipment with type accepted or notified equipment, as detailed under 
paragraph (g) of this section, without prior FCC approval, provided the 
proposed changes will not depart from any of the terms of the station or 
system authorization or the Commission's technical rules governing this 
service, and also provided that any changes made to type accepted or 
modified transmitting equipment is in compliance with the provisions of 
Part 2 of the FCC Rules concerning modifications to authorized 
equipment.
    (d) Any manufacturer of a transmitter to be used in this service may 
apply for type acceptance or notification following the procedures set 
forth in Part 2 of the FCC Rules.
    (e) An applicant for a TV broadcast auxiliary station may also apply 
for type acceptance or notification, as specified in paragraph (f) of 
this section, for an individual transmitter by following the procedures 
set forth in Subpart J of Part 2 of the FCC Rules and Regulations. 
Individual transmitters which are authorized will not normally be 
included in the FCC's Radio Equipment List.
    (f) As of March 5, 1984, transmitters designed to be used 
exclusively for a TV STL station, a TV intercity relay station, a TV 
translator relay station, or a TV microwave booster station, shall be 
authorized under the notification procedure. All other transmitters will 
be authorized under the type acceptance procedure. Transmitters 
authorized under type acceptance are acceptable for use in all TV 
broadcast auxiliary stations (see Sec. 2.904(d) of this chapter).

Sec. 74.682  Station identification.

    (a) Each television broadcast auxiliary station operating with a 
transmitter output power of 1 watt or more must, when actually 
transmitting programs, transmit station identification at the beginning 
and end of each period of operation, and hourly, as close to the hour as 
feasible, at a natural break in program offerings by one of the 
following means:
    (1) Transmission of its own call sign by visual or aural means or by 
automatic transmission in international Morse telegraphy.
    (2) Visual or aural transmission of the call sign of the TV 
broadcast station with which it is licensed as an auxiliary.
    (3) Visual or aural transmission of the call sign of the TV 
broadcast station whose signals are being relayed or, where programs are 
obtained directly from network lines and relayed, the network 
identification.
    (b) Identification transmissions during operation need not be made 
when to make such transmission would interrupt a single consecutive 
speech, play, religious service, symphony concert, or any type of 
production. In such cases, the identification transmission shall be made 
at the first interruption of the entertainment continuity and at the 
conclusion thereof.
    (c) During occasions when a television pickup station is being used 
to deliver program material for network distribution it may transmit the 
network identification in lieu of its own or associated TV station call 
sign during the actual program pickup. However, if it is providing the 
network feed through its own associated TV broadcast station it shall 
perform the station identification required by paragraph (a) of this 
section at the beginning and end of each period of operation.
    (d) A period of operation is defined as a single uninterrupted 
transmission or a series of intermittent transmissions from a single 
location or continuous or intermittent transmission from a television 
pickup station covering a single event from various locations, within a 
single broadcast day.
    (e) Regardless of the method used for station identification it 
shall be performed in a manner conducive to prompt association of the 
signal source with the responsible licensee. In exercising the 
discretion provided by this rule, licensees are expected to act in a

[[Page 427]]

responsible manner to assure that result.
    (f) TV microwave boosters stations will be assigned individual call 
signs. However, station identification will be accomplished by the 
retransmission of identification as provided in paragraph (a) of this 
section.

Sec. 74.702  Channel assignments.

    (a) An applicant for a new low power TV or TV translator station or 
for changes in the facilities of an authorized station shall endeavor to 
select a channel on which its operation is not likely to cause 
interference. The applications must be specific with regard to

[[Page 428]]

the channel requested. Only one channel will be assigned to each 
station.
    (1) Any one of the 12 standard VHF Channels (2 to 13 inclusive) may 
be assigned to a VHF low power TV or TV translator station. Channels 5 
and 6 assigned in Alaska shall not cause harmful interference to and 
must accept interference from non-Government fixed operation authorized 
prior to January 1, 1982.
    (2) Any one of the UHF Channels from 14 to 69, inclusive, may be 
assigned to a UHF low power TV or TV translator station. In accordance 
with Sec. 73.603(c) of part 73, Channel 37 will not be assigned to such 
stations.
    (3) Application for new low power TV or TV translator stations or 
for changes in existing stations, specifying operation above 806 MHz 
will not be accepted for filing. License renewals for existing TV 
translator stations operating on channels 70 (806-812 MHz) through 83 
(884-890 MHz) will be granted only on a secondary basis to land mobile 
radio operations.
    (b) Changes in the TV Table of Allotments or Digital Television 
Table of Allotments (Secs. 73.606(b) and 73.622(a), respectively, of 
part 73 of this chapter), authorizations to construct new TV broadcast 
analog or DTV stations or to authorizations to change facilities of 
existing such stations, may be made without regard to existing or 
proposed low power TV or TV translator stations. Where such a change 
results in a low power TV or TV translator station causing actual 
interference to reception of the TV broadcast analog or DTV station, the 
licensee or permittee of the low power TV or TV translator station shall 
eliminate the interference or file an application for a change in 
channel assignment pursuant to Sec. 73.3572 of this chapter.
    (c) A television broadcast booster station will be authorized on the 
channel assigned to its primary station.

<R05>
Sec. 74.703  Interference.

    (a) An application for a new low power TV, TV translator, or TV 
booster station or for a change in the facilities of such an authorized 
station will not be granted when it is apparent that interference will 
be caused. Except where there is a written agreement between the 
affected parties to accept interference, or where it can be shown that 
interference will not occur due to terrain shielding and/or Longley-Rice 
terrain dependent propagation methods, the licensee of a new low power 
TV, TV translator, or TV booster shall protect existing low power TV and 
TV translator stations from interference within the protected contour 
defined in Sec. 74.707. Such written agreement shall accompany the 
application. Guidance on using the Longley-Rice methodology is provided 
in OET Bulletin No. 69. Copies of OET Bulletin No. 69 may be inspected 
during normal business hours at the: Federal Communications Commission, 
1919 M St., N.W., Dockets Branch (Room 239), Washington, DC 20554. This 
document is also available through the Internet on the FCC Home Page at 
http://www.fcc.gov.
    (b) It shall be the responsibility of the licensee of a low power 
TV, TV translator, or TV booster station to correct at its expense any 
condition of interference to the direct reception of the signal of any 
other TV broadcast analog station and DTV station operating on the same 
channel as that used by the low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster 
station or an adjacent channel which occurs as a result of the operation 
of the low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster station. Interference 
will be considered to occur whenever reception of a regularly used 
signal is impaired by the signals radiated by the low power TV, TV 
translator, or TV booster station, regardless of the quality of the 
reception or the strength of the signal so used. If the interference 
cannot be promptly eliminated by the application of suitable techniques, 
operation of the offending low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster 
station shall be suspended and shall not be resumed until the 
interference has been eliminated. If the complainant refuses to permit 
the low Power TV, TV translator, or TV booster station to apply remedial 
techniques that demonstrably will eliminate the interference without 
impairment of the original reception, the licensee of the

[[Page 429]]

low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster station is absolved of 
further responsibility. TV booster stations will be exempt from the 
provisions of this paragraph to the extent that they may cause limited 
interference to their primary stations' signal subject to the conditions 
of paragraph (g) of this section.
    (c) It shall be the responsibility of the licensee of a low power 
TV, TV translator, or TV booster station to correct any condition of 
interference which results from the radiation of radio frequency energy 
outside its assigned channel. Upon notice by the FCC to the station 
licensee or operator that such interference is caused by spurious 
emissions of the station, operation of the station shall be immediately 
suspended and not resumed until the interference has been eliminated. 
However, short test transmissions may be made during the period of 
suspended operation to check the efficacy of remedial measures.
    (d) When a low power TV or TV translator station causes interference 
to a CATV system by radiations within its assigned channel at the cable 
headend or on the output channel of any system converter located at a 
receiver, the earlier user, whether cable system or low power TV or TV 
translator station, will be given priority on the channel, and the later 
user will be responsible for correction of the interference. When a low 
power TV or TV translator station causes interference to an MDS of ITFS 
system by radiations within its assigned channel on the output channel 
of any system converter located at a receiver, the earlier user, whether 
MDS system or low power TV or TV translator station, will be given 
priority on the channel, and the later user will be responsible for 
correction of the interference.
    (e) Low power TV and TV translator stations are being authorized on 
a secondary basis to existing land mobile uses and must correct whatever 
interference they cause to land mobile stations or cease operation.
    (f) In each instance where suspension of operation is required, the 
licensee shall submit a full report to the FCC in Washington, DC, after 
operation is resumed, containing details of the nature of the 
interference, the source of the interfering signals, and the remedial 
steps taken to eliminate the interference.
    (g) A TV booster station may not disrupt the existing service of its 
primary station nor may it cause interference to the signal provided by 
the primary station within the principal community to be served.

Sec. 74.705  TV broadcast analog station protection.

    (a) The TV broadcast station protected contour will be its Grade B 
contour signal level as defined in Sec. 73.683 and calculated from the 
authorized maximum radiated power (without depression angle correction), 
the horizontal radiation pattern, height above average terrain in the 
pertinent direction, and the appropriate chart from Sec. 73.699.
    (b)(1) An application to construct a new low power TV or TV 
translator station or change the facilities of an existing station will 
not be accepted if it specifies a site which is within the protected 
contour of a co-channel or first adjacent channel TV broadast station.
    (2) Due to the frequency spacing which exists between TV Channels 4 
and 5, between Channels 6 and 7, and between Channels 13 and 14, 
adjacent channel protection standards shall not be applicable to these 
pairs of channels. (See Sec. 73.603(a) of part 73 of this chapter.)
    (3) A UHF low power TV or TV translator construction permit 
application will not be accepted if it specifies a site within the UHF 
TV broadcast station's protected contour and proposes operation on a 
channel either 14 or 15 channels above the channel in use by the TV 
broadcast station.
    (4) A UHF low power TV or TV translator construction permit 
application will not be accepted if it specifies a site less than 100 
kilometers from the transmitter site of a UHF TV broadcast analog 
station operating on a channel which is the seventh channel above the 
requested channel, unless it

[[Page 430]]

can demonstrate that the service area of the low power TV or TV 
translator station as established in Sec. 74.707(a) is not located in an 
area where the TV broadcast analog station is regularly viewed.
    (5) An application for a new UHF low power TV or TV translator 
construction permit, a change of channel, or a major change in 
facilities pursuant to Sec. 73.3572 of this chapter proposing a maximum 
effective radiated power of more than 50 kilowatts will not be accepted 
if it specifies a site less than 32 kilometers from the transmitter site 
of a UHF TV broadcast analog station operating on a channel which is the 
second, third, or fourth channel above or below the requested channel.
    (c) The low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster station field 
strength is calculated from the proposed effective radiated power (ERP) 
and the antenna height above average terrain (HAAT) in pertinent 
directions.
    (1) For co-channel protection, the field strength is calculated 
using Figure 9a, 10a, or 10c of Sec. 73.699 (F(50,10) charts) of Part 73 
of this chapter.
    (2) For low power TV, TV translator, and TV boosters that do not 
specify the same channel as the TV broadcast station to be protected, 
the field strength is calculated using Figure 9, 10, or 10b of 
Sec. 73.699 (F(50,50) charts) of Part 73 of this chapter.
    (d) A low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster station application 
will not be accepted if the ratio in dB of its field strength to that of 
the TV broadcast station at the protected contour fails to meet the 
following:
    (1) -45 dB for co-channel operations without offset carrier 
frequency operation or -28 dB for offset carrier frequency operation. An 
application requesting offset carrier frequency operation must include 
the following:
    (i) A requested offset designation (zero, plus, or minus) 
identifying the proposed direction of the 10 kHz offset from the 
standard carrier frequencies of the requested channel. If the offset 
designation is not different from that of the station being protected, 
the -45 dB ratio must be used.
    (ii) A description of the means by which the low power TV, TV 
translator, or TV booster station will be maintained within the 
tolerances specified in Sec. 74.761 for offset operation.
    (2) 6 dB when the protected TV broadcast station operates on a VHF 
channel that is one channel above the requested channel.
    (3) 12 dB when the protected TV broadcast station operates on a VHF 
channel that is one channel below the requested channel.
    (4) 15 dB when the protected TV broadcast station operates on a UHF 
channel that is one channel above or below the requested channel.
    (5) 23 dB when the protected TV broadcast station operates on a UHF 
channel that is fourteen channels below the requested channel.
    (6) 6 dB when the protected TV broadcast station operates a UHF 
channel that is fifteen channels below the requested channel.
    (e) In support of a request for waiver of the interference 
protection rules, an applicant for a low power TV, TV translator or TV 
booster may make full use of terrain shielding and Longley-Rice terrain 
dependent propagation prediction methods to demonstrate that the 
proposed facility would not be likely to cause interference to TV 
broadcast stations. Guidance on using the Longley-Rice methodology is 
provided in OET Bulletin No. 69. Copies of OET Bulletin No. 69 may be 
inspected during normal business hours at the: Federal Communications 
Commission, 1919 M St., NW., Dockets Branch (Room 239), Washington, DC 
20554. This document is also available through the Internet on the FCC

Sec. 74.706  Digital TV (DTV) station protection.

    (a) For purposes of this section, the DTV station protected service 
area is the geographic-area in which the field strength of the station's 
signal exceeds the noise-limited service levels specified in 
Sec. 73.622(e) of this chapter. The extremity of this area (noise-
limited perimeter) is calculated from the authorized maximum radiated 
power (without depression angle correction), the horizontal radiation 
pattern, and

[[Page 431]]

height above average terrain in the pertinent direction, using the 
signal propagation method specified in Sec. 73.625(b) of this chapter.
    (b)(1) An application to construct a new low power TV or TV 
translator station or change the facilities of an existing station will 
not be accepted if it specifies a site which is located within the 
noise-limited service perimeter of a co-channel DTV station.
    (2) Due to the frequency spacing which exists between TV channels 4 
and 5, between Channels 6 and 7, and between Channels 13 and 14, 
adjacent channel protection standards shall not be applicable to these 
pairs of channels.
    (c) The low power TV, TV translator or TV booster station field 
strength is calculated from the proposed effective radiated power (ERP) 
and the antenna height above average terrain (HAAT) in pertinent 
directions.
    (1) For co-channel protection, the field strength is calculated 
using Figure 9a, 10a, or 10c of Sec. 73.699 (F(50,10) charts) of part 73 
of this chapter.
    (2) For adjacent channel protection, the field strength is 
calculated using Figure 9, 10, or 10b of Sec. 73.699 (F(50,50) charts) 
of part 73 of this chapter.
    (d) A low power TV, TV translator or TV booster station application 
will not be accepted if the ratio in dB of its field strength to that of 
the DTV station fails to meet the following:
    (1)-21 dB for co-channel operations at the noise-limited perimeter 
of the DTV station.
    (2) +48 dB for adjacent channel operations at:
    (i) The DTV noise-limited perimeter if a low power TV, TV translator 
or TV booster station is located outside that perimeter.
    (ii) At all points within the DTV noise-limited area if a low power 
TV or TV translator is located within the DTV noise-limited perimeter, 
as demonstrated by the applicant.

Sec. 74.707  Low power TV and TV translator station protection.

    (a)(1) A low power TV or TV translator will be protected from 
interference from other low power TV or TV translator stations, or TV 
booster stations within the following predicted contours:
    (i) 62 dBu for stations on Channels 2 through 6;
    (ii) 68 dBu for stations on Channels 7 through 13; and
    (iii) 74 dBu for stations on Channels 14 through 69.

Existing licensees and permittees that did not furnish sufficient data 
required to calculate the above contours by April 15, 1983 are assigned 
protected contours having the following radii:

Up to 0.001 kW VHF/UHF--1 mile (1.6 km) from transmitter site
Up to 0.01 kW VHF; up to 0.1 k/W UHF--2 miles (3.2 km) from transmitter 
site
Up to 0.1 kW VHF; up to 1 kW UHF--4 miles (6.4 km) from transmitter site


New applicants must submit the required information; they cannot rely on 
this table.
    (2) The low power TV or TV translator station protected contour is 
calculated from the authorized effective radiated power and antenna 
height above average terrain, using Figure 9, 10, or 10b of Sec. 73.699 
(F(50,50) charts) of Part 73 of this chapter.
    (b)(1) An application to construct a new low power TV, TV 
translator, or TV booster station or change the facilities of an 
existing station will not be accepted if it specifies a site which is 
within the protected contour of a co-channel or first adjacent channel 
low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster station, except that a TV 
booster station may be located within the protected contour of its co-
channel primary station.
    (2) Due to the frequency spacing which exists between TV Channels 4 
and 5, between Channels 6 and 7, and between Channels 13 and 14, 
adjacent channel protection standards shall not be applicable to these 
pairs of channels. (See Sec. 73.603(a) of Part 73 of this chapter.)
    (3) A UHF low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster construction 
permit application will not be accepted if it specifies a site within 
the UHF low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster station's protected 
contour and proposes operation on a channel that is 15 channels above 
the channel in use by the low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster 
station.

[[Page 432]]

    (c) The low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster construction 
permit application field strength is calculated from the proposed 
effective radiated power (ERP) and the antenna above average terrain 
(HAAT) in pertinent directions.
    (1) For co-channel protection, the field strength is calculated 
using Figure 9a, 10a, or 10c of Sec. 73.699 (F(50,10) charts) of Part 73 
of this chapter.
    (2) For low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster applications that 
do not specify the same channel as the low power TV, TV translator, or 
TV booster station to be protected, the field strength is calculated 
using Figure 9, 10, or 10b of Sec. 73.699 (F(50,50) charts) of Part 73 
of this chapter.
    (d) A low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster station application 
will not be accepted if the ratio in dB of its field strength to that of 
the authorized low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster station at its 
protected contour fails to meet the following:
    (1) -45 dB for co-channel operations without offset carrier 
frequency operation or -28 dB for offset carrier frequency operation. An 
application requesting offset carrier frequency operation must include 
the following:
    (i) A requested offset designation (zero, plus, or minus) 
identifying the proposed direction of the 10 kHz offset from the 
standard carrier frequencies of the requested channel. If the offset 
designation is not different from that of the station being protected, 
or if the station being protected is not maintaining its frequencies 
within the tolerance specified in Sec. 74.761 for offset operation, the 
-45 dB ratio must be used.
    (ii) A description of the means by which the low power TV, TV 
translator, or TV booster station's frequencies will be maintained 
within the tolerances specified in Sec. 74.761 for offset operation.
    (2) 6 dB when the protected low power TV or TV translator station 
operates on a VHF channel that is one channel above the requested 
channel.
    (3) 12 dB when the protected low power TV or TV translator station 
operates on a VHF channel that is one channel below the requested 
channel.
    (4) 15 dB when the protected low power TV or TV translator station 
operates on a UHF channel that is one channel above or below the 
requested channel.
    (5) 6 dB when the protected low power TV or TV translator station 
operates on a UHF channel that is fifteen channels below the requested 
channel.
    (e) In support of a request for waiver of the interference 
protection rules, an applicant for a low power TV or TV translator 
station may make full use of terrain shielding and Longley-Rice terrain 
dependent propagation prediction methods to demonstrate that the 
proposed facility would not be likely to cause interference to low power 
TV, TV translator and TV booster stations. Guidance on using the 
Longley-Rice methodology is provided in OET Bulletin No. 69. Copies of 
OET Bulletin No. 69 may be inspected during normal business hours at

Sec. 74.731  Purpose and permissible service.

    (a) Television broadcast translator stations and television 
broadcast booster stations provide a means whereby the signals of 
television broadcast stations may be retransmitted to areas in which 
direct reception of such television broadcast stations is unsatisfactory 
due to distance or intervening terrain barriers.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, a 
television broadcast translator station or television broadcast booster 
station may be used only to receive the signals of a television 
broadcast station, another television broadcast translator station, a 
television translator relay station, a television intercity relay 
station, a television STL station, or other suitable source such as a 
CARS or common carrier microwave station, for the simultaneous 
retransmission of the programs and signals of a television broadcast 
station. Such retransmissions may be accomplished by either:
    (1) Reception of the television programs and signals of a television 
broadcast station directly through space, conversion to a different 
channel by simple heterodyne frequency conversion and suitable 
amplification; or,
    (2) Modulation and amplification of a video and audio feed, in which 
case modulating equipment meeting the requirements of Sec. 74.750(d) 
shall be used.
    (c) The transmissions of each television broadcast translator 
station shall be intended for direct reception by the general public and 
any other use shall be incidental thereto. A television broadcast 
translator station shall not be operated solely for the purpose of 
relaying signals to one or more fixed receiving points for 
retransmission, distribution, or further relaying.
    (d) The technical characteristics of the retransmitted signals shall 
not be deliberately altered so as to hinder reception on conventional 
television broadcast receivers.
    (e) A television broadcast translator station shall not deliberately 
retransmit the signals of any station other than the station it is 
authorized by license to retransmit. Precautions shall be taken to avoid 
unintentional retransmission of such other signals.
    (f) A locally generated radio frequency signal similar to that of a 
TV broadcast station and modulated with visual and aural information may 
be connected to the input terminals of a television broadcast translator 
or low power station for the purposes of transmitting still photographs, 
slides and voice announcements. The radio frequency signals shall be on 
the same channel as the normally used off-the-air signal being 
rebroadcast. When transmitting originations concerning financial support 
or public service announcements, connection of the locally generated 
signals shall be made automatically either by means of a time switch or 
upon receipt of a control signal from the TV station being rebroadcast 
designed to actuate the switching circuit. The switching circuit will be 
so designed that the input circuit will be returned to the off-the-air 
signal within 30 seconds. The connection for emergency transmissions may 
be made manually. The apparatus used to generate the local signal which 
is used to modulate the translator or low power station must be capable 
of producing a visual or aural signal or both which will provide 
acceptable reception on television receivers designed for the 
transmission standards employed by TV broadcast stations. The visual and 
aural materials so transmitted shall be limited to emergency warnings of 
imminent danger, to local public service announcements and to seeking or 
acknowledging financial support deemed necessary to the continued 
operation of the station. Accordingly, the originations concerning 
financial support and PSAs are limited to 30 seconds each, no more than 
once per hour. Acknowledgements of financial support may include 
identification of the contributors, the size and nature of the 
contribution and advertising messages of contributors. Emergency 
transmissions shall be no longer or more frequent than necessary to 
protect life and property.
    (g) Low power TV stations may operate under the following modes of 
service:
    (1) As a TV translator station, subject to the requirements of this 
part;

[[Page 435]]

    (2) For origination of programming and commercial matter as defined 
in Sec. 74.701(f);
    (3) For the transmission of subscription television broadcast (STV) 
programs, intended to be received in intelligible form by members of the 
public for a fee or charge subject to the provisions of Secs. 73.642(e) 
and 73.644.
    (h) A low power TV station may not be operated solely for the 
purpose of relaying signals to one or more fixed receiving points for 
retransmission, distribution or relaying.
    (i) Low power TV stations are subject to no minimum required hours 
of operation and may operate in any of the 3 modes described in 
paragraph (g) of this section for any number of hours.
    (j) Television broadcast booster stations provide a means whereby 
the licensee of a television broadcast station may provide service to 
areas of low signal strength in any region within the primary station's 
Grade B contour. The booster station may not be located outside the 
predicted Grade B of its primary station nor may the predicted Grade B 
signal of the television booster station extend beyond the predicted 
Grade B contour of the primary station. A television broadcast booster 
station is authorized to retransmit only the signals of its primary 
station; it shall not retransmit the signals of any other stations nor 
make independent transmissions. However, locally generated signals may 
be used to excite the booster apparatus for the purpose of conducting 
tests and measurements essential to the proper installation and 
maintenance of the apparatus.
    (k) The transmissions of a television broadcast booster station 
shall be intended for direct reception by the general public. Such 
stations will not be permitted to establish a point-to-point television 
relay system.

Sec. 74.732  Eligibility and licensing requirements.

    (a) A license for a low power TV or TV translator station may be 
issued to any qualified individual, organized group of individuals, 
broadcast station licensee, or local civil governmental body.
    (b) More than one low power TV or TV translator station may be 
licensed to the same applicant whether or not such stations serve 
substantially the same area. Low power TV and TV translator stations are 
not counted for purposes of Sec. 73.3555, concerning multiple ownership.
    (c) Only one channel will be assigned to each low power TV or TV 
translator station. Additional low power or translator stations may be 
authorized to provide additional reception. A separate application is 
required for each station and each application must be complete in all 
respects.
    (d) The FCC will not act on applications for new low power TV or TV 
translator stations, for changes in facilities of existing stations, or 
for changes in output channel tendered by displaced stations pursuant to 
Sec. 73.3572(a)(1), when such changes will result in a major change 
until the applicable time for filing a petition to deny has passed 
pursuant to Sec. 73.3584(c).
    (e) A proposal to change the primary TV station being retransmitted 
or an application of a licensed translator station to include low power 
TV station operation, i.e., program origination or subscription service 
will be subject only to a notification requirement.
    (f) Applications for transfer of ownership or control of a low power 
TV or TV translator station will be subject to petitions to deny.
    (g) A television broadcast booster station will be authorized only 
to the licensee or permittee of the television station whose signals the 
booster will rebroadcast, to areas within the Grade B contour of the 
primary station.
    (h) No numerical limit is placed on the number of booster stations 
that may be licensed to a single licensee. A separate license is 
required for each television broadcast booster station.

Sec. 74.733  UHF translator signal boosters.

    (a) The licensee of a UHF television broadcast translator station 
may be

[[Page 436]]

authorized to operate one or more signal boosters for the purpose of 
providing reception to small shadowed areas within the area intended to 
be served by the translator.
    (b) The transmitting apparatus shall consist of a simple linear 
radio frequency amplifier, with one or more amplifying stages, which is 
capable of receiving, amplifying, and retransmitting the signals of the 
parent translator without significantly altering any electrical 
characteristic of the received signal other than its amplitude. The 
maximum power input to the plate of the final radio frequency amplifier 
shall not exceed 5 watts.
    (c) The amplifier shall be equipped with suitable circuits which 
will automatically cause it to cease radiating if no signal is being 
received from the parent translator station. Care shall be taken in the 
design of the apparatus to insure that out-of-band radiation is not 
excessive and that adequate isolation is maintained between the input 
and output circuits to prevent unstable operation.
    (d) The installation of the apparatus and its associated receiving 
and transmitting antennas shall be in accordance with accepted 
principles of good engineering practice. Either horizontal, vertical, or 
circular polarization of the electric field of the radiated signal may 
be employed. If the isolation between the input and output circuits 
depends in part upon the polarization or directive properties of the 
transmitting and receiving antennas, the installation shall be 
sufficiently rugged to withstand the normal hazards of the environment.
    (e) The operation of a UHF translator signal booster is subject to 
the condition that no harmful interference is caused to the reception of 
any station, broadcast or non-broadcast, other than the parent 
translator. The licensee of the UHF translator signal booster is 
expected to use reasonable diligence to minimize interference to the 
direct reception of the parent translator station.
    (f) UHF translator signal boosters may be operated unattended. 
Repairs and adjustments shall be made by a qualified person. The 
required qualifications are set forth in Sec. 74.750 (g) and (h).
    (g) An individual call sign will not be assigned to a UHF translator 
booster station. The retransmission of the call sign of the parent 
translator will serve as station identification.
    (h) Applications for authority to construct and operate a UHF 
translator signal booster shall be submitted on FCC Form 346A. No 
construction of facilities or installation of apparatus at the proposed 
transmitter site shall be made until a construction permit therefor has 
been issued by the Commission.
    (i) The provisions of Sec. 74.765 concerning posting of station 
license shall apply to a UHF translator signal booster except that the 
parent UHF translator call sign, followed by the word ``Booster'', shall 
be displayed at the signal booster site.
    (j) The provisions of Secs. 74.767 and 74.781 concerning marking and 
lighting of antenna structures and station records, respectively, apply 
to UHF translator signal boosters.

    Note: Effective July 11, 1975, no new UHF signal boosters will be 
authorized. Licensees of such existing boosters may make application for 
renewal of license or change in facilities on the applicable FCC forms 
for Television Broadcast Translator Stations (Form 346, for construction 
permits; 347, for license to cover construction permit; and 303-S, for 
renewal of license). Report and Order, Docket No. 20372. May 28, 1975.

<R05>
Sec. 74.734  Attended and unattended operation.

    (a) Low power TV, TV translator, and TV booster stations may be 
operated without a designated person in attendance if the following 
requirements are met:
    (1) If the transmitter site cannot be promptly reached at all hours 
and in all seasons, means shall be provided so that the transmitting 
apparatus can be turned on and off at will from a point that readily is 
accessible at all hours and in all seasons.

[[Page 437]]

    (2) The transmitter also shall be equipped with suitable automatic 
circuits that will place it in a nonradiating condition in the absence 
of a signal on the input channel or circuit.
    (3) The transmitting and the ON/OFF control, if at a location other 
than the transmitter site, shall be adequately protected against 
tampering by unauthorized persons.
    (4) The FCC shall be supplied with the name, address, and telephone 
number of a person or persons who may be called to secure suspension of 
operation of the transmitter promptly should such action be deemed 
necessary by the FCC. Such information shall be kept current by the 
licensee.
    (5) In cases where the antenna and supporting structure are 
considered to be a hazard to air navigation and are required to be 
painted and lighted under the provisions of part 17 of the Rules, the 
licensee shall make suitable arrangements for the daily observations, 
when required, and lighting equipment inspections required by 
Secs. 17.37 and 17.38 of the FCC rules.
    (b) An application for authority to construct a new low power TV 
station (when rebroadcasting the programs of another station) or TV 
translator station or to make changes in the facilities of an authorized 
station, and that proposes unattended operation, shall include an 
adequate showing as to the manner of compliance with this section.

<R05>
Sec. 74.735  Power limitations.

    (a) The maximum peak effective radiated power (ERP) of an analog low 
power TV, TV translator, or TV booster station shall not exceed:
    (1) 3 kW for VHF channels 2-13; and
    (2) 150 kW for UHF channels 14-69.
    (b) The maximum ERP of a digital low power TV, TV translator, or TV 
booster station (average power) shall not exceed:
    (1) 300 watts for VHF channels 2-13; and
    (2) 15 kW for UHF channels 14-69.
    (c) The limits in paragraphs (a) and (b) apply separately to the 
effective radiated powers that may be obtained by the use of 
horizontally or vertically polarized transmitting antennas, providing 
the applicable provisions of Secs. 74.705, 74.706, 74.707 and 74.709 are 
met. For either omnidirectional or directional antennas, where the ERP 
values of the vertically and horizontally polarized components are not 
of equal strength, the ERP limits shall apply to the polarization with 
the larger ERP. Applications proposing the use of directional antenna 
systems must be accompanied by the following:
    (1) Complete description of the proposed antenna system, including 
the manufacturer and model number of the proposed directional antenna. 
It is not acceptable to label the antenna with only a generic term such 
as ``Yagi'' or ``Dipole''. A specific model number must be provided. In 
the case of individually designed antennas with no model number, or in 
the case of a composite antenna composed of two or more individual 
antennas, the antenna should be described as a ``custom'' or 
``composite'' antenna, as appropriate. A full description of the design 
of the antenna should also be submitted.
    (2) Relative field horizontal plane pattern (horizontal polarization 
only) of the proposed directional antenna. A value of 1.0 should be used 
for the maximum radiation. The plot of the pattern should be oriented so 
that 0 deg. corresponds to the maximum radiation of the directional 
antenna or, alternatively in the case of a symmetrical pattern, to the 
line of symmetry. The 0 deg. on the plot should be referenced to the 
actual azimuth with respect to true North.
    (3) A tabulation of the relative field pattern required in paragraph 
(c)(2), of this section. The tabulation should use the same zero degree 
reference as the plotted pattern, and be tabulated at least every 
10 deg.. In addition, tabulated values of all maximas and minimas, with 
their corresponding azimuths, should be submitted.
    (4) All horizontal plane patterns must be plotted to the largest 
scale possible on unglazed letter-size polar coordinate paper (main 
engraving approximately 18 cm x 25 cm (7 inches x 10 inches)) using only 
scale divisions and subdivisions of 1, 2, 2.5 or 5 times 10-nth. Values 
of field strength on any

[[Page 438]]

pattern less than 10% of the maximum field strength plotted on that 
pattern must be shown on an enlarged scale.
    (5) The horizontal plane patterns that are required are the patterns 
for the complete directional antenna system. In the case of a composite 
antenna composed of two or more individual antennas, this means that the 
patterns for the composite antenna composed of two or more individual 
antennas, not the patterns for each of the individual antennas, must be 
submitted.

Sec. 74.736  Emissions and bandwidth.

    (a) The license of a low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster 
station authorizes the transmission of the visual signal by amplitude 
modulation (A5) and the accompanying aural signal by frequency 
modulation (F3).
    (b) Standard width television channels will be assigned and the 
transmitting apparatus shall be operated so as to limit spurious 
emissions to the lowest practicable value. Any emissions including 
intermodulation products and radio frequency harmonics which are not 
essential for the transmission of the desired picture and sound 
information shall be considered to be spurious emissions.
    (c) Any emissions appearing on frequencies more than 3 MHz above or 
below the upper and lower edges, respectively, of the assigned channel 
shall be attenuated no less than:
    (1) 30 dB for transmitters rated at no more than 1 watt power 
output.
    (2) 50 dB for transmitters rated at more than 1 watt power output.
    (3) 60 dB for transmitters rated at more than 100 watts power 
output.
    (d) Greater attenuation than that specified in paragraph (c) of this 
section may be required if interference results from emissions outside 
the assigned channel.

Sec. 74.737  Antenna location.

    (a) An applicant for a new low power TV, TV translator, or TV 
booster station or for a change in the facilities of an authorized 
station shall endeavor to select a site that will provide a line-of-
sight transmission path to the entire area intended to be served and at 
which there is available a suitable signal from the primary station, if 
any, that will be retransmitted.
    (b) The transmitting antenna should be placed above growing 
vegetation and trees lying in the direction of the area intended to be 
served, to minimize the possibility of signal absorption by foliage.
    (c) A site within 8 kilometers of the area intended to be served is 
to be preferred if the conditions in paragraph (a) of this section can 
be met.
    (d) Consideration should be given to the accessibility of the site 
at all seasons of the year and to the availability of facilities for the 
maintenance and operation of the transmitting equipment.
    (e) The transmitting antenna should be located as near as is 
practical to the transmitter to avoid the use of long transmission lines 
and the associated power losses.
    (f) Consideration should be given to the existence of strong radio 
frequency fields from other transmitters at the site of the transmitting 
equipment and the possibility that such fields may result in the 
retransmissions of signals originating on frequencies other than that of 
the primary station being rebroadcast.

Sec. 74.750  Transmission system facilities.

    (a) A low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster station shall 
operate with a transmitter that is either type accepted for licensing 
under the provisions of this subpart or type notified for use under part 
73 of this chapter.
    (b) Transmitting antennas, antennas used to receive the signals to 
be rebroadcast, and transmission lines are not type accepted by the FCC. 
External preamplifiers also may be used provided that they do not cause 
improper

[[Page 439]]

operation of the transmitting equipment, and use of such preamplifiers 
is not necessary to meet the provisions of paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (c) The following requirements must be met before low power TV and 
TV translator transmitters will be type accepted by the FCC:
    (1) The equipment shall be so designed that the electrical 
characteristics of a standard television signal introduced into the 
input terminals will be maintained at the output. The overall response 
of the apparatus within its assigned channel, when operating at its 
rated power output and measured at the output terminals, shall provide a 
smooth curve, varying within limits separated by no more than 4 dB: 
Provided, however, That means may be provided to reduce the amplitude of 
the aural carrier below those limits, if necessary to prevent 
intermodulation which would mar the quality of the retransmitted picture 
or result in emissions outside of the assigned channel.
    (2) Radio frequency harmonics of the visual and aural carriers, 
measured at the output terminals of the transmitter, shall be attenuated 
no less than 60 dB below the peak visual output power within the 
assigned channel. All other emissions appearing on frequencies more than 
3 megacycles above or below the upper and lower edges, respectively, of 
the assigned channel shall be attenuated no less than:
    (i) 30 dB for transmitters rated at no more than 1 watt power 
output.
    (ii) 50 dB for transmitters rated at more than 1 watt power output.
    (iii) 60 dB for transmitters rated at more than 100 watts power 
output.
    (3) When subjected to variations in ambient temperature between 
minus 30 degrees and plus 50 degrees Centigrade and variations in power 
main voltage between 85 percent and 115 percent of rated power supply 
voltage, the local oscillator frequency stability shall maintain the 
operating frequency within:
    (i) 0.02 percent of its rated frequency for transmitters rated at no 
more than 100 watts peak visual power.
    (ii) 0.002 percent of the rated frequency for transmitters rated at 
more than 100 watts peak visual power.
    (iii) Plus or minus 1 kHz of its rated frequency for transmitters to 
be used at stations employing offset carrier frequency operation.
    (4) The apparatus shall contain automatic circuits which will 
maintain the peak visual power output constant within 2 dB when the 
strength of the input signal is varied over a range of 30 dB and which 
will not permit the peak visual power output to exceed the maximum rated 
power output under any condition. If a manual adjustment is provided to 
compensate for different average signal strengths, provision shall be 
made for determining the proper setting for the control, and if improper 
adjustment of the control could result in improper operation, a label 
shall be affixed at the adjustment control bearing a suitable warning.
    (5) The apparatus must be equipped with automatic controls that will 
place it in a non-radiating condition when no signal is being received 
on the input channel, either due to absence of a transmitted signal or 
failure of the receiving portion of the facilities used for 
rebroadcasting the signal of another station. The automatic control may 
include a time delay feature to prevent interruptions caused by fading 
or other momentary failures of the incoming signal.
    (6) The tube or tubes employed in the final radio frequency 
amplifier shall be of the appropriate power rating to provide the rated 
power output of the translator. The normal operating constants for 
operation at the rated power output shall be specified. The apparatus 
shall be equipped with suitable meters or meter jacks so that 
appropriate voltage and current measurements may be made while the 
apparatus is in operation.
    (7) The transmitters of over 0.001 kW peak visual power (0.002 kW 
when circularly polarized antennas are used) shall be equipped with an 
automatic keying device that will transmit the call sign of the station, 
in International Morse Code, at least once each hour during the time the 
station is in operation when operating in the translator mode 
retransmitting the programming of a TV broadcast station. However, the 
identification by Morse Code is not required if the licensee of

[[Page 440]]

the low power TV or TV translator station has an agreement with the TV 
broadcast station being rebroadcast to transmit aurally or visually the 
low power TV or TV translator station call as provided for in 
Sec. 74.783. Transmission of the call sign can be accomplished by:
    (i) Frequency shift keying; the aural and visual carrier shift shall 
not be less than 5 kHz or greater than 25 kHz.
    (ii) Amplitude modulation of the aural carrier of at least 30% 
modulation. The audio frequency tone used shall not be within 200 hertz 
of the Emergency Broadcast System Attention Signal alerting frequencies.
    (8) Wiring, shielding, and construction shall be in accordance with 
accepted principles of good engineering practice.
    (d) Low power TV, TV translator and transmitting equipment using a 
modulation process for either program origination or rebroadcasting TV 
booster transmitting equipment using a modulation process must meet the 
following requirements:
    (1) The equipment shall meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1)

Sec. 74.783  Station identification.

    (a) Each low power TV and TV translator station not originating 
local programming as defined by Sec. 74.701(h) operating over 0.001 kw 
peak visual power (0.002 kw when using circularly polarized antennas) 
must transmit its station identification as follows:
    (1) By transmitting the call sign in International Morse Code at 
least once each hour. This transmission may be accomplished by means of 
an automatic device as required by Sec. 74.750(c)(7). Call sign 
transmission shall be made at a code speed not in excess of 20 words per 
minute; or
    (2) By arranging for the primary station, whose signal is being 
rebroadcast, to identify the translator station by transmitting an 
easily readable visual presentation or a clearly understandable aural 
presentation of the translator station's call letters and location. Two 
such identifications shall be made between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. 
and 5 p.m. each broadcast day at approximately one hour intervals during 
each time period. Television stations which do not begin their broadcast 
day before 9 a.m. shall make these identifications in the hours closest 
to these time periods at the specified intervals.
    (b) Licensees of television translators whose station identification 
is made by the television station whose signals are being rebroadcast by 
the translator, must secure agreement with this television station 
licensee to keep in its file, and available to FCC personnel, the 
translator's call letters and location, giving the name, address and 
telephone number of the licensee or his service representative to be 
contacted in the event of malfunction of the translator. It shall be the 
responsibility of the translator licensee to furnish current information 
to the television station licensee for this purpose.
    (c) A low power TV station shall comply with the station 
identification procedures given in Sec. 73.1201 when locally originating 
programming, as defined by Sec. 74.701(h). The identification procedures 
given in paragraphs (a) and (b) are to be used at all other times.
    (d) Call signs for low power TV and TV translator stations will be 
made up of the initial letter K or W followed by the channel number 
assigned to the station and two additional letters. The use of the 
initial letter generally will follow the pattern used in the broadcast 
service, i.e., stations west of the Mississippi River will be assigned 
an

[[Page 445]]

initial letter K and those east, the letter W. The two letter 
combinations following the channel number will be assigned in order and 
requests for the assignment of the particular combinations of letters 
will not be considered. The channel number designator for Channels 2 
through 9 will be incorporated in the call sign as a 2-digit number, 
i.e., 02, 03, . . . ., so as to avoid similarities with call signs 
assigned to amateur radio stations.
    (e) Low power TV permittees or licensees may request that they be 
assigned four-letter call signs in lieu of the five-character alpha-
numeric call signs described in paragraph (d) of this section. Parties 
requesting four-letter call signs are to follow the procedures 
delineated in Sec. 73.3550. Such four-letter call signs shall begin with 
K or W; stations West of the Mississippi River will be assigned an 
initial letter K and stations east of the Mississippi River will be 
assigned an initial letter W. The four-letter call sign will be followed 
by the suffix ``-LP.'' A party holding a low power TV construction 
permit who requests a four-letter call sign must file with that request 
a certification that the station has been constructed, that physical 
construction is underway at the transmitter site or that a firm 
equipment order has been placed.
    (f) TV broadcast booster station shall be identified by their 
primary stations by broadcasting of the primary station's call letters 
and location in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 73.1201 of this 
chapter.

simultaneous or subsequent retransmission of such programs or signals 
for direct reception by the general public.
    (b) The licensee of a low power TV or TV translator station shall 
not rebroadcast the programs of any other TV broadcast station or other 
station authorized under the provisions of this Subpart without 
obtaining prior consent of the station whose signals or programs are 
proposed to be retransmitted. The FCC shall be notified of the call 
letters of each station rebroadcast and the licensee of the low power TV 
or TV broadcast translator station shall certify that written consent 
has been obtained from the licensee of the station whose programs are 
retransmitted.
    (c) A TV translator station may rebroadcast only programs and 
signals that are simultaneously transmitted by a TV broadcast station.
    (d) A TV booster station may rebroadcast only programs and signals 
that are simultaneously transmitted by the primary station to which it 
is authorized.

Sec. 74.803  Frequency selection to avoid interference.

    (a) Where two or more low power auxiliary licensees need to operate 
in the same area, the licensees shall endeavor to select frequencies or 
schedule operation in such manner as to avoid mutual interference. If a 
mutually satisfactory arrangement cannot be reached, the Commission 
shall be notified and it will specify the frequency or frequencies to be 
employed by each licensee.
    (b) The selection of frequencies in the bands allocated for TV 
broadcasting for use in any area shall be guided by the need to avoid 
interference to TV broadcast reception. In these bands, low power 
auxiliary station usage is secondary to TV broadcasting and land mobile 
stations operating in the UHF-TV spectrum and must not cause harmful 
interference. If such interference occurs, low power auxiliary station 
operation must immediately cease and may not be resumed until the 
interference problem has been resolved.

Sec. 74.831  Scope of service and permissible transmissions.

    The license for a low power auxiliary station authorizes the 
transmission of cues and orders to production personnel and participants 
in broadcast programs and motion pictures and in the preparation 
therefor, the transmission of program material by means of a wireless 
microphone worn by a performer and other participants in a program or 
motion picture during rehearsal and during the actual broadcast, 
filming, or recording, or the transmission of comments, interviews, and 
reports from the scene of a remote broadcast. Low power auxiliary 
stations operating in the 944-952 MHz band may, in addition, transmit 
synchronizing signals and various control signals to portable or hand-
carried TV cameras which employ low power radio signals in lieu of cable 
to deliver picture signals to the control point at the scene of a remote 
broadcast.

<R05>
Sec. 74.832  Licensing requirements and procedures.

    (a) A license authorizing operation of one or more low power 
auxiliary stations will be issued only to the following:
    (1) A licensee of an AM, FM, TV, or International broadcast station 
or low power TV station. Low power auxiliary stations will be licensed 
for used with a specific broadcast or low power TV station or 
combination of stations licensed to the same licensee within the same 
community.
    (2) A broadcast network entity.
    (3) A cable television system operator who operates a cable system 
that produces program material for origination or access cablecasting, 
as defined in Sec. 76.5(r).
    (4) Motion picture producers as defined in Sec. 74.801.
    (5) Television program producers as defined in Sec. 74.801.
    (6) Licensees and conditional licensees of stations in the 
Multipoint Distribution Service and Multichannel Multipoint Distribution 
Service as defined in Sec. 21.2 of this chapter, or entities that hold 
an executed lease agreement with an MDS or MMDS licensee or conditional 
licensee or with an Instructional Television Fixed Service licensee or 
permittee.
    (b) An application for a new or renewal of low power auxiliary 
license shall specify the frequency band or bands desired. Only those 
frequency bands necessary for satisfactory operation shall be requested.
    (c) Licensees of AM, FM, TV, and International broadcast stations; 
low power TV stations; and broadcast network entities may be authorized 
to operate low power auxiliary stations in the frequency bands set forth 
in Sec. 74.802(a).
    (d) Cable television operations, motion picture and television 
program producers may be authorized to operate low power auxiliary 
stations only in the bands allocated for TV broadcasting.
    (e) An application for low power auxiliary stations or for a change 
in an existing authorization shall specify the broadcast station, 
combination of such stations, or the network with which the low power 
broadcast auxiliary facilities are to be principally used as given in 
paragraph (h) of this section; or it shall specify the motion picture or 
television production company or the cable television operator with 
which the low power broadcast auxiliary facilities are to be solely 
used. A single application, filed in duplicate on FCC Form 313 may be 
used in applying for the authority to operate one or more low power 
auxiliary units. The application must specify the number of units to be 
operated and the frequency bands which will be used. Motion picture 
producers, television program producers, and cable television operators 
are required to attach a single sheet to their application form 
explaining in detail the manner in which the eligibility requirements 
given in paragraph (a) of this section are met.
    (f) Applications for the use of the bands allocated for TV 
broadcasting must specify the usual area of operation within which the 
low power auxiliary station will be used. This area of operation may, 
for example, be specified as the metropolitan area in which the 
broadcast licensee serves, or the usual area within which motion picture 
and television producers are operating. Because low power auxiliary 
stations operating in these bands will only be permitted in areas 
removed from existing co-channel TV broadcast stations, licensees have 
full responsibility to ensure that operation of their stations does not 
occur at distances less than those specified in Sec. 74.802(b).
    (g) Low power auxiliary licenses will specify the minimum and 
maximum number of units that may be operated as follows: from 1 to 5 
stations; from 4 to 12 stations; from 10 to 24 stations; from 20 to 50 
stations; 45 or more stations.
    (h) For broadcast licensees, low power auxiliary stations will be 
licensed for use with a specific broadcast station or combination of 
broadcast stations licensed to the same licensee and to the same 
community. Licensing of low power auxiliary stations for use with a 
specific broadcast station or combination of such stations does not 
preclude their use with other broadcast stations of the same or a 
different licensee at any location. Operation of low power auxiliary 
stations outside

[[Page 448]]

the area of operation specified in the authorization, or in other bands 
is permitted without further authority of the Commission. However, 
operation of low power auxiliary stations shall, at all times, be in 
accordance with the requirements of Sec. 74.882 of this subpart. Also, a 
low power auxiliary station that is being used with a broadcast station 
or network other than one with which it is licensed, must, in addition 
to meeting the requirements of Sec. 74.861 of this subpart, not cause 
harmful interference to another low power auxiliary station which is 
being used with the broadcast station(s) or network with which it is 
licensed.
    (i) In case of permanent discontinuance of operation of a station 
licensed under this subpart, the licensee shall forward the station 
license to the Federal Communications Commission, Broadcast Auxiliary 
Radio Services, 1270 Fairfield Road, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania 17325 for 
cancellation.
    (j) The license shall be retained in the licensee's files at the 
address shown on the authorization, posted at the transmitter, or posted 
at the control point of the station.

    (b) Instructional Television Fixed Stations authorized to operate on 
Channels 2650-2656, 2662-2668, and 2674-

[[Page 452]]

2680 MHz as of July 16, 1971, may continue to operate on a coequal basis 
with other stations operating in accordance with the Table of Frequency 
Allocations. Requests for subsequent renewals or modification of 
existing licenses will be considered; however, expansion of systems 
comprised of such stations will not be permitted except on frequencies 
allocated for the service.
    (c) Channels 2596-2602, 2602-2608, 2608-2614, 2614-2620, 2620-2626, 
2626-2632, 2632-2638, and 2638-2644 MHz and the corresponding response 
channels listed in Sec. 74.939(d) are shared with the Multipoint 
Distribution Service. No new Instructional Television Fixed Service 
applications for these channels filed after May 25, 1983 will be 
accepted. In those areas where Multipoint Distribution Service use of 
these channels is allowed pursuant to Sec. 21.902, Instructional 
Television Fixed Service users of these channels will continue to be 
afforded protection from harmful cochannel and adjacent channel 
interference from Multipoint Distribution Service stations.
    (d)(1) A licensee is limited to the assignment of no more than four 
channels for use in a single area of operation, all of which should be 
selected from the same Group listed in paragraph (a) of this section. An 
area of operation is defined as the area 20 miles or less from the ITFS 
transmitter. Applicants shall not apply for more channels than they 
intend to construct within a reasonable time, simply for the purpose of 
reserving additional channels. The number of channels authorized to an 
applicant will be based on the demonstration of need for the number of 
channels requested. The Commission will take into consideration such 
factors as the amount of use of any currently assigned channels and the 
amount of proposed use of each channel requested, the amount of, and 
justification for, any repetition in the schedules, and the overall 
demand and availability of ITFS channels in the community. For those 
applicant organizations formed for the purpose of serving accredited 
institutional or governmental organizations, evaluation of the need will 
only consider service to those specified receive sites which submitted 
supporting documentation pursuant to Sec. 74.932(a)(4).
    (2) An applicant leasing excess capacity and proposing a schedule 
which complies in all respects with the requirements of Section 
74.931(e) will have presumptively demonstrated need, in accordance with 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, for no more than four channels, all 
part of the same Group listed in paragraph (a) of this section. This 
presumption is rebuttable by demonstrating that the application does not 
propose to comport with our educational programming requirements, that 
is, to transmit some formal educational programming, as defined in 
Section 74.931(a), and to transmit the requisite minimum programming of 
Section 74.931(e) for genuinely educational purposes and to receive 
sites when students are there.
    (e) The same channel may be assigned to more than one station or 
more than one licensee in the same area if the geometric arrangement of 
the transmitting and receiving points or the times of operation are such 
that interference is not likely to occur.
    (f) A temporary fixed ITFS station may use any available ITFS 
channel on a secondary basis. Operation of stations located within 56.3 
km (35 miles) of Canada shall be limited by Sec. 74.24(h)(3).
    (g) Where adjacent channel operation is proposed in any area, the 
preferred location of the proposed station's transmitting antenna is at 
the site of the adjacent channel transmitting antenna. If this is not 
practicable, the adjacent channel transmitting antennas should be 
located as close as reasonably possible.
    (h) On the E and F-channel frequencies, a point-to-point ITFS 
station may be involuntarily displaced by an MDS applicant, conditional 
licensee or licensee, provided that suitable alternative spectrum is 
available and that the MDS entity bears the expenses of the migration. 
Suitability of spectrum will be determined on a case-by-base basis; at a 
minimum, the alternative spectrum must be licensable by ITFS operators 
on a primary basis (although it need not be specifically allocated to 
the ITFS service), and must provide a signal that is equivalent to the 
prior

[[Page 453]]

signal in picture quality and reliability, unless the ITFS licensee will 
accept an inferior signal. Potential expansion of the ITFS licensee may 
be considered in determining whether alternative available spectrum is 
suitable.
    (i) If suitable alternative spectrum is located pursuant to 
paragraph (h) of this section, the initiating party must prepare and 
file the appropriate application for the new spectrum, and must 
simultaneously serve a copy of the application on the ITFS licensee to 
be moved. The initiating party will be responsible for all costs 
connected with the migration, including purchasing, testing and 
installing new equipment, labor costs, reconfiguration of existing 
equipment, administrative costs, legal and engineering expenses 
necessary to prepare and file the migration application, and other 
reasonable documented costs. The initiating party must secure a bond or 
establish an escrow account to cover reasonable incremental increase in 
ongoing expenses that may fall upon the migrated licensee. The bond or 
escrow account should also account for the possibility that the 
initiating party subsequently becomes bankrupt. If it becomes necessary 
for the Commission to assess the sufficiency of a bond or escrow amount, 
it will take into account such factors as projected incremental increase 
in electricity or maintenance expenses, or relocation expenses, as 
relevant in each case.
    (j) The ITFS party to be moved will have a 60-day period in which to 
oppose the involuntary migration. The ITFS party should state its 
opposition to the migration with specificity, including engineering and 
other challenges, and a comparison of the present site and the proposed 
new site. If involuntary migration is granted, the new facilities must 
be operational before the initiating party will be permitted to begin 
its new or modified operations. The migration must not disrupt the ITFS 
licensee's provision of service, and the ITFS licensee has the right to 
inspect the construction or installation work.

Sec. 74.903  Interference.

    (a) Since interference in this service will occur only when an 
unfavorable desired-to-undesired signal ratio exists at the antenna 
input terminals of the affected receiver, the directive properties of 
receiving antennas can be used to minimize the hazard of such 
interference. Interference may also be controlled through the use of 
directive transmitting antennas, geometric arrangement of transmitters 
and receivers, and the use of the minimum power required to provide the 
needed service. Harmful interference will be considered present when the 
reference receiving antenna is oriented to receive the maximum desired 
signal, and a free space calculation determines that the desired-to-
undesired signal ratio is less than the value specified for the 
respective channel under consideration.
    (1) Cochannel interference is defined as the ratio of the desired 
signal to the undesired signal, at the antenna input terminals of the 
affected receiver, when the ratio is less than 45 dB.
    (2) Adjacent channel interference is defined as the ratio of the 
desired signal to undesired signal present in an adjacent channel, at 
the output of a reference receiving antenna oriented to receive the 
maximum desired signal level. Harmful interference will be considered 
present when a free space calculation determines that this ratio is less 
than 0 dB. In the alternative, harmful interference will be considered 
present for an Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS) station 
constructed before May 26, 1983, when a free space calculation 
determines that this ratio is less than 10 dB, unless the individual 
receive site under consideration has been subsequently upgraded with up-
to-date reception equipment,

[[Page 454]]

in which case the ratio shall be less than 0 dB, or unless the license 
for an ITFS station is conditioned on the proffer to the affected ITFS 
station licensee of equipment capable of providing a ratio of 0 dB or 
more at no expense to the affected ITFS station licensee, and also 
conditioned, if necessary, on installation of such equipment, absent a 
showing by the affected ITFS station licensee demonstrating good cause 
and that the proposed equipment will not provide a ratio of 0 dB or more 
or that installation of such equipment, at no expense to the ITFS 
station licensee, is not possible. Absent information presented to the 
contrary, the Commission will assume that reception equipment 
installation occurred simultaneously with original station equipment.
    (3) For purposes of this section, all interference calculations 
involving receive antenna performance shall use the reference antenna 
characteristics shown in Figure 1, of Sec. 74.937(a) or, in the 
alternative, utilize the actual pattern characteristics of the antenna 
in use at the receive site under study. If the actual receive antenna 
pattern is utilized, the applicant must submit complete details 
including manufacturer, model number(s), co-polar and cross-polar gain 
patterns, and other pertinent data.
    (4) If an application can demonstrate that the installation of a 
receiving antenna at an existing licensee's site with characteristics 
superior to those of the standard antenna (or, alternatively, the 
appropriate existing antenna in use at the site) will permit the 
applicant to provide service without interference to the existing 
licensee, the application will be considered grantable with the 
condition that the applicant bears all costs of upgrading the existing 
licensee's reception equipment at that site(s). Such a showing should 
include interference calculations for both the existing or reference 
antenna and the proposed antenna. The manufacturer, model number(s), co-
polar and cross-polar gain patterns of the replacement antenna should be 
supplied as well as an accurate assessment of the expected reimbursement 
costs.
    (5) No receive site more than 35 miles from the transmitter shall be 
entitled to interference protection.
    (b) All applicants for instructional television fixed stations are 
expected to take full advantage of such directive antenna techniques to 
prevent interference to the reception of any existing operational fixed, 
multichannel multipoint distribution, international control or 
instructional television fixed station at authorized receiving 
locations. Therefore, all applications for new or major changes must 
include an analysis of potential interference to all existing and 
previously proposed stations in accordance with Sec. 74.903(a). An 
applicant for a new instructional television fixed station or for 
changes in an existing ITFS facility for a construction permit must 
include the following technical information with the application:
    (1) An analysis of the potential for harmful cochannel interference 
with any authorized or previously proposed station if:
    (i) The proposed transmitting antenna has an unobstructed electrical 
path to receive sites(s) of any other station(s) that utilize(s), or 
would utilize, the same frequency, or
    (ii) The proposed transmitter is within 80.5 km (50 miles) of the 
coordinates of any such station.
    (2) An analysis of the potential for harmful adjacent channel 
interference with any authorized or previously proposed station(s) if 
the proposed transmitter is within 80.5 km (50 miles) of the coordinates 
of any other station(s) that utilize(s), or would utilize, an adjacent 
channel frequency.
    (3) An analysis concerning possible adverse impact upon Mexican and 
Canadian communications if the station's transmitting antenna is to be 
located within 80.5 km (50 miles) of the border.
    (4) In lieu of the interference analyses required by paragraphs 
(b)(1) and (b)(2) of this Section for any authorized or previously 
proposed station(s), an applicant may submit a statement(s) from the 
affected ITFS licensee(s) or permittee(s) that any resulting 
interference is acceptable.

[[Page 455]]

    (5) An analysis of the potential for harmful interference within the 
protected service area, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, of 
any authorized or previously proposed station(s) described in paragraph 
(d) of this section.
    (c) Existing licensees and prospective applicants are expected to 
cooperate fully in attempting to resolve problems of potential 
interference before bringing the matter to the attention of the 
Commission.
    (d) Each authorized or previously-proposed applicant, construction 
permittee, or licensee who proposes to lease excess capacity to a 
``wireless cable'' operator pursuant to Sec. 74.931(e)(2) must be 
protected from harmful electrical interference for the hours of such 
transmissions within a protected service area as defined at 
Sec. 21.902(d) of this chapter. Alternatively, an applicant, permittee, 
or licensee may select a 56.33 km (35 mile) circular protected area 
centered at the geographic latitude and longitude of the transmitting 
antenna site. Applicants are expected to cooperate fully and in good 
faith with an authorized or previously-proposed applicant, construction 
permittee, or licensee who leases or proposes to lease excess capacity 
to a ``wireless cable'' operator pursuant to Sec. 74.931(e)(2), in 
attempting to resolve problems of potential interference to such 
operations before bringing the matter to the attention of the 
Commission.
    (e) Each ITSF applicant, permittee, or licensee who wishes to claim 
the protection described at paragraph (d) of this section must request 
such protection in writing in its initial application for a new station, 
in an application amendment, or by modification application. Such 
protection shall be applied solely with regard to applications filed 
subsequent to the request for a protected service area.
    (f) With respect to protected service area proposals, two 
applications will be regarded as mutually exclusive if they are:
    (1) Submitted during the same filing window;
    (2) Otherwise grantable;
    (3) Mutually exclusive only because either or both applicants 
request a protected service area. However, if an applicant in such a 
situation shows that the resulting interference would occur solely over 
water, the applications will not be considered to be mutually exclusive.

Sec. 74.911  Processing of ITFS station applications.

    (a) Application for ITFS stations are divided into two groups:
    (1) In the first group are applications for new stations or major 
changes in the facilities of authorized stations. These applications are 
subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section. A major 
change for an ITFS station will be any proposal to add new

[[Page 456]]

channels, change from one channel (or channel group) to another, change 
polarization, increase the EIRP in any direction by more than 1.5dB, 
increase the transmitting antenna height by 25 feet or more, or relocate 
a facility's transmitter site by 10 miles or more. However, the 
Commission may, within 15 days after the acceptance of an application, 
or 15 days after the acceptance of any other application for 
modification of facilities, advise the applicant that such application 
is considered to be one for a major change, and subject to the 
provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) The second group consists of applications for licenses and all 
other changes in the facilities of authorized stations.
    (b) A new file number will be assigned to an application for a new 
station or for major changes in the facilities of an authorized station, 
when it is amended so as to effect a major change, as defined in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this Section, or result in a situation where the 
original party or parties to the application do not retain control of 
the applicant as originally filed. An application for change in the 
facilities of any existing station will continue to carry the same file 
number even though (pursuant to Commission approval) an assignment of 
license or transfer of control of such licensee or permittee has taken 
place if, upon consummation, the application is amended to reflect the 
new ownership.
    (c)(1) New and major change applications for ITFS stations will be 
accepted only on dates specified by the Commission. Filing periods will 
be designated by the Commission in a Public Notice, to be released not 
fewer than 60 days before the commencement of the filing period. 
Qualified parties will have no fewer than 5 business days within which 
to submit their applications. After termination of the filing period, 
the Commission shall release a Public Notice with a list of applications 
filed in the window and provide no fewer than 30 days for the submission 
of petitions to deny. Uncontested applications that are not mutually 
exclusive with any other application or licensed facility, and are found 
to be acceptable, shall be granted. Mutually exclusive applications 
shall be evaluated pursuant to the comparative selection process set 
forth in Sec. 74.913 as herein amended.
    (2) The requirements of this section apply to a wireless cable 
entity requesting to be licensed on ITFS frequency pursuant to 
Sec. 74.990. The application of such a wireless cable entity shall be 
included in the Public Notice released after the termination of the 
filing period.
    (d) Those applications, other than mutually exclusive applications, 
which upon examination meet other pertinent requirements and would serve 
the public interest, convenience and necessity will be granted. Mutually 
exclusive applications will be processed pursuant to the provisions in 
Sec. 74.913.

[50 FR 26759, June 28, 1985, as amended at 55 FR 46013, Oct. 31, 1990; 
60 FR 20247, Apr. 25, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 74.912  Petitions to deny.

    (a) Any party in interest may file with the Commission a petition to 
deny any application for new facilities or major changes in the 
facilities of authorized stations, provided such petitions are filed by 
the date established pursuant to the cut-off provisions of 
Sec. 74.911(c). In the case of all other applications, except those 
excluded under section 309(c) of the Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended, petitions to deny must be filed not later than 30 days after 
issuance of a public notice of the acceptance for filing of the 
applications. In the case of applications for renewal of license, 
petitions to deny may be filed after the issuance of a public notice of 
acceptance for filing of the applications and up until the first day of 
the last full calendar month of the expiring license term.
    (b) The applicant file an opposition to any petition to deny, and 
the petitioner a reply to such opposition in which allegations of fact 
or denials thereof shall be supported by affidavit of a person or 
persons with personal knowledge thereof. The times for filing such 
oppositions and replies shall be those provided in Sec. 1.45 of this 
chapter.
    (c) Only petitions to deny filed against a tentative selectee 
(Sec. 74.913) will be considered. If the petition does not present 
substantial and material

[[Page 457]]

questions of fact warranting a hearing, the petition will be denied and 
the tentative selectee will be granted a license where, upon 
examination, the Mass Media Bureau finds that other pertinent 
requirements have been met and the public interest, convenience and 
necessity would be served. Where necessary, the points of the 
application will be modified to comport with any findings made as a 
result of the review. In the event that the tentative selectee's 
application is denied or its point total reduced, the point system 
process will be repeated, where necessary, to determine the tentative 
selectee or applicants qualifying for the random tie-breaker. If, upon 
examination, a substantial and material question of fact is found and 
the Bureau is unable to find that the public interest, convenience and 
necessity will be served by granting the application of the tentative 
selectee pursuant to the point system, its application will be 
designated for hearing pursuant to section 309 of the Communications Act 
of 1934, as amended. Petitions for reconsideration, motions to stay, or 
applications for review may be submitted at the time the Bureau grants 
or denies the application of the tentative selectee pursuant to the 
filing periods specified in Sec. 1.45 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 74.913  Selection procedure for mutually exclusive ITFS applications.

    (a) If timely filed ITFS applications are determined to be mutually 
exclusive, such applications will be processed and assessed points to 
determine the tentative selectee for the particular channels. The 
tentative selectee will be the applicant with the highest point total 
under the procedure set forth in this section, unless the provisions of 
paragraph (c) of this section apply, and will be awarded the requested 
channels if the Commission concludes that such an award will serve the 
public interest, convenience and necessity.
    (b) Each application will be awarded a predetermined number of 
points under the criteria listed:
    (1) Four points for applicants that are ``local,'' as defined in 
Sec. 74.932, n.1.
    (2) Three points for accredited schools, or their governing bodies 
applying within their jurisdiction;
    (3) Two points for applicants whose request, if granted, would 
result in the acquisition of four or fewer ITFS channels by that 
applicant within the particular area;
    (4) One point for a proposed weekly schedule of twenty-one or more 
average hours per channel per week of formal educational programming 
(Sec. 74.931(a)), or of forty-one or more average hours per channel per 
week of other ITFS programming; two points for forty-one or more average 
hours per channel per week of formal education programming, or for 
sixty-one or more hours per channel per week of ITFS programming where 
at least twenty-one of those hours are formal educational programming;
    (5) One point for an existing E or F channel licensee seeking to 
relocate and showing an established need for an expanded service that 
cannot be accommodated on its grandfathered E or F facilities. The 
applicant must submit a specific request and adequate supporting 
documentation.
    (c) If the best qualified (highest scoring) two or more applicants 
have the same point accumulation, they will be given thirty days from 
the date of release of such decision to notify the Commission of any 
agreement to divide the use of the channels. If no agreement is reached 
and advanced to the Commission within that time, the tentative selectee 
will then be determined through a tie-breaker mechanism.
    (d) The tie-breaker will operate as follows: each of the tied 
applicants will be directed to submit to the Commission a statement of 
the number of students at its proposed receive locations who are 
formally enrolled in classes for credit toward an academic degree or 
diploma, or a legally required certification or license. It must also 
demonstrate that this claim of students who would benefit from the 
proposed system is supported by the educational programs proposed in its 
application. Each applicant will serve it submission(s) on the other 
tied competing applicant(s), who will have an opportunity to respond to 
any aspect of the

[[Page 458]]

enrollment submissions. If any applicant's system would reach less than 
80% as many students as another applicant's would reach, the application 
which would result in service to the fewer number of students will be 
denied. The application(s) of any remaining applicant(s) will be 
granted. If more than one application is to be granted under this 
procedure, the channels or channel capacity will be divided evenly among 
the remaining applicants. At any time during this process, the 
applicants may advise the Commission that they are negotiating or have 
reached settlement for disposition of the contested facilities, and the 
Commission will withhold further comparative processing upon such 
notification.
    (1) Enrollment will be considered as of the last date of the filing 
window during which the applications were filed, as provided by 
Sec. 74.911(c). Enrollment figures should be the latest available from a 
regular term or session prior to that filing date, and must be taken 
from a statement or submission of data made by the subject school for 
some other official purpose or function, such as a mid-year or year-end 
fiscal report, or a budget proposal, and they must represent actual, not 
projected, student population. Each applicant must identify the 
source(s) from which its submitted enrollment figures are drawn.
    (2) All full- and part-time students formally enrolled in classes 
for credit toward an academic degree or diploma, or a legally required 
certification or license, at any school, campus, or other locations 
listed in the application as a receive site may be counted, except if an 
applicant's system would serve only students in a particular discipline 
(or disciplines) or at a particular grade level (or levels), only 
students in classes and programs within that discipline(s) or grade 
level(s) may be counted.
    (3) For off-campus sites, only students who can be shown to be 
recipients of formal ITFS educational material may be counted.
    (4) Applicants serving students other than their own count only 
students at schools, campuses, and other receive sites which have 
submitted a letter indicating their intention to use the proposed 
service. The validity of such expressions of intention will be judged 
pursuant to Sec. 74.932 of these rules. If several schools from the same 
school system are listed as receive sites, a single letter from an 
appropriate person representing the school board or system will be 
sufficient to demonstrate the intention to use the proposed service at 
each of these receive sites if each receive site's participation is 
specifically acknowledged.
    (5) A receive site not receiving interference protection may not be 
utilized by an applicant for tie-breaking purposes.

    Note 1: Entities entitled to the accreditation points will include 
umbrella organizations whose membership is composed of entities which 
are individually eligible for the points. Also, a state's department of 
education (or equivalent agency) would qualify, as well as any directly 
controlled arm of that department if its specific duties include that 
department's educational function.
    Note 2: Average hours per channel per week are determined by 
totaling the number of scheduled hours per week of programming between 
8:00 a.m and 10:00 p.m. Monday through Saturday in the subject category, 
and dividing that total by the number of channels.
    Note 3: Paragraph (b)(3) of this section does not apply to 
applications for modification of facilities other than the addition of 
channels.
    Note 4: For applications pending as of August 14, 1989, the 
enrollment which will be counted will be the most recent available up to 
August 22, 1989, for which receive sites are on file by that date.

Sec. 74.931  Purpose and permissible service.

    (a)(1) Instructional television fixed stations are intended 
primarily to provide a formal educational and cultural development in 
aural and visual form, to students enrolled in accredited public and 
private schools, colleges and universities. Authorized instructional 
television fixed station channels must be used to transmit formal 
educational programming offered for credit to enrolled students of 
accredited schools, with limited exceptions as set forth in

[[Page 459]]

paragraph (e)(9) of this section and Secs. 74.990 through 74.992.
    (2) All applicants that do not list accredited schools as receive 
sites must name the school(s) and the degree(s) or diploma(s) for which 
the formal programming will be offered and describe the administration 
of the course(s). They must submit documentation, written or signed by 
the authorities responsible for the schools' curricula, verifying each 
of these points.
    (b) Such stations may also be used for the additional purpose of 
transmitting other visual and aural educational, instructional and 
cultural material to selected receiving locations, including in-service 
training and instruction in special skills and safety programs, 
extension of professional training, informing persons and groups engaged 
in professional and technical activities of current developments in 
their particular fields, and other similar endeavors.
    (c) During periods when the circuits provided by these stations are 
not being used for the transmission of instructional and cultural 
material, they may be used for the transmission of material directly 
related to the administrative activities of the licensee such as the 
holding of conferences with personnel, distribution of reports and 
assignments, exchange of data and statistics, and other similar uses. 
Stations will not be licensed in this service solely for the 
transmission of administrative traffic.
    (d) Stations may be licensed in this service as originating or relay 
stations to interconnect instructional television fixed stations in 
adjacent areas, to deliver instructional and cultural material to, and 
obtain such material from, commercial and noncommercial educational 
television broadcast stations for use on the instructional television 
fixed system, and to deliver instructional and cultural material to, and 
obtain such material from, nearby terminals or connection points of 
closed circuit educational television systems employing wired 
distribution systems or radio facilities authorized under other parts of 
this chapter, or to deliver instructional and cultural material to any 
CATV system serving a receiving site or sites which would be eligible 
for direct reception of ITFS signals under the provisions of paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section.
    (e) A licensee may use excess capacity on each channel to transmit 
material other than the ITFS subject matter specified in paragraphs (a), 
(b), (c), and (d) of this section subject to the following conditions:
    (1) If the time or capacity leased is not to be used for ``wireless 
cable'' operations, the licensee must preserve at least 40 hours per 
week, including at least 6 hours per weekday (Monday through Friday), 
excluding holidays and vacation days, for ITFS purposes on that channel. 
The 40-hour preservation may consist of airtime strictly reserved for 
ITFS use and not used for non-ITFS programming, or of time used for non-
ITFS programming but subject to ready recapture by the licensee for ITFS 
use with no economic or operational detriment of the licensee. At least 
20 hours per week of the preserved time on each channel must be used for 
ITFS programming, including at least 3 hours per weekday, excluding 
holidays and vacation days, except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of 
this section. Only ITFS programming and preserved airtime scheduled 
between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. Monday through Saturday, will qualify to meet 
these requirements.
    (2) If the time or capacity leased is to be used for ``wireless 
cable'' operations, before leasing excess capacity on any one channel, 
the licensee must provide at least 20 hours per week of ITFS programming 
on that channel, except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. 
All hours not used for ITFS programming may be leased to a ``wireless 
cable'' operator. An additional 20 hours per week per channel must be 
reserved for recapture by the ITFS licensee for its ITFS programming, 
subject to one year's advance, written notification by the ITFS licensee 
to its ``wireless cable'' lessee. These hours of recapture are not 
restricted as to time of day or day of the week, but may be established 
by negotiations between the ITFS licensee and the ``wireless cable'' 
lessee.
    (3) For the first two years of operation, an ITFS entity may lease 
excess

[[Page 460]]

capacity if it provides ITSF programming at least 12 hours per channel 
per week, including up to four hours of ITFS usage per day.
    (4) The licensee may schedule the ITFS programming and use automatic 
channel switching equipment so as to employ channel mapping technology 
to lease to a ``wireless cable'' operator. However, an ITFS applicant 
should request only as many channel as it needs to fulfill its 
educational requirements.
    (5) All of the capacity available on any subsidiary channel of any 
authorized channel may be used for the transmission of material to be 
used by others.
    (6) When an ITFS licensee makes capacity available on a common 
carrier basis, it will be subject to common carrier regulation. A 
licensee operating as a common carrier is required to apply for the 
appropriate authorization and to comply with all policies and rules 
applicable to that service. Responsibility for making the initial 
determination of whether a particular activity is common carriage rests 
with the ITFS licensee. Initial determinations by the licensees are 
subject to Commission examination and may be reviewed at the 
Commission's discretion.
    (7) An ITFS applicant, permittee, or licensee may use an 
omnidirectional antenna to facilitate the leasing of excess capacity to 
``wireless cable'' operators.
    (8) Leasing activity may not cause unacceptable interference to 
cochannel and adjacent-channel operations.
    (9) A licensee may shift its requisite ITFS programming onto fewer 
than its authorized number of channels, via channel mapping technology 
or channel loading, so that it can lease full-time channel capacity to a 
wireless cable operator, subject to the condition that it provide a 
total average of at least 20 hours per channel per week of ITFS 
programming on its authorized channels. The licensee also retains the 
unabridgeable right to recapture, subject to six months' written 
notification to the wireless cable operator, an average of an additional 
20 hours per channel per week for simultaneous programming on the number 
of channels for which it is authorized. The licensee may agree to the 
transmission of this recapture time on channels not authorized to it, 
but which are included in the wireless system of which it is a part.
    (f) Material transmitted by these stations may be intended for 
simultaneous reception and display or may be recorded by authorized 
users for use at another time.
    (g) On a secondary basis, an ITFS station may be operated as a 
temporary fixed station from temporary unspecified points to an ITFS 
station under the provisions of paragraph (a), (b), (d) or (e) of this 
section.
    (h) Except as specified in paragraphs (i) and (j) of this section, 
no licensee of a station in this service may lease transmission time or 
capacity to any cable television company either directly or indirectly 
through an affiliate owned, operated, controlled by, or under common 
control with the cable television company, if the ITFS main transmitter 
station is within 32 km (20 miles) of the cable television company's 
franchise area or service area, and if the cable television company is 
the sole provider of cable television service in the franchise area.
    (i)(1) A cable television company shall be exempt from the 
provisions of paragraph (h) of this section if its franchise area 
contains none of the following:
    (i) Any incorporated place of 2,500 inhabitants or more, or any part 
thereof;
    (ii) Any unincorporated place of 2,500 inhabitants or more, or any 
part thereof; or
    (iii) Any other territory, incorporated or unincorporated, included 
in an urbanized area.
    (2) All population statistics and definitions used in qualifying for 
this exemption shall be the most recent available from the U.S. 
Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census. In no event shall any 
statistics resulting from censuses prior to 1980 be used. The Census 
Bureau has defined some incorporated places of 2,500 inhabitants or more 
as ``extended cities.'' Such cities consist of an urban part and rural 
part.
    (3) If the cable operator's franchise area includes a rural part of 
an extended city, but includes no other territory described in this 
paragraph, an exemption shall apply.

[[Page 461]]

    (j) The provisions of paragraph (h) of this section will not apply 
to ITFS excess capacity leased directly or indirectly to cable operators 
or affiliates to provide locally-produced programming to cable headends. 
Locally-produced programming is programming produced in or near the 
cable operator's franchise area and not broadcast on a television 
station available within that franchise area. A cable operator or 
affiliate will be permitted to lease ITFS excess capacity equivalent to 
one MDS channel within 32 km (20 miles) of the cable television 
franchise area or service area for this purpose, and, within 32 km (20 
miles) of the cable television franchise area or service area, no more 
ITFS excess capacity than the equivalent of one MDS channel may be used 
by a cable television company or affiliate pursuant to this paragraph. 
The licensee for a cable operator providing local programming pursuant 
to a lease must include in a notice filed with the Mass Media Bureau a 
cover letter explicitly identifying its lessee as a local cable operator 
or affiliate and stating that the lease was executed to facilitate the 
provision of local programming. The first lease notification for an MDS 
or ITFS channel in an area filed with the Commission will be entitled to 
the exemption. The limitations on the equivalent of one MDS channel per 
party and per area include any cable/ITFS operations grandfathered 
pursuant to paragraph (k) of this section or any cable/MDS operations 
grandfathered pursuant to Sec. 21.912(f) of this chapter. Local 
programming service pursuant to a lease must be provided within one year 
of the date of the lease or one year of the grant of the licensee's 
application for the leased channel(s), whichever is later.
    (k) Lease arrangements between cable and ITFS entities for which a 
lease or a firm agreement was signed prior to February 8, 1990, will not 
be subject to the prohibitions of paragraph (h) of this section. Leases 
between cable television entities and ITFS entities executed on February 
8, 1990, or thereafter, are invalid.

<R05>
Sec. 74.932  Eligibility and licensing requirements.

    (a) With certain limited exceptions set forth in Secs. 74.990 
through 74.992 of this part, a license for an instructional television 
fixed station will be issued only to an accredited institution or to a 
governmental organization engaged in the formal education of enrolled 
students or to a nonprofit organization whose purposes are educational 
and include providing educational and instructional television material 
to such accredited institutions and governmental organizations, and 
which is otherwise qualified under the statutory provisions of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended.
    (1) Only local applicants can file applications and be considered 
for licenses during the local priority period, which extends for one 
year from the effective date of these rules.
    (i) During this local priority period, the existing of any 
outstanding application for ITFS channels by a nonlocal applicant will 
not prevent the filing and/or grant of an application by a local entity 
for those same channels.
    (2) A publicly supported educational institution must be accredited 
by the appropriate state department of education.
    (3) A privately controlled educational institution must be 
accredited by the appropriate state department of education or the 
recognized regional and national accrediting organizations.
    (4) Those applicant organizations whose eligibility is established 
by service to accredited institutional or governmental organizations 
must submit documentation from proposed receive sites demonstrating they 
will receive

[[Page 462]]

and use the applicant's formal educational programming. In place of this 
documentation, a state educational television (ETV) commission may 
demonstrate that the public schools it proposes to serve are required to 
use its proposed formal educational programming.
    (5) Nonlocal applicants, in addition to submitting letters from 
proposed receive sites, must demonstrate the establishment of a local 
program committee in each community where they apply.
    (b) No numerical limit is placed on the number of stations which may 
be licensed to a single licensee. However, individual licensees will be 
governed by the limitations of Secs. 74.902 and 74.990(d) of this part 
as to the number of channels which may be used. A single license may be 
issued for more than one transmitter if they are to be located at a 
common site and operated by the same licensee. Applicants are expected 
to accomplish the proposed operation by the use of the smallest number 
of channels required to provide the needed service.
    (c) An application for a new instructional television fixed station 
or for changes in the facilities of an existing station shall specify 
the location of the transmitter, all proposed receiving installations, 
response transmitters, and any relay transmitters which will be under 
the control of or will be equipped for reception by the applicant. If 
reception is also intended at unspecified locations, i.e., if power is 
deliberately radiated to locations or areas so that voluntary reception 
will be possible, the applications shall include a complete statement as 
to the purpose of such additional reception.
    (d) In case of permanent discontinuance of operation of a station 
licensed under this subpart, authority to operate is forfeited and the 
licensee shall forward the station license to the Commission for 
cancellation. For the purposes of this section, a station which is not 
operated for a period of one year is considered to have been permanently 
discontinued. If use of a channel(s) is discontinued, authority to 
operate on such channel(s) is forfeited and an application for 
modification shall be filed to delete such channel(s).
    (e) No receive site more than 35 miles from the transmitter site 
shall be used to establish basic eligibility.

    Note 1: A ``local'' licensee (or applicant) is an institution or 
organization that is physically located in the community, or 
metropolitan area, where service is proposed. For a college or 
university, this would include any area where it has a campus. An 
educational organization will generally be regarded as ``local'' if the 
address of the organization's headquarters is located within the area 
where the facility is sought. An entity created by a state or local 
government for the purpose of serving formal educational needs will be 
considered ``local'' throughout the area within the government's 
jurisdiction over which its authority is intended to extend. An 
educational entity located within a state and created by affiliated 
educational institutions within that state, including hospitals, will be 
considered ``local'' in those areas where the member institutions are 
located.


    Note 2: Documentation from proposed receive sites which are to 
establish the eligibility of an entity not serving its own enrolled 
students for credit should be in letter form, written and signed by an 
administrator or authority who is responsible for the receive site's 
curriculum planning. The administrator must indicate that the 
applicant's program offerings have been viewed and that such programming 
will be incorporated in the site's curriculum. The letter should discuss 
the types of programming and hours per week of formal and informal 
programming expected to be used and the site's involvement in the 
planning, scheduling and production of programming. If other levels of 
authority must be obtained before a firm commitment to utilize the 
service can be made, the nature and extent of such additional 
authorization(s) must be provided.


    Note 3: Letters submitted on behalf of a nonlocal entity must 
confirm that a member of the receive site's staff will serve on the 
local program committee and demonstrate a recognition of the composition 
and power of the committee. The letter should show that the staff member 
will aid in the selection, scheduling and production of the programming 
received over the system.

<R05>
Sec. 74.934  Unattended operation.

    Unattended operation of licensed ITFS stations is permitted without 
further authority.
    (a) An unattended relay station may be employed to receive and 
retransmit signals of another station provided that the transmitter is 
equipped with circuits which permit it to radiate only when the signal 
intended to be retransmitted is present at the receiver input terminals.

[52 FR 3806, Feb. 6, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 74.935  Power limitations.

    (a) The maximum equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) of a 
transmitter station in this service shall not exceed 2000 watts (33 dBW) 
except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) If a station uses a transmitting antenna with a non-
omnidirectional horizontal plane radiation pattern, the maximum 
equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) in dBW in a given 
direction shall be determined by the following formula:

EIRP=33 dBW+10 log (360/beamwidth) [where 10 log (360/beamwidth) 
          <ls-thn-eq>6 dB].

Beamwidth is the total horizontal plane beamwidth of the transmitting 
antenna system in degrees, measured at the half-power points.
    (c) An increase in station transmitter power, above currently-
authorized or previously-proposed values, to the maximum values provided 
in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, may be authorized, if an 
applicant demonstrates that the requested power increase will not cause 
harmful interference to any authorized or previously-proposed co-channel 
or adjacent-channel station with a transmitter site within 80.5 km (50 
miles) of the applicant's transmitter site, or if an applicant 
demonstrates that:
    (1) A station, that must be protected from interference, potentially 
could suffer interference that would be eliminated by increasing the 
power of the interfered-with station; and
    (2) That the interfered-with station may increase its own power 
consistent with the rules; and
    (3) The applicant requesting authorization of a power increase 
agrees to pay all expenses associated with the increase in power to the 
interfered-with station.
    (d) For television transmission, the peak power of the accompanying 
aural signal must not exceed 10 percent of the peak visual power of the 
transmitter. The Commission may order a reduction in aural signal power 
to diminish the potential for harmful interference.

[55 FR 46013, Oct. 31, 1990, as amended at 58 FR 44951, Aug. 25, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 74.936  Emissions and bandwidth.

    (a) An instrutional television fixed station shall normally employ 
amplitude modulation (A5) for the transmission of the visual signal and 
frequency modulation (F3) for the transmission of the aural signal.
    (b) On or after November 1, 1991, the maximum out-of-band power of a 
transmitter operating in this service shall be attenuated 38 dB relative 
to the peak visual carrier at the channel edges and constant slope 
attenuation from this level to 60 dB relative to the peak visual carrier 
at 1 MHz below the lower band edge and 0.5 MHz above the upper band 
edge. All out-of-band emissions extending beyond these frequencies shall 
be attenuated at least 60 dB below the peak visual carrier power. 
However, should interference occur as a result of emissions outside the 
assigned channel, additional attenuation may be required. A transmitter 
licensed prior to November 1, 1991, that remains at the station site 
initially licensed, and does not comply with this paragraph, may 
continue to be used for its life if it does not cause harmful 
interference to the operation of any other licensee. Any non-conforming 
transmitter replaced after November 1, 1991, shall be replaced by a 
transmitter meeting the requirements of this paragraph.
    (c) The requirements of Sec. 73.687(c)(2) of this chapter will be 
considered to be satisfied insofar as measurements of

[[Page 464]]

operating power are concerned if the transmitter is equipped with 
instruments for determining the combined visual and aural operating 
power. However, licensees are expected to maintain the operating powers 
within the limits specified in Sec. 74.935 of this part. Measurements of 
the separate visual and aural operating powers must be made at 
sufficiently frequent intervals to insure compliance with the rules, and 
in no event less than once a month.
    (d) As a further exception to the other requirements of this 
section, transmitting equipment characteristics may vary from these 
requirements to the extent necessary to insure that transmitted 
information is not likely to be received in intelligible form by 
unauthorized subscribers or licensees, provided such variations permit 
recovery of the transmitted information without perceptible degradation 
as compared to the same information transmitted without such variations.

<R05>
Sec. 74.937  Antennas.

    (a) In order to minimize the hazard of harmful interference from 
other stations, directive receiving antennas should be used at all 
receiving locations. The choice of receiving antennas is left to the 
discretion of the licensee. However, for the purpose of interference 
calculations, the general characteristics of the reference receiving 
antenna shown in Figure 1 of this section (i.e., a 0.6 meter (2 foot) 
parabolic reflector antenna) are assumed to be used in accordance with 
the provisions of Sec. 74.903(a)(3) unless pertinent data is submitted 
of the actual antenna in use at the receive site. Licensees may install 
receiving antennas with general characteristics superior to those of the 
reference receive antenna. Nevertheless, should interference occur and 
it can be demonstrated by an applicant that the existing antenna at the 
receive site is inappropriate, a more suitable yet practical receiving 
antenna should be installed. In such cases, the modification of the 
receive site will be in the discretion, and will be the responsibility, 
of the licensee serving the site.

[[Page 465]]

[[Page 466]]

    (b) Directive transmitting antennas shall be used whenever feasible 
so as to minimize interference to other licensees. The radiation pattern 
shall be designed to minimize radiation in directions where no reception 
is intended. When an ITFS station is used for point-to-point service, an 
appropriate directional antenna must be used.
    (c) The use of elevated receiving antennas is preferable to the use 
of elevated transmitting antennas or greater power to provide the 
desired service.
    (d) The use of vertical or horizontal plane polarization or right-
hand or left-hand rotating (circular) polarization may be used to 
minimize the hazard of harmful interference between systems. The 
Commission reserves the right to specify the polarization to be used.
    (e) The power gain compared to an isotropic antenna and the 
directive properties of the transmitting and receiving antennas proposed 
to be employed, as well as the geometric distribution of the 
transmitting and receiving points, shall be supplied with each 
application for a new ITFS fixed station or for changes in the antenna 
facilities of an existing station.

Sec. 74.938  Transmission standards.

    The width of an ITFS channel is 6 MHz. ITFS transmitters must be 
type accepted by the Commission for the particular visual and aural 
signals that will be employed in actual operation. Either the 
manufacturer or the licensee must obtain transmitter type acceptance for 
the transmitter by filing a application for type acceptance with 
appropriate information concerning the signal waveforms and 
measurements.

<R05>
Sec. 74.939  Special rules governing ITFS response stations.

    (a) An ITFS response station is authorized to provide communication 
by voice and/or data signals with its associated instructional 
television fixed station for use in instructional or computer-assisted 
communications. Other communications concerning the technical operation 
of the system may be carried on when necessary.
    (b) An ITFS response station may be operated only by the licensee of 
an instructional television fixed station and only at an authorized 
receiving location of the instructional television fixed station with 
which it communicates. More than one ITFS response station may be 
operated at the same or different locations by the same licensee. An 
application for authority to operate a new or modified response station 
shall be filed with the Commission in Washington, DC, on FCC Form 330. 
Section VI of that form shall supply the following information for each 
response station:
    (1) The name of the school or other description of the building in 
which the ITFS response station will be located, the address, and the 
geographic coordinates of the ITFS response station transmitting 
antenna.
    (2) The manufacturer's name, type number, operating frequency, and 
power output of the proposed ITFS response station transmitter.
    (3) The type of transmitting antenna, power gain, and azimuthal 
orientation of the major lobe of radiation in degrees measured clockwise 
from True North.
    (4) A sketch giving pertinent details of the ITFS response station 
transmitting antenna installation including ground elevation of the 
transmitter site above mean sea level; overall height above ground, 
including appurtenances, of any ground-mounted tower or mast on which 
the transmitting antenna will be mounted or, if the tower or mast is or

    (e) Transmitter power output will normally be limited to no more 
than 250 milliwatts. Upon a special showing of need, transmitter power 
output of up to 2 watts may be permitted.
    (f) An ITFS response channel is 125 kHz wide and is centered at the 
assigned frequency. Either amplitude or frequency modulation can be 
employed. If amplitude modulation is used, the carrier shall not be 
modulated in excess of 100%. If frequency modulation is used, the 
deviation shall not exceed <plus-minus>25 kHz. Any emissions outside the 
channel including harmonics shall be attenuated at least 60 dB below 
peak output power. Greater attenuation may be required if interference 
is caused by out-of-channel emissions.
    (g) The unmodulated carrier frequency shall be maintained within 35 
kHz of the assigned frequency at all times. Adequate means shall be 
provided to insure compliance with this rule.
    (h) A directive transmitting antenna shall be employed, oriented 
toward the transmitter site of the associated instructional television 
fixed station. The beamwidth between half power points shall not exceed 
15 deg. and radiation in any minor lobe of the antenna radiation pattern 
shall be at least 20 dB below the power in the main lobe of radiation.
    (i) The transmitter of an ITFS response station may be operated 
unattended. The overall performance of the ITFS response station 
transmitter shall be checked as often as necessary to ensure that it is 
functioning in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's 
rules. The licensee of an ITFS response station is responsible for the 
proper operation of the transmitter at all times. The transmitter shall 
be installed and protected in such manner as to prevent tampering or 
operation by unauthorized persons.
    (j) The transmitting apparatus employed at ITFS response stations 
shall have received type acceptance in accordance with Sec. 74.952.
    (k) An ITFS response station shall be operated only when engaged in 
communication with its associated instructional television fixed station 
or for necessary equipment or system tests and adjustments. Radiation of 
an unmodulated carrier and other unnecessary transmissions are 
forbidden.

Sec. 74.950  Equipment performance and installation.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the requirements 
of

[[Page 468]]

Sec. 73.687 of this chapter regarding the installation and performance 
of television broadcast transmitters and associated equipment shall 
apply to instructional television fixed stations.
    (b) The overall attenuation characteristics of the transmitter may 
vary from those specified in Sec. 73.687 of this chapter, provided that 
the provisions of Sec. 74.936 of this part are met. However, care should 
be exercised in the adjustment of the transmitter to insure correct 
overall response of the transmitter for proper transmission of the upper 
and vestigial lower sideband.
    (c) The provisions of Sec. 74.961 in lieu of Sec. 73.687(c)(1) of 
this chapter apply with respect to the frequency tolerance for the 
visual carrier.
    (d) The provisions of Sec. 74.936 in lieu of Sec. 73.687(i)(1) of 
this chapter apply with respect to spurious emissions and radio 
frequency harmonics.
    (e) The requirements of Sec. 73.687(c)(2) of this chapter will be 
considered to be met insofar as measurements of operating power are 
concerned, if the transmitter is equipped with instruments for 
determining the combined visual and aural operating power. However, 
licensees are expected to maintain the operating powers within the 
limits specified in the rules of this part. Measurements of the separate 
visual and aural operating powers should be made at sufficiently 
frequent intervals to ensure compliance with the rules.
    (f) Transmitting apparatus (translators and boosters) used solely 
for relaying signals received from other ITFS stations and operating in 
the manner described in Sec. 74.934(a)(2) shall meet the following 
requirements before being type accepted by the Commission.
    (1) The frequency converter and associated amplifiers shall be so 
designed that the electrical characteristics of a standard television 
signal introduced into the input terminals will not be significantly 
altered by passage through the apparatus except as to frequency and 
amplitude. The overall response of the apparatus within its assigned 
channel when operating at its rated power output and measured at the 
output terminals, shall provide a smooth curve, varying within limits 
separated by no more than 4 dB: Provided, however, That means may be 
provided to reduce the amplitude of the aural carrier below those 
limits, if necessary to prevent intermodulation which would mar the 
quality of the retransmitted picture or result in emissions outside of 
the assigned channel.
    (2) The suppression of emissions appearing outside of the assigned 
channel shall comply with Sec. 74.936(b) and (c).
    (3) The local oscillator employed in the frequency converter shall 
maintain its operating frequency within 0.02 percent of its rated 
frequency when subjected to variations in ambient temperature between 
minus 30 deg. and plus 50 deg. centigrade and variations in powerline 
voltage between 85 percent and 115 percent of the rated supply voltage.
    (4) The apparatus shall contain automatic circuits which will 
maintain peak visual power output constant within 2 dB when the strength 
of the input signal is varied over a range of 30 dB and which will not 
permit the peak visual power output to exceed the maximum rated power 
output under any conditions. If a manual adjustment is provided to 
compensate for different average signal strengths, provision shall be 
made for determining the proper setting for the control. If improper 
adjustment of the control could result in improper operation a label 
bearing a suitable warning shall be affixed at the adjustment control: 
Provided, however, That apparatus with an output of 50 milliwatts peak 
visual power per channel or less need not comply with this paragraph, 
provided the equipment is so designed that the rated output power of the 
transmitter cannot be exceeded by more than 3 dB by an increase in the 
input signal.
    (5) The apparatus shall be equipped with automatic controls which 
will place it in a nonradiating condition when no signal is being 
received on the input channel, either due to absence of a transmitted 
signal or failure of the receiving portion of the relay transmitter. In 
the case of equipment (translators or boosters) of 50 milliwatts peak 
visual power per channel or less relaying more than one channel it shall 
be turned off in the absence of the last signal to be relayed. The 
automatic

[[Page 469]]

control may include a time delay feature to prevent interruptions in the 
operation of the relay transmitter caused by fading or other momentary 
failures of the incoming signal.
    (6) The tube(s) or transistor(s) employed in the final radio 
frequency amplifier shall be of the appropriate power rating to provide 
the rated power output of the relay transmitter. The normal operating 
constants for operation at the rated power output shall be specified. 
The apparatus shall be equipped with suitable meters or meter jacks so 
that appropriate voltage and current measurements may be made while the 
apparatus is in operation.
    (7) Boosters used in this service shall comply with all the 
provisions of this paragraph except with paragraph (f)(3). However, in 
addition, the isolation between the input and output circuits of the 
booster, including the receiving and transmitting antenna systems shall 
be at least 20 dB greater than the maximum overall gain of the booster 
amplifier. Boosters may use opposite antenna polarization of the input 
and output antennas.

Sec. 74.951  Modification of transmission systems.

    Formal application on FCC Form 330 is required for any of the 
following changes or modifications of the transmission systems:
    (a) Replacement of the transmitter as a whole, except replacement 
with a transmitter of identical power rating which has been type 
accepted by the FCC for use by instructional TV fixed stations, or any 
change which could result in a change in the electrical characteristics 
or performance of the station. Upon the installation or modification of 
the transmitting equipment for which prior FCC authority is not required 
under the provisions of this paragraph, the licensee shall place in the 
station records a certification that the new installation complies in 
all respects with the technical requirements of this part and the terms 
of the station authorization.
    (b) Any change in the antenna system affecting the direction of 
radiation, directive radiation pattern, antenna gain, or radiated power.
    (c) Any change in the overall height of the antenna structure, 
except where notice to the Federal Aviation Administration is 
specifically not required under Sec. 17.14(b) of the FCC Rules.
    (d) Any change in the location of the transmission system except a 
move within the same building or upon the same antenna supporting 
structure.
    (e) A change in frequency assignment.
    (f) A change in the operating power.
    (g) Any addition of receiving locations or to modify such a location 
to a receive and response station.

    (a) Beginning November 1, 1991, the frequency of the visual carrier 
shall be maintained within <plus-minus> 1 KHz of the assigned frequency 
at all times when the station is in operation. Until that date, the 
frequency of the visual carrier shall be maintained within 60 KHz of the 
assigned frequency at all times when the station is in operation. A 
transmitter licensed prior to November 1, 1991, that remains at the 
station site initially licensed and does not comply with this paragraph 
may continue to be used for its life if it does not cause

[[Page 470]]

harmful interference to the operation of any other licensee. Any non-
conforming transmitter replaced after November 1, 1991, must be replaced 
by a transmitter meeting the requirements of this paragraph.
    (b) For television transmission, the peak power of the accompanying 
aural signal must not exceed 10 percent of the peak visual power of the 
transmitter.
    (c) Any licensee with transmission equipment conforming to the 
transmitter tolerance standard of this section can be required to use 
frequency offset where it is demonstrated to be necessary to avoid 
harmful interference with another station.

<R05>
Sec. 74.982  Station identification.

    (a) Call signs for instructional television fixed stations will 
consist of three letters and three digits pursuant to the provisions of 
Sec. 2.302 of this chapter relating to fixed stations.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this 
section, each instructional television fixed station shall transmit its 
call sign at the beginning and end of each period of operation and, 
during operation, on the hour. Visual or aural transmissions shall be 
employed.
    (c) The hourly station identification announcement during operation 
may be deferred if it would interrupt a single consecutive 
demonstration, lecture, or other similar discourse or otherwise impair 
the continuity of a program in progress. In such cases the station 
identification announcement shall be made at the first normal break in 
the continuity of the program.
    (d) In cases where an instructional television fixed station is 
operating as a relay for signals originating at some

[[Page 471]]

other station operated by the same licensee, its call sign shall be 
announced by the originating station at the times and in the manner 
prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (e) Where an instructional television fixed station is operating as 
a relay for signals originating at a station operated by some other 
licensee, its call sign may be transmitted by the originating station, 
if suitable arrangements can be made with the other licensee, or means 
shall be provided for the transmission of the call sign by the relay 
transmitter itself. Low power relay stations, authorized by 
Sec. 74.950(f)(4) will not be assigned individual call signs. Station 
identification will be accomplished by the retransmission of the call 
sign of the primary station.
    (f) Temporary fixed ITFS stations shall identify with the call sign 
of the primary station and a temporary fixed identifier.

Sec. 74.985  Signal booster stations.

    (a) Authorizations for Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS) 
booster stations may be granted to an ITFS applicant, permittee or 
licensee, or to a third party with a fully-executed lease agreement with 
an ITFS applicant, permittee, or licensee. The eligibility requirements 
of Sec. 74.932 will not apply to such third-party booster station 
applicants. A signal booster station may not extend service beyond a 
registered receive site of the primary ITFS station. No booster station 
may be authorized for retransmission of signals from an MDS, MMDS, or 
ITFS station without the written consent of the licensee of the station 
whose signals are retransmitted.
    (b) In addition to the other application requirements of this Part 
and of Form 330, each application for a signal booster station that 
would retransmit an ITFS signal must include a demonstration that the 
proposed signal booster station will not transmit a signal to a receiver 
site that is beyond a previously-registered receive site of the primary 
ITFS station.
    (c) In addition to the other application requirements of this part 
and of Form 330, each application for a signal booster station that 
would retransmit an ITFS signal must include a demonstration that the 
power flux density of the ITFS signal does not exceed -75.6 dBW/m\2\ at 
the edge of a protected service area for the primary ITFS transmitter 
station, as defined by Sec. 21.902(d) of this chapter.
    (d) In addition to the other application requirements of this part 
and of Forms 494 and 330, each application for a signal booster station

transmitter site.
    (e) In addition to the other application requirements of this part 
and of Forms 494 and 330, each application for a signal booster station 
must include a written consent statement of the licensee of each MDS, 
MMDS, and ITFS station whose signal is retransmitted.
    (f) The output power of the signal booster transmitter station must 
not exceed 18 dBW EIRP.
    (g) An MDS or ITFS licensee may install and commence operation of a 
signal booster station that has a maximum power level of -9 dBW EIRP and 
that does not extend service beyond the boundaries of an MDS station's 
protected service area or beyond an ITFS licensee's registered receive 
site, subject to the condition that for sixty (60) days after 
installation, no objection or petition to deny is filed by an authorized 
co-channel or adjacent channel ITFS or MDS station with a transmitter 
within 8 km (5 miles) (8.05 km) of the coordinates of the primary 
transmitter of the signal booster. An MDS or ITFS licensee seeking to 
install a signal booster under this rule must, within 48 hours after 
installation, submit a certification that:

[[Page 472]]

    (1) The maximum power level of the signal booster transmitter does

receivers, and the street address of the signal booster;
    (3) No registered receiver of an ITFS E or F channel station, 
constructed prior to May 26, 1983, is located within a 1 mile (1.61 km) 
radius of the coordinates of the booster, or in the alternative, that a 
consent statement has been obtained from the affected ITFS licensee;
    (4) No environmental assessment location as defined at Sec. 1.1307 
of this chapter is affected by installation and/or operation of the 
signal booster;
    (5) Each MDS and/or ITFS station licensee with protected service 
areas or registered receivers within a 8 km (5 mile) (8.05 km) radius of 
the coordinates of the booster has been given notice of its

Sec. 74.986  Involuntary ITFS station modifications.

    (a) Parties specified in paragraph (b) of this section may, subject 
to Commission approval, involuntary modify the facilities of an existing 
ITFS licensee in the following situations:
    (1) If the initiating party is prevented from invoking the 0 dB 
interference protection standard (see Sec. 21.902(f)(2) of this chapter 
and Sec. 74.903(a)(2) of this part) for projecting its impact on an 
existing ITFS licensee because of that licensee's pre-May 26, 1983, 
facilities, the applicant, permittee or licensee may modify the 
facilities of the pre-existing ITFS station with equipment adequate to 
perform at that level of interference;
    (2) If the initiating party is prevented from operating at a higher 
transmitter output power or EIRP because such power level will cause 
harmful interference to an ITFS station and modifying the ITFS station 
will avoid such harmful interference;
    (3) If the initiating party is prevented from installing a signal 
booster because such installation will cause harmful interference to an 
ITFS station and modifying the ITFS station will avoid harmful 
interference;
    (4) If an ITFS licensee uses equipment incapable of meeting the 
aural power standard specified in Sec. 74.935(d) and that equipment 
becomes a source of harmful adjacent-channel interference, and other 
equipment would avoid such harmful intereference.
    (5) If an ITFS licensee uses equipment incapable of meeting the 
transmitter tolerance standard specified in Sec. 74.961 of this part and 
that equipment becomes a source of harmful co-channel interference, and 
other equipment would avoid the harmful interference;
    (6) If an ITFS licensee uses equipment incapable of meeting the out-
of-band emissions standard specified in Sec. 74.936 of this part and 
that equipment becomes a source of harmful adjacent-channel 
interference, and other equipment would avoid the harmful interference; 
and
    (7) If harmful adjacent-channel interference may be avoided by 
colocation of an ITFS facility with its own facilities.

[[Page 473]]

    (b) Involuntary modification may be sought by an MDS, MMDS or ITFS 
licensee, conditional licensee, permittee or applicant. Opposed 
applicants do not have authority to seek involuntary colocation. An 
opposed application is one that faces a competing application(s) or 
petition(s) to deny. Applicants will be required to confirm their 
unopposed status after the period for competing applications and 
petitions to deny has passed. If an initiating application is opposed, 
the companion ITFS modification application will be returned. It may be 
refiled when the initial application is again unopposed.
    (c) The application for involuntary modification must be prepared, 
signed and filed by the initiating party. The applicant must submit FCC 
Form 330 but need not fill out section II (Legal Qualifications), and 
the application must include a cover letter clearly indicating that the 
modification is involuntary and identifying the parties involved. A copy 
of the application must be served on the affected ITFS party on or 
before the day of filing. The ITFS party to be modified will have a 60-
day period in which to oppose the modification application; the 
opposition should state objections to the modification with specificity, 
including engineering and other challenges. If the modification includes 
colocation, the opponent should address the desirability of the present 
site compared to the proposed new site.
    (d) The party initiating the modification will be responsible for 
all costs connected with the modification, including purchasing, testing 
and installing new equipment, labor costs, reconfiguration of existing 
equipment, administrative costs, legal and engineering expenses 
necessary to prepare and file the modification application, and other 
reasonable documented costs. The initiating party must secure a bond or 
establish an escrow account to cover reasonable incremental increase in 
ongoing expenses that will fall upon the modified ITFS entity and to 
cover expenses that would inure to the modified ITFS entity in the event 
the initiating party becomes bankrupt. In establishing a bond or escrow 
amount, such factors as projected electricity or maintenance expenses, 
or relocation expenses must be taken into account, as relevant in each 
case.
    (e) The involuntarily modified facilities must be operational before 
the initiating party will be permitted to begin its new or modified 
operations. The modification must not disrupt the ITFS licensee's 
provision of service, and the ITFS licensee has the right to inspect the 
construction or installation work.

Sec. 74.990  Use of available instructional television fixed service frequencies by wireless cable entities.

    (a) Notwithstanding the provisions Secs. 74.931 and 74.932 of this 
part, a wireless cable entity may be licensed on instructional 
television fixed service frequencies in areas where at least eight other 
instructional television fixed service channels remain available in the 
community for future ITFS use. Channels will be considered available for 
future ITFS use if there are no co-channel operators or applicants 
within 80.5 km (50 miles) of the transmitter site of the proposed 
wireless cable operation, and if the transmitter site remains available 
for use at reasonable terms by new ITFS applicants on those channels 
within three years of commencing operation.
    (b) No more than eight instructional television fixed service 
channels per community may be licensed to wireless cable entities.
    (c) To be licensed on instructional television fixed service 
channels, a wireless cable applicant must hold a conditional license, 
license or a lease, or must have filed an unopposed application for at 
least four MDS channels to be used in conjunction with the facilities 
proposed on the ITFS frequencies. An unopposed application is one that 
faces no competing application(s) or petition(s) to deny. Applicants 
will be required to confirm their unopposed status after the period for 
filing competing applications and petitions to deny has passed. If an 
MDS or MMDS application is opposed, the companion ITFS application will 
be returned.
    (d) To be licensed on instructional television fixed service 
channels, a wireless cable applicant must show

[[Page 474]]

that there are no multipoint distribution service or multichannel 
multipoint distribution service channels available for application, 
purchase or lease that could be used in lieu of the instructional 
television fixed service frequencies applied for. A wireless cable 
entity may apply for instructional television fixed service frequencies 
at the same time it applies for the related MDS or MMDS frequencies, but 
if that MDS or MMDS application is opposed by a timely filed mutually 
exclusive application or petition to deny, the application for ITFS 
facilities will be returned.
    (e) If an instructional television fixed service application and a 
wireless cable application for available instructional television fixed 
service facilities are mutually exclusive, as defined at Sec. 21.31(a) 
of this chapter, the instructional television fixed service application 
will be granted if the applicant is qualified. An instructional 
television fixed service applicant may not file an application mutually 
exclusive with a wireless cable application if there are other 
instructional television fixed service channels available for the 
proposed instructional television fixed service facility.
    (f) The interference protection provided wireless cable applicants 
and licensees of instructional television fixed service facilities will 
be that described in Sec. 21.902 of this chapter.

newspaper. The local public notice must be made in a daily newspaper of 
general circulation published in the community in which the proposed 
station will be located at least twice a week for two consecutive weeks 
in a three week period. If there is no such daily newspaper, notice must 
be made in a weekly newspaper of general circulation published in the 
community once a week for three consecutive weeks in a four week period. 
If there is no daily or weekly newspaper published in the community, 
notice must be made in the daily newspaper, wherever published, that has 
the greatest general circulation in the community twice a week for two 
consecutive weeks within a three week period.
    (c) The public notice required by paragraph (b) of this section 
shall contain, where applicable, the following information:
    (1) The name of the applicant if the applicant is an individual, the 
names of all partners if the applicant is a partnership, or the names of 
all officers and directors and of those persons holding 10 percent or 
more of the capital stock or other ownership interest if the applicant 
is a corporation or an unincorporated association;
    (2) The purpose for which the application will be filed (i.e., for a 
construction permit for a wireless cable system);
    (3) A statement that the channels applied for are ITFS channels 
normally reserved for educational use, and a list of the specific 
frequencies or channels on which the proposed station will operate;

Sec. 74.992  Access to channels licensed to wireless cable entities.

    (a) An educational institution or entity that would be eligible for 
ITFS channels that are licensed to a wireless cable entity may be 
entitled to access to those channels. Requests for access may be made by 
application to the Commission on FCC Form 330 with a copy simultaneously 
served on the wireless cable licensee. An applicant for access must fill 
out sections I, II, III and IV of the ITFS application Form 330. Section 
I, question 1 should be answered by spelling out, ``For access to 
existing facilities.'' Section I, question 2b should include the name of 
the wireless cable licensee or applicant. A cover letter must clearly 
indicate that the application is for ITFS access to a wireless cable 
entity's facilities on ITFS channels.
    (b) An ITFS entity determined by the Commission to have right of 
access to wireless cable licensed facilities may have access to a 
maximum of 40 hours per channel per week. The ITFS entity has the right 
to designate 20 of those hours as follows:
    (1) 3 hours of the ITFS entity's choice each day, Monday through 
Friday, between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m., excluding weekends, holidays and 
school vacations; and
    (2) The remaining five hours any time of the ITFS entity's choice 
between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m., Monday through Saturday.
    (c) No time-of-day and day-of-week obligations will be imposed on 
either party with respect to the other 20 hours of access time.
    (d) The ITFS user must provide the wireless cable licensee with its 
planned scheduled of use four months in advance. No minimum amount of 
programming will be required of an ITFS operator seeking access to one 
channel; for access to a second channel, the ITFS user must use at least 
20 hours per week on the first channel from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., Monday 
through Saturday; for access to a third channel, the ITFS entity must 
use at least 20 hours per week on the first channel and on the second 
channel during the hours prescribed above, and so on. Only one 
educational institution or entity per wireless cable licensed channel 
will be entitled to access from the wireless cable entity. Access will 
not be granted to a single entity for more than four channels, unless it 
can satisfy the waiver provisions of Sec. 74.902(d) of this part.
    (e) When an ITFS entity is granted access to an ITFS channel of a 
wireless cable licensee, the wireless cable licensee will be required to 
pay half of the cost of five standard receive sites on that channel. The 
wireless cable entity may, at its option, pay the costs of an 
application and facility construction for such ITFS entity on other 
available ITFS channels, including half of the cost of five receive 
sites per channel.
    (f) An instructional television fixed service entity granted access 
to instructional television fixed service channels licensed to a 
wireless cable entity will have the interference protection afforded 
ITFS licensees (see Sec. 74.903 of this part).
    (g) After three years of operation, a wireless cable entity licensed 
to use ITFS channels will not be required to grant new or additional 
access to such ITFS channels, or provide any alternative facilities to 
any ITFS entity seeking access to its facilities, if there are suitable 
ITFS frequencies available for the ITFS entity to build its own system.
    (h) The parties may mutually agree to modify any requirements or 
obligations imposed by these provisions, except for the requirement that 
an educational entity use at least 20 hours per week on a channel of a 
wireless cable licensee before requesting access to an additional 
channel.

  Subpart L--FM Broadcast Translator Stations and FM Broadcast Booster 
                                Stations

    Source:  35 FR 15388, Oct. 2, 1970, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 74.1201  Definitions.

    (a) FM translator. A station in the broadcasting service operated 
for the purpose of retransmitting the signals of an FM radio broadcast 
station or another FM broadcast translator station without significantly 
altering any characteristics of the incoming signal other than its 
frequency and amplitude, in order to provide FM broadcast service to the 
general public.
    (b) Commercial FM translator. An FM broadcast translator station 
which rebroadcasts the signals of a commercial FM radio broadcast 
station.
    (c) Noncommercial FM translator. An FM broadcast translator station 
which rebroadcasts the signals of a noncommercial educational FM radio 
broadcast station.
    (d) Primary station. The FM radio broadcast station radiating the 
signals which are retransmitted by an FM broadcast translator station or 
an FM broadcast booster station.
    (e) FM radio broadcast station. When used in this Subpart L, the 
term FM broadcast station or FM radio broadcast station refers to 
commercial and noncommercial educational FM radio broadcast stations as 
defined in Sec. 2.1 of this chapter, unless the context indicates 
otherwise.
    (f) FM broadcast booster station. A station in the broadcasting 
service operated for the sole purpose of retransmitting the signals of 
an FM radio broadcast station, by amplifying and reradiating such 
signals, without significantly altering any characteristic of the 
incoming signal other than its amplitude.
    (g) Translator coverage contour. The coverage contour for an FM 
translator providing ``fill-in'' service is congruent with its parent 
station: For a fill-in translator for a commercial Class B station it is 
the predicted 0.5 mV/m field strength contour; for a fill-in translator 
for a commercial Cass B1 station it is the predicted 0.7 mV/m field 
strength contour; and for a fill-in translator for all other classes of 
commercial stations as well as all noncommercial educational stations it 
is the predicted 1 mV/m field strength contour. A fill-in FM 
translator's coverage contour must be contained within the primary 
station's coverage contour. The protected contour for an FM translator 
station is its predicted 1 mV/m contour.
    (h) Fill-in area. The area where the coverage contour of an FM 
translator or booster station is within the protected contour of the 
associated primary station (i.e., predicted 0.5 mV/m contour for 
commercial Class B stations, predicted 0.7 mV/m contour for commercial 
Class B1 stations, and predicted 1 mV/m contour for all other classes of 
stations).
    (i) Other area. The area where the coverage contour of an FM 
translator station extends beyond the protected contour of the primary 
station (i.e., predicted 0.5 mV/m contour for commercial Class B 
stations, predicted 0.7 mV/m contour for commercial Class B1 stations, 
and predicted 1 mV/m contour for all other classes of stations).

Sec. 74.1202  Frequency assignment.

    (a) An applicant for a new FM broadcast translator station or for 
changes in the facilities of an authorized translator station shall 
endeavor to select a channel on which its operation is not likely to 
cause interference to the reception of other stations. The application 
must be specific with regard to the frequency requested. Only one output 
channel will be assigned to each translator station.
    (b) Subject to compliance with all the requirements of this subpart, 
FM broadcast translators may be authorized to operate on the following 
FM channels, regardless of whether they are assigned for local use in 
the FM Table of Allotments (Sec. 73.202(b) of this chapter):
    (1) Commercial FM translators: Channels 221-300 as identified in 
Sec. 73.201 of this chapter.
    (2) Noncommercial FM translators: Channels 201-300 as identified in 
Sec. 73.201 of this chapter. Use of reserved channels 201-220 is subject 
to the restrictions specified in Sec. 73.501 of this chapter.
    (3) In Alaska, FM translators operating on Channels 201-260 (88.1-
99.9 MHz) shall not cause harmful interference to and must accept 
interference from non-Government fixed operations authorized prior to 
January 1, 1982.
    (c) An FM broadcast booster station will be assigned the channel 
assigned to its primary station.

10, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 74.1203  Interference.

    (a) An authorized FM translator or booster station will not be 
permitted to continue to operate if it causes any actual interference 
to:
    (1) The transmission of any authorized broadcast station; or
    (2) The reception of the input signal of any TV translator, TV 
booster, FM translator or FM booster station; or
    (3) The direct reception by the public of the off-the-air signals of 
any authorized broadcast station including TV Channel 6 stations, Class 
D (secondary) noncommercial educational FM stations, and previously 
authorized and operating FM translators and FM booster stations. 
Interference will be considered to occur whenever reception of a 
regularly used signal is impaired by the signals radiated by the FM 
translator or booster station, regardless of the quality of such 
reception, the strength of the signal so used, or the channel on which 
the protected signal is transmitted.
    (b) If interference cannot be properly eliminated by the application 
of suitable techniques, operation of the offending FM translator or 
booster station shall be suspended and shall not be resumed until the 
interference has been eliminated. Short test transmissions may be made 
during the period of suspended operation to check the efficacy of 
remedial measures. If a complainant refuses to permit the FM translator 
or booster licensee to apply remedial techniques which demonstrably will 
eliminate the interference without impairment to the original reception, 
the licensee of the FM translator or booster station is absolved of 
further responsibility for that complaint.
    (c) An FM booster station will be exempted from the provisions of 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section to the extent that it may cause 
limited interference to its primary station's signal, provided it does 
not disrupt the existing service of its primary station or cause such 
interference within the boundaries of the principal community of its 
primary station.
    (d) A fill-in FM translator operating on the first, second or third 
adjacent channel to its primary station's channel will be exempt from 
the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section to the extent 
that it may cause limited interference to its primary station's signal, 
provided it does not disrupt the existing service of its primary station 
or cause such interference within the boundaries of the principal 
community of its primary station.
    (e) It shall be the responsibility of the licensee of an FM 
translator or FM booster station to correct any condition of 
interference which results from the radiation of radio frequency energy 
by its equipment on any frequency outside the assigned channel. Upon 
notice

[[Page 478]]

by the Commission to the station licensee that such interference is 
being caused, the operation of the FM translator or FM booster station 
shall be suspended within three minutes and shall not be resumed until 
the interference has been eliminated or it can be demonstrated that the 
interference is not due to spurious emissions by the FM translator or FM 
booster station; provided, however, that short test transmissions may be 
made during the period of suspended operation to check the efficacy of 
remedial measures.

Sec. 74.1204  Protection of FM broadcast stations and FM translators.

    (a) An application for an FM translator station will not be accepted 
for filing if the proposed operation would involve overlap of predicted 
field strength contours with any other authorized station, including 
commercial and noncommercial educational FM broadcast stations, FM 
translators and Class D (secondary) noncommercial educational FM 
stations, as set forth below:
    (1) Commercial Class B FM Stations (Protected Contour: 0.5 mV/m)

                                     dBu)               dBu).           
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Commercial Class B1 FM Stations (Protected Contour: 0.7 mV/m)

Co-channel........................  0.07 mV/m (37      0.7 mV/m (57     
                                     dBu)               dBu).           
200 kHz...........................  0.35 mV/m (51      0.7 mV/m (57     
                                     dBu)               dBu).           
400 kHz...........................  7.00 mV/m (77      0.7 mV/m (57     
                                     dBu)               dBu).           
600 kHz...........................  70.0 mV/m (97      0.7 mV/m (57     
                                     dBu)               dBu).           
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) All Other Classes of FM Stations (Protected Contour: 1 mV/m

Co-channel........................  0.1 mV/m (40 dBu)  1 mV/m (60 dBu). 
200 kHz...........................  0.5 mV/m (54 dBu)  1 mV/m (60 dBu).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) The following standards must be used to compute the distances to 
the pertinent contours:
    (1) The distances to the protected contours are computed using 
Figure 1 of Sec. 73.333 [F(50,50) curves] of this chapter.
    (2) The distances to the interference contours are computed using 
Figure 1a of Sec. 73.333 [F(50,10) curves] of this chapter. In the event 
that the distance to the contour is below 16 kilometers (approximately 
10 miles), and therefore not covered by Figure 1a, curves in Figure 1 
must be used.
    (3) The effective radiated power (ERP) to be used is the maximum ERP 
of the main radiated lobe in the pertinent azimuthal direction. If the 
transmitting antenna is not horizontally polarized only, either the 
vertical component or the horizontal component of the ERP should be 
used, whichever is greater in the pertinent azimuthal direction.
    (4) The antenna height to be used is the height of the radiation 
center above the average terrain along each pertinent radial, determined 
in accordance with Sec. 73.313(d) of this chapter.
    (c) An application for a change (other than a change in channel) in 
the authorized facilities of an FM translator station will be accepted 
even though overlap of field strength contours would occur with another 
station in an area where such overlap does not already exist, if:
    (1) The total area of overlap with that station would not be 
increased:
    (2) The area of overlap with any other station would not increase;
    (3) The area of overlap does not move significantly closer to the 
station receiving the overlap; and,
    (4) No area of overlap would be created with any station with which 
the overlap does not now exist.

[[Page 479]]

    (d) The provisions of this section concerning prohibited overlap 
will not apply where the area of such overlap lies entirely over water. 
In addition, an application otherwise precluded by this section will be 
accepted if it can be demonstrated that no actual interference will 
occur due to intervening terrain, lack of population or such other 
factors as may be applicable.
    (e) The provisions of this section will not apply to overlap between 
a proposed fill-in FM translator station and its primary station 
operating on a first, second or third adjacent channel, provided That 
such operation may not result in interference to the primary station 
within its principal community.
    (f) An application for an FM translator station will not be accepted 
for filing even though the proposed operation would not involve overlap 
of field strength contours with any other station, as set forth in 
paragraph (a) of this section, if the predicted 1 mV/m field strength 
contour of the FM translator station will overlap a populated area 
already receiving a regularly used, off-the-air signal of any authorized 
co-channel, first, second or third adjacent channel broadcast station, 
including Class D (secondary) noncommercial educational FM stations and 
grant of the authorization will result in interference to the reception 
of such signal.
    (g) An application for an FM translator or an FM booster station 
that is 53 or 54 channels removed from an FM radio broadcast station 
will not be accepted for filing if it fails to meet the required 
separation distances set out in Sec. 73.207 of this chapter. For 
purposes of determining compliance with Sec. 73.207 of this chapter, 
translator stations will be treated as Class A stations and booster 
stations will be treated the same as their FM radio broadcast station 
equivalents. FM radio broadcast station equivalents will be determined 
in accordance with Secs. 73.210 and 73.211 of this chapter, based on the 
booster station's ERP and HAAT. Provided, however, that FM translator 
stations and booster stations operating with less than 100 watts ERP 
will be treated as class D stations and will not be subject to 
intermediate frequency separation requirements.
    (h) An application for an FM translator station will not be accepted 
for filing if it specifies a location within 320 kilometers 
(approximately 199 miles) of either the Canadian or Mexican borders and 
it does not comply with Sec. 74.1235(d) of this part.
    (i) FM booster stations shall be subject to the requirement that the 
signal of any first adjacent channel station must exceed the signal of 
the booster station by 6 dB at all points within the protected contour 
of any first adjacent channel station, except that in the case of FM 
stations on adjacent channels at spacings that do not meet the minimum 
distance separations specified in Sec. 73.207 of this chapter, the 
signal of any first adjacent channel station must exceed the signal of 
the booster by 6 dB at any point within the predicted interference free 
contour of the adjacent channel station.
    (j) FM translator stations authorized prior to June 1, 1991 with 
facilities that do not comply with the predicted interference protection 
provisions of this section, may continue to operate, provided that 
operation is in conformance with Sec. 74.1203 regarding actual 
interference. Applications for major changes in FM translator stations 
must specify facilities that comply with provisions of this section.

Sec. 74.1231  Purpose and permissible service.

    (a) FM translators provide a means whereby the signals of FM 
broadcast stations may be retransmitted to areas in which direct 
reception of such FM broadcast stations is unsatisfactory due to 
distance or intervening terrain barriers.
    (b) An FM translator may be used for the purpose of retransmitting 
the signals of a primary FM radio broadcast station or another 
translator station which have been received directly through space, 
converted, and suitably amplified. However, an FM translator providing 
fill-in service may use any terrestrial facilities to receive the signal 
that is being rebroadcast. An FM booster station or a noncommercial 
educational FN translator station operating on a reserved channel 
(Channels 201-220) and owned and operated by

[[Page 481]]

the licensee of the primary noncommercial educational FM station it 
rebroadcasts may use alternative signal delivery means, including, but 
not limited to, satellite and terrestrial microwave facilities. 
Provided, however, that an applicant for a noncommercial educational FM 
translator station operating on a reserved channel (Channel 201-220) and 
owned and operated by the licensee of the primary noncommercial 
educational FM station it rebroadcasts complies with either paragraph 
(b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section:
    (1) The applicant demonstrates that:
    (i) The transmitter site of the proposed FM translator station is 
within 80 kilometers of the predicted 1 mV/m contour of the primary 
station to be rebroadcast; or,
    (ii) The transmitter site of the proposed FM translator station is 
more than 160 kilometers from the transmitter site of any authorized 
full service noncommercial educational FM station; or,
    (iii) The application is mutually exclusive with an application 
containing the showing as required by Sec. 74.1231(b)(2) (i) or (ii) of 
this section; or,
    (iv) The application is filed after October 1, 1992.
    (2) If the transmitter site of the proposed FM translator station is 
more than 80 kilometers from the predicted 1 mV/m contour of the primary 
station to be rebroadcast or is within 160 kilometers of the transmitter 
site of any authorized full service noncommercial educational FM 
station, the applicant must show that:
    (i) An alternative frequency can be used at the same site as the 
proposed FM translator's transmitter location and can provide signal 
coverage to the same area encompassed by the applicant's proposed 1 mV/m 
contour; or,
    (ii) An alternative frequency can be used at a different site and 
can provide signal coverage to the same area encompassed by the 
applicant's proposed 1 mV/m contour.

    Note: For paragraphs 74.1231(b) and 74.1231(h) of this section, 
auxiliary intercity relay station frequencies may be used to deliver 
signals to FM translator and booster stations on a secondary basis only. 
Such use shall not interfere with or otherwise preclude use of these 
frequencies for transmitting aural programming between the studio and 
transmitter location of a broadcast station, or between broadcast 
stations, as provided in paragraphs 74.531 (a) and (b) of this part. 
Prior to filing an application for an auxiliary intercity relay 
microwave frequency, the applicant shall notify the local frequency 
coordination committee, or, in the absence of a local frequency 
coordination committee, any licensees assigned the use of the proposed 
operating frequency in the intended location or area of operation.

    (c) The transmissions of each FM translator or booster station shall 
be intended only for direct reception by the general public. An FM 
translator or booster shall not be operated solely for the purpose of 
relaying signals to one or more fixed received points for 
retransmission, distribution, or further relaying in order to establish 
a point-to-point FM radio relay system.
    (d) The technical characteristics of the retransmitted signals shall 
not be deliberately altered so as to hinder reception on conventional FM 
broadcast receivers.
    (e) An FM translator shall not deliberately retransmit the signals 
of any station other than the station it is authorized to retransmit. 
Precautions shall be taken to avoid unintentional retransmission of such 
other signals.
    (f) A locally generated radio frequency signal similar to that of an 
FM broadcast station and modulated with aural information may be 
connected to the input terminals of an FM translator for the purpose of 
transmitting voice announcements. The radio frequency signals shall be 
on the same channel as the normally used off-the-air signal being 
rebroadcast. Connection of the locally generated signals shall be made 
by any automatic means when transmitting originations concerning 
financial support. The connections for emergency transmissions may be 
made manually. The apparatus used to generate the local signal that is 
used to modulate the FM translator must be capable of producing an aural 
signal which will provide acceptable reception on FM receivers designed 
for the transmission standards employed by FM broadcast stations.

[[Page 482]]

    (g) The aural material transmitted as permitted in paragraph (f) of 
this section shall be limited to emergency warnings of imminent danger 
and to seeking or acknowledging financial support deemed necessary to 
the continued operation of the translator. Originations concerning 
financial support are limited to a total of 30 seconds an hour. Within 
this limitation the length of any particular announcement will be left 
to the discretion of the translator station licensee. Solicitations of 
contributions shall be limited to the defrayal of the costs of 
installation, operation and maintenance of the translator or 
acknowledgements of financial support for those purposes. Such 
acknowledgements may include identification of the contributors, the 
size or nature of the contributions and advertising messages of 
contributors. Emergency transmissions shall be no longer or more 
frequent than necessary to protect life and property.
    (h) FM broadcast booster stations provide a means whereby the 
licensee of an FM broadcast station may provide service to areas in any 
region within the primary station's predicted, authorized service 
contours. An FM broadcast booster station is authorized to retransmit 
only the signals of its primary station which have been received 
directly through space and suitably amplified, or received by 
alternative signal delivery means including, but not limited to, 
satellite and terrestrial microwave facilities. The FM booster station 
shall not retransmit the signals of any other station nor make 
independent transmissions, except that locally generated signals may be 
used to excite the booster apparatus for the purpose of conducting tests 
and measurements essential to the proper installation and maintenance of 
the apparatus.

    Note: In the case of an FM broadcast station authorized with 
facilities in excess of those specified by Sec. 73.211 of this chapter, 
an FM booster station will only be authorized within the protected 
contour of the class of station being rebroadcast as predicted on the 
basis of the maximum powers and heights set forth in that section for 
the applicable class of FM broadcast station concerned.

<R05>
Sec. 74.1232  Eligibility and licensing requirements.

    (a) Subject to the restrictions set forth in paragraph (d) of this 
section, a license for an FM broadcast translator station may be issued 
to any qualified individual, organized group of individuals, broadcast 
station licensee, or local civil governmental body, upon an appropriate 
showing that plans for financing the installation and operation of the 
translator are sufficiently sound to assure prompt construction of the 
translator and dependable service.
    (b) More than one FM translator may be licensed to the same 
applicant, whether or not such translators serve substantially the same 
area, upon an appropriate showing of technical need for such additional 
stations. FM translators are not counted as FM stations for the purpose 
of Sec. 73.3555 of this chapter concerning multiple ownership.

    Note: As used in this section need refers to the quality of the 
signal received and not to the programming content, format, or 
transmission needs of an area.

    (c) Only one input and one output channel will be assigned to each 
FM translator. Additional FM translators may be authorized to provide 
additional reception. A separate application is required for each FM 
translator and each application shall be complete in all respects.
    (d) An authorization for an FM translator whose coverage contour 
extends beyond the protected contour of the commercial primary station 
will not be granted to the licensee or permittee of a commercial FM 
radio broadcast station. Similarly, such authorization will not be 
granted to any person or entity having any interest whatsoever, or any 
connection with a primary FM station. Interested and connected parties 
extend to group owners, corporate parents, shareholders, officers, 
directors,

[[Page 483]]

employees, general and limited partners, family members and business 
associates. For the purposes of this paragraph, the protected contour of 
the primary station shall be defined as follows: the predicted 0.5mV/m 
contour for commercial Class B stations, the predicted 0.7 mV/m contour 
for commercial Class B1 stations and the predicted 1 mV/m field strength 
contour for all other FM radio broadcast stations. The contours shall be 
as predicted in accordance with Sec. 73.313(a) through (d) of this 
chapter. In the case of an FM radio broadcast station authorized with 
facilities in excess of those specified by Sec. 73.211 of this chapter, 
a co-owned commercial FM translator will only be authorized within the 
protected contour of the class of station being rebroadcast, as 
predicted on the basis of the maximum powers and heights set forth in 
that section for the applicable class of FM broadcast station concerned. 
An FM translator station in operation prior to March 1, 1991, which is 
owned by a commercial FM (primary) station and whose coverage contour 
extends beyond the protected contour of the primary station, may 
continue to be owned by such primary station until March 1, 1994. 
Thereafter, any such FM translator station must be owned by independent 
parties. An FM translator station in operation prior to June 1, 1991, 
which is owned by a commercial FM radio broadcast station and whose 
coverage contour extends beyond the protected contour of the primary 
station, may continue to be owned by a commercial FM radio broadcast 
station until June 1, 1994. Thereafter, any such FM translator station 
must be owned by independent parties.
    (e) An FM translator station whose coverage contour goes beyond the 
protected contour of the commercial primary station shall not receive 
any support, before or after construction, either directly or 
indirectly, from the commercial primary FM radio broadcast station. Such 
support also may not be received from any person or entity having any 
interest whatsoever, or any connection with the primary FM station. 
Interested and connected parties extend to group owners, corporate 
parents, shareholders, officers, directors, employees, general and 
limited partners, family members and business associates. Such an FM 
translator station may, however, receive technical assistance from the 
primary station to the extent of installing or repairing equipment or 
making adjustments to equipment to assure compliance with the terms of 
the translator station's construction permit and license. FM translator 
stations in operation prior to March 1, 1991 may continue to receive 
contributions or support from the commercial primary station for the 
operation and maintenance of the translator station until March, 1, 
1994. Thereafter, any such FM translator station shall be subject to the 
prohibitions on support contained in this section. Such an FM translator 
station may, however, receive technical assistance from the primary 
station to the extent of installing or repairing equipment or making 
adjustments to equipment to assure compliance with the terms of the 
translator station's construction permit and license. FM translator 
stations in operation prior to June 1, 1991 may continue to receive 
contributions or support from a commercial FM radio broadcast station 
for the operation and maintenance of the translator station until June 
1, 1994. Thereafter, any such FM translator station shall be subject to 
the prohibitions on support contained in this section.

    Note: ``Technical assistance'' refers to actual services provided by 
the primary station's technical staff or compensation for the time and 
services provided by independent engineering personnel. Conversely, such 
support must not include the supply of equipment or direct funding for 
the translator's discretionary use. ``Technical assistance'' must occur 
after the issuance of the translator's construction permit or license in 
order to meet expenses incurred by installing, repairing, or making 
adjustments to equipment.

    (f) An FM broadcast booster station will be authorized only to the 
licensee or permittee of the FM radio broadcast station whose signals 
the booster station will retransmit, to serve areas within the protected 
contour of the primary station, subject to Note, Sec. 74.1231(h) of this 
part.
    (g) No numerical limit is placed upon the number of FM booster 
stations

[[Page 484]]

which may be licensed to a single licensee. A separate application is 
required for each FM booster station. FM broadcast booster stations are 
not counted as FM broadcast stations for the purposes of Sec. 73.5555 of 
this chapter concerning multiple ownership.
    (h) Any authorization for an FM translator station issued to an 
applicant described in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section will be 
issued subject to the condition that it may be terminated at any time, 
upon not less than sixty (60) days written notice, where the 
circumstances in the community or area served are so altered as to have 
prohibited grant of the application had such circumstances existed at 
the time of its filing.

Sec. 74.1233  Processing FM translator and booster station applications.

    (a) Applications for FM translator and booster stations are divided 
into two groups:
    (1) In the first group are applications for new stations or for 
major changes in the facilities of authorized stations. In the case of 
FM translator stations, a major change is any change in frequency 
(output channel), or change (only the gain should be included in 
determining amount of change) or increase (but not decrease) in area to 
be served greater than ten percent of the previously authorized 1 mV/m 
contour. All other changes will be considered minor. All major changes 
are subject to the provisions of Secs. 73.3580 and 1.1104 of this 
chapter pertaining to major changes.
    (2) In the second group are applications for licenses and all other 
changes in the facilities of the authorized station.
    (b) Applications for FM translator and booster stations will be 
processed as nearly as possible in the order in which they are filed. 
Such applications will be placed in the processing line in numerical 
sequence, and will be drawn by the staff for study, the lowest file 
number first. In order that those applications which are entitled to be 
grouped for processing may be fixed prior to the time processing of the 
earliest filed application is begun, the FCC will periodically release a 
Public Notice listing applications which have been accepted for filing 
and announcing a date (not less than 30 days after publication) on which 
the listed applications will be considered available and ready for 
processing and by which all mutually exclusive applications and/or 
petitions to deny the listed applications must be filed.
    (c) In the case of an application for an instrument of 
authorization, other than a license pursuant to a construction permit, 
grant will be based on the application, the pleadings filed, and such 
other matters that may be officially noticed. Before a grant can be made 
it must be determined that:
    (1) There is not pending a mutually exclusive application filed in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) The applicant is legally, technically, financially and otherwise 
qualified;
    (3) The applicant is not in violation of any provisions of law, the 
FCC rules, or established policies of the FCC; and
    (4) A grant of the application would otherwise serve the public 
interest, convenience and necessity.
    (d) Applications for FM translator stations proposing to provide 
fill-in service (within the primary station's protected contour) of the 
commonly owned primary station will be given priority over all other 
applications.
    (e) Where applications for FM translator stations are mutually 
exclusive and do not involve a proposal to provide fill-in service of a 
commonly owned primary station, the FCC may stipulate different 
frequencies as necessary for the applicants.
    (f) Where there are no available frequencies to substitute for a 
mutually exclusive application, the FCC will base its decision on the 
following priorities: (1) First full-time aural services; (2) second 
full-time aural services; and (3) other public interest matters 
including, but not limited to the number of aural services received in 
the proposed service area, the need for or lack of public radio service, 
and other matters such as the relative size of the proposed communities 
and their growth rate.

[[Page 485]]

    (g) Where the procedures in paragraph (d), (e) and (f) of this 
section fail to resolve the mutual exclusivity, the applications will be 
processed on a first-come-first-served basis.

Sec. 74.1234  Unattended operation.

    (a) A station authorized under this subpart may be operated without 
a designated person in attendance if the following requirements are met:
    (1) If the transmitter site cannot be reached promptly at all hours 
and in all seasons, means shall be provided so that the transmitting 
apparatus can be turned on and off at will from a point which is readily 
accessible at all hours and in all seasons.
    (2) The transmitter shall also be equipped with suitable automatic 
circuits which will place it in a nonradiating condition in the absence 
of a signal on the input channel.
    (3) The on-and-off control (if at a location other than the 
transmitter site) and the transmitting apparatus, shall be adequately 
protected against tampering by unauthorized persons.
    (4) The Commission shall be supplied with the name, address, and 
telephone number of a person or persons who may be contacted to secure 
suspension of operation of the translator promptly should such action be 
deemed necessary by the Commission. Such information shall be kept 
current by the licensee.
    (5) Where the antenna and supporting structure are required to be 
painted and lighted under the provisions of Part 17 of this chapter, the 
licensee shall make suitable arrangements for the daily inspection and 
logging of the obstruction lighting and associated control equipment as 
required by Secs. 17.47, 17.48, and 17.49 of this chapter.
    (b) An application for authority to construct a new station pursuant 
to this subpart or to make changes in the facilities of such a station, 
which proposes unattended operation shall include an adequate showing as 
to the manner of compliance with this section.

Sec. 74.1235  Power limitations and antenna systems.

    (a) An application for an FM translator station filed by the 
licensee or permittee of the primary station to provide fill-in service 
within the primary station's coverage area will not be accepted for 
filing if it specifies an effective radiated power (ERP) which exceeds 
250 watts.
    (b) An application for an FM translator station, other than one for 
fill-in service which is covered in paragraph (a) of this section, will 
not be accepted for filing if it specifies an effective radiated power 
(ERP) which exceeds the maximum ERP (MERP) value determined in 
accordance with this paragraph. The antenna height above average terrain 
(HAAT) shall be determined in accordance with Sec. 73.313(d) of this 
chapter for each of 12 distinct radials, with each radial spaced 30 
degrees apart and with the bearing of the first radial bearing true 
north. Each raidal HAAT value shall be rounded to the nearest meter. For 
each of the 12 radial directions, the MERP is the value corresponding to 
the calculated HAAT in the following tables that is appropriate for the 
location of the translator. For an application specifying a 
nondirectional transmitting antenna, the specified ERP must not exceed 
the smallest of the 12 MERP's. For an application specifying a 
directional transmitting antenna, the ERP in each azimuthal direction 
must not exceed the MERP for the closest of the 12 radial directions.

    (b) The call sign of an FM booster station will consist of the call 
sign of the primary station followed by the letters ``FM'' and the 
number of the booster station being authorized, e.g., WFCCFM-1.
    (c) A translator station authorized under this subpart shall be 
identified by one of the following methods.
    (1) By arranging for the primary station whose station is being 
rebroadcast to identify the translator station by call sign and 
location. Three such identifications shall be made during each day: once 
between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., once between 12:55 p.m. and 1:05 p.m. and 
once between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. Stations which do not begin their 
broadcast before 9 a.m. shall make their first identification at the 
beginning of their broadcast days. The licensee of an FM translator 
whose station identification is made by the primary station must arrange 
for the primary station licensee to keep in its file, and to make 
available to FCC personnel, the translator's call letters and location, 
giving the name, address and telephone number of the licensee or his 
service representative to be contacted in the event of malfunction of 
the translator. It shall be the responsibility of the translator 
licensee to furnish current information to the primary station licensee 
for this purpose.
    (2) By transmitting the call sign in International Morse Code at 
least once each hour. Transmitters of FM broadcast translator stations 
of more than 1 watt transmitter output power must be equipped with an 
automatic keying device that will transmit the call sign at least once 
each hour, unless there is in effect a firm agreement with the 
translator's primary station as provided in Sec. 74.1283(c)(1) of this 
section. Transmission of the call sign can be accomplished by:
    (i) Frequency shifting key; the carrier shift shall not be less than 
5 kHz nor greater than 25 kHz.
    (ii) Amplitude modulation of the FM carrier of at least 30 percent 
modulation. The audio frequency tone use shall not be within 200 hertz 
of the Emergency Broadcast System Attention signal alerting frequencies.
    (d) FM broadcast booster stations shall be identified by their 
primary stations, by the broadcasting of the primary station's call 
signs and location, in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 73.1201 of 
this chapter.

state the relief requested. It shall state fully and precisely all 
pertinent facts and considerations relied on to demonstrate the need for 
the relief requested and to support a determination that a grant of such 
relief would serve the public interest. Factual allegations shall be 
supported by affidavit of a person or persons with actual knowledge of 
the facts, and exhibits shall be verified by the person who prepares 
them.
    (2) A petition for special relief or must-carry complaint shall set 
forth all steps taken by the parties to resolve the problem, except 
where the only relief sought is a clarification or interpretation of the 
rules.
    (3) An original and two (2) copies of the petition for special 
relief or must-carry complaint, and all subsequent pleadings shall be 
filed in accordance with Sec. 0.401(a) of this chapter, except the 
petitions for special relief requiring fees as set forth at part 1, 
subpart G of this chapter must be filed in accordance with Sec. 0.401(b) 
of this chapter. Must-carry complaints filed pursuant to Sec. 76.61 are 
not covered by part 1, subpart G of this chapter and do not require 
fees.
    (4)(i) Must-carry complaints filed pursuant to Sec. 76.61(a) 
(Complaints regarding carriage of local commercial television stations) 
shall be accompanied by the notice from the complainant to the cable 
television system operator (Sec. 76.61(a)(1)), and the cable television 
system operator's response (Sec. 76.61(a)(2)), if any. If no timely 
response was received, the complaint should so state.
    (ii) Must-carry complaints filed pursuant to Sec. 76.61(b) 
(Complaints regarding carriage of qualified local NCE television 
stations) should be accompanied by any relevant correspondence between 
the complainant and the cable television system operator.
    (iii) No must-carry complaint filed pursuant to Sec. 76.61(a) 
(complaints regarding local commercial television stations) will be 
accepted by the Commission if filed more than sixty (60) days after the 
date of the specific event described in this paragraph. Must-carry 
complaints filed pursuant to Sec. 76.61(a) should affirmatively state 
the specific event upon which the complaint is based, and shall 
establish that the complaint is being filed within sixty (60) days of 
such specific event. With respect to such must-carry complaints, the 
specific event shall be--
    (A) The denial by a cable television system operator of request for 
carriage or channel position contained in the notice required by 
Sec. 76.61(a)(1), or
    (B) The failure to respond to such notice within the time period 
allowed by Sec. 76.61(a)(2).

applicable provisions of subpart D of this part.
    (d) Interested persons may submit comments or oppositions to a 
petition for special relief or a must-carry complaint within twenty (20) 
days after the date of public notice of the filing of such petition or 
complaint. For good cause shown in the petition for special relief or 
must-carry complaint, the Commission may, by letter or telegram to known 
interested persons, specify an altered time for such submissions. 
Comments or oppositions shall be served on the petitioner or complainant 
and on all persons listed in petitioner's or complainant's certificate 
of service, and shall contain a detailed full showing, supported by 
affidavit, of any facts or considerations relied on.
    (e) The petitioner or complainant may file a reply to the comments 
or oppositions within ten (10) days after their submission, which shall 
be served on all persons who have filed pleadings and shall also contain 
a detailed full showing, supported by affidavit, of any additional facts 
or considerations relied on. For good cause shown, the Commission may 
specify a shorter time for the filing of reply comments.
    (f) The Commission, after consideration of a petition for special 
relief and the responsive pleadings, may determine whether the public 
interest would be served by the grant, in whole or in part, or denial of 
the request, or may issue a ruling on the complaint or dispute. The 
Commission will resolve must-carry complaints pursuant to paragraphs 
(a)(4) and (b)(2) of Sec. 76.61. The Commission may specify other 
procedures, such as oral argument, evidentiary hearing, or further 
written submissions directed to particular aspects, as it deems 
appropriate. In the event that an evidentiary hearing is required, the 
Commission will determine, on the basis of the pleadings and such other 
procedures as it may specify, whether temporary relief should be 
afforded any party pending the hearing and the nature of any such 
temporary relief.
    (g) On a finding that the public interest so requires, the 
Commission may determine that a system community unit operating or 
proposing to operate in a community located outside of the 48 contiguous 
states shall comply with provisions of subparts D, F, and G of this part 
in addition to the provisions thereof otherwise applicable.

    Note: Each party filing a petition, comments, opposition or other 
pleading pursuant to Sec. 76.7 is responsible for the continuing 
accuracy and completeness of all information in such document. The 
provisions of Sec. 1.65 of this chapter are wholly applicable to 
pleadings involving Sec. 76.7, except that where specific provisions of 
the latter conflict with the former, the specific provisions of 
Sec. 76.7 are controlling, e.g., where requirements for service on 
specified parties of certain information may vary.

    (a) A petition for special relief may, upon request of the 
petitioner, be dismissed without prejudice as a matter of right prior to 
the adoption date of any final action taken by the Commission with 
respect to the petition. A petitioner's request for the return of a 
petition will be regarded as a request for dismissal.
    (b) Failure to prosecute a petition, or failure to respond to

Sec. 76.9  Order to show cause; forfeiture proceeding.

    (a) Upon petition by any interested person, the Commission may:
    (1) Issue an order requiring a cable television operator to show 
cause why it should not be directed to cease and desist from violating 
the Commission's rules;
    (2) Initiate a forfeiture proceeding against a cable television 
operator for violation of the Commission's Rules.
    (b) The petition may be submitted informally, by letter, but shall 
be accompanied by a certificate of service on any interested person who 
may be directly affected if an order to show

[[Page 504]]

cause is issued or a forfeiture proceeding initiated. An original and 
two copies of the petition and all subsequent pleadings should be filed.
    (c) The petition shall state fully and precisely all pertinent facts 
and considerations relied on to support a determination that issuance of 
an order to show cause or initiation of a forfeiture proceeding would be 
in the public interest. Factual allegations shall be supported by 
affidavit of a person or persons with actual knowledge of the facts, and 
exhibits shall be verified by the person who prepares them.
    (d) Interested persons may submit comments or oppositions to the 
petition within thirty (30) days after it has been filed. For good cause 
shown in the petition, the Commission may, by letter or telegram to 
known interested persons, specify a shorter time for such submissions. 
Comments or oppositions shall be served on petitioner and on all persons 
listed in petitioner's certificate of service, and shall contain a 
detailed full showing supported by affidavit, of any facts or 
circumstances relied on.
    (e) The petitioner may file a reply to the comments or oppositions 
within twenty (20) days after the time for filing such comments or 
oppositions has ended. A reply shall be served on all persons who have 
filed pleadings and shall also contain a detailed full showing, 
supported by affidavit, of any additional facts or considerations relied 
on. For good cause shown, the Commission may specify a shorter time for 
the filing of reply comments.
    (f) The Commission, after consideration of the pleadings, shall 
determine whether the public interest requires the issuance of an order 
to show cause or the initiation of a forfeiture proceeding.

    Note 1: After issuance of an order to show cause, the rules of 
procedure in title 47, part 1, subpart A, Secs. 1.91-1.95 shall apply.

    Note 2: Nothing in this section is intended to prevent the 
Commission from initiating show cause or forfeiture proceedings on its 
own motion; Provided, however, That show cause proceedings and 
forfeiture proceedings pursuant to Sec. 1.80(g) of the rules will not be 
initiated by such motion until the affected parties are given an 
opportunity to respond to the Commission's charges.

    Note 3: Forfeiture proceedings are generally nonhearing matters 
conducted pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 1.80(f) of the rules 
(Notice of Apparent Liability). Petitioners who contend that the 
alternative hearing procedures of Sec. 1.80(g) of the rules should be 
followed in a particular case must support this contention with a 
specific showing of the facts and considerations relied on.

Sec. 76.54  Significantly viewed signals; method to be followed for special showings.

    (a) Signals that are significantly viewed in a county (and thus are 
deemed to be significantly viewed within all communities within the 
county) are those that are listed in Appendix A of the memorandum 
opinion and order on reconsideration of the Cable Television Report and 
Order (Docket 18397 et al.), FCC 72-530.
    (b) Significant viewing in a cable television community for signals 
not shown as significantly viewed under paragraph (a) or (d) of this 
section may be demonstrated by an independent professional audience 
survey of non-cable television homes that covers at least two weekly 
periods separated by at least thirty (30) days but no more than one of 
which shall be a week between the months of April and September. If two 
surveys are taken, they shall include samples sufficient to assure that 
the combined surveys result in an average figure at least one standard 
error above the required viewing level. If surveys are taken for more 
than 2-weekly periods in any 12 months, all such surveys must result in 
an average figure at least one standard error above the required viewing 
level. If a cable television system serves more than one community, a 
single survey may be taken, provided that the sample includes non-cable 
television homes from each community that are proportional to the 
population.
    (c) Notice of a survey to be made pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
section shall be served on all licensees or permittees of television 
broadcast stations within whose predicted Grade B contour the cable 
community or communities are located, in whole or in part, and on all 
other system community units, franchisees, and franchise applicants in 
the cable community or communities at least (30) days prior to the 
initial survey period. Furthermore, if a survey is undertaken pursuant 
to the provisions of Sec. 76.33(a)(2)(i) of the rules, notice shall also 
be served on the franchising authority. Such notice shall include the 
name of the survey organization and a description of the procedures to 
be used. Objections to survey organizations or procedures shall be 
served on the party sponsoring the survey within twenty (20) days after 
receipt of such notice.
    (d) Signals of television broadcast stations not encompassed by the 
surveys (for the periods May 1970, November 1970 and February/March 
1971) used in establishing appendix B of the Memorandum Opinion and 
Order on Reconsideration of Cable Television Report and Order, FCC 72-
530, 36 FCC 2d 326 (1972), may be demonstrated as significantly viewed 
on a county-wide basis by independent professional audience surveys 
which cover three separate, consecutive four-week periods and are 
otherwise comparable to the surveys used in compiling the above-
referenced appendix B: Provided, however, That such demonstration shall 
be based upon audience survey data for the first three years of the 
subject station's broadcast operations.

Sec. 76.55  Definitions applicable to the must-carry rules.

    For purposes of the must-carry rules set forth in this subpart, the 
following definitions apply:
    (a) Qualified noncommercial educational (NCE) television station. A 
qualified NCE television station is any television broadcast station 
which
    (1)(i) Under the rules and regulations of the Commission in effect 
on March 29, 1990, is licensed by the Commission as an NCE television 
broadcast station and which is owned and operated by a

[[Page 512]]

public agency, nonprofit foundation, corporation, or association; and
    (ii) Has as its licensee an entity which is eligible to receive a 
community service grant, or any successor grant thereto, from the 
Corporation for Public Broadcasting, or any successor organization 
thereto, on the basis of the formula set forth in section 396(k)(6)(B) 
of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended; or
    (2) Is owned and operated by a municipality and transmits 
noncommercial programs for educational programs for educational 
purposes, as defined in Sec. 73.621 of this chapter, for at least 50 
percent of its broadcast week.
    (3) This definition includes:
    (i) The translator of any NCE television station with five watts or 
higher power serving the franchise area,
    (ii) A full-service station or translator if such station or 
translator is licensed to a channel reserved for NCE use pursuant to 
Sec. 73.606 of this chapter, or any successor regulations thereto, and
    (iii) Such stations and translators operating on channels not so 
reserved but otherwise qualified as NCE stations.

    Note to paragraph (a): For the purposes of Sec. 76.55(a), ``serving 
the franchise area'' will be based on the predicted protected contour of 
the NCE translator.

    (b) Qualified local noncommercial educational (NCE) television 
station. A qualified local NCE television station is a qualified NCE 
television station:
    (1) That is licensed to a community whose reference point, as 
defined in Sec. 76.53 is within 80.45 km (50 miles) of the principal 
headend, as defined in Sec. 76.5(pp), of the cable system; or
    (2) Whose Grade B service contour encompasses the principal headend, 
as defined in Sec. 76.5(pp), of the cable system.
    (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a cable operator 
shall not be required to add the signal of a qualified local 
noncommercial educational television station not already carried under 
the provision of Sec. 76.56(a)(5), where such signal would be considered 
a distant signal for copyright purposes unless such station agrees to 
indemnify the cable operator for any increased copyright liability 
resulting from carriage of such signal on the cable system.
    (c) Local commercial television station. A local commercial 
television station is any full power television broadcast station, other 
than a qualified NCE television station as defined in paragraph (a) of 
this section, licensed and operating on a channel regularly assigned to 
its community by the Commission that, with respect to a particular cable 
system, is within the same television market, as defined below in 
paragraph (e) of this section, as the cable system, except that the term 
local commercial television station does not include:
    (1) Low power television stations, television translator stations, 
and passive repeaters with operate pursuant to part 74 of this chapter.
    (2) A television broadcast station that would be considered a 
distant signal under the capable compulsory copyright license, 17 U.S.C. 
111, if such station does not agree to indemnify the cable operator for 
any increased copyright liability resulting from carriage on the cable 
system; or
    (3) A television broadcast station that does not deliver to the 
principal headend, as defined in Sec. 76.5(pp), of a cable system either 
a signal level of -45dBm for UHF signals or -49dBm for VHF signals at 
the input terminals of the signal processing equipment, i.e., the input 
to the first active component of the signal processing equipment 
relevant to the signal at issue, if such station does not agree to be 
responsible for the costs of delivering to the cable system a signal of 
good quality or a baseband video signal.
    (d) Qualified low power station. A qualified low power station is 
any television broadcast station conforming to the low power television 
rules contained in part 74 of this chapter, only if:
    (1) Such station broadcasts for at least the minimum number of hours 
of operation required by the Commission for full power television 
broadcast stations under part 73 of this chapter;
    (2) Such station meets all obligations and requirements applicable 
to full power television broadcast stations under part 73 of this 
chapter, with respect to the broadcast of nonentertainment programming; 
programming and rates involving political candidates, election issues, 
controversial issues of

[[Page 513]]

public importance, editorials, and personal attacks; programming for 
children; and equal employment opportunity; and the Commission 
determines that the provision of such programming by such station would 
address local news and informational needs which are not being 
adequately served by full power television broadcast stations because of 
the geographic distance of such full power stations from the low power 
station's community of license;
    (3) Such station complies with interference regulations consistent 
with its secondary status pursuant to part 74 of this chapter;
    (4) Such station is located no more than 56.32 km (35 miles) from 
the cable system's principal headend, as defined in Sec. 76.5(pp), and 
delivers to that headend an over-the-air signal of good quality;
    (5) The community of license of such station and the franchise area 
of the cable system are both located outside of the largest 160 
Metropolitan Statistical Areas, ranked by population, as determined by 
the Office of Management and Budget on June 30, 1990, and the population 
of such community of license on such date did not exceed 35,000; and
    (6) There is no full power television broadcast station licensed to 
any community within the county or other equivalent political 
subdivision (of a State) served by the cable system.

    Note to paragraph (d): For the purposes of this section, a good 
quality signal shall mean a signal level of either -45 dBm for UHF 
signals or -49 dBm for VHF signals at the input terminals of the signal 
processing equipment, or a baseband video signal.

    (e) Television market. (1) Until January 1, 2000, a commercial 
broadcast television station's market, unless amended pursuant to 
Sec. 76.59, shall be defined as its Area of Dominant Influence (ADI) as 
determined by Arbitron and published in the Arbitron 1991-1992 
Television ADI Market Guide, as noted below, except that for areas 
outside the contiguous 48 states, the market of a station shall be 
defined using Nielsen's Designated Market Area (DMA), where applicable, 
as published in the Nielsen 1991-92 DMA Market and Demographic Rank 
Report, and that Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam will 
each be considered a single market.
    (2) Effective January 1, 2000, a commercial broadcast television 
station's market, unless amended pursuant to Sec. 76.59, shall be 
defined as its Designated Market Area (DMA) as determined by Nielsen 
Media Research and published in its DMA Market and Demographic Rank 
Report or any successor publication, as noted below.
    (3) A cable system's television market(s) shall be the one or more 
ADI markets in which the communities it serves are located until January 
1, 2000, and the one or more DMA markets in which the communities it 
serves are located thereafter.
    (4) In addition, the county in which a station's community of 
license is located will be considered within its market.

    Note to paragraph (e): For the 1996 must-carry/retransimission 
consent election, the ADI assignments specified in the 1991-1992 
Television ADI Market Guide, available from the Arbitron Ratings Co., 
9705 Patuxent Woods Drive, Columbia, MD, will apply. For the 1999 
election, which becomes effective on January 1, 2000, DMA assignments 
specified in the 1997-98 DMA Market and Demographic Rank Report, 
available from Nielsen Media Research, 299 Park Avenue, New York, NY, 
shall be used. The applicable DMA list for the 2002 election will be the 
2000-2001 list, etc.

    (f) Network. For purposes of the must-carry rules, a commercial 
television network is an entity that offers programming on a regular 
basis for 15 or more hours per week to at least 25 affiliates in 10 or 
more states.

<R05>
Sec. 76.56  Signal carriage obligations.

    (a) Carriage of qualified noncommercial educational stations. A 
cable television system shall carry qualified NCE television stations in 
accordance with the following provisions:
    (1) Each cable operator shall carry on its cable television system 
any qualified local NCE television station requesting carriage, except 
that
    (i) Systems with 12 or fewer usable activated channels, as defined 
in Sec. 76.6(oo), shall be required to carry the signal of one such 
station;

[[Page 514]]

    (ii) Systems with 13 to 36 usable activated channels, as defined in 
Sec. 76.5(oo), shall be required to carry at least one qualified local 
NCE station, but not more than three such stations; and
    (iii) Systems with more than 36 usable activated channels shall be 
required to carry the signals of all qualified local NCE television 
stations requesting carriage, but in any event at least three such 
signals; however a cable system with more than 36 channels shall not be 
required to carry an additional qualified local NCE station whose 
programming substantially duplicates the programming of another 
qualified local NCE station being carried on the system.

    Note: For purposes of this paragraph, a station will be deemed to 
``substantially duplicate'' the programming of another station if it 
broadcasts the same programming, simultaneous or non-simultaneous, for 
more than 50 percent of prime time, as defined in Sec. 76.5(n), and more 
than 50 percent outside of prime time over a three-month period.

    (2)(i) In the case of a cable system with 12 or fewer channels that 
operates beyond the presence of any qualified local NCE stations, the 
cable operator shall import one qualified NCE television station.
    (ii) A cable system with between 13 and 36 channels that operates 
beyond the presence of any qualified local NCE stations, the cable 
operator shall import at least one qualified NCE television station.
    (3) A cable system with 12 or fewer usable activated channels shall 
not be required to remove any programming service provided to 
subscribers as of March 29, 1990, to satisfy these requirements, except 
that the first available channel must be used to satisfy these 
requirements.
    (4) A cable system with 13 to 36 usable activated channels which 
carries the signal of a qualified local NCE station affiliated with a 
State public television network shall not be required to carry more than 
one qualified local NCE station affiliated with such network, if the 
programming of such additional stations substantially duplicates, as 
defined in the note in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the programming 
of a qualified local NCE television station receiving carriage.
    (5) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, all cable operators shall continue to provide carriage to all 
qualified local NCE television stations whose signals were carried on 
their systems as of March 29, 1990. In the case of a cable system that 
is required to import a distance qualified NCE signal, and such system 
imported the signal of a qualified NCE station as of March 29, 1990, 
such cable system shall continue to import such signal until such time 
as a qualified local NCE signal is available to the cable system. This 
requirements may be waived with respect to a particular cable operator 
and a particular NCE station, upon the written consent of the cable 
operator and the station.
    (b) Carriage of local commercial television stations. Effective June 
2, 1993, a cable television system shall carry local commercial 
broadcast television stations in accordance with the following 
provisions:
    (1) A cable system with 12 or fewer usable activated channels, as 
defined in Sec. 76.5(oo), shall carry the signals of at least three 
qualified local commercial television stations, except that if such 
system serves 300 or fewer subscribers it shall not be subject to these 
requirements as long as it does not delete from carriage the signal of a 
broadcast television station which was carried on that system on October 
5, 1992.
    (2) A cable system with more than 12 usable activated channels, as 
defined in Sec. 76.5(oo), shall carry local commercial television 
stations up to one-third of the aggregate number of usable activated 
channels of such system.
    (3) If there are not enough local commercial television stations to 
fill the channels set aside under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this 
section, a cable operator of a system with 35 or fewer usable activated 
channels, as defined in Sec. 76.5(oo), shall, if such stations exist, 
carry one qualified low power television station and a cable system with 
more than 35 usable activated channels shall carry two qualified low 
power stations.
    (4) Whenever the number of local commercial television stations 
exceeds the maximum number of signals a cable system is required to 
carry under

[[Page 515]]

paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, the cable operator shall 
have discretion in selecting which such stations shall be carried on its 
cable system, except that
    (i) Under no circumstances shall a cable operator carry a qualified 
low power station in lieu of a local commercial television station; and
    (ii) If the cable operator elects to carry an affiliate of a 
broadcast network, as defined in Sec. 76.55(f), such cable operator 
shall carry the affiliate of such broadcast network whose community of 
license reference point, as defined in Sec. 76.53, is closest to the 
principal headend, as defined in Sec. 76.5(pp), of the cable system.
    (5) A cable operator is not required to carry the signal of any 
local commercial television station that substantially duplicates the 
signal of another local commercial television station that is carried on 
its cable system, or to carry the signals of more than one local 
commercial television station affiliated with a particular broadcast 
network, as defined in Sec. 76.55(f). However, if a cable operator 
declines to carry duplicating signals, such cable operator shall carry 
the station whose community of license reference point, as defined in 
Sec. 76.53, is closest to the principal headend of the cable system. For 
purposes of this paragraph, substantially duplicates means that a 
station regularly simultaneously broadcasts the identical programming as 
another station for more than 50 percent of the broadcast week. For 
purposes of this definition, only identical episodes of a television 
series are considered duplicative and commercial inserts are excluded 
from the comparison. When the stations being compared are licensed to 
communities in different time zones, programming aired by a station 
within one hour of the identical program being broadcast by another 
station will be considered duplicative.
    (6)  [Removed]
    (7) A local commercial television station carried to fulfill the 
requirements of this paragraph, which subsequently elects retransmission 
consent pursuant to Sec. 76.64, shall continue to be carried by the 
cable system until the effective date of such retransmission consent 
election.
    (c) Use of public, educational, or governmental (PEG) channels. A 
cable operator required to carry more than one signal of a qualified low 
power station or to add qualified local NCE stations in fulfillment of 
these must-carry obligations may do so, subject to approval by the 
franchising authority pursuant to Section 611 of the Communications Act 
of 1934, as amended, by placing such additional station on public, 
educational, or governmental channels not in use for their designated 
purposes.
    (d) Availability of signals. (1) Local commercial television 
stations carried in fulfillment of the requirements of this section 
shall be provided to every subscriber of a cable system. Such signals 
shall be viewable via cable on all television receivers of a subscriber 
which are connected to a cable system by a cable operator or for which a 
cable operator provides a connection.
    (2) Qualified local NCE television stations carried in fulfillment 
of the carriage obligations of a cable operator under this section shall 
be available to every subscriber as part of the cable system's lowest 
priced service tier that includes the retransmission of local commercial 
television broadcast signals.
    (3) If a cable operator authorizes subscribers to install additional 
receiver connections, but does not provide the subscriber with such 
connections, or with the equipment and materials for such connections, 
the operator shall notify such subscribers of all broadcast stations 
carried on the cable system which cannot be viewed via cable without a 
converter box and shall offer to sell or lease such a converter box to 
such subscribers. Such notification must be provided by June 2, 1993, 
and annually thereafter and to each new subscriber upon initial 
installation. The notice, which may be included in routine billing 
statements, shall identify the signals that are unavailable without an 
additional connection, the manner for obtaining such additional 
connection and instructions for installation.

[[Page 516]]

    (e) Identification of must-carry signals. A cable operator shall 
respond in writing within 30 days to any written request by any person 
for the identification of the signals carried on its system in 
fulfillment of the requirements of this section. Pursuant to 
Sec. 76.302, a cable operator must place a list of the broadcast 
television signals carried in fulfillment of these must-carry 
obligations in its public file.
    (f) Carriage of additional broadcast television signals on such 
system shall be at the discretion of the cable operator, subject to the 
retransmission consent rules, Sec. 76.64. A cable system may also carry 
any ancillary service transmission on the vertical blanking interval or 
the aural baseband of any television broadcast signal, including, but 
not limited to, multichannel television sound and teletext.

Sec. 76.57  Channel positioning.

    (a) At the election of the licensee of a local commercial broadcast 
television station, and for the purpose of this section, a qualified low 
power television station, carried in fulfillment of the must-carry 
obligations, a cable operator shall carry such signal on the cable 
system channel number on which the local commercial television station 
is broadcast over the air, or on the channel on which it was carried on 
July 19, 1985, or on the channel on which it was carried on January 1, 
1992.
    (b) At the election of the licensee of a qualified local NCE 
broadcast television station carried in fulfillment of the must-carry 
obligations, a cable operator shall carry such signal on the cable 
system channel number on which the qualified NCE television station is 
broadcast over the air, or on the channel on which it was carried on 
July 19, 1985.
    (c) Any signal carried in fulfillment of the must-carry obligations 
may be carried on such other channel number as is mutually agreed upon 
by the station and the cable operator.
    (d) At the time a local commercial station elects must-carry status 
pursuant to Sec. 76.64, such station shall notify the cable system of 
its choice of channel position as specified in paragraphs (a)-(c) of 
this section. A qualified NCE stations shall notify the cable system of 
its choice of channel position when it requests carriage. Channel 
positioning requests from local commercial stations shall be fulfilled 
by the cable operator no later than October 6, 1993.

    Note: Any existing agreement for channel position between a local 
commercial station entitled to must-carry status and a cable operator 
entered into prior to June 26, 1990, may continue through the expiration 
of such agreement.

    (e) Pursuant to Sec. 76.64(f)(3), a local commercial broadcast 
television station that fails to make an election is deemed a must-carry 
station. A cable operator shall carry such a television station on the 
cable system channel number on which the local commercial television 
station is broadcast over the air, or on the channel on which it was 
carried on July 19, 1985, or on the channel on which it was carried on 
January 1, 1992. In the event that none of these specified channel 
positions is available due to a channel positioning request from a 
commercial television station affirmatively asserting its must-carry 
rights or such a request from a qualified local noncommercial 
educational station, the cable operator shall place the signal of such a 
television station on a channel of the cable system's choice, so long as 
that channel is included on the basic service tier.

[58 FR 17361, Apr. 2, 1993, as amended at 58 FR 40368, July 28, 1993; 59 
FR 62345, Dec. 5, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 76.58  Notification.

    (a) Effective April 2, 1993, a cable operator shall provide written 
notice to any broadcast television station at least 30 days prior to 
either deleting from carriage or repositioning that station. Such 
notification shall also be provided to subscribers of the cable system.

    Note: No deletion or repositioning of a local commercial television 
station shall occur during a period in which major television ratings 
services measure the size of audiences of local television stations. For 
this purpose, such periods are the four national four-week ratings 
periods--generally including February, May, July and November--commonly 
known as audience sweeps.


[[Page 517]]


    (b) By May 3, 1993, a cable operator must notify all qualified NCE 
stations of its designated principal headend by certified mail.
    (c) A cable operator shall provide written notice by certified mail 
to all stations carried on its system pursuant to the must-carry rules 
at least 60 days prior to any change in the designation of its principal 
headend, and shall include the new designation in its public file.
    (d) By May 3, 1993, a cable operator must notify all local 
commercial and NCE stations that may not be entitled to carriage because 
they either
    (1) Fail to meet the standards for delivery of a good quality signal 
to the cable system's principal headend or
    (2) May cause an increased copyright liability to the cable system.
    (e) By June 2, 1993, a cable operator must send by certified mail a 
copy of a list of all broadcast television stations carried by its 
system and their channel positions to all local commercial and 
noncommercial television stations, including those not designated as 
must-carry stations and those not carried on the system.

Sec. 76.59  Modification of television markets.

    (a) The Commission, following a written request from a broadcast 
station or a cable system, may deem that the television market of a 
particular commercial television broadcast station should include 
additional communities within its television market or exclude 
communities from such station's television market. In this respect, 
communities may be considered part of more than one television market.
    (b) Such requests for modification of a television market shall be 
submitted in accordance with Sec. 76.7, petitions for special relief.
    (c) A cable operator shall not delete from carriage the signal of a 
commercial television station during the pendency of any proceeding 
pursuant to this section.

<R05>
Sec. 76.60  Compensation for carriage.

    A cable operator is prohibited from accepting or requesting monetary 
payment or other valuable consideration in exchange either for carriage 
or channel positioning of any broadcast television station carried in 
fulfillment of the must-carry requirements, except that
    (a) Any such station may be required to bear the costs associated 
with delivering a good quality signal or a baseband video signal to the 
principal headend of the cable system; or
    (b) A cable operator may accept payments from stations which would 
be considered distant signals under the cable compulsory copyright 
license, 17 U.S.C. 111, as indemnification for any increased copyright 
liability resulting from carriage of such signal.

    Note: A cable operator may continue to accept monetary payment or 
other valuable consideration in exchange for carriage or channel 
positioning of the signal of any local commercial television station 
carried in fulfillment of the must-carry requirements, through, but not 
beyond, the date of expiration of an agreement between a cable operator 
and a local commercial television station entered into prior to June 26, 
1990.

    (c) A cable operator may accept payments from stations pursuant to a 
retransmission consent agreement, even if such station will be counted 
towards the must-carry complement, as long as all other applicable rules 
are adhered to.

Sec. 76.61  Disputes concerning carriage.

    (a) Complaints regarding carriage of local commercial television 
stations. (1) Whenever a local commercial television station or a 
qualified low power television station believes that a cable operator 
has failed to meet its carriage or channel positioning obligations, 
pursuant to Secs. 76.56 and 76.57, such station shall notify the 
operator, in writing, of the alleged failure and identify its reasons 
for believing that the cable operator is obligated to carry the signal 
of such station or position such signal on a particular channel.

[[Page 518]]

    (2) The cable operator shall, within 30 days of receipt of such 
written notification, respond in writing to such notification and either 
commence to carry the signal of such station in accordance with the 
terms requested or state its reasons for believing that it is not 
obligated to carry such signal or is in compliance with the channel 
positioning and repositioning and other requirements of the must-carry 
rules. If a refusal for carriage is based on the station's distance from 
the cable system's principal headend, the operator's response shall 
include the location of such headend. If a cable operator denies 
carriage on the basis of the failure of the station to deliver a good 
quality signal at the cable system's principal headend, the cable 
operator must provide a list of equipment used to make the measurements, 
the point of measurement and a list and detailed description of the 
reception and over-the-air signal processing equipment used, including 
sketches such as block diagrams and a description of the methodology 
used for processing the signal at issue, in its response.
    (3) A local commercial television station or qualified low power 
television station that is denied carriage or channel positioning or 
repositioning in accordance with the must-carry rules by a cable 
operator may file a complaint with the Commission in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in Sec. 76.7 relating to must-carry complaints. In 
addition to the requirements of Sec. 76.7, such complaint shall 
specifically allege the manner in which such cable operator has failed 
to meet its obligations and the basis for such allegations.
    (4) If the Commission determines that a cable operator has failed to 
meet its must-carry obligations, the Commission shall order that, within 
45 days of such order or such other time period as the Commission may 
specify, the cable operator reposition the complaining station or, in 
the case of an obligation to carry a station, commence or resume 
carriage of the station and continue such carriage for at least 12 
months. If the Commission determines that the cable operator has fully 
met the must-carry requirements, it shall dismiss the complaint.
    (b) Complaints regarding carriage of qualified local NCE television 
stations. (1) Whenever a qualified local NCE television station believes 
that a cable operator has failed to comply with the signal carriage or 
channel positioning requirements, pursuant to Secs.  76.56-76.57, the 
station may file a complaint with the Commission in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in Sec. 76.7. In addition to the requirements of 
Sec. 76.7, such complaint shall specifically allege the manner in which 
such cable operator has failed to comply with such requirements and 
state the basis for such allegations.
    (2) If the Commission determines that a cable operator has failed to 
meet its must-carry obligations, the Commission shall order that, within 
45 days of such order or such other period as the Commission may 
specify, the cable operator reposition the complaining station or, in 
the case of an obligation to carry a station, commence or resume 
carriage of the station and continue such carriage for a period of time 
the Commission deems appropriate for the specific case under 
consideration. If the Commission determines that the cable operator has 
fully met the must-carry requirements, it shall dismiss the complaint.

Sec. 76.64  Retransmission consent.

    (a) After 12:01 a.m. on October 6, 1993, no multichannel video 
programming distributor shall retransmit the signal of any commercial 
broadcasting station without the express authority of the originating 
station, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) A commercial broadcast signal may be retransmitted without 
express authority of the originating station if--
    (1) The distributor is a cable system and the signal is that of a 
commercial television station (including a low-power television station) 
that is being carried pursuant to the Commission's must-carry rules set 
forth in Sec. 76.56;
    (2) The multichannel video programming distributor obtains the 
signal of a superstation that is distributed by a satellite carrier and 
the originating station was a superstation on May 1, 1991, and the 
distribution is made only to areas outside the local market of the 
originating station; or
    (3) The distributor is a satellite carrier and the signal is 
transmitted directly to a home satellite antenna, provided that:
    (i) The broadcast station is not owned or operated by, or affiliated 
with, a broadcasting network and its signal was retransmitted by a 
satellite carrier on May 1, 1991, or
    (ii) The broadcast station is owned or operated by, or affiliated 
with a broadcasting network, and the household receiving the signal is 
an unserved household.
    (c) For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
    (1) A satellite carrier is an entity that uses the facilities of a 
satellite or satellite service licensed by the Federal Communications 
Commission, to establish and operate a channel of communications for 
point-to-multipoint distribution of television station signals, and that 
owns or leases a capacity or service on a satellite in order to provide 
such point-to-multipoint distribution, except to the extent that such 
entity provides such distribution pursuant to tariff under the 
Communications Act of 1934, other than for private home viewing;
    (2) A superstation is a television broadcast station other than a 
network station, licensed by the Federal Communications Commission that 
is secondarily transmitted by a satellite carrier;
    (3) An unserved household with respect to a television network is a 
household that
    (i) Cannot receive, through the use of a conventional outdoor 
rooftop receiving antenna, an over-the-air signal of grade B intensity 
of a primary network station affiliated with that network, and
    (ii) Has not, within 90 days before the date on which that household 
subscribes, either initially or on renewal, received secondary 
transmissions by a satellite carrier of a network station

[[Page 520]]

affiliated with that network, subscribed to a cable system that provides 
the signal of a primary network station affiliated with the network.
    (4) A primary network station is a network station that broadcasts 
or rebroadcasts the basic programming service of a particular national 
network;
    (5) The terms ``network station,'' and ``secondary transmission'' 
have the meanings given them in 17 U.S.C. 111(f).
    (d) A multichannel video program distributor is an entity such as, 
but not limited to, a cable operator, a multichannel multipoint 
distribution service, a direct broadcast satellite service, a television 
receive-only satellite program distributor, or a satellite master 
antenna television system operator, that makes available for purchase, 
by subscribers or customers, multiple channels of video programming.
    (e) The retransmission consent requirements of this section are not 
applicable to broadcast signals received by master antenna television 
facilities or by direct over-the-air reception in conjunction with the 
provision of service by a multichannel video program distributor 
provided that the multichannel video program distributor makes reception 
of such signals available without charge and at the subscribers option 
and provided further that the antenna facility used for the reception of 
such signals is either owned by the subscriber or the building owner; or 
under the control and available for purchase by the subscriber or the 
building owner upon termination of service.
    (f) Commercial television stations are required to make elections 
between retransmission consent and must-carry status according to the 
following schedule:
    (1) The initial election must be made by June 17, 1993.
    (2) Subsequent elections must be made at three year intervals; the 
second election must be made by October 1, 1996 and will take effect on 
January 1, 1997; the third election must be made by October 1, 1999 and 
will take effect on January 1, 2000, etc.
    (3) Television stations that fail to make an election by the 
specified deadline will be deemed to have elected must carry status for 
the relevant three-year period.
    (4) New television stations shall make their initial election any 
time between 60 days prior to commencing broadcast and 30 days after 
commencing broadcast; such initial election shall take effect 90 days 
after they are made.
    (5) Television broadcast stations that become eligible for must 
carry status with respect to a cable system or systems due to a change 
in the market definition may, within 30 days of the effective date of 
the new definition, elect must-carry status with respect to such system 
or systems. Such elections shall take effect 90 days after they are 
made.
    (g) If one or more franchise areas served by a cable system overlaps 
with one or more franchise areas served by another cable system, 
television broadcast stations are required to make the same election for 
both cable systems.
    (h) On or before each must-carry/retransmission consent election 
deadline, each television broadcast station shall place copies of all of 
its election statements in the station's public file, and shall send via 
certified mail to each cable system in the station's defined market a 
copy of the station's election statement with respect to that operator.
    (i) Notwithstanding a television station's election of must-carry 
status, if a cable operator proposes to retransmit that station's signal 
without according the station must-carry rights (i.e., pursuant to 
Sec. 76.56(f)), the operator must obtain the station's express authority 
prior to retransmitting its signal.
    (j) A cable system that changes its technical configuration in such 
a way as to integrate two formerly separate cable systems must give 90 
days notice of its intention to do so to any television broadcast 
stations that have elected must-carry status with respect to one system 
and retransmission consent status with respect to the other. If the 
system and the station do not agree on a uniform election 45 days prior 
to integration, the cable system may require the station to make such a 
uniform election 30 days prior to integration.

[[Page 521]]

    (k) Retransmission consent agreements between a broadcast station 
and a multichannel video programming distributor shall be in writing and 
shall specify the extent of the consent being granted, whether for the 
entire signal or any portion of the signal.
    (l) A cable system commencing new operation is required to notify 
all local commercial and noncommercial broadcast stations of its intent 
to commence service. The cable operator must send such notification, by 
certified mail, at least 60 days prior to commencing cable service. 
Commercial broadcast stations must notify the cable system within 30 
days of the receipt of such notice of their election for either must-
carry or retransmission consent with respect to such new cable system. 
If the commercial broadcast station elects must-carry, it must also 
indicate its channel position in its election statement to the cable 
system. Such election shall remain valid for the remainder of any three-
year election interval, as established in Sec. 76.64(f)(2). 
Noncommercial educational broadcast stations should notify the cable 
operator of their request for carriage and their channel position. The 
new cable system must notify each station if its signal quality does not 
meet the standards for carriage and if any copyright liability would be 
incurred for the carriage of such signal. Pursuant to Sec. 76.57(e), a 
commercial broadcast station which fails to respond to such a notice 
shall be deemed to be a must-carry station for the remainder of the 
current three-year election period.
    (m) Exclusive retransmission consent agreements are prohibited. No 
television broadcast station shall make an agreement with one 
multichannel distributor for carriage, to the exclusion of other 
multichannel distributors.
    (n) A multichannel video programming distributor providing an all-
band FM radio broadcast service (a service that does not involve the 
individual processing of specific broadcast signals) shall obtain 
retransmission consents from all FM radio broadcast stations that are 
included on the service that have transmitters located within 92 
kilometers (57 miles) of the receiving antenna for such service. 
Stations outside of this 92 kilometer (57 miles) radius shall be 
presumed not to be carried in an all-band reception mode but may 
affirmatively assert retransmission consent rights by providing 30 days 
advance notice to the distributor.

Sec. 76.67  Sports broadcasts.

    (a) No community unit located in whole or in part within the 
specified zone of a television broadcast station licensed to a community 
in which a sports event is taking place, shall, on request of the holder 
of the broadcast rights to that event, or its agent, carry the live 
television broadcast of that event if the event is not available live on 
a television broadcast signal carried by the community unit meeting the 
criteria specified in Secs. 76.5(gg)(1) through 76.5(gg)(3) of this 
part. For purposes of this section, if there is no television station 
licensed to the community in which the sports event is taking place, the 
applicable specified zone shall be that of the television station 
licensed to the community with which the sports event or team is 
identified, or, if the event or local team is not identified with any 
particular community, the nearest community to which a television 
station is licensed.
    (b) Notification of the programming to be deleted pursuant to this 
section shall include the following information:
    (1) As to programming to be deleted from television broadcast 
signals regularly carried by the community unit:

revisions of notices previously submitted, must be received within 
twenty-four (24) hours after the time of the telecast to be deleted is 
known, but in any event no later than twenty-four (24) hours from the 
time the subject telecast is to take place.
    (d) Whenever, pursuant to this section, a community unit is required 
to delete a television program on a signal regularly carried by the 
community unit, such community unit may, consistent with the rules 
contained in Subpart F of this part, substitute a program from any other 
television broadcast station. A program substituted may be carried to 
its completion, and the community unit need not return to its regularly 
carried signal until it can do so without interrupting a program already 
in progress.
    (e) The provisions of this section shall not be deemed to require 
the deletion of any portion of a television signal which a community 
unit was lawfully carrying prior to March 31, 1972.
    (f) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any community 
unit having fewer than 1,000 subscribers.

    Source:  50 FR 40855, Oct. 7, 1985, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 76.71  Scope of application.

    (a) The provisions of this subpart shall apply to any corporation, 
partnership, association, joint-stock company, or trust engaged 
primarily in the management or operation of any cable system. Cable 
entities subject to these provisions include those systems defined in 
Sec. 76.5(a), all satellite master antenna television systems serving 50 
or more subscribers, and any multichannel video programming distributor. 
For purposes of the provisions of this subpart, a multichannel video 
programming distributor is an entity such as, but not limited to, a 
cable operator, a multipoint distribution service, a multichannel 
multipoint distribution

[[Page 523]]

service, a direct broadcast satellite service, a television receive-only 
satellite program distributor, or a video dialtone program service 
provider, who makes available for purchase, by subscribers or customers, 
multiple channels of video programming, whether or not a licensee. 
Multichannel video programming distributors do not include any entity 
which lacks control over the video programming distributed. For purposes 
of this subpart, an entity has control over the video programming it 
distributes, if it selects video programming channels or programs and 
determines how they are presented for sale to consumers. 
Nothwithstanding the foregoing, the regulations in this subpart are not 
applicable to the owners or originators (of programs or channels of 
programming) that distribute six or fewer channels of commonly-owned 
video programming over a leased transport facility. For purposes of this 
subpart, programming services are ``commonly-owned'' if the same entity 
holds a majority of the stock (or is a general partner) of each program 
service.
    (b) Employment units. The provisions of this subpart shall apply to 
cable entities as employment units. Each cable entity may be considered 
a separate employment unit; however, where two or more cable entities 
are under common ownership or control and are interrelated in their 
local management, operation, and utilization of employees, they shall 
constitute a single employment unit.
    (c) Headquarters office. A multiple cable operator shall treat as a 
separate employment unit each headquarters office to the extent the work 
of that office is primarily related to the operation of more than one 
employment unit as described in paragraph (b) of this section.

Sec. 76.73  General EEO policy.

    (a) Equal opportunity in employment shall be afforded by each cable 
entity to all qualified persons, and no person shall be discriminated 
against in employment by such entity because of race, color, religion, 
national origin, age or sex.
    (b) Each employment unit shall establish, maintain, and carry out a 
positive continuing program of specific practices designed to assure 
equal opportunity to every aspect of cable system employment policy and 
practice. Under the terms of its program, an employment unit shall:
    (1) Define the responsibility of each level of management to ensure 
a positive application and vigorous enforcement of its policy of equal 
opportunity, and establish a procedure to review and control managerial 
and supervisory performance;
    (2) Inform its employees and recognized employee organizations of 
the positive equal employment opportunity policy and program and enlist 
their cooperation;
    (3) Communicate its equal employment opportunity policy and progam 
and its employment needs to sources of qualified applicants without 
regard to race, color, religion, national origin, age or sex, and 
solicit their recruitment assistance on a continuing basis;
    (4) Conduct a continuing program to exclude every form of prejudice 
or discrimination based upon race, color, religion, national origin, age 
or sex from its personnel policies and practices and working conditions; 
and
    (5) Conduct a continuing review of job structure and employment 
practices and adopt positive recruitment, training, job design, and 
other measures needed to ensure genuine equality of opportunity to 
participate fully in all organizational units, occupations, and levels 
of responsibility.


<R05>
Sec. 76.75  EEO program requirements.

    An employment unit's equal employment opportunity program should 
reasonably address itself to the specific areas set forth below, to the 
extent possible and to the extent that they are appropriate in terms of 
employment unit size, location, etc.:
    (a) Disseminate its equal employment opportunity program to job 
applicants, employees, and those with whom it regularly does business. 
For example, this requirement may be met by:
    (1) Posting notices in the employment unit's office and places of 
employment informing employees, and applicants for employment, of their 
equal

[[Page 524]]

employment opportunity rights, and their right to notify the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission, the Federal Communications 
Commission, or other appropriate agency, if they believe they have been 
discriminated against. Where a significant percentage of employees, 
employment applicants, or residents of the community of a cable 
television system of the relevant labor area are Hispanic, such notices 
should be posted in Spanish and English. Similar use should be made of 
other languages in such posted equal employment opportunity notices, 
where appropriate;
    (2) Placing a notice in bold type on the employment application 
informing prospective employees that discrimination because of race, 
color, religion, national origin, age or sex is prohibited and that they 
may notify the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Federal 
Communications Commission, or other appropriate agency if they believe 
they have been discriminated against.
    (b) Use minority organizations, organizations for women, media, 
educational institutions, and other potential sources of minority and 
female applicants, to supply referrals whenever job vacancies are 
available in its operation. For example, this requirement may be met by:
    (1) Placing employment advertisements in media that have significant 
circulation among minority-group people in the recruiting area;
    (2) Recruiting through schools and colleges with significant 
minority-group enrollments;
    (3) Maintaining systematic contacts with minority and human 
relations organizations, leaders, and spokesmen to encourage referral of 
qualified minority or female applicants;
    (4) Encouraging current employees to refer minority or female 
applicants;
    (5) Making known to the appropriate recruitment sources in the 
employer's immediate area that qualified minority members and females 
are being sought for consideration whenever the employment unit hires.
    (c) Evaluate its employment profile and job turnover against the 
availability of minorities and women in its franchise area. For example, 
this requirement may be met by:
    (1) Comparing composition of relevant labor area with the 
composition of the entity's employees;
    (2) Comparing its employees, within each job category, with the 
people available for such positions;
    (3) Where there is underrepresentation of either minorities and/or 
women, examining the company's personnel policies and practices to 
assure that they do not inadvertently screen out any protected group and 
take appropriate action where necessary.

    Note: These data are generally available on a metropolitan 
statistical area (MSA), primany metropolitan statistical area (PMSA) or 
county basis.

    (d) Undertake to offer promotions of minorities and women in a non-
discriminatory fashion to positions of greater responsibility. For 
example, this requirement may be met by:
    (1) Instructing those who make decisions on placement and promotion 
that minority employees and females are to be considered without 
discrimination, and that job areas in which there is little or no 
minority or female representation should be reviewed to determine 
whether this results from discrimination;
    (2) Giving minority groups and female employees equal opportunity 
for positions which lead to higher positions. Inquiring as to the 
interest and skills of all lower paid employees with respect to any of 
the higher paid positions, followed by assistance, counselling, and 
effective measures to enable employees with interest and potential to 
qualify themselves for such positions;
    (3) Providing opportunity to perform overtime work on a basis that 
does not discriminate against qualified minority group or female 
employees.
    (e) Encourage minority and female entrepreneurs to conduct business 
with all parts of its operation. For example, this requirement may be 
met by:
    (1) Recruiting as wide as possible a pool of qualified entrepreneurs 
from sources such as employee referrals, community groups, contractors, 
associations, and other sources likely to be representative of minority 
and female interests.

[[Page 525]]

    (f) Analyze the results of its efforts to recruit, hire, promote, 
and use the services of minorities and women and explain any 
difficulties encountered in implementing its equal employment 
opportunity program. For example, this requirement may be met by:
    (1) Where union agreements exist, cooperating with the union or 
unions in the development of programs to assure qualified minority 
persons or females of equal opportunity for employment, and including an 
effective nondiscrimination clause in new or renegotiated union 
agreements;
    (2) Avoiding use of selection techniques or tests that have the 
effect of discriminating against qualified minority groups or females;
    (3) Reviewing seniority practices to ensure that such practices are 
nondiscriminatory;

Sec. 76.159  Requirements for invocation of protection.

    For a station licensee to be eligible to invoke the provisions of 
this subpart, it must have a contract or other written indicia that it 
holds syndicated exclusivity rights for the exhibition of the program in 
question. Contracts entered on or after August 18, 1988, must contain 
the following words: ``the licensee [or substitute name] shall, by the 
terms of this contract, be entitled to invoke the protection against 
duplication of programming imported under the Compulsory Copyright 
License, as provided in Sec. 76.151 of the FCC rules [or `as provided in 
the FCC's syndicated exclusivity rules'].'' Contracts entered into prior 
to August 18, 1988, must contain either the foregoing language or a 
clear and specific reference to the licensee's authority to exercise 
exclusivity rights as to the specific programming against cable 
television broadcast signal carriage by the cable system in question 
upon the contingency that the government reimposed syndicated 
exclusivity protection. In the absence of such a specific reference in 
contracts entered into prior to August 18, 1988, the provisions of these 
rules may be invoked only if (a) the contract

[[Page 532]]

specific written acknowledgment is obtained from the party from whom the 
broadcast exhibition rights were obtained that the existing contract was 
intended, or should now be construed by agreement of the parties, to 
include such rights. A general acknowledgment by a supplier of 
exhibition rights that specific contract language was intended to convey 
rights under these rules will be accepted with respect to all contracts 
containing that specific language. Nothing in this Section shall be 
construed as a grant of exclusive rights to a broadcaster where such 
rights are not agreed to by the parties.

    (4) On-the-spot coverage of bona fide news events (including, but 
not limited to political conventions and activities incidental thereto) 
shall not be deemed to be use of a system. (section 315(a) of the 
Communications Act.)
    (b) Uses. As used in this section and Sec. 76.206, the term ``use'' 
means a candidate appearance (including by voice or picture) that is not 
exempt under paragraphs 76.205 (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section.
    (c) Timing of Request. A request for equal opportunities must be 
submitted to the system within 1 week of the day on which the first 
prior use giving rise to the right of equal opportunities occurred: 
Provided, however, That where the person was not a candidate at the time 
of such first prior use, he or she shall submit his or her request 
within 1 week of the first subsequent use after he or she has become a 
legally qualified candidate for the office in question.
    (d) Burden of proof. A candidate requesting equal opportunities of 
the system or complaining of noncompliance to the Commission shall have 
the burden of proving that he or she and his or her opponent are legally 
qualified candidates for the same public office.
    (e) Discrimination between candidates. In making time available to 
candidates for public office, no system shall make any discrimination 
between candidates in practices, regulations, facilities, or services 
for or in connection with the service rendered pursuant to this part, or 
make or give any preference to any candidate for public office or 
subject any such candidate to any prejudice or disadvantage; nor shall 
any system make any contract or other agreement which shall have the 
effect of permitting any legally qualified candidate for

[[Page 533]]

any public office to cablecast to the exclusion of other legally 
qualified candidates for the same public office.

Sec. 76.206  Candidate rates.

    (a) Charges for use of cable television systems. The charges, if 
any, made for the use of any system by any person who is a legally 
qualified candidate for any public office in connection with his or her 
campaign for nomination for election, or election, to such office shall 
not exceed:
    (1) During the 45 days preceding the date of a primary or primary 
runoff election and during the 60 days preceding the date of a general 
or special election in which such person is a candidate, the lowest unit 
charge of the system for the same class and amount of time for the same 
period.
    (i) A candidate shall be charged no more per unit than the system 
charges its most favored commercial advertisers for the same classes and 
amounts of time for the same periods. Any system practices offered to 
commercial advertisers that enhance the value of advertising spots must 
be disclosed and made available to candidates upon equal terms. Such 
practices include but are not limited to any discount privileges that 
affect the value of advertising, such as bonus spots, time-sensitive 
make goods, preemption priorities, or any other factors that enhance the 
value of the announcement.
    (ii) The Commission recognizes non-preemptible, preemptible with 
notice, immediately preemptible and run-of-schedule as distinct classes 
of time.
    (iii) Systems may establish and define their own reasonable classes 
of immediately preemptible time so long as the differences between such 
classes are based on one or more demonstrable benefits associated with 
each class and are not based solely upon price or identity of the 
advertiser. Such demonstrable benefits include, but are not limited to, 
varying levels of preemption protection, scheduling flexibility, or 
associated privileges, such as guaranteed time-sensitive make goods. 
Systems may not use class distinctions to defeat the purpose of the 
lowest unit charge requirement. All classes must be fully disclosed and 
made available to candidates.
    (iv) Systems may establish reasonable classes of preemptible with 
notice time so long as they clearly define all such classes, fully 
disclose them and make them available to candidates.
    (v) Systems may treat non-preemptible and fixed position as distinct 
classes of time provided that systems articulate clearly the differences 
between such classes, fully disclose them, and make them available to 
candidates.
    (vi) Systems shall not establish a separate, premium-priced class of 
time sold only to candidates. Systems may sell higher-priced non-
preemptible or fixed time to candidates if such a class of time is made 
available on a bona fide basis to both candidates and commercial 
advertisers, and provided such class is not functionally equivalent to 
any lower-priced class of time sold to commercial advertisers.
    (vii)  [Reserved]
    (viii) Lowest unit charge may be calculated on a weekly basis with 
respect to time that is sold on a weekly basis, such as rotations 
through particular programs or dayparts. Systems electing to calculate 
the lowest unit charge by such a method must include in that calculation 
all rates for all announcements scheduled in the rotation, including 
announcements aired under long-term advertising contracts. Systems may 
implement rate increases during election periods only to the extent that 
such increases constitute ``ordinary business practices,'' such as 
seasonal program changes or changes in audience ratings.
    (ix) Systems shall review their advertising records periodically 
throughout the election period to determine whether compliance with this 
section requires that candidates receive rebates or credits. Where 
necessary, systems shall issue such rebates or credits promptly.
    (x) Unit rates charged as part of any package, whether individually 
negotiated or generally available to all advertisers, must be included 
in the lowest unit charge calculation for the same class and length of 
time in the same time period. A candidate cannot be required to purchase 
advertising in

[[Page 534]]

every program or daypart in a package as a condition for obtaining 
package unit rates.
    (xi) Systems are not required to include non-cash promotional 
merchandising incentives in lowest unit charge calculations; provided, 
however, that all such incentives must be offered to candidates as part 
of any purchases permitted by the system. Bonus spots, however, must be 
included in the calculation of the lowest unit charge calculation.
    (xii) Make goods, defined as the rescheduling of preempted 
advertising, shall be provided to candidates prior to election day if a 
system has provided a time-sensitive make good during the year preceding 
the pre-election periods, respectively set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section, to any commercial advertiser who purchased time in the 
same class.
    (xiii) Systems must disclose and make available to candidates any 
make good policies provided to commercial advertisers. If a system 
places a make good for any commercial advertiser or other candidate in a 
more valuable program or daypart, the value of such make good must be 
included in the calculation of the lowest unit charge for that program 
or daypart.
    (2) At any time other than the respective periods set forth in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, systems may charge legally qualified 
candidates for public office no more than the charges made for 
comparable use of the system by commercial advertisers. The rates, if 
any, charged all such candidates for the same office shall be uniform 
and shall not be rebated by any means, direct or indirect. A candidate 
shall be charged no more than the rate the system would charge for 
comparable commercial advertising. All discount privileges otherwise 
offered by a system to commercial advertisers must be disclosed and made 
available upon equal terms to all candidates for public office.
    (b) If a system permits a candidate to use its cablecast facilities, 
the system shall make all discount privileges offered to commercial 
advertisers, including the lowest unit charges for each class and length 
of time in the same time period and all corresponding discount 
privileges, available on equal terms to all candidates. This duty 
includes an affirmative duty to disclose to candidates information about 
rates, terms, conditions and all value-enhancing discount privileges 
offered to commercial advertisers. Systems may use reasonable discretion 
in making the disclosure; provided, however, that the disclosure 
includes, at a minimum, the following information:
    (1) A description and definition of each class of time available to 
commercial advertisers sufficiently complete enough to allow candidates 
to identify and understand what specific attributes differentiate each 
class;
    (2) A description of the lowest unit charge and related privileges 
(such as priorities against preemption and make goods prior to specific 
deadlines) for each class of time offered to commercial advertisers;
    (3) A description of the system's method of selling preemptible time 
based upon advertiser demand, commonly known as the ``current selling 
level,'' with the stipulation that candidates will be able to purchase 
at these demand-generated rates in the same manner as commercial 
advertisers;
    (4) An approximation of the likelihood of preemption for each kind 
of preemptible time; and
    (5) An explanation of the system's sales practices, if any, that are 
based on audience delivery, with the stipulation that candidates will be 
able to purchase this kind of time, if available to commercial 
advertisers.
    (c) Once disclosure is made, systems shall negotiate in good faith 
to actually sell time to candidates in accordance with the disclosure.

<R05>
Sec. 76.207  Political file.

    (a) Every cable television system shall keep and permit public 
inspection of a complete and orderly record (political file) of all 
requests for cablecast time made by or on behalf of a candidate for 
public office, together with an appropriate notation showing the 
disposition made by the system of such requests, and the charges made, 
if any,

[[Page 535]]

if the request is granted. The ``disposition'' includes the schedule of 
time purchased, when spots actually aired, the rates charged, and the 
classes of time purchased.
    (b) When free time is provided for use by or on behalf of 
candidates, a record of the free time provided shall be placed in the 
political file.
    (c) All records required by this paragraph shall be placed in the 
political file as soon as possible and shall be retained for a period of 
two years. As soon as possible means immediately absent unusual 
circumstances.

[57 FR 212, Jan. 3, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 76.209  Fairness doctrine; personal attacks; political editorials.

    (a) A cable television system operator engaging in origination 
cablecasting shall afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of 
conflicting views on issues of public importance.

    Note: See public notice, ``Applicability of the Fairness Doctrine in 
the Handling of Controversial Issues of Public Importance,'' 29 FR 
10415.

    (b) When, during such origination cablecasting, an attack is made 
upon the honesty, character, integrity, or like personal qualities of an 
identified person or group, the cable television system operator shall, 
within a reasonable time and in no event later than one (1) week after 
the attack, transmit to the person or group attacked:
    (1) Notification of the date, time, and identification of the 
cablecast;
    (2) A script or tape (or an accurate summary if a script or tape is 
not available) of the attack; and
    (3) An offer of a reasonable opportunity to respond over the 
system's facilities.
    (c) The provisions of paragraph (b) of this section shall not apply 
to cablecast material which falls within one or more of the following 
categories:
    (1) Personal attacks on foreign groups or foreign public figures;
    (2) Personal attacks occurring during uses by legally qualified 
candidates.
    (3) Personal attacks made during cablecasts not included in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section and made by legally qualified 
candidates, their authorized spokespersons or those associated with them 
in the campaign, on other such candidates, their authorized 
spokespersons or persons associated with the candidates in the campaign; 
and
    (4) Bona fide newscasts, bona fide news interviews, and on-the-spot 
coverage of bona fide news events (including commentary or analysis 
contained in the foregoing programs, but, the provisions of paragraph 
(b) of this section shall be applicable to editorials of the cable 
television system operator).
    (d) Where a cable television system operator, in an editorial, (1) 
endorses or (2) opposes a legally qualified candidate or candidates, the 
system operator shall, within 24 hours of the editorial, transmit to 
respectively (i) the other qualified candidate or candidates for the 
same office, or (ii) the candidate opposed in the editorial, (a) 
notification of the date, time, and channel of the editorial; (b) a 
script or tape of the editorial; and (c) an offer of a reasonable 
opportunity for a candidate or a spokesman of the candidate to respond 
over the system's facilities: Provided, however, That where such 
editorials are cablecast within 72 hours prior to the day of the 
election, the system operator shall comply with the provisions of this 
paragraph sufficiently far in advance of the broadcast to enable the 
candidate or candidates to have a reasonable opportunity to prepare a 
response and to present it in a timely fashion.

<R05>
Sec. 76.213  Lotteries.

    (a) No cable television system operator, except as in paragraph (c), 
when engaged in origination cablecasting shall transmit or permit to be 
transmitted on the origination cablecasting channel or channels any 
advertisement of or information concerning any lottery, gift, 
enterprise, or similar scheme, offering prizes dependent in whole or in 
part upon lot or chance, or any list of prizes drawn or awarded by means 
of any such lottery, gift enterprise, or scheme, whether said list 
contains any part or all of such prizes.

[[Page 536]]

    (b) The determination whether a particular program comes within the 
provisions of paragraph (a) of this section depends on the facts of each 
case. However, the Commission will in any event consider that a program 
comes within the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section if in 
connection with such program a prize consisting of money or thing of 
value is awarded to any person whose selection is dependent in whole or 
in part upon lot or chance, if as a condition of winning or competing 
for such prize, such winner or winners are required to furnish any money 
or thing of value or are required to have in their possession any 
product sold, manufactured, furnished, or distributed by a sponsor of a 
program cablecast on the system in question.
    (c) The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall 
not apply to advertisements or lists of prizes or information 
concerning:
    (1) A lottery conducted by a State acting under authority of State 
law which is transmitted:
    (i) By a cable system located in that State;
    (ii) By a cable system located in another State which conducts such 
a lottery; or
    (iii) By a cable system located in another State which is integrated 
with a cable system described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(ii) of 
this section, if termination of the receipt of such transmission by the 
cable systems in such other State would be technically infeasible.
    (2) Any gaming conducted by an Indian Tribe pursuant to the Indian 
Gaming Regulatory Act. (25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.).
    (3) A lottery, gift enterprise or similar scheme, other than one 
described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, that is authorized or not 
otherwise prohibited by the State in which it is conducted and which is:
    (i) Conducted by a not-for-profit organization or a governmental 
organization; or
    (ii) Conducted as a promotional activity by a commercial 
organization and is clearly occasional and ancillary to the primary 
business of that organization.
    (d) For the purposes of paragraph (c) lottery means the pooling of 
proceeds derived from the sale of tickets or chances and allotting those 
proceeds or parts thereof by chance to one or more chance takers or 
ticket purchasers. It does not include the placing or accepting of bets 
or wagers on sporting events or contests.
    (e) For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, the term 
``not-for-profit organization'' means any organization that would 
qualify as tax exempt under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986.

<R05>
Sec. 76.221  Sponsorship identification; list retention; related requirements.

    (a) When a cable television system operator engaged in origination 
cablecasting presents any matter for which money, service, or other 
valuable consideration is either directly or indirectly paid or promised 
to, or charged or accepted by such cable television system operator, the 
cable television system operator, at the time of the cablecast, shall 
announce that such matter is sponsored, paid for, or furnished, either 
in whole or in part, and by whom or on whose behalf such consideration 
was supplied: Provided, however, That ``service or other valuable 
consideration'' shall not include any service or property furnished 
either without or at a nominal charge for use on, or in connection with, 
a cablecast unless it is so furnished in consideration for an 
identification of any person, product, service, trademark, or brand name 
beyond an identification reasonably related to the use of such service 
or property on the cablecast. For the purposes of this section, the term 
``sponsored'' shall be deemed to have the same meaning as ``paid for.'' 
In the case of any political advertisement cablecast under this 
paragraph that concerns candidates for public office, the sponsor shall 
be identified with letters equal to or greater than four percent of the 
vertical picture height that air for not less than four seconds.

[[Page 537]]

    (b) Each cable television system operator engaged in origination 
cablecasting shall exercise reasonable diligence to obtain from 
employees, and from other persons with whom the system operator deals 
directly in connection with any matter for cablecasting, information to 
enable such system operator to make the announcement required by this 
section.
    (c) In the case of any political origination cablecast matter or any 
origination cablecast matter involving the discussion of public 
controversial issues for which any film, record, transcription, talent, 
script, or other material or service of any kind is furnished, either 
directly or indirectly, to a cable television system operator as an 
inducement for cablecasting such matter, an announcement shall be made 
both at the beginning and conclusion of such cablecast on which such 
material or service is used that such film, record, transcription, 
talent, script, or other material or service has been furnished to such 
cable television system operator in connection with the transmission of 
such cablecast matter: Provided, however, That in the case of any 
cablecast of 5 minutes' duration or less, only one such announcement 
need be made either at the beginning or conclusion of the cablecast.
    (d) The announcement required by this section shall, in addition to 
stating the fact that the origination cablecasting matter was sponsored, 
paid for or furnished, fully and fairly disclose the true identity of 
the person or persons, or corporation, committee, association or other 
unincorporated group, or other entity by whom or on whose behalf such 
payment is made or promised, or from whom or on whose behalf such 
services or other valuable consideration is received, or by whom the 
material or services referred to in paragraph (c) of this section are 
furnished. Where an agent or other person or entity contracts or 
otherwise makes arrangements with a cable television system operator on 
behalf of another, and such fact is known or by the exercise of 
reasonable diligence, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, 
could be known to the system operator, the announcement shall disclose 
the identity of the person or persons or entity on whose behalf such 
agent is acting instead of the name of such agent. Where the origination 
cablecasting material is political matter or matter involving the 
discussion of a controversial issue of public importance and a 
corporation, committee, association or other unincorporated group, or 
other entity is paying for or furnishing the matter, the system operator 
shall, in addition to making the announcement required by this section, 
require that a list of the chief executive officers or members of the 
executive committee or of the board of directors of the corporation, 
committee, association or other unincorporated group, or other entity 
shall be made available for public inspection at the local office of the 
system. Such lists shall be kept and made available for a period of two 
years.
    (e) In the case of origination cablecast matter advertising 
commercial products or services, an announcement stating the sponsor's 
corporate or trade name, or the name of the sponsor's product, when it 
is clear that the mention of the name of the product constitutes a 
sponsorship identification, shall be deemed sufficient for the purposes 
of this section and only one such announcement need be made at any time 
during the course of the cablecast.
    (f) The announcement otherwise required by this section is waived 
with respect to the origination cablecast or ``want ad'' or classified 
advertisements sponsored by an individual. The waiver granted in this 
paragraph shall not extend to a classified advertisement or want and 
sponsorship by any form of business enterprise, corporate or otherwise. 
Whenever sponsorship announcements are omitted pursuant to this 
paragraph, the cable television system operator shall observe the 
following conditions:
    (1) Maintain a list showing the name, address, and (where available) 
the telephone number of each advertiser;
    (2) Make this list available to members of the public who have a 
legitimate interest in obtaining the information contained in the list.
    (g) The announcements required by this section are waived with 
respect to feature motion picture film produced

[[Page 538]]

initially and primarily for theatre exhibition.

    Note: The waiver heretofore granted by the Commission in its Report 
and Order, adopted November 16, 1960 (FCC 60-1369; 40 F.C.C. 95), 
continues to apply to programs filmed or recorded on or before June 20, 
1963, when Sec. 73.654(e), the predecessor television rule, went into 
effect.

    (h) Commission interpretations in connection with the provisions of 
the sponsorship identification rules for the broadcasting services are 
contained in the Commission's Public Notice, entitled ``Applicability of 
Sponsorship Indentification Rules,'' dated May 6, 1963 (40 F.C.C. 141), 
as modified by Public Notice, dated April 21, 1975 (FCC 75-418). Further 
interpretations are printed in full in various volumes of the Federal 
Communications Commission Reports. The interpretations made for the 
broadcasting services are equally applicable to origination 
cablecasting.

Sec. 76.225  Commercial limits in children's programs.

    (a) No cable operator shall air more than 10.5 minutes of commercial 
matter per hour during children's programming on weekends, or more than 
12 minutes of commercial matter per hour on weekdays.
    (b) This rule shall not apply to programs aired on a broadcast 
television channel which the cable operator passively carries, or to 
access channels over which the cable operator may not exercise editorial 
control, pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 531(e) and 532(c)(2).
    (c) Cable operators must maintain records sufficient to verify 
compliance with this rule and make such records available to the public. 
Such records must be retained for a period sufficient to cover the 
limitations period specified in 47 U.S.C. 503(b)(6)(B).

    Note 1: Commercial matter means air time sold for purposes of 
selling a product or service.

    Note 2: For purposes of this section, children's programming refers 
to programs originally produced and broadcast primarily for an audience 
of children 12 years old and younger.

Sec. 76.227  Blocking of indecent sexually-oriented programming channels.

    (a) In providing sexually explicit adult programming or other 
programming that is indecent on any channel of its service primarily 
dedicated to sexually-oriented programming, a multichannel video 
programming distributor shall fully scramble or otherwise fully block 
the video and audio portion of such channel so that one not a subscriber 
to such channel or programming does not receive it.
    (b) Until a multichannel video programming distributor complies with 
the requirement set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, the 
multichannel video programming distributor shall not provide the 
programming referred to in paragraph (a) of this section between the 
hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m.
    (c) Scramble means to rearrange the content of the signal of the 
programming so that the programming cannot be viewed or heard in an 
understandable manner.
    (d) Sexually explicit adult programming or other programming that is 
indecent means any programming that describes or depicts sexual or 
excretory activities or organs in a patently offensive manner as 
measured by contemporary community standards for the cable or other 
multichannel video programming distribution medium.

documents or an attorney's office). The public inspection file shall be 
available for public inspection at any time during regular business 
hours.
    (c) The records specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall be

inspection file shall be available for machine reproduction upon request 
made in person, provided the requesting party shall pay the reasonable 
cost of reproduction. Requests for machine copies shall be fulfilled at 
a location specified by the system operator, within a reasonable period 
of time, which in no event shall be longer than seven days. The system 
operator is not required to honor requests made by mail but may do so if 
it chooses.

Sec. 76.309  Customer service obligations.

    (a) A cable franchise authority may enforce the customer service 
standards set forth in paragraph (c) of this section against cable 
operators. The franchise authority must provide affected cable operators 
ninety (90) days written notice of its intent to enforce the standards.
    (b) Nothing in this rule should be construed to prevent or prohibit:
    (1) A franchising authority and a cable operator from agreeing to 
customer service requirements that exceed the standards set forth in 
paragraph (c) of this section;
    (2) A franchising authority from enforcing, through the end of the 
franchise term, pre-existing customer service requirements that exceed 
the standards set forth in paragraph (c) of this section and are 
contained in current franchise agreements;
    (3) Any State or any franchising authority from enacting or 
enforcing any consumer protection law, to the extent not specifically 
preempted herein; or
    (4) The establishment or enforcement of any State or municipal law 
or regulation concerning customer service that imposes customer service 
requirements that exceed, or address matters not addressed by the 
standards set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Effective July 1, 1993, a cable operator shall be subject to the 
following customer service standards:
    (1) Cable system office hours and telephone availability--

call telephone access line which will be available to its subscribers 24 
hours a day, seven days a week.
    (A) Trained company representatives will be available to respond to 
customer telephone inquiries during normal business hours.
    (B) After normal business hours, the access line may be answered by 
a service or an automated response system, including an answering 
machine. Inquiries received after normal business hours must be 
responded to by a trained company representative on the next business 
day.
    (ii) Under normal operating conditions, telephone answer time by a 
customer representative, including wait time, shall not exceed thirty 
(30) seconds when the connection is made. If the call needs to be 
transferred, transfer time shall not exceed thirty (30) seconds. These 
standards shall be met no less than ninety (90) percent of the time 
under normal operating conditions, measured on a quarterly basis.
    (iii) The operator will not be required to acquire equipment or 
perform surveys to measure compliance with the telephone answering 
standards above unless an historical record of complaints indicates a 
clear failure to comply.
    (iv) Under normal operating conditions, the customer will receive a 
busy signal less than three (3) percent of the time.
    (v) Customer service center and bill payment locations will be open 
at least during normal business hours and will be conveniently located.

business days after an order has been placed. ``Standard'' installations 
are those that are located up to 125 feet from the existing distribution 
system.
    (ii) Excluding conditions beyond the control of the operator, the 
cable operator will begin working on ``service interruptions'' promptly 
and in no event later than 24 hours after the interruption becomes 
known. The cable

[[Page 541]]

operator must begin actions to correct other service problems the next 
business day after notification of the service problem.
    (iii) The ``appointment window'' alternatives for installations, 
service calls, and other installation activities will be either a 
specific time or, at maximum, a four-hour time block during normal 
business hours. (The operator may schedule service calls and other 
installation activities outside of normal business hours for the express 
convenience of the customer.)
    (iv) An operator may not cancel an appointment with a customer after 
the close of business on the business day prior to the scheduled 
appointment.
    (v) If a cable operator representative is running late for an 
appointment with a customer and will not be able to keep the appointment 
as scheduled, the customer will be contacted. The appointment will be 
rescheduled, as necessary, at a time which is convenient for the 
customer.
    (3) Communications between cable operators and cable subscribers--
    (i) Notifications to subscribers--
    (A) The cable operator shall provide written information on each of 
the following areas at the time of installation of service, at least 
annually to all subscribers, and at any time upon request:
    (1) Products and services offered;

such changes if the change is within the control of the cable operator. 
In addition, the cable operator shall notify subscribers thirty (30) 
days in advance of any significant changes in the other information 
required by paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section. Notwithstanding any 
other provision of Part 76, a cable operator shall not be required to 
provide prior notice of any rate change that is the result of a 
regulatory fee, franchise fee, or any other fee, tax, assessment, or 
charge of any kind imposed by any Federal agency, State, or franchising 
authority on the transaction between the operator and the subscriber.
    (ii) Billing--
    (A) Bills will be clear, concise and understandable. Bills must be

    (B) The return of the equipment supplied by the cable operator if 
service is terminated.
    (iv) Credits--Credits for service will be issued no later than the

    (ii) Normal operating conditions--The term ``normal operating 
conditions'' means those service conditions which are within the control 
of the cable operator. Those conditions which are not within the control 
of the cable operator include, but are not limited to, natural 
disasters, civil disturbances, power outages, telephone network outages, 
and severe or unusual weather conditions. Those conditions which are

[[Page 542]]

ordinarily within the control of the cable operator include, but are not 
limited to, special promotions, pay-per-view events, rate increases, 
regular peak or seasonal demand periods, and maintenance or upgrade of 
the cable system.
    (iii) Service interruption--The term ``service interruption'' means

<R04>
                  Subpart J--Ownership of Cable Systems


<R05>
Sec. 76.501  Cross-ownership.

    (a) No cable television system (including all parties under common 
control) shall carry the signal of any television broadcast station if 
such system directly or indirectly owns, operates, controls, or has an 
interest in a TV broadcast station whose predicted Grade B contour, 
computed in accordance with Sec. 73.684 of part 73 of this chapter, 
overlaps in whole or in part the service area of such system (i.e., the 
area within which the system is serving subscribers).
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Effective date. The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section 
are not effective until November 8, 1987, as to ownership interests 
proscribed herein if

[[Page 543]]

such interests were in existence on or before July 1, 1970 (e.g., if 
franchise were in existence on or before July 1970), and will be applied 
to cause divestiture as to ownership interests proscribed herein only 
where the cable system is directly or indirectly, owned, operated, 
controlled by, or has an interest in a non-satellite television 
broadcast station which places a principal community contour 
encompassing the entire community and there is no other commercial non-
satellite television broadcast station placing a principal community 
contour encompassing the entire community.
    (d) No cable operator shall offer satellite master antenna 
television service (``SMATV''), as that service is defined in 
Sec. 76.5(a)(2), separate and apart from any franchised cable service in 
any portion of the franchise area served by that cable operator's cable 
system, either directly or indirectly through an affiliate owned, 
operated, controlled, or under common control with the cable operator.
    (e)(1) A cable operator may directly or indirectly, through an 
affiliate owned, operated, controlled by, or under common control with 
the cable operator, offer SMATV service within its franchise area if the 
cable operator's SMATV system was owned, operated, controlled by or 
under common control with the cable operator as of October 5, 1992.
    (2) A cable operator may directly or indirectly, through an 
affiliate owned, operated, controlled by, or under common control with 
the cable operator, offer service within its franchise area through 
SMATV facilities, provided such service is offered in accordance with 
the terms and conditions of a cable franchise agreement.
    (f) The restrictions in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section shall 
not apply to any cable operator in any franchise area in which a cable 
operator is subject to effective competition as determined under section 
623(l) of the Communications Act.

    Note 1: The word ``control'' as used herein is not limited to 
majority stock ownership, but includes actual working control in 
whatever manner exercised.

    Note 2: In applying the provisions of this section, ownership and 
other interests in broadcast licensees and cable television systems will 
be attributed to their holders and deemed cognizable pursuant to the 
following criteria:
    (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, partnership and direct 
ownership interest and any voting stock interest amounting to 5% or more 
of the outstanding voting stock of a corporate broadcast licensee or 
cable television system will be cognizable;
    (b) No minority voting stock interest will be cognizable if there is 
a single holder of more than 50% of the outstanding voting stock of the 
corporate broadcast licensee or cable television system in which the 
minority interest is held;
    (c) Investment companies, as defined in 15 U.S.C. 80a-3, insurance 
companies and banks holding stock through their trust departments in 
trust accounts will be considered to have a cognizable interest only if 
they hold 10% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporate 
broadcast licensee or cable television system, or if any of the officers 
or directors of the broadcast licensee or cable television system are 
representatives of the investment company, insurance company or bank 
concerned. Holdings by a bank or insurance company will be aggregated if 
the bank or insurance company has any right to determine how the stock 
will be voted. Holdings by investment companies will be aggregated if 
under common management.
    (d) Attribution of ownership interests in a broadcast licensee or 
cable television system that are held indirectly by any party through 
one or more intervening corporations will be determined by successive 
multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link in the 
vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution 
benchmark to the resulting product, except that wherever the ownership 
percentage for any link in the chain exceeds 50%, it shall not be 
included for purposes of this multiplication. [For example, if A owns 
10% of company X, which owns 60% of company Y, which owns 25% of 
``Licensee'', then X's interest in ``Licensee'' would be 25% (the same 
as Y's interest since X's interest in Y exceeds 50%), and A's interest 
in ``Licensee'' would be 2.5% (0.1 x 0.25). Under the 5% attribution 
benchmark, X's interest in ``Licensee'' would be cognizable, while A's 
interest would not be cognizable.]
    (e) Voting stock interests held in trust shall be attributed to any 
person who holds or shares the power to vote such stock, to any person 
who has the sole power to sell such stock, and to any person who has the 
right to revoke the trust at will or to replace the trustee at will. If 
the trustee has a familial, personal or extra-trust business 
relationship to the grantor or the beneficiary, the grantor or 
beneficiary, as appropriate, will be attributed with the stock interests 
held in

[[Page 544]]

trust. An otherwise qualified trust will be ineffective to insulate the 
grantor or beneficiary from attribution with the trust's assets unless 
all voting stock interests held by the grantor or beneficiary in the 
relevant broadcast licensee or cable television system are subject to 
said trust.
    (f) Holders of non-voting stock shall not be attributed an interest 
in the issuing entity. Holders of debt and instruments such as warrants, 
convertible debentures, options or other non-voting interests with 
rights of conversion to voting interests shall not be attributed unless 
and until conversion is effected.
    (g) (1) A limited partnership interest shall be attributed to a 
limited partner unless that partner is not materially involved, directly 
or indirectly, in the management or operation of the media-related 
activities of the partnership and the licensee or system so certifies.
    (2) In order for a licensee or system to make the certification set 
forth in paragraph (g)(1) of this note, it must verify that the 
partnership agreement or certificate of limited partnership, with 
respect to the particular limited partner exempt from attribution, 
establishes that the exempt limited partner has not material 
involvement, directly or indirectly, in the management or operation of 
the media activities of the partnership. The criteria which would assure 
adequate insulation for purposes of this certification are described in 
the Memorandum Opinion and Order in MM Docket No. 83-46, FCC 85-252 
(released June 24, 1985) as modified on reconsideration in the 
Memorandum Opinion and Order in MM Docket No. 83-46, FCC 86-410 
(released November 28, 1986). Irrespective of the terms of the 
certificate of limited partnership or partnership agreement, however, no 
such certification shall be made if the individual or entity making the 
certification has actual knowledge of any material involvement of the 
limited partners in the management or operation of the media-related 
businesses of the partnership.
    (h) Officers and directors of a broadcast licensee or cable 
television system are considered to have a cognizable interest in the 
entity with which they are so associated. If any such entity engages in 
businesses in addition to its primary business of broadcasting or cable 
television service, it may request the Commission to waive attribution 
for any officer or director whose duties and responsibilities are wholly 
unrelated to its primary business. The officers and directors of a 
parent company of a broadcast licensee or cable television system, with 
an attributable interest in any such subsidiary entity, shall be deemed 
to have a cognizable interest in the subsidiary unless the duties and 
responsibilities of the officer or director involved are wholly 
unrelated to the broadcast licensee or cable television system 
subsidiary, and a statement properly documenting this fact is submitted 
to the Commission. [This statement may be included on appropriate 
Ownership Report.] The officers and directors of a sister corporation of 
a broadcast licensee or cable television system shall not be attributed 
with ownership of these entities by virtue of such status.
    (i) Discrete ownership interests will be aggregated in determining 
whether or not an interest is cognizable under this section. An 
individual or entity will be deemed to have a cognizable investment if:
    (1) The sum of the interests held by or through ``passive 
investors'' is equal to or exceeds 10 percent; or
    (2) The sum of the interests other than those held by or through 
``passive investors'' is equal to or exceeds 5 percent; or
    (3) The sum of the interests computed under paragraph (i)(1) of this 
note plus the sum of the interests computed under paragraph (i)(2) of 
this note is equal to or exceeds 10 percent.

    Note 3: In cases where record and beneficial ownership of voting 
stock is not identical (e.g., bank nominees holding stock as record 
owners for the benefit of mutual funds, brokerage houses holding stock 
in street names for benefit of customers, investment advisors holding 
stock in their own names for the benefit of clients, and insurance 
companies holding stock), the party having the right to determine how 
the stock will be voted will be considered to own it for purposes of 
this subpart.

    Note 4: Paragraph (a) of this section will not be applied so as to 
require the divestiture of ownership interests proscribed herein solely 
because of the transfer of such interests to heirs or legatees by will 
or intestacy, provided that the degree or extent of the proscribed 
cross-ownership is not increased by such transfer.

    Note 5: In applying the provisions of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this 
section, control and an attributable ownership interest shall be defined 
by reference to the definitions contained in Notes 1 through 4, provided 
however, that:
    (a) The single majority shareholder provisions of Note 2(b) and the 
limited partner insulation provisions of Note 2(g) shall not apply; and
    (b) The provisions of Note 2(a) regarding five (5) percent interests 
shall include all voting or nonvoting stock or limited partnership 
equity interests of five (5) percent or more.

service area and cable franchise area, respectively, are in the same 
market may not enter into any joint venture or partnership to provide 
video programming directly to subscribers or to provide 
telecommunications services within such market.
    (d) Exceptions:
    (1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, a 
local exchange carrier (with respect to a cable system located in its 
telephone service area) and a cable operator (with respect to the 
facilities of a local exchange carrier used to provide telephone 
exchange service in its cable franchise area) may obtain a controlling 
interest in, management interest in, or enter into a joint venture or 
partnership with the operator of such system or facilities for the use 
of such system or facilities to the extent that:
    (i) Such system or facilities only serve incorporated or 
unincorporated :
    (A) Places or territories that have fewer than 35,000 inhabitants; 
and
    (B) Are outside an urbanized area, as defined by the Bureau of the 
Census; and
    (ii) In the case of a local exchange carrier, such system, in the 
aggregate with any other system in which such carrier has an interest, 
serves less than 10 percent of the households in the telephone service 
area of such carrier.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c) of this section, a local exchange 
carrier may obtain, with the concurrence of the cable operator on the 
rates, terms, and conditions, the use of that part of the transmission 
facilities of a cable system extending from the last multi-user terminal 
to the premises of the end user, if such use is reasonably limited in 
scope and duration, as determined by the Commission.
    (3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, a local 
exchange carrier may obtain a controlling interest in, or form a joint 
venture or other partnership with, or provide financing to, a cable 
system (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as ``the subject cable 
system'') if:
    (i) The subject cable system operates in a television market that is 
not in the top 25 markets, and such market has more than 1 cable system 
operator, and the subject cable system is not the cable system with the 
most subscribers in such television market;
    (ii) The subject cable system and the cable system with the most 
subscribers in such television market held on May 1, 1995, cable 
television franchises from the largest municipality in the television 
market and the boundaries of such franchises were identical on such 
date;
    (iii) The subject cable system is not owned by or under common 
ownership or control of any one of the 50 cable system operators with 
the most subscribers as such operators existed on May 1, 1995; and
    (iv) The system with the most subscribers in the television market 
is owned by or under common ownership or control of any one of the 10 
largest

[[Page 547]]

cable system operators as such operators existed on May 1, 1995.
    (4) Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to any cable system 
if:
    (i) The cable system serves no more than 17,000 cable subscribers, 
of which no less than 8,000 live within an urban area, and no less than 
6,000 live within a nonurbanized area as of June 1, 1995;
    (ii) The cable system is not owned by, or under common ownership or 
control with, any of the 50 largest cable system operators in existence 
on June 1, 1995; and
    (iii) The cable system operates in a television market that was not 
in the top 100 television markets as of June 1, 1995.
    (5) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, a local 
exchange carrier with less than $100,000,000 in annual operating 
revenues (or any affiliate of such carrier owned by, operated by, 
controlled by, or under common control with such carrier) may purchase 
or otherwise acquire more than a 10 percent financial interest in, or 
any management interest in, or enter into a joint venture or partnership 
with, any cable system within the local exchange carrier's telephone 
service area that serves no more than 20,000 cable subscribers, if no 
more than 12,000 of those subscribers live within an urbanized area, as 
defined by the Bureau of the Census.
    (6) The Commission may waive the restrictions of paragraphs (a), 
(b), or (c) of this section only if:
    (i) The Commission determines that, because of the nature of the 
market served by the affected cable system or facilities used to provide 
telephone exchange service:
    (A) The affected cable operator or local exchange carrier would be 
subjected to undue economic distress by the enforcement of such 
provisions;
    (B) The system or facilities would not be economically viable if 
such provisions were enforced; or
    (C) The anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are 
clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the 
transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be 
served; and
    (ii) The local franchising authority approves of such waiver.
    (e) For purposes of this section, the term ``telephone service 
area'' when used in connection with a common carrier subject in whole or 
in part to title II of the Communications Act means the area within 
which such carrier provided telephone exchange service as of January 1, 
1993, but if any common carrier after such date transfers its telephone 
exchange service facilities to another common carrier, the area to which 
such facilities provide telephone exchange service shall be treated as 
part of the telephone service area of the acquiring common carrier and 
not of the selling common carrier.

                     Subpart K--Technical Standards


<R05>
Sec. 76.601  Performance tests.

    (a) The operator of each cable television system shall be 
responsible for insuring that each such system is designed, installed, 
and operated in a manner that fully complies with the provisions of this 
subpart. Each system operator shall be prepared to show, on request by 
an authorized representative of the Commission or the local franchiser, 
that the system does, in fact, comply with the rules.
    (b) The operator of each cable television system shall maintain at 
its local office a current listing of the cable television channels 
which that system delivers to its subscribers.
    (c) The operator of each cable television system shall conduct 
complete performance tests of that system at least twice each calendar 
year (at intervals not to exceed seven months), unless otherwise noted 
below, and shall maintain the resulting test data on file at the 
operator's local business office for at least five (5) years. The test 
data shall be made available for inspection by the Commission or the 
local franchiser, upon request. The performance tests shall be directed 
at determining the extent to which the system complies with all the 
technical standards set forth in Sec. 76.605(a) and shall be as follows:
    (1) For cable television systems with 1000 or more subscribers but 
with 12,500 or fewer subscribers, proof-of-performance tests conducted 
pursuant to this

[[Page 548]]

section shall include measurements taken at six (6) widely separated 
points. However, within each cable system, one additional test point 
shall be added for every additional 12,500 subscribers or fraction 
thereof (e.g., 7 test points if 12,501 to 25,000 subscribers; 8 test 
points if 25,001 to 37,500 subscribers, etc.). In addition, for 
technically integrated portions of cable systems that are not 
mechanically continuous (i.e., employing microwave connections), at 
least one test point will be required for each portion of the cable 
system served by a technically integrated microwave hub. The proof-of-
performance test points chosen shall be balanced to represent all 
geographic areas served by the cable system. At least one-third of the 
test points shall be representative of subscriber terminals most distant 
from the system input and from each microwave receiver (if microwave 
transmissions are employed), in terms of cable length. The measurements 
may be taken at convenient monitoring points in the cable network: 
Provided, that data shall be included to relate the measured performance 
of the system as would be viewed from a nearby subscriber terminal. An 
identification of the instruments, including the makes, model numbers, 
and the most recent date of calibration, a description of the procedures 
utilized, and a statement of the qualifications of the person performing 
the tests shall also be included.
    (2) Proof-of-performance tests to determine the extent to which a 
cable television system complies with the standards set forth in 
Sec. 76.605(a) (3), (4), and (5) shall be made on each of the NTSC or 
similar video channels of that system. Unless otherwise as noted, proof-
of-performance tests for all other standards in Sec. 76.605(a) shall be 
made on a minimum of four (4) channels plus one additional channel for 
every 100 MHz, or fraction thereof, of cable distribution system upper 
frequency limit (e.g., 5 channels for cable television systems with a 
cable distribution system upper frequency limit of 101 to 216 MHz; 6 
channels for cable television systems with a cable distribution system 
upper frequency limit of 217-300 MHz; 7 channels for cable television 
systems with a cable distribution upper frequency limit to 300 to 400 
MHz, etc.). The channels selected for testing must be representative of 
all the channels within the cable television system.
    (3) The operator of each cable television system shall conduct semi-
annual proof-of-performance tests of that system, to determine the 
extent to which the system complies with the technical standards set 
forth in Sec. 76.605(a)(4) as follows. The visual signal level on each 
channel shall be measured and recorded, along with the date and time of 
the measurement, once every six hours (at intervals of not less than 
five hours or no more than seven hours after the previous measurement), 
to include the warmest and the coldest times, during a 24-hour period in 
January or February and in July or August.
    (4) The operator of each cable television system shall conduct 
triennial proof-of-performance tests of its system to determine the 
extent to which the system complies with the technical standards set 
forth in Sec. 76.605(a)(11).
    (d) Successful completion of the performance tests required by 
paragraph (c) of this section does not relieve the system of the 
obligation to comply with all pertinent technical standards at all 
subscriber terminals. Additional tests, repeat tests, or tests involving 
specified subscriber terminals may be required by the Commission of the 
local franchiser to secure compliance with the technical standards.
    (e) The provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section shall 
not apply to any cable television system having fewer than 1,000 
subscribers: Provided, however, that any cable television system using 
any frequency spectrum other than that allocated to over-the-air 
television and FM broadcasting (as described in Sec. 73.603 and 
Sec. 73.210 of this chapter) is required to conduct all tests, 
measurements and monitoring of signal leakage that are required by this 
subpart. A cable television system operator complying with the 
monitoring, logging and the leakage repair requirements of Sec. 76.614, 
shall be considered to have met the requirements of this paragraph. 
However, the leakage log, shall be retained for five years rather

[[Page 549]]

than the two years prescribed in Sec. 76.614.

    Note: Prior to requiring any additional testing pursuant to 
Sec. 76.601(d), the local franchising authority shall notify the cable 
operator who will be allowed thirty days to come into compliance with 
any perceived signal quality problems which need to be corrected. The 
Commission may request cable operators to test their systems at any 
time.


[57 FR 11001, Apr. 1, 1992, as amended at 57 FR 61010, Dec. 23, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 76.605  Technical standards.

    (a) As of December 30, 1992, unless otherwise noted, the following 
requirements apply to the performance of a cable television system as 
measured at any subscriber terminal with a matched impedance at the 
termination point or at the output of the modulating or processing 
equipment (generally the headend) of the cable television system or 
otherwise as noted. The requirements are applicable to each NTSC or 
similar video downstream cable television channel in the system:
    (1)(i) The cable television channels delivered to the subscriber's 
terminal shall be capable of being received and displayed by TV 
broadcast receivers used for off-the-air reception of TV broadcast 
signals, as authorized under part 73 of this chapter; and
    (ii) Cable television systems shall transmit signals to subscriber 
premises equipment on frequencies in accordance with the channel 
allocation plan set forth in the Electronics Industries Association's 
``Cable Television Channel Identification Plan, EIA IS-132, May 1994'' 
(EIA IS-132). This incorporation by reference was approved by the 
Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 522(a) and 
1 CFR Part 51. Cable systems are required to use this channel allocation 
plan for signals transmitted in the frequency range 54 MHz to 1002 MHz. 
This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the 
Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 522(a) and 1 CFR Part 51. 
Copies of EIA IS-132 may be obtained from: Global Engineering Documents, 
2805 McGraw Ave., Irvine CA 92714. Copies of EIA IS-132 may be inspected 
during normal business hours at the following locations: Federal 
Communications Commission, 1919 M Street, NW, Dockets Branch (Room 239), 
Washington, DC, or the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol 
Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. This requirement is applicable 
on May 31, 1995, for new and re-built cable systems, and on June 30, 
1997, for all cable systems.
    (2) The aural center frequency of the aural carrier must be 4.5 MHz 
<plus-minus> 5 kHz above the frequency of the visual carrier at the 
output of the modulating or processing equipment of a cable television 
system, and at the subscriber terminal.
    (3) The visual signal level, across a terminating impedance which 
correctly matches the internal impedance of the cable system as viewed 
from the subscriber terminal, shall not be less than 1 millivolt across 
an internal impedance of 75 ohms (0 dBmV). Additionally, as measured at 
the end of a 30 meter (100 foot) cable drop that is connected to the 
subscriber tap, it shall not be less than 1.41 millivolts across an 
internal impedance of 75 ohms (+3 dBmV). (At other impedance values, the 
minimum visual signal level, as viewed from the subscriber terminal, 
shall be the square root of 0.0133 (Z) millivolts and, as measured at 
the end of a 30 meter (100 foot) cable drop that is connected to the 
subscriber tap, shall be 2 times the square root of 0.00662(Z) 
millivolts, where Z is the appropriate impedance value.)
    (4) The visual signal level on each channel, as measured at the end 
of a 30 meter cable drop that is connected to the subscriber tap, shall 
not vary more than 8 decibels within any six-month interval, which must 
include four tests performed in six-hour increments during a 24-hour 
period in July or August and during a 24-hour period in January or 
February, and shall be maintained within:
    (i) 3 decibels (dB) of the visual signal level of any visual carrier 
within a 6 MHz nominal frequency separation;
    (ii) 10 dB of the visual signal level on any other channel on a 
cable television system of up to 300 MHz of cable distribution system 
upper frequency limit, with a 1 dB increase for each additional 100 MHz 
of cable distribution system upper frequency limit (e.g., 11

[[Page 550]]

dB for a system at 301-400 MHz; 12 dB for a system at 401-500 MHz, 
etc.); and
    (iii) A maximum level such that signal degradation due to overload 
in the subscriber's receiver or terminal does not occur.
    (5) The rms voltage of the aural signal shall be maintained between 
10 and 17 decibels below the associated visual signal level. This 
requirement must be met both at the subscriber terminal and at the 
output of the modulating and processing equipment (generally the 
headend). For subscriber terminals that use equipment which modulate and 
remodulate the signal (e.g., baseband converters), the rms voltage of 
the aural signal shall be maintained between 6.5 and 17 decibels below 
the associated visual signal level at the subscriber terminal.
    (6) The amplitude characteristic shall be within a range of 
<plus-minus>2 decibels from 0.75 MHz to 5.0 MHz above the lower boundary 
frequency of the cable television channel, referenced to the average of 
the highest and lowest amplitudes within these frequency boundaries.
    (i) Prior to December 30, 1999, the amplitude characteristic may be 
measured after a subscriber tap and before a converter that is provided 
and maintained by the cable operator.
    (ii) As of December 30, 1999, the amplitude characteristic shall be 
measured at the subscriber terminal.
    (7) The ratio of RF visual signal level to system noise shall be as 
follows:
    (i) From June 30, 1992, to June 30, 1993, shall not be less than 36 
decibels.
    (ii) From June 30, 1993 to June 30, 1995, shall not be less than 40 
decibels.
    (iii) As of June 30, 1995, shall not be less then 43 decibels.
    (iv) For class I cable television channels, the requirements of 
paragraphs (a)(7)(i), (a)(7)(ii) and (a)(7)(iii) of this section are 
applicable only to:
    (A) Each signal which is delivered by a cable television system to 
subscribers within the predicted Grade B contour for that signal;
    (B) Each signal which is first picked up within its predicted Grade 
B contour;
    (C) Each signal that is first received by the cable television 
system by direct video feed from a TV broadcast station, a low power TV 
station, or a TV translator station.
    (8) The ratio of visual signal level to the rms amplitude of any 
coherent disturbances such as intermodulation products, second and third 
order distortions or discrete-frequency interfering signals not 
operating on proper offset assignments shall be as follows:
    (i) The ratio of visual signal level to coherent disturbances shall 
not be less than 51 decibels for noncoherent channel cable television 
systems, when measured with modulated carriers and time averaged; and
    (ii) The ratio of visual signal level to coherent disturbances which 
are frequency-coincident with the visual carrier shall not be less than 
47 decibels for coherent channel cable systems, when measured with 
modulated carriers and time averaged.
    (9) The terminal isolation provided to each subscriber terminal:
    (i) Shall not be less than 18 decibels. In lieu of periodic testing, 
the cable operator may use specifications provided by the manufacturer 
for the terminal isolation equipment to meet this standard; and
    (ii) Shall be sufficient to prevent reflections caused by open-
circuited or short-circuited subscriber terminals from producing visible 
picture impairments at any other subscriber terminal.
    (10) The peak-to-peak variation in visual signal level caused by 
undesired low frequency disturbances (hum or repetitive transients) 
generated within the system, or by inadequate low frequency response, 
shall not exceed 3 percent of the visual signal level. Measurements made 
on a single channel using a single unmodulated carrier may be used to 
demonstrate compliance with this parameter at each test location.
    (11) As of June 30, 1995, the following requirements apply to the 
performance of the cable television system as measured at the output of 
the modulating or processing equipment (generally the headend) of the 
system:
    (i) The chrominance-luminance delay inequality (or chroma delay), 
which is

[[Page 551]]

the change in delay time of the chrominance component of the signal 
relative to the luminance component, shall be within 170 nanoseconds.
    (ii) The differential gain for the color subcarrier of the 
television signal, which is measured as the difference in amplitude 
between the largest and smallest segments of the chrominance signal 
(divided by the largest and expressed in percent), shall not exceed 
<plus-minus>20%.
    (iii) The differential phase for the color subcarrier of the 
television signal which is measured as the largest phase difference in 
degrees between each segment of the chrominance signal and reference 
segment (the segment at the blanking level of O IRE), shall not exceed 
<plus-minus>10 degrees.
    (12) As an exception to the general provision requiring measurements 
to be made at subscriber terminals, and without regard to the type of 
signals carried by the cable television system, signal leakage from a 
cable television system shall be measured in accordance with the 
procedures outlined in Sec. 76.609(h) and shall be limited as follows:

                                                  leakage               
                  Frequencies                      limit     Distance in
                                                (micro-volt/  meters (m)
                                                   meter)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Cable television systems distributing signals by using methods 
such as nonconventional coaxial cable techniques, noncoaxial copper 
cable techniques, specialized coaxial cable and fiber optical cable 
hybridization techniques or specialized compression techniques or 
specialized receiving devices, and which, because of their basic design, 
cannot comply with one or more of the technical standards set forth in 
paragraph (a) of this section, may be permitted to operate: Provided, 
That an adequate showing is made pursuant to Sec. 76.7 which establishes 
that the public interest is benefited. In such instances, the Commission 
may prescribe special technical requirements to ensure that subscribers 
to such systems are provided with an equivalent level of good quality 
service.

    Note 1: Local franchising authorities of systems serving fewer than 
1000 subscribers may adopt standards less stringent than those in 
Sec. 76.605(a). Any such agreement shall be reduced to writing and be 
associated with the system's proof-of-performance records.

    Note 2: For systems serving rural areas as defined in Sec. 76.5, the 
system may negotiate with its local franchising authority for standards 
less stringent than those in Secs. 76.605(a)(3), 76.605(a)(7), 
76.605(a)(8), 76.605(a)(10) and 76.605(a)(11). Any such agreement shall 
be reduced to writing and be associated with the system's proof-of-
performance records.

    Note 3: The requirements of this section shall not apply to devices 
subject to the provisions of Secs. 15.601 through 15.626.

    Note 4: Should subscriber complaints arise from a system failing to 
meet Sec. 76.605(a)(6) prior to December 30, 1999, the cable operator 
will be required to provide a converter that will allow the system to 
meet the standard immediately at the complaining subscriber's terminal. 
Further, should the problem be found to be system-wide, the Commission 
may order all converters on the system be changed to meet the standard.

    Note 5: Should subscriber complaints arise from a system failing to 
meet Sec. 76.605(a)(10), the cable operator will be required to remedy 
the complaint and perform test measurements on Sec. 76.605(a)(10) 
containing the full number of channels as indicated in Sec. 76.601(c)(2) 
at the complaining subscriber's terminal. Further, should the problem be 
found to be system-wide, the Commission may order that the full number 
of channels as indicated in Sec. 76.601(c)(2) be tested at all required 
locations for future proof-of-performance tests.

    Note 6: No State or franchising authority may prohibit, condition, 
or restrict a cable system's use of any type of subscriber equipment or 
any transmission technology.

Sec. 76.609  Measurements.

    (a) Measurements made to demonstrate conformity with the performance 
requirements set forth in Secs. 76.601 and 76.605 shall be made under 
conditions which reflect system performance during normal operations, 
including the effect of any microwave relay operated in the Cable 
Television Relay (CARS) Service intervening between pickup antenna and 
the cable distribution network. Amplifiers shall be operated at normal 
gains, either by the insertion of appropriate signals or by manual 
adjustment. Special signals inserted in a cable television channel for 
measurement purposes should be operated at levels approximating those 
used for normal operation. Pilot tones, auxiliary or substitute signals, 
and nontelevision signals normally carried on the cable television 
system should be operated at normal levels to the extent possible. Some 
exemplary, but not mandatory, measurement procedures are set forth in 
this section.
    (b) When it may be necessary to remove the television signal 
normally carried on a cable television channel in order to facilitate a 
performance measurement, it will be permissible to disconnect the 
antenna which serves the channel under measurement and to substitute 
therefor a matching resistance termination. Other antennas and inputs 
should remain connected and normal signal levels should be maintained on 
other channels.
    (c) As may be necessary to ensure satisfactory service to a 
subscriber, the Commission may require additional tests to demonstrate 
system performance or may specify the use of different test procedures.
    (d) The frequency response of a cable television channel may be 
determined by one of the following methods, as appropriate:
    (1) By using a swept frequency or a manually variable signal 
generator at the sending end and a calibrated attenuator and frequency-
selective voltmeter at the subscriber terminal; or
    (2) By using either a multiburst generator or vertical interval test 
signals and either a modulator or processor at the sending end, and by 
using either a demodulator and either an oscilloscope display or a 
waveform monitor display at the subscriber terminal.
    (e) System noise may be measured using a frequency-selective 
voltmeter (field strength meter) which has been suitably calibrated to 
indicate rms noise or average power level and which has a known 
bandwidth. With the system operating at normal level and with a properly 
matched resistive termination substituted for the antenna, noise power 
indications at the subscriber terminal are taken in successive 
increments of frequency equal to the bandwidth of the frequency-
selective voltmeter, summing the power indications to obtain the total 
noise power present over a 4 MHz band centered within the cable 
television channel. If it is established that the noise

[[Page 553]]

level is constant within this bandwidth, a single measurement may be 
taken which is corrected by an appropriate factor representing the ratio 
of 4 MHz to the noise bandwidth of the frequency-selective voltmeter. If 
an amplifier is inserted between the frequency-selective voltmeter and 
the subscriber terminal in order to facilitate this measurement, it 
should have a bandwidth of at least 4 MHz and appropriate corrections 
must be made to account for its gain and noise figure. Alternatively, 
measurements made in accordance with the NCTA Recommended Practices for 
Measurements on Cable Television Systems, 2nd edition, November 1989, on 
noise measurement may be employed.
    (f) The amplitude of discrete frequency interfering signals within a 
cable television channel may be determined with either a spectrum 
analyzer or with a frequency-selective voltmeter (field strength meter), 
which instruments have been calibrated for adequate accuracy. If 
calibration accuracy is in doubt, measurements may be referenced to a 
calibrated signal generator, or a calibrated variable attenuator, 
substituted at the point of measurement. If an amplifier is used between 
the subscriber terminal and the measuring instrument, appropriate 
corrections must be made to account for its gain.
    (g) The terminal isolation between any two terminals in the cable 
television system may be measured by applying a signal of known 
amplitude to one terminal and measuring the amplitude of that signal at 
the other terminal. The frequency of the signal should be close to the 
midfrequency of the channel being tested. Measurements of terminal 
isolation are not required when either:
    (1) The manufacturer's specifications for subscriber tap isolation 
based on a representative sample of no less than 500 subscribers taps or
    (2) Laboratory tests performed by or for the operator of a cable 
television system on a representative sample of no less than 50 
subscriber taps, indicates that the terminal isolation standard of 
Sec. 76.605(a)(9) is met.

To demonstrate compliance with Sec. 76.605(a)(9), the operator of a 
cable television system shall attach either such manufacturer's 
specifications or laboratory measurements as an exhibit to each proof-
of-performance record.
    (h) Measurements to determine the field strength of the signal 
leakage emanated by the cable television system shall be made in 
accordance with standard engineering procedures. Measurements made on 
frequencies above 25 MHz shall include the following:
    (1) A field strength meter of adequate accuracy using a horizontal 
dipole antenna shall be employed.
    (2) Field strength shall be expressed in terms of the rms value of 
synchronizing peak for each cable television channel for which signal 
leakage can be measured.
    (3) The resonant half wave dipole antenna shall be placed 3 meters 
from and positioned directly below the system components and at 3 meters 
above ground. Where such placement results in a separation of less than 
3 meters between the center of the dipole antenna and the system 
components, or less than 3 meters between the dipole and ground level, 
the dipole shall be repositioned to provide a separation of 3 meters 
from the system components at a height of 3 meters or more above ground.
    (4) The horizontal dipole antenna shall be rotated about a vertical 
axis and the maximum meter reading shall be used.
    (5) Measurements shall be made where other conductors are 3 or more 
meters (10 or more feet) away from the measuring antenna.
    (i) For systems using cable traps and filters to control the 
delivery of specific channels to the subscriber terminal, measurements 
made to determine compliance with Sec. 76.605(a) (5) and (6) may be 
performed at the location immediately prior to the trap or filter for 
the specific channel. The effects of these traps or filters, as 
certified by the system engineer or the equipment manufacturer, must be 
attached to each proof-of-performance record.
    (j) Measurements made to determine the differential gain, 
differential phase and the chrominance-luminance delay inequality 
(chroma delay) shall be made in accordance with the NCTA

Sec. 76.611  Cable television basic signal leakage performance criteria.

    (a) No cable television system shall commence or provide service in 
the frequency bands 108-137 and 225-400 MHz unless such systems is in 
compliance with one of the following cable television basic signal 
leakage performance criteria:
    (1) prior to carriage of signals in the aeronautical radio bands and 
at least once each calendar year, with no more than 12 months between 
successive tests thereafter, based on a sampling of at least 75% of the 
cable strand, and including any portion of the cable system which are 
known to have or can reasonably be expected to have less leakage 
integrity than the average of the system, the cable operator 
demonstrates compliance with a cumulative signal leakage index by 
showing either that (i) 10 log I<INF>3000</INF> is equal to or less than 
-7 or (ii) 10 log I<INF>00</INF> is equal to or less than 64, using one 
of the following formula:

where:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MR91.115

r<INF>i</INF> is the distance (in meters) between the leakage source and 
          the center of the cable television system;
<greek-th> is the fraction of the system cable length actually examined 
          for leakage sources and is equal to the strand kilometers 
          (strand miles) of plant tested divided by the total strand 
          kilometers (strand miles) in the plant;
R<INF>i</INF> is the slant height distance (in meters) from leakage 
          source i to a point 3000 meters above the center of the cable 
          television system;
E<INF>i</INF> is the electric field strength in microvolts per meter 
          (<greek-m>V/m) measured pursuant to Sec. 76.609(h) 3 meters 
          from the leak i; and
n is the number of leaks found of field strength equal to or greater 
          than 50 <greek-m>V/m pursuant to Section 76.609(h).

The sum is carried over all leaks i detected in the cable examined; or
    (2) prior to carriage of signals in the aeronautical radio bands and 
at least once each calendar year, with no more than 12 months between 
successive tests thereafter, the cable operator demonstrates by 
measurement in the airspace that at no point does the field strength 
generated by the cable system exceed 10 microvolts per meter 
(<greek-m>V/m) RMS at an altitude of 450 meters above the average 
terrain of the cable system. The measurement system (including the 
receiving antenna) shall be calibrated against a known field of 10 
<greek-m>V/m RMS produced by a well characterized antenna consisting of 
orthogonal reasonant dipoles, both parallel to and one quarter 
wavelength above the ground plane of a diameter of two meters or more at 
ground level. The dipoles shall have centers collocated

[[Page 555]]

and be excited 90 degrees apart. The half-power bandwidth of the 
detector shall be 25 kHz. If an aeronautical receiver is used for this 
purpose it shall meet the standards of the Radio Technical Commission 
for Aeronautics (RCTA) for aeronautical communications receivers. The 
aircraft antenna shall be horizontally polarized. Calibration shall be 
made in the community unit or, if more than one, in any of the community 
units of the physical system within a reasonable time period to 
performing the measurements. If data is recorded digitally the 90th 
percentile level of points recorded over the cable system shall not 
exceed 10 <greek-m>V/m RMS; if analog recordings is used the peak values 
of the curves, when smoothed according to good engineering practices, 
shall not exceed 10 <greek-m>V/m RMS.
    (b) In paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section the unmodulated 
test signal used on the cable plant shall: (1) Be within the VHF 
aeronautical band 108-137 MHz or any other frequency in which the 
results can be correlated to the VHF aeronautical band and (2) have an 
average power level equal to the average power level of the strongest 
cable television carrier on the system.
    (c) In paragraph (a)(1) and (2) of this section, if a modulated test 
signal is used, the test signal and detector technique must, when 
considered together, yield the same result as though an unmodulated test 
signal were used in conjunction with a detection technique which would 
yield the RMS value of said unmodulated carrier.
    (d) If a sampling of at least 75% of the cable strand (and including 
any portions of the cable system which are known to have or can 
reasonably be expected to have less leakage integrity than the average 
of the system) as described in paragraph (a)(1) cannot be obtained by 
the cable operator or is otherwise not reasonably feasible, the cable 
operator shall perform the airspace measurements described in paragraph 
(a)(2).
    (e) Prior to providing service to any subscriber on a new section of 
cable plant, the operator shall show compliance with either: (1) The 
basic signal leakage criteria in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) or 
(a)(2) of this section for the entire plant in operation or (2) a 
showing shall be made indicating that no individual leak in the new 
section of the plant exceeds 20    <greek-m>V/m at 3 meters in 
accordance with Sec. 76.609 fo the Rules.
    (f) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a cable operator 
shall be permitted to operate on any frequency which is offset pursuant 
to Sec. 76.612 in the frequency band 108-137 MHz for the purpose of 
demonstrating compliance with the cable television basic signal leakage 
performance criteria.

Sec. 76.612  Cable television frequency separation standards.

    All cable television systems which operate in the frequency bands 
108-137 and 225-400 MHz shall comply with the following frequency 
separation standards:
    (a) In the aeronautical radiocommunication bands 118-137, 225-328.6 
and 335.4-400 MHz, the frequency of all carrier signals or signal 
components carried at an average power level equal to or greater than 
10<SUP>-4</SUP> watts in a 25 kHz bandwidth in any 160 microsecond 
period must operate at frequencies offset from certain frequencies which 
may be used by aeronautical radio services operated by Commission 
licensees or by the United States Government or its Agencies. The 
aeronautical frequencies from which offsets must be maintained are those 
frequencies which are within one of the aeronautical bands defined in 
this subparagraph, and when expressed in MHz and divided by 0.025 yield 
an integer. The offset must meet one of the following two criteria:
    (1) All such cable carriers or signal components shall be offset by 
12.5 kHz with a frequency tolerance of <plus-minus>5 kHz; or
    (2) The fundamental frequency from which the visual carrier 
frequencies are derived by multiplication by an integer number which 
shall be 6.0003 MHz with a tolerance of <plus-minus>1 Hz (Harmonically 
Related Carrier (HRC) comb generators only).

[[Page 556]]

    (b) In the aeronautical radionavigation bands 108-118 and 328.6-
335.4 MHz, the frequency of all carrier signals or signal components 
carrier at an average power level equal to or greater than 
10<SUP>-4</SUP> watts in a 25 kHz bandwidth in any 160 microsecond 
period shall be offset by 25 kHz with a tolerance of <plus-minus>5 kHz. 
The aeronautical radionavigation frequencies from which offsets must be 
maintained are defined as follows:
    (1) Within the aeronautical band 108-118 MHz when expressed in MHz 
and divided by 0.025 yield an even integer.
    (2) Within the band 328.6-335.4 MHz, the radionavigation glide path 
channels are listed in Section 87.501 of the Rules.

    Note: The HRC system, as described above, will meet this requirement 
in the 328.6-335.4 MHz navigation glide path band. Those Incrementally 
Related Carriers (IRC) systems, with comb generator reference 
frequencies set at certain odd multiples equal to or greater than 3 
times the 0.0125 MHz aeronautical communications band offset, e.g. (6n + 
1.250 <plus-minus> 0.0375) MHz, may also meet the 25 kHz offset 
requirement in the navigation glide path band.

greater at a distance of 3 meters in the aeronautical radio frequency 
bands shall be noted and such leakage sources shall be repaired within a 
reasonable period of time. The operator shall maintain a log showing the 
date and location of each leakage source identified, the date on which 
the leakage was repaired, and the probable cause of the leakage. The log

request waiver was filed with the Commission, and cable operators must 
inform the Commission in writing, as soon as possible, of that 
notification date. The notification to subscribers must state:

    On (date of waiver request was filed with the Commission), (cable 
operator's name) filed with the Federal Communications Commission a 
request for waiver of the rule prohibiting scrambling of channels on the 
basic tier of service. 47 CFR Sec. 76.630(a). The request for waiver 
states (a brief summary of the waiver request). A copy of the request 
for waiver is on file for public inspection at (the address of the cable 
operator's local place of business).
    Individuals who wish to comment on this request for waiver should 
mail comments to the Federal Communications Commission by no later than 
30 days from (the date the notification was mailed to subscribers). 
Those comments should be addressed to the: Federal Communications 
Commission, Cable Services Bureau, Washington, DC 20554, and should 
include the name of the cable operator to whom the comments are 
applicable. Individuals should also send a copy of their comments to 
(the cable operator at its local place of business).


Cable operators may file comments in reply no later than 7 days from the 
date subscriber comments must be filed.
    (b) Cable system operators that provide their subscribers with cable 
system terminal devices and other customer premises equipment that 
incorporates remote control capability shall permit the remote operation 
of such devices with commercially available remote control units or 
otherwise take no action that would prevent the devices from being 
operated by a commercially available remote control unit. Cable system 
operators are advised that this requirement obliges them to actively 
enable the remote control functions of customer premises equipment where 
those functions do not operate without a special activation procedure. 
Cable system operators may, however, disable the remote control 
functions of a subscriber's customer premises equipment where requested 
by the subscriber.
    (c) Cable system operators that use scrambling, encryption or 
similar technologies in conjunction with cable system terminal devices, 
as defined in Sec. 15.3(e) of this chapter, that may affect subscribers' 
reception of signals shall offer to supply each subscriber with special 
equipment that will enable the simultaneous reception of multiple 
signals. The equipment offered shall include a single terminal device 
with dual descramblers/decoders and/or timers and bypass switches. Other 
equipment, such as two independent set-top terminal devices may be 
offered at the same time that the single terminal device with dual 
tuners/descramblers is offered. For purposes of this rule, two set-top 
devices linked by a control system that provides functionality 
equivalent to that of a single device with dual descramblers is 
considered to be the same as a terminal device with dual descramblers/
decoders.
    (1) The offer of special equipment shall be made to new subscribers 
at the time they subscribe and to all subscribers at least once each 
year.
    (2) Such special equipment shall, at a minimum, have the capability:
    (i) To allow simultaneous reception of any two scrambled or 
encrypted signals and to provide for tuning to alternative channels on a 
pre-programmed schedule; and
    (ii) To allow direct reception of all other signals that do not need 
to be processed through descrambling or decryption circuitry (this 
capability can generally be provided through a separate by-pass switch 
or through internal by-pass circuitry in a cable system terminal 
device).
    (3) Cable system operators shall determine the specific equipment 
needed by individual subscribers on a case-by-case basis, in 
consultation with the subscriber. Cable system operators are required to 
make a good faith effort to provide subscribers with the amount and 
types of special equipment needed to resolve their individual 
compatibility problems.
    (4) Cable operators shall provide such equipment at the request of 
individual subscribers and may charge for purchase or lease of the 
equipment and its installation in accordance with the provisions of the 
rate regulation rules for customer premises equipment used to receive 
the basic service tier, as set forth in Sec. 76.923. Notwithstanding the

[[Page 560]]

required annual offering, cable operators shall respond to subscriber 
requests for special equipment for reception of multiple signals that 
are made at any time.
    (d) Cable system operators shall provide a consumer education 
program on compatibility matters to their subscribers in writing, as 
follows:
    (1) The consumer information program shall be provided to 
subscribers at the time they first subscribe and at least once a year 
thereafter. Cable operators may choose the time and means by which they 
comply with the annual consumer information requirement. This 
requirement may be satisfied by a once-a-year mailing to all 
subscribers. The information may be included in one of the cable 
system's regular subscriber billings.
    (2) The consumer information program shall include the following 
information:
    (i) Cable system operators shall inform their subscribers that some 
models of TV receivers and videocassette recorders may not be able to 
receive all of the channels offered by the cable system when connected 
directly to the cable system. In conjunction with this information, 
cable system operators shall briefly explain, the types of channel 
compatibility problems that could occur if subscribers connected their 
equipment directly to the cable system and offer suggestions for 
resolving those problems. Such suggestions could include, for example, 
the use of a cable system terminal device such as a set-top channel 
converter. Cable system operators shall also indicate that channel 
compatibility problems associated with reception of programming that is 
not scrambled or encrypted programming could be resolved through use of 
simple converter devices without descrambling or decryption capabilities 
that can be obtained from either the cable system or a third party 
retail vendor.
    (ii) In cases where service is received through a cable system 
terminal device, cable system operators shall indicate that subscribers 
may not be able to use special features and functions of their TV 
receivers and videocassette recorders, including features that allow the 
subscriber to: view a program on one channel while simultaneously 
recording a program on another channel; record two or more consecutive 
programs that appear on different channels; and, use advanced picture 
generation and display features such as ``Picture-in-Picture,'' channel 
review and other functions that necessitate channel selection by the 
consumer device.
    (iii) In cases where cable system operators offer remote control 
capability with cable system terminal devices and other customer 
premises equipment that is provided to subscribers, they shall advise 
their subscribers that remote control units that are compatible with 
that equipment may be obtained from other sources, such as retail 
outlets. Cable system operators shall also provide a representative list 
of the models of remote control units currently available from retailers 
that are compatible with the customer premises equipment they employ. 
Cable system operators are required to make a good faith effort in 
compiling this list and will not be liable for inadvertent omissions. 
This list shall be current as of no more than six months before the date 
the consumer education program is distributed to subscribers. Cable 
operators are also required to encourage subscribers to contact the 
cable operator to inquire about whether a particular remote control unit 
the subscriber might be considering for purchase would be compatible 
with the subscriber's customer premises equipment.

    Note: Sec. 76.630: The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section are applicable July 31, 1994, and June 30, 1994, respectively. 
The provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section are applicable 
October 31, 1994, except for the requirement under paragraph (c) of this 
section for cable system operators to supply cable system terminal 
devices with dual tuners (as needed), which is applicable October 31, 
1995. The initial offer of special equipment to all subscribers, as 
required under paragraph (c) of this section, shall be made by October 
31, 1994.

Sec. 76.701  Leased access channels.

    (a) Notwithstanding 47 U.S.C. 532(b)(2) (Communications Act of 1934, 
as amended, section 612), a cable operator, in accordance with 47 U.S.C. 
532(h) (Cable Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, section 
10(a)), may adopt and enforce prospectively a written and published 
policy of prohibiting programming which, it reasonably believes,

                      Subpart M--Cable Home Wiring


<R05>
Sec. 76.801  Scope.

    The provisions of this subpart set forth rules and regulations for 
the disposition, after a subscriber voluntarily terminates cable 
service, of that cable home wiring installed by the cable system 
operator or its contractor within the premises of the subscriber. The 
provisions do not apply where the cable home wiring belongs to the 
subscriber, such as where the operator has transferred ownership to the 
subscriber, the operator has been treating the wiring as belonging to 
the subscriber for tax purposes, or the wiring is considered to be a 
fixture by state or local law in the subscriber's jurisdiction. Nothing 
in this subpart shall affect the cable system operator's rights and 
responsibilities under Sec. 76.617 to prevent excessive signal leakage 
while providing cable service, or the cable operator's right to access 
the subscriber's property or premises.

[58 FR 11971, Mar. 2, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 76.802  Disposition of cable home wiring.

    (a) Upon voluntary termination of cable service by a subscriber, a 
cable operator shall not remove the cable home wiring unless it gives 
the subscriber the opportunity to purchase the wiring at the replacement 
cost, and the subscriber declines. The cost is to be determined based on 
the replacement cost per foot of the cable home wiring multiplied by the 
length in feet of the cable home wiring, and the replacement cost of any 
passive splitters located on the subscriber's side of the demarcation 
point. If the subscriber declines to acquire the cable home wiring, the 
cable system operator must then remove it within seven (7) business 
days, under normal operating conditions, or make no subsequent attempt 
to remove it or to restrict its use.
    (b) During the initial telephone call in which a subscriber contacts 
a cable operator to voluntarily terminate cable service, the cable 
operator--if it owns and intends to remove the home wiring--must inform 
the subscriber:
    (1) That the cable operator owns the home wiring;
    (2) That the cable operator intends to remove the home wiring;
    (3) That the subscriber has the right to purchase the home wiring; 
and
    (4) What the per-foot replacement cost and total charge for the 
wiring would be (the total charge may be based on either the actual 
length of cable wiring and the actual number of passive splitters on the 
customer's side of the demarcation point, or a reasonable approximation 
thereof; in either event, the information necessary for

[[Page 562]]

calculating the total charge must be available for use during the 
initial phone call).
    (c) If the subscriber voluntarily terminates cable service in 
person, the procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section apply.
    (d) If the subscriber requests termination of cable service in 
writing, it is the operator's responsibility--if it wishes to remove the 
wiring--to make reasonable efforts to contact the subscriber prior to 
the date of service termination and follow the procedures set forth in 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (e) If the cable operator fails to adhere to the procedures 
described in paragraph (b) of this section, it will be deemed to have 
relinquished immediately any and all ownership interests in the home 
wiring; thus, the operator will not be entitled to compensation for the 
wiring and shall make no subsequent attempt to remove it or restrict its 
use.
    (f) If the cable operator adheres to the procedures described in 
paragraph (b) of this section, and, at that point, the subscriber agrees 
to purchase the wiring, constructive ownership over the home wiring will 
transfer to the subscriber immediately, and the subscriber will be 
permitted to authorize a competing service provider to connect with and 
use the home wiring.
    (g) If the cable operator adheres to the procedures described in 
paragraph (b) of this section, and the subscriber asks for more time to 
make a decision regarding whether to purchase the home wiring, the seven 
(7) business day period described in paragraph (b) of this section will 
not begin running until the subscriber declines to purchase the wiring; 
in addition, the subscriber may not use the wiring to connect to an 
alternative service provider until the subscriber notifies the operator 
whether or not the subscriber wishes to purchase the wiring.
    (h) If an alternative video programming service provider connects 
its wiring to the home wiring before the incumbent cable operator has 
terminated service and has capped off its line to prevent signal 
leakage, the alternative video programming service provider shall be 
responsible for ensuring that the incumbent's wiring is properly capped 
off in accordance with the Commission's signal leakage requirements. See 
Subpart K (technical standards) of the Commission's Cable Television 
Service rules (47 CFR 76.605(a)(13) and 76.610 through 76.617).
    (i) Where the subscriber terminates cable service but will not be 
using the home wiring to receive another alternative video programming 
service, the cable operator shall properly cap off its own line in 
accordance with the Commission's signal leakage requirements. See 
Subpart K (technical standards) of the Commission's Cable Television 
Service rules (47 CFR 76.605(a)(13) and 76.610 through 76.617).
    (j) Cable operators are prohibited from using any ownership 
interests they may have in property located on the subscriber's side of 
the demarcation point, such as molding or conduit, to prevent, impede, 
or in any way interfere with, a subscriber's right to use his or her 
home wiring to receive an alternative service. In addition, incumbent 
cable operators must take reasonable steps within their control to 
ensure that an alternative service provider has access to the home 
wiring at the demarcation point. Cable operators and alternative 
multichannel video programming delivery service providers are required 
to minimize the potential for signal leakage in accordance with the 
guidelines set forth in 47 CFR 76.605(a)(13) and 76.610 through 76.617, 
theft of service and unnecessary disruption of the consumer's premises.
    (k) Definitions--Normal operating conditions--The term ``normal 
operating conditions'' shall have the same meaning as at 47 CFR 
76.309(c)(4)(ii).

Sec. 76.900  Temporary freeze of cable rates.

    (a) The average monthly subscriber bill for services provided by 
cable operators subject to regulation under Section 623 of the 
Communications Act shall not increase above the average monthly 
subscriber bill determined under rates in effect on April 5, 1993, for a 
period of 120 days.
    (b) The average monthly subscriber bill shall be calculated by 
determining for a monthly billing cycle the sum of all billed monthly 
charges for all cable services subject to regulation under section 623 
of the Communications Act and dividing that sum by the number of 
subscribers receiving any of those services. The average monthly 
subscriber bill determined under rates in effect on April 5, 1993, shall 
be calculated based on customer charges for the most recent monthly 
billing cycle ending prior to April 5, 1993.


<R05>
Sec. 76.901  Definitions.

    (a) Basic service. The basic service tier shall, at a minimum, 
include all signals of domestic television broadcast stations provided 
to any subscriber (except a signal secondarily transmitted by satellite 
carrier beyond the local service area of such station, regardless of how 
such signal is ultimately received by the cable system) any public, 
educational, and governmental programming required by the franchise to 
be carried on the basic tier, and any additional video programming 
signals a service added to the basic tier by the cable operator.
    (b) Cable programming service. Cable programming service includes 
any video programming provided over a cable system, regardless of 
service tier, including installation or rental of equipment used for the 
receipt of such video programming, other than:
    (1) Video programming carried on the basic service tier as defined 
in this section;
    (2) Video programming offered on a pay-per-channel or pay-per-
program basis; or
    (3) A combination of multiple channels of pay-per-channel or pay-
per-program video programming offered on a multiplexed or time-shifted 
basis so long as the combined service:
    (i) Consists of commonly-identified video programming; and
    (ii) Is not bundled with any regulated tier of service.
    (c) Small System. A small system is a cable television system that 
serves 15,000 or fewer subscribers. The service area of a small system 
shall be determined by the number of subscribers that are served by the 
system's principal headend, including any other headends or microwave 
receive sites that are technically integrated to the principal headend.
    (d) New Product Tier. A new product tier (``NPT'') is a cable 
programming service tier meeting the conditions set forth in 
Sec. 76.987.
    (e) Small cable company. A small cable company is a cable television 
operator that serves a total of 400,000 or fewer subscribers over one or 
more cable systems.

<R05>
Sec. 76.905  Standards for identification of cable systems subject to effective competition.

    (a) Only the rates of cable systems that are not subject to 
effective competition may be regulated.
    (b) A cable system is subject to effective competition when any one 
of the following conditions is met:
    (1) Fewer than 30 percent of the households in its franchise area 
subscribe to the cable service of a cable system.
    (2) The franchise area is:

[[Page 564]]

    (i) Served by at least two unaffiliated multichannel video 
programming distributors each of which offers comparable programming to 
at least 50 percent of the households in the franchise area; and
    (ii) the number of households subscribing to multichannel video 
programming other than the largest multichannel video programming 
distributor exceeds 15 percent of the households in the franchise area.
    (3) A multichannel video programming distributor, operated by the 
franchising authority for that franchise area, offers video programming 
to at least 50 percent of the households in the franchise area.
    (4) A local exchange carrier or its affiliate (or any multichannel 
video programming distributor using the facilities of such carrier or 
its affiliate) offers video programming services directly to subscribers 
by any means (other than direct-to-home satellite services) in the 
franchise area of an unaffiliated cable operator which is providing 
cable service in that franchise area, but only if the video programming 
services so offered in that area are comparable to the video programming 
services provided by the unaffiliated cable operator in that area.
    (c) For purposes of paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this 
section, each separately billed or billable customer will count as a 
household subscribing to or being offered video programming services, 
with the exception of multiple dwelling buildings billed as a single 
customer. Individual units of multiple dwelling buildings will count as 
separate households. The term ``households'' shall not include those 
dwellings that are used solely for seasonal, occasional, or recreational 
use.
    (d) A multichannel video program distributor, for purposes of this 
section, is an entity such as, but not limited to, a cable operator, a 
multichannel multipoint distribution service, a direct broadcast 
satellite service, a television receive-only satellite program 
distributor, a video dialtone service provider, or a satellite master 
antenna television service provider that makes available for purchase, 
by subscribers or customers, multiple channels of video programming.
    (e) Service of a multichannel video programming distributor will be 
deemed offered:
    (1) When the multichannel video programming distributor is 
physically able to deliver service to potential subscribers, with the 
addition of no or only minimal additional investment by the distributor, 
in order for an individual subscriber to receive service; and
    (2) When no regulatory, technical or other impediments to households 
taking service exist, and potential subscribers in the franchise area 
are reasonably aware that they may purchase the services of the 
multichannel video programming distributor.
    (f) For purposes of determining the number of households subscribing 
to the services of a multichannel video programming distributor other 
than the largest multichannel video programming distributor, under 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the number of subscribers of all 
multichannel video programming distributors that offer service in the 
franchise area will be aggregated.
    (g) In order to offer comparable programming within the meaning of 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, a competing multichannel video 
programming distributor must offer at least 12 channels of video 
programming, including at least one channel of nonbroadcast service 
programming.

Sec. 76.910  Franchising authority certification.

    (a) A franchising authority must be certified by the Commission in 
order to regulate the basic service tier and associated equipment of a 
cable system within its jurisdiction.
    (b) To be certified, the franchising authority must file with the 
Commission a written certification that:
    (1) The franchising authority will adopt and administer regulations 
with

[[Page 565]]

respect to the rates for the basic service tier that are consistent with 
the regulations prescribed by the Commission for regulation of the basic 
service tier;
    (2) The franchising authority has the legal authority to adopt, and 
the personnel to administer, such regulations;
    (3) Procedural laws and regulations applicable to rate regulation 
proceedings by such authority provide a reasonable opportunity for 
consideration of the views of interested parties; and
    (4) The cable system in question is not subject to effective 
competition. Unless a franchising authority has actual knowledge to the 
contrary, the franchising authority may rely on the presumption in 
Sec. 76.906 that the cable operator is not subject to effective 
competition.
    (c) The written certification described in paragraph (b) of this 
section shall be made by filing the FCC form designated for that 
purpose. The form must be filed by
    (1) Registered mail, return receipt requested, or
    (2) Hand-delivery to the Commission and a date-stamped copy 
obtained. The date on the return receipt or on the date-stamped copy is 
the date filed.
    (d) A copy of the certification form described in paragraph (c) of 
this section must be served on the cable operator before or on the same 
day it is filed with the Commission.
    (e) Unless the Commission notifies the franchising authority 
otherwise, the certification will become effective 30 days after the 
date filed, provided, however, That the franchising authority may not 
regulate the rates of a cable system unless it:
    (1) Adopts regulations:
    (i) Consistent with the Commission's regulations governing the basic 
tier; and
    (ii) Providing a reasonable opportunity for consideration of the 
views of interested parties, within 120 days of the effective date of 
certification; and
    (2) Notifies the cable operator that the authority has been 
certified and has adopted the regulations required by paragraph (e)(1) 
of this section.
    (f) If the Commission denies a franchising authority's 
certification, the Commission will notify the franchising authority of 
any revisions or modifications necessary to obtain approval.


<R05>
Sec. 76.911  Petition for reconsideration of certification.

    (a) A cable operator (or other interested party) may challenge a 
franchising authority's certification by filing a petition for 
reconsideration. The petition may allege either of the following:
    (1) The cable operator is not subject to rate regulation because 
effective competition exists as defined in Sec. 76.905.
    (2) The franchising authority does not meet the certification 
standards set forth in 47 U.S.C. 543(a)(3).
    (b)(1) The cable operator bears the burden of rebutting the 
presumption that effective competition does not exist with evidence that 
effective competition, as defined in Sec. 76,905, exists in the 
franchise area.
    (2) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if the 
evidence establishing effective competition is not otherwise available, 
cable operators may request from a competitor information regarding the 
competitor's reach and number of subscribers. A competitor must respond 
to such request within 15 days. Such responses may be limited to 
numerical totals.
    (c) Stay of rate regulation. (1) The filing of a petition for 
reconsideration pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section will 
automatically stay the imposition of rate regulation pending the outcome 
of the reconsideration proceeding.
    (2) A petitioner filing pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section 
may request a stay of rate regulation.
    (3) In any case in which a stay of rate regulation has been granted, 
if the petition for reconsideration is denied, the cable operator may be 
required to refund any rates or portion of rates above the permitted 
tier charge or permitted equipment charge which were collected from the 
date the operator implements a prospective rate reduction back in time 
to September 1, 1993, or one year, whichever is shorter.
    (d) The filing of a petition for reconsideration alleging the 
presence of effective competition based on frivolous grounds is 
prohibited, and may be subject to forfeitures.

[[Page 566]]

    (e) If the Commission upholds a challenge to a certification filed 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the Commission will notify 
the franchising authority of the revisions necessary to secure approval 
and provide the authority an opportunity to amend its certification 
however necessary to secure approval. Provided, however, That pending 
approval of certification, the Commission will assume jurisdiction over 
basic cable service rates in that franchise area.

Sec. 76.913  Assumption of jurisdiction by the Commission.

    (a) Upon denial or revocation of the franchising authority's 
certification, the Commission will regulate rates for cable services and 
associated equipment of a cable system not subject to effective 
competition, as defined in Sec. 76.905, in a franchise area. Such 
regulation by the Commission will continue until the franchising 
authority has obtained certification or recertification.
    (b) A franchising authority unable to meet certification standards 
may petition the Commission to regulate the rates for basic cable 
service and associated equipment of its franchisee when:
    (1) The franchising authority lacks the resources to administer rate 
regulation.
    (2) The franchising authority lacks the legal authority to regulate 
basic service rates; Provided, however, That the authority must submit 
with its request a statement detailing the nature of the legal 
infirmity.
    (c) The Commission will regulate basic service rates pursuant to 
this Section until the franchising authority qualifies to exercise 
jurisdiction pursuant to Sec. 76.916.

[58 FR 29753, May 21, 1993, as amended at 62 FR 6495, Feb. 12, 1997]

    Effective Date Note:  At 62 FR 6495, Feb. 12, 1997, in Sec. 76.913, 
paragraph (b)(1) was revised. This amendment contains information 
collection and recordkeeping requirements and will not become effective 
until approval has been given by the Office of Management and Budget.


<R05>
Sec. 76.914  Revocation of certification.

    (a) A franchising authority's certification shall be revoked if:
    (1) After the franchising authority has been given a reasonable 
opportunity to comment and cure any minor nonconformance, it is 
determined that state and local laws and regulations are in substantial 
and material conflict with the Commission's regulations governing cable 
rates.
    (2) After being given an opportunity to cure the defect, a 
franchising authority fails to fulfill one of the three conditions for 
certification, set forth in 47 U.S.C. 543(a)(3), or any of the 
provisions of Sec. 76.910(b).
    (b) In all cases of revocation, the Commission will assume 
jurisdiction over basic service rates until an authority becomes 
recertified. The Commission will also notify the franchising authority 
regarding the corrective action that may be taken.
    (c) A petition for revocation must be served on the franchising 
authority and contain a statement that service was made. The franchising 
authority may file an opposition within 30 days of filing of the 
petition. A reply may be filed within 15 days of filing the opposition.
    (d) While a petition for revocation is pending, and absent grant of 
a stay, the franchising authority may continue to regulate the basic 
service rates of its franchisees.

[58 FR 29753, May 21, 1993, as amended at 59 FR 17972, Apr. 15, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 76.915  Change in status of cable operator.

    (a) A cable operator that becomes subject to effective competition, 
may

[[Page 567]]

petition the franchising authority for change in its regulatory status. 
The operator bears the burden of proving the existence of effective 
competition. Oppositions may be filed within 15 days of public notice of 
the filing of the petition, and must be served on the operator. Cable 
operators may reply within 7 days of filing of oppositions.
    (b) Franchising authority decisions on petitions for change in 
status must be made within 30 days after the pleading cycle set forth in 
paragraph (a) of this section closes. Franchising authorities must 
notify the Commission within ten days of any decision changing status. 
Unless the Commission receives an opposition to such change in status, 
the decision will become final 30 days after adoption by the franchising 
authority.
    (c) After an initial determination of the franchising authority that 
effective competition exists becomes final, the franchising authority 
will then cease regulating basic cable service rates, and the 
Commission's regulatory authority over cable programming services for 
the system in the franchise area will also cease.
    (d) A cable operator and a franchising authority may submit a joint 
statement that effective competition exists. The joint statement must 
stipulate which of the three statutory tests for effective competition 
has been met and explain how the test has been satisfied. These joint 
statements will become final decisions within 30 days of filing with the 
Commission, unless challenged by an interested party.
    (e) Cable operators denied a change in status by a franchising 
authority may seek review of that finding at the Commission by filing a 
petition for revocation.
    (f) In cases where a local franchising authority has not been 
certified to regulate rates, a cable operator may petition the 
Commission for change in its regulatory status. The time periods in 
paragraph (a) of this section will apply to oppositions and replies 
concerning these petitions.


<R05>
Sec. 76.916  Petition for recertification.

    (a) After its request for certification has been denied or its 
existing certification has been revoked, a franchising authority wishing 
to assume jurisdiction to regulate basic service and associated 
equipment rates must file a ``Petition for Recertification'' accompanied 
by a copy of the earlier decision denying or revoking certification.
    (b) The petition must:
    (1) Meet the requirements set forth in 47 U.S.C. 543(a)(3);
    (2) State that the cable system is not subject to effective 
competition; and
    (3) Contain a clear showing, supported by either objectively 
verifiable data such as a state statute, or by affidavit, that the 
reasons for the earlier denial or revocation no longer pertain.
    (c) The petition must be served on the cable operator and on any 
interested party that participated in the proceeding denying or revoking 
the original certification.
    (d) Oppositions may be filed within 15 days after the petition is 
filed, and must be served on the petitioner. Replies may be filed within 
seven days of filing of oppositions, and must be served on the opposing 
party(ies).


<R05>
Sec. 76.917  Notification of certification withdrawal.

    A franchising authority that has been certified to regulate rates 
may, at any time, notify the Commission that it no longer intends to 
regulate basic cable rates. Such notification shall include the 
franchising authority's determination that rate regulation no longer 
serves the interests of cable subscribers served by the cable system 
within the franchising authority's jurisdiction, and that it has 
received no consideration for its withdrawal of certification. Such 
notification shall be served on the cable operator. The Commission 
retains the right to review such determinations and to request the 
factual finding of the franchising authority underlying its decision to 
withdraw certification. The franchising authority's withdrawal becomes 
effective upon notification to the Commission.

[59 FR 17972, Apr. 15, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 76.920  Composition of the basic tier.

    Every subscriber of a cable system must subscribe to the basic tier 
in order to subscribe to any other tier of

[[Page 568]]

video programming or to purchase any other video programming.


<R05>
Sec. 76.921  Buy-through of other tiers prohibited.

    (a) No cable system operator, other than an operator subject to 
effective competition, may require the subscription to any tier other 
than the basic service tier as a condition of subscription to video 
programming offered on a per channel or per program charge basis. A 
cable operator may, however, require the subscription to one or more 
tiers of cable programming services as a condition of access to one or 
more tiers of cable programming services.
    (b) A cable operator not subject to effective competition may not 
discriminate between subscribers to the basic service tier and other 
subscribers with regard to the rates charged for video programming 
offered on a per-channel or per-program charge basis.
    (c) With respect to cable systems not subject to effective 
competition, prior to October 5, 2002, the provisions of paragraph (a) 
of this section shall not apply to any cable system that lacks the 
capacity to offer basic service and all programming distributed on a per 
channel or per program basis without also providing other intermediate 
tiers of service:
    (1) By controlling subscriber access to nonbasic channels of service 
through addressable equipment electronically controlled from a central 
control point; or
    (2) Through the installation, noninstallation, or removal of 
frequency filters (traps) at the premises of subscribers without other 
alteration in system configuration or design and without causing 
degradation in the technical quality of service provided.
    (d) With respect to cable systems not subject to effective 
competition, any retiering of channels or services that is not 
undertaken in order to accomplish legitimate regulatory, technical, or 
customer service objectives and that is intended to frustrate or has the 
effect of frustrating compliance with paragraphs (a) through (c) of this 
section is prohibited.

[62 FR 6495, Feb. 12, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 76.922  Rates for the basic service tier and cable programming services tiers.

    (a) Basic and cable programming service tier rates. Basic service 
tier and cable programming service rates shall be subject to regulation 
by the Commission and by state and local authorities, as is appropriate, 
in order to assure that they are in compliance with the requirements of 
47 U.S.C. 543. Rates that are demonstrated, in accordance with this 
part, not to exceed the ``Initial Permitted Per Channel Charge'' or the 
``Subsequent Permitted Per Channel Charge'' as described in this 
section, or the equipment charges as specified in Sec. 76.923, will be 
accepted as in compliance. The maximum monthly charge per subscriber for 
a tier of regulated programming services offered by a cable system shall 
consist of a permitted per channel charge multiplied by the number of 
channels on the tier, plus a charge for franchise fees. The maximum 
monthly charges for regulated programming services shall not include any 
charges for equipment or installations. Charges for equipment and 
installations are to be calculated separately pursuant to Sec. 76.923. 
The same rate-making methodology (either the benchmark methodology found 
in paragraph (b) of this section, or a cost-of-service showing) shall be 
used to set initial rates on all rate regulated tiers, and shall 
continue to provide the basis for subsequent permitted charges.
    (b) Permitted charge on May 15, 1994. (1) The permitted charge for a 
tier of regulated program service shall be, at the election of the cable 
system, either:
    (i) A rate determined pursuant to a cost-of-service showing;
    (ii) The full reduction rate;
    (iii) The transition rate, if the system is eligible for transition 
relief; or
    (iv) A rate based on a streamlined rate reduction, if the system is 
eligible to implement such a rate reduction. Except where noted, the 
term ``rate'' in this subsection means a rate measured on an average 
regulated revenue per subscriber basis.
    (2) Full reduction rate. The ``full reduction rate'' on May 15, 1994 
is the system's September 30, 1992 rate, measured on an average 
regulated revenue

[[Page 569]]

per subscriber basis, reduced by 17 percent, and then adjusted for the 
following:
    (i) The establishment of permitted equipment rates as required by 
Sec. 76.923;
    (ii) Inflation measured by the GNP-PI between October 1, 1992 and 
September 30, 1993;
    (iii) Changes in the number of program channels subject to 
regulation that are offered on the system's program tiers between 
September 30, 1992 and the earlier of the initial date of regulation for 
any tier or February 28, 1994; and
    (iv) Changes in external costs that have occurred between the 
earlier of the initial date of regulation for any tier or February 28, 
1994, and March 31, 1994.
    (3) March 31, 1994 benchmark rate. The ``March 31, 1994 benchmark 
rate'' is the rate so designated using the calculations in Form 1200.
    (4) Transition rates.--(i) Termination of transition relief for 
systems other than low price systems. Systems other than low-price 
systems that already have established a transition rate as of the 
effective date of this rule may maintain their current rates, as 
adjusted under the price cap requirements of Sec. 76.922(d), until two 
years from the effective date of this rule. These systems must begin 
charging reasonable rates in accordance with applicable rules, other 
than transition relief, no later than that date.
    (ii) Low-price systems. Low price systems shall be eligible to 
establish a transition rate for a tier.
    (A) A low-price system is a system:
    (1) Whose March 31, 1994 rate is below its March 31, 1994 benchmark 
rate, or
    (2) Whose March 31, 1994 rate is above its March 31, 1994 benchmark 
rate, but whose March 31, 1994 full reduction rate is below its March 
31, 1994 benchmark rate, as defined in Sec. 76.922(b)(2), above.
    (B) The transition rate on May 15, 1994 for a system whose March 31, 
1994 rate is below its March 31, 1994 benchmark rate is the system's 
March 31, 1994 rate. The March 31, 1994 rate is in both cases adjusted:
    (1) To establish permitted rates for equipment as required by 
Sec. 76.923 if such rates have not already been established; and
    (2) For changes in external costs incurred between the earlier of 
initial date of regulation of any tier or February 28, 1994, and March 
31, 1994, to the extent changes in such costs are not already reflected 
in the system's March 31, 1994 rate. The transition rate on May 15, 1994 
for a system whose March 31, 1994 adjusted rate is above its March 31, 
1994 benchmark rate, but whose March 31, 1994 full reduction rate is 
below its March 31, 1994 benchmark rate, is the March 31, 1994 benchmark 
rate, adjusted to establish permitted rates for equipment as required by 
Sec. 76.923 if such rates have not already been established.
    (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the transition rate for a tier 
shall be adjusted to reflect any determination by a local franchising 
authority and/or the Commission that the rate in effect on March 31, 
1994 was higher (or lower) than that permitted under applicable 
Commission regulations. A filing reflecting the adjusted rate shall be 
submitted to all relevant authorities within 30 days after issuance of 
the local franchising authority and/or Commission determination. A 
system whose March 31, 1994 rate is determined by a local franchising 
authority or the Commission to be too high under the Commission's rate 
regulations in effect before May 15, 1994 will be subject to any refund 
liability that may accrue under those rules. In addition, the system 
will be liable for refund liability under the rules in effect on and 
after May 15, 1994. Such refund liability will be measured by the 
difference in the system's March 31, 1994 rate and its permitted March 
31, 1994 rate as calculated under the Commission's rate regulations in 
effect before May 15, 1994. The refund liability will accrue according 
to the time periods set forth in Secs. 76.942, and 76.961 of the 
Commission's rules.
    (5) Streamlined rate reductions. (i) Small systems that are not 
owned by or affiliated with any other system (``independent systems''), 
and small systems owned by small multiple system operators (``small 
MSOs''), that have not already restructured their rates to comply with 
the Commission's rules may establish rates for regulated program 
services and equipment by making a streamlined rate reduction.

[[Page 570]]

``Small MSOs'' are those multiple system operators that:
    (A) Small systems that are owned by small cable companies and that 
have not already restructured their rates to comply with the 
Commission's rules may establish rates for regulated program services 
and equipment by making a streamlined rate reduction. Small systems 
owned by small cable companies shall not be eligible for streamlined 
rate reductions if they are owned or controlled by, or are under common 
control or affiliated with, a cable operator that exceeds these 
subscriber limits. For purposes of this rule, a small system will be 
considered ``affiliated with'' such an operator if the operator has a 20 
percent or greater equity interest in the small system.
    (B) The streamlined rate for a tier on May 15, 1994 shall be the 
system's March 31, 1994 rate for the tier, reduced by 14 percent. A 
small system that elects to establish its rate for a tier by 
implementing this streamlined rate reduction must also reduce, at the 
same time, each billed item of regulated cable service, including 
equipment, by 14 percent. Regulated rates established using the 
streamlined rate reduction process shall remain in effect until:
    (1) Adoption of a further order by the Commission establishing a 
schedule of average equipment costs;
    (2) The system increases its rates using the calculations and time 
periods set forth in FCC Form 1211; or
    (3) The system elects to establish permitted rates under another 
available option set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (C) Implementation and notification. An eligible small system that 
elects to use the streamlined rate reduction process must implement the 
required rate reductions and provide written notice of such reductions 
to subscribers, the local franchising authority and the Commission 
according to the following schedule:
    (1) Within 60 days from the date it receives the initial notice of 
regulation from the franchising authority or the Commission, the small 
system must provide written notice to subscribers and the franchising 
authority, or to the Commission if the Commission is regulating the 
basic tier, that it is electing to set its regulated rates by the 
streamlined rate reduction process. The system must then implement the 
streamlined rate reductions within 30 days after the written 
notification has been provided to subscribers and the local franchise 
authority or Commission.
    (2) If a cable programming services complaint is filed against the 
system, the system must provide the required written notice, described 
in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(C)(1) of this section, to subscribers, the 
local franchising authority or the Commission within 60 days after the 
complaint is filed. The system must then implement the streamlined rate 
reductions within 30 days after the written notification has been 
provided.
    (3) A small system is required to give written notice of, and to 
implement, the rates that are produced by the streamlined rate reduction 
process only once. If a system has already provided notice of, and 
implemented, the streamlined rate reductions when a given tier becomes 
subject to regulation, it must report to the relevant regulator (either 
the franchising authority or the Commission) in writing within 30 days 
of becoming subject to regulation that it has already provided the 
required notice and implemented the required rate reductions.
    (ii) The stremlined rate for a tier on May 15, 1994 shall be the 
system's March 31, 1994 rate for the tier, reduced by 14 percent. A 
small system that elects to establish its rate for a tier by 
implementing this streamlined rate reduction must also reduce, at the 
same time, each billed item of regulated cable service, including 
equipment, by 14 percent. Regulated rates established using the 
streamlined rate reduction process shall remain in effect until:
    (A) Adoption of a further order by the Commission establishing a 
schedule of average equipment costs;
    (B) The system increases its rates using the calculations and time 
periods set forth in FCC Form 1211; or
    (C) The system elects to establish permitted rates under another 
available option set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (iii) Implementation and notification. An eligible small system that 
elects to use the streamlined rate reduction

[[Page 571]]

process must implement the required rate reductions and provide written 
notice of such reductions to subscribers, the local franchising 
authority and the Commission according to the following schedule:
    (A) Where the franchising authority has been certified by the 
Commission to regulate the small system's basic service tier rates as of 
May 15, 1994, the system must notify the franchising authority and its 
subscribers in writing that it is electing to set its regulated rates by 
the streamline rate reduction process. Such notice must be given by June 
15, 1994, and must also describe the new rates that will result from the 
streamlined rate reduction process. Those rates must then be implemented 
within 30 days after the written notification has been provided to 
subscribers and the local franchising authority.
    (B) Where the franchising authority has not been certified to 
regulate basic service tier rates by May 15, 1994, the small system must 
provide the written notice to subscribers and the franchising authority, 
described in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(A) of this section, within 30 days 
from the date it receives the initial notice of regulation from the 
franchising authority. The system must then implement the streamlined 
rate reductions within 30 days after the written notification has been 
provided to subscribers and the local franchise authority.
    (C) Where the Commission is regulating the small system's basic 
service tier rates as of May 15, 1994, the system must notify the 
Commission and its subscribers in writing that it is electing to set its 
regulated rates by the streamlined rate reduction process. Such notice 
must be given by June 15, 1994, and must also describe the new rates 
that will result from the streamlined rate reduction process. Those 
rates must then be implemented within 30 days after the written 
notification has been provided to subscribers and the Commission.
    (D) Where the Commission begins regulating basic service rates after 
May 15, 1994, the small system must provide the written notice to 
subscribers and the Commission, described in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(C) of 
this section, within 30 days from the date it receives an initial notice 
of regulation. The system must then implement the streamlined rate 
reductions within 30 days after the written notification has been 
provided to subscribers and the Commission.
    (E) If a complaint about its cable programming service rates has 
been filed with the Commission on or before May 15, 1994, the small 
system must provide the written notice described in paragraph 
(b)(5)(iii)(A) of this section, to subscribers, the local franchising 
authority and the Commission by June 15, 1994. If a cable programming 
services complaint is filed against the system after May 15, 1994, the 
system must provide the required written notice to subscribers, the 
local franchising authority or the Commission within 30 days after the 
complaint is filed. The system must then implement the streamlined rate 
reductions within 30 days after the written notification has been 
provided.
    (F) A small system is required to give written notice of, and to 
implement, the rates that are produced by the streamlined rate reduction 
process only once. If a system has already provided notice of, and 
implemented, the streamlined rate reductions when a given tier becomes 
subject to regulation, it must report to the relevant regulator (either 
the franchising authority or the Commission) in writing within 30 days 
of becoming subject to regulation that it has already provided the 
required notice and implemented the required rate reductions.
    (6) Establishment of initial regulated rates. (i) Cable systems, 
other than those eligible for streamlined rate reductions, shall file 
FCC Forms 1200, 1205, and 1215 for a tier that is regulated on May 15, 
1994 by June 15, 1994, or thirty days after the initial date of 
regulation for the tier. A system that becomes subject to regulation for 
the first time on or after July 1, 1994 shall also file FCC Form 1210 at 
the time it files FCC Forms 1200, 1205 and 1215.
    (ii) A cable system will not incur refund liability under the 
Commission's rules governing regulated cable rates on and after May 15, 
1994 if:
    (A) Between March 31, 1994 and July 14, 1994, the system does not 
change the rate for, or restructure in any fashion,

[[Page 572]]

any program service or equipment offering that is subject to regulation 
under the 1992 Cable Act; and
    (B) The system establishes a permitted rate defined in paragraph (b) 
of this section by July 14, 1994. The deferral of refund liability 
permitted by this subsection will terminate if, after March 31, 1994, 
the system changes any rate for, or restructures, any program service or 
equipment offering subject to regulation, and in all events will expire 
on July 14, 1994. Moreover, the deferral of refund liability permitted 
by this paragraph does not apply to refund liability that occurs because 
the system's March 31, 1994 rates for program services and equipment 
subject to regulation are higher than the levels permitted under the 
Commission's rules in effect before May 15, 1994.
    (7) For purposes of this section, the initial date of regulation for 
the basic service tier shall be the date on which notice is given 
pursuant to Sec. 76.910, that the provision of the basic service tier is 
subject to regulation. For a cable programming services tier, the 
initial date of regulation shall be the first date on which a complaint 
on the appropriate form is filed with the Commission concerning rates 
charged for the cable programming services tier.
    (8) For purposes of this section, rates in effect on the initial 
date of regulation or on September 30, 1992 shall be the rates charged 
to subscribers for service received on that date.
    (9) Updating Data Calculations.
    (i) For purposes of this section, if:
    (A) A cable operator, prior to becoming subject to regulation, 
revised its rates to comply with the Commission's rules; and
    (B) The data on which the cable operator relied was current and 
accurate at the time of revision, and the rate is accurate and justified 
by the prior data; and
    (C) Through no fault of the cable operator, the rates that resulted 
from using such data differ from the rates that would result from using 
data current and accurate at the time the cable operator's system 
becomes subject to regulation;

then the cable operator is not required to change its rates to reflect 
the data current at the time it becomes subject to regulation.
    (ii) Notwithstanding the above, any subsequent changes in a cable 
operator's rates must be made from rate levels derived from data [that 
was current as of the date of the rate change].
    (iii) For purposes of this subsection, if the rates charged by a 
cable operator are not justified by an analysis based on the data 
available at the time it initially adjusted its rates, the cable 
operator must adjust its rates in accordance with the most accurate data 
available at the time of the analysis.
    (c) Subsequent permitted charge. (1) The permitted charge for a tier 
after May 15, 1994 shall be, at the election of the cable system, 
either:
    (i) A rate determined pursuant to a cost-of-service showing,
    (ii) A rate determined by application of the Commission's price cap 
requirements set forth in paragraph (d) of this section to a permitted 
rate determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, or
    (iii) A rate determined by application of the Commission's price cap 
requirements set forth in paragraph (e) of this section to a permitted 
rate determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) The Commission's price cap requirements allow a system to adjust 
its permitted charges for inflation, changes in the number of regulated 
channels on tiers, or changes in external costs. After May 15, 1994, 
adjustments for changes in external costs shall be calculated by 
subtracting external costs from the system's permitted charge and making 
changes to that ``external cost component'' as necessary. The remaining 
charge, referred to as the ``residual component,'' will be adjusted 
annually for inflation. Cable systems may adjust their rates by using 
the price cap rules contained in either paragraph (d) or (e) of this 
section. In addition, cable systems may further adjust their rates using 
the methodologies set forth in paragraph (n) of this section.
    (3) An operator may switch between the quarterly rate adjustment 
option contained in paragraph (d) of this section and the annual rate 
adjustment

[[Page 573]]

option contained in paragraph (e) of this section, provided that:
    (i) Whenever an operator switches from the current quarterly system 
to the annual system, the operator may not file a Form 1240 earlier than 
90 days after the operator proposed its last rate adjustment on a Form 
1210; and
    (ii) When an operator changes from the annual system to the 
quarterly system, the operator may not return to a quarterly adjustment 
using a Form 1210 until a full quarter after it has filed a true up of 
its annual rate on a Form 1240 for the preceding filing period.
    (4) An operator that does not set its rates pursuant to a cost-of-
service filing must use the quarterly rate adjustment methodology 
pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section or annual rate adjustment 
methodology pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section for both its basic 
service tier and its cable programming services tier(s).
    (d) Quarterly rate adjustment method--(1) Calendar year quarters. 
All systems using the quarterly rate adjustment methodology must use the 
following calendar year quarters when adjusting rates under the price 
cap requirements. The first quarter shall run from January 1 through 
March 31 of the relevant year; the second quarter shall run from April 1 
through June 30; the third quarter shall run from July 1 through 
September 30; and the fourth quarter shall run from October 1 through 
December 31.
    (2) Inflation Adjustments. The residual component of a system's 
permitted charge may be adjusted annually for inflation. The annual 
inflation adjustment shall be used on inflation occurring from June 30 
of the previous year to June 30 of the year in which the inflation 
adjustment is made, except that the first annual inflation adjustment 
shall cover inflation from September 30, 1993 until June 30 of the year 
in which the inflation adjustment is made. The adjustment may be made 
after September 30, but no later than August 31, of the next calendar 
year. Adjustments shall be based on changes in the Gross National 
Product Price Index as published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of 
the United States Department of Commerce. Cable systems that establish a 
transition rate pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section may not 
begin adjusting rates on account of inflation before April 1, 1995. 
Between April 1, 1995 and August 31, 1995 cable systems that established 
a transition rate may adjust their rates to reflect the net of a 5.21% 
inflation adjustment minus any inflation adjustments they have already 
received. Low price systems that had their March 31, 1994 rates above 
the benchmark, but their full reduction rate below the benchmark will be 
permitted to adjust their rates to reflect the full 5.21% inflation 
factor unless the rate reduction was less than the inflation adjustment 
received on an FCC Form 393 for rates established prior to May 15, 1994. 
If the rate reduction established by a low price system that reduced its 
rate to the benchmark was less than the inflation adjustment received on 
an FCC Form 393, the system will be permitted to receive the 5.21% 
inflation adjustment minus the difference between the rate reduction and 
the inflation adjustment the system made on its FCC Form 393. Cable 
systems that established a transition rate may make future inflation 
adjustments on an annual basis with all other cable operators, no 
earlier than October 1 of each year and no later than August 31 of the 
following year to reflect the final GNP-PI through June 30 of the 
applicable year.
    (3) External costs. (i) Permitted charges for a tier may be adjusted 
up to quarterly to reflect changes in external costs experienced by the 
cable system as defined by paragraph (f) of this section. In all events, 
a system must adjust its rates annually to reflect any decreases in 
external costs that have not previously been accounted for in the 
system's rates. A system must also adjust its rates annually to reflect 
any changes in external costs, inflation and the number of channels on 
regulated tiers that occurred during the year if the system wishes to 
have such changes reflected in its regulated rates. A system that does 
not adjust its permitted rates annually to account for those changes 
will not be permitted to increase its

[[Page 574]]

rates subsequently to reflect the changes.
    (ii) A system must adjust its rates in the next calendar year 
quarter for any decrease in programming costs that results from the 
deletion of a channel or channels from a regulated tier.
    (iii) Any rate increase made to reflect an increase in external 
costs must also fully account for all other changes in external costs, 
inflation and the number of channels on regulated tiers that occurred 
during the same period. Rate adjustments made to reflect changes in 
external costs shall be based on any changes in those external costs 
that occurred from the end of the last quarter for which an adjustment 
was previously made through the end of the quarter that has most 
recently closed preceding the filing of the FCC Form 1210 (or FCC Form 
1211, where applicable). A system may adjust its rates after the close 
of a quarter to reflect changes in external costs that occurred during 
that quarter as soon as it has sufficient information to calculate the 
rate change.
    (e) Annual rate adjustment method--(1) Generally. Except as provided 
for in paragraphs (e)(2)(iii)(B) and (e)(2)(iii)(C) of this section and 
Section 76.923(o), operators that elect the annual rate adjustment 
method may not adjust their rates more than annually to reflect 
inflation, changes in external costs, changes in the number of regulated 
channels, and changes in equipment costs. Operators that make rate 
adjustments using this method must file on the same date a Form 1240 for 
the purpose of making rate adjustments to reflect inflation, changes in 
external costs and changes in the number of regulated channels and a 
Form 1205 for the purpose of adjusting rates for regulated equipment and 
installation. Operators may choose the annual filing date, but they must 
notify the franchising authority of their proposed filing date prior to 
their filing. Franchising authorities or their designees may reject the 
annual filing date chosen by the operator for good cause. If the 
franchising authority finds good cause to reject the proposed filing 
date, the franchising authority and the operator should work together in 
an effort to reach a mutually acceptable date. If no agreement can be 
reached, the franchising authority may set the filing date up to 60 days 
later than the date chosen by the operator. An operator may change its 
filing date from year-to-year, but except as described in paragraphs 
(e)(2)(iii)(B) and (e)(2)(iii)(C) of this section, at least twelve 
months must pass before the operator can implement its next annual 
adjustment.
    (2) Projecting Inflation, Changes in External Costs, and Changes in 
Number of Regulated Channels. An operator that elects the annual rate 
adjustment method may adjust its rates to reflect inflation, changes in 
external costs and changes in the number of regulated channels that are 
projected for the 12 months following the date the operator is scheduled 
to make its rate adjustment pursuant to Section 76.933(g).
    (i) Inflation Adjustments. The residual component of a system's 
permitted charge may be adjusted annually to project for the 12 months 
following the date the operator is scheduled to make a rate adjustment. 
The annual inflation adjustment shall be based on inflation that 
occurred in the most recently completed July 1 to June 30 period. 
Adjustments shall be based on changes in the Gross National Product 
Price Index as published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the 
United States Department of Commerce.
    (ii) External costs. (A) Permitted charges for a tier may be 
adjusted annually to reflect changes in external costs experienced but 
not yet accounted for by the cable system, as well as for projections in 
these external costs for the 12-month period on which the filing is 
based. In order that rates be adjusted for projections in external 
costs, the operator must demonstrate that such projections are 
reasonably certain and reasonably quantifiable. Projections involving 
copyright fees, retransmission consent fees, other programming costs, 
Commission regulatory fees, and cable specific taxes are presumed to be 
reasonably certain and reasonably quantifiable. Operators may project 
for increases in franchise related costs to the extent that they are 
reasonably certain and reasonably quantifiable, but such changes are not

[[Page 575]]

presumed reasonably certain and reasonably quantifiable. Operators may 
pass through increases in franchise fees pursuant to Section 76.933(g).
    (B) In all events, a system must adjust its rates every twelve 
months to reflect any net decreases in external costs that have not 
previously been accounted for in the system's rates.
    (C) Any rate increase made to reflect increases or projected 
increases in external costs must also fully account for all other 
changes and projected changes in external costs, inflation and the 
number of channels on regulated tiers that occurred or will occur during 
the same period. Rate adjustments made to reflect changes in external 
costs shall be based on any changes, plus projections, in those external 
costs that occurred or will occur in the relevant time periods since the 
periods used in the operator's most recent previous FCC Form 1240.
    (iii) Channel Adjustments. (A) Permitted charges for a tier may be 
adjusted annually to reflect changes not yet accounted for in the number 
of regulated channels provided by the cable system, as well as for 
projected changes in the number of regulated channels for the 12-month 
period on which the filing is based. In order that rates be adjusted for 
projected changes to the number of regulated channels, the operator must 
demonstrate that such projections are reasonably certain and reasonably 
quantifiable.
    (B) An operator may make rate adjustments for the addition of 
required channels to the basic service tier that are required under 
federal or local law at any time such additions occur, subject to the 
filing requirements of Section 76.933(g)(2), regardless of whether such 
additions occur outside of the annual filing cycle. Required channels 
may include must-carry, local origination, public, educational and 
governmental access and leased access channels. Should the operator 
elect not to pass through the costs immediately, it may accrue the costs 
of the additional channels plus interest, as described in paragraph 
(e)(3) of this section.
    (C) An operator may make one additional rate adjustment during the 
year to reflect channel additions to the cable programming services 
tiers or, where the operator offers only one regulated tier, the basic 
service tier. Operators may make this additional rate adjustment at any 
time during the year, subject to the filing requirements of Section 
76.933(g)(2), regardless of whether the channel addition occurs outside 
of the annual filing cycle. Should the operator elect not to pass 
through the costs immediately, it may accrue the costs of the additional 
channels plus interest, as described in paragraph (e)(3) of this 
section.
    (3) True-up and Accrual of Charges Not Projected. As part of the 
annual rate adjustment, an operator must ``true up'' its previously 
projected inflation, changes in external costs and changes in the number 
of regulated channels and adjust its rates for these actual cost 
changes. The operator must decrease its rates for overestimation of its 
projected cost changes, and may increase its rates to adjust for 
underestimation of its projected cost changes.
    (i) Where an operator has underestimated costs, future rates may be 
increased to permit recovery of the accrued costs plus 11.25% interest 
between the date the costs are incurred and the date the operator is 
entitled to make its rate adjustment.
    (ii) Per Channel Adjustment. Operators may increase rates by a per 
channel adjustment of up to 20 cents per subscriber per month, exclusive 
of programming costs, for each channel added to a CPST between May 15, 
1994, and December 31, 1997, except that an operator may take the per 
channel adjustment only for channel additions that result in an increase 
in the highest number of channels offered on all CPSTs as compared to 
May 14, 1994, and each date thereafter. Any revenues received from a 
programmer, or shared by a programmer and an operator in connection with 
the addition of a channel to a CPST shall first be deducted from 
programming costs for that channel pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(x) of 
this section and then, to the extent revenues received from the 
programmer are greater than the programming costs, shall be deducted 
from the per channel adjustment. This deduction will apply on a channel 
by channel basis. With respect to the per channel adjustment only, this 
deduction shall

[[Page 576]]

not apply to revenues received by an operator from a programmer as 
commissions on sales of products or services offered through home 
shopping services.
    (iii) If an operator has underestimated its cost changes and elects 
not to recover these accrued costs with interest on the date the 
operator is entitled to make its annual rate adjustment, the interest 
will cease to accrue as of the date the operator is entitled to make the 
annual rate adjustment, but the operator will not lose its ability to 
recover such costs and interest. An operator may recover accrued costs 
between the date such costs are incurred and the date the operator 
actually implements its rate adjustment.
    (iv) Operators that use the annual methodology in their next filing 
after the release date of this Order may accrue costs and interest 
incurred since July 1, 1995 in that filing. Operators that file a Form 
1210 in their next filing after the release date of this Order, and 
elect to use Form 1240 in a subsequent filing, may accrue costs incurred 
since the end of the last quarter to which a Form 1210 applies.
    (4) Sunset Provision. The Commission will review paragraph (e) of 
this section prior to December 31, 1998 to determine whether the annual 
rate adjustment methodology should be kept, and whether the quarterly 
system should be eliminated and replaced with the annual rate adjustment 
method.
    (f) External costs. (1) External costs shall consist of costs in the 
following categories:
    (i) State and local taxes applicable to the provision of cable 
television service;
    (ii) Franchise fees;
    (iii) Costs of complying with franchise requirements, including 
costs of providing public, educational, and governmental access channels 
as required by the franchising authority;
    (iv) Retransmission consent fees and copyright fees incurred for the 
carriage of broadcast signals;
    (v) Other programming costs; and
    (vi) Commission cable television system regulatory fees imposed 
pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Sec. 159.
    (2) The permitted charge for a regulated tier shall be adjusted on 
account of programming costs, copyright fees and retransmission consent 
fees only for the program channels or broadcast signals offered on that 
tier.
    (3) The permitted charge shall not be adjusted for costs of 
retransmission consent fees or changes in those fees incurred prior to 
October 6, 1994.
    (4) The starting date for adjustments on account of external costs 
for a tier of regulated programming service shall be the earlier of the 
initial date of regulation for any basic or cable service tier or 
February 28, 1994. Except, for regulated FCC Form 1200 rates set on the 
basis of rates at September 30, 1992 (using either March 31, 1994 rates 
initially determined from FCC Form 393 Worksheet 2 or using Form 1200 
Full Reduction Rates from Line J6), the starting date shall be September 
30, 1992. Operators in this latter group may make adjustment for changes 
in external costs for the period between September 30, 1992, and the 
initial date of regulation or February 28, 1994, whichever is 
applicable, based either on changes in the GNP-PI over that period or on 
the actual change in the external costs over that period. Thereafter, 
adjustment for external costs may be made on the basis of actual changes 
in external costs only.
    (5) Changes in franchise fees shall not result in an adjustment to 
permitted charges, but rather shall be calculated separately as part of 
the maximum monthly charge per subscriber for a tier of regulated 
programming service.
    (6) Adjustments to permitted charges to reflect changes in the costs 
of programming purchased from affiliated programmers, as defined in 
Sec. 76.901, shall be permitted as long as the price charged to the 
affiliated system reflects either prevailing company prices offered in 
the marketplace to third parties (where the affiliated program supplier 
has established such prices) or the fair market value of the 
programming.
    (7) Adjustments to permitted charges on account of increases in 
costs of programming shall be further adjusted to reflect any revenues 
received by the operator from the programmer. Such adjustments shall 
apply on a channel-by-channel basis.

[[Page 577]]

    (8) In calculating programming expense, operators may add a mark-up 
of 7.5% for increases in programming costs occurring after March 31, 
1994, except that operators may not file for or take the 7.5% mark-up on 
programming costs for new channels added on or after May 15, 1994 for 
which the operator has used the methodology set forth in paragraph 
(g)(3) of this section for adjusting rates for channels added to cable 
programming service tiers. Operators shall reduce rates by decreases in 
programming expense plus an additional 7.5% for decreases occurring 
after May 15, 1994 except with respect to programming cost decreases on 
channels added after May 15, 1994 for which the rate adjustment 
methodology in paragraph (g)(3) of this section was used.
    (g) Changes in the number of channels on regulated tiers.(1) 
Generally. A system may adjust the residual component of its permitted 
rate for a tier to reflect changes in the number of channels offered on 
the tier on a quarterly basis. Cable systems shall use FCC Form 1210 (or 
FCC Form 1211, where applicable) or FCC Form 1240 to justify rate 
changes made on account of changes in the number of channels on a basic 
service tier (``BST'') or a cable programming service tier (``CPST''). 
Such rate adjustments shall be based on any changes in the number of 
regulated channels that occurred from the end of the last quarter for 
which an adjustment was previously made through the end of the quarter 
that has most recently closed preceding the filing of the FCC Form 1210 
(or FCC Form 1211, where applicable) or FCC Form 1240. However, when a 
system deletes channels in a calendar quarter, the system must adjust 
the residual component of the tier charge in the next calendar quarter 
to reflect that deletion. Operators must elect between the channel 
addition rules in paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) of this section the first 
time they adjust rates after December 31, 1994, to reflect a channel 
addition to a CPST that occurred on or after May 15, 1994, and must use 
the elected methodology for all rate adjustments through December 31, 
1997. A system that adjusted rates after May 15, 1994, but before 
January 1, 1995 on account of a change in the number of channels on a 
CPST that occurred after May 15, 1994, may elect to revise its rates to 
charge the rates permitted by paragraph (g)(3) of this section on or 
after January 1, 1995, but is not required to do so as a condition for 
using the methodology in paragraph (g)(3) of this section for rate 
adjustments after January 1, 1995. Rates for the BST will be governed 
exclusively by paragraph (g)(2) of this section, except that where a 
system offered only one tier on May 14, 1994, the cable operator will be 
allowed to elect between paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) of this section as 
if the tier was a CPST.
    (2) Adjusting Rates for increases in the number of channels offered 
between May 15, 1994, and December 31, 1997, on a basic service tier and 
at the election of the operator on a cable programming service tier. The 
following table shall be used to adjust permitted rates for increases in 
the number of channels offered between May 15, 1994, and December 31, 
1997, on a basic service tier and subject to the conditions in paragraph 
(g)(1) of this section at the election of the operator on a CPST. The 
entries in the table provide the cents per channel per subscriber per 
month by which cable operators will adjust the residual component using 
FCC Form 1210 (or FCC Form 1211, where applicable) or FCC Form 1240.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In order to adjust the residual component of the tier charge when 
there is an increase in the number of channels on a tier, the operator 
shall perform the following calculations:
    (i) Take the sum of the old total number of channels on tiers 
subject to regulation (i.e., tiers that are, or could be, regulated but 
excluding New Product Tiers) and the new total number of channels and 
divide the resulting number by two;
    (ii) Consult the above table to find the applicable per channel 
adjustment factor for the number of channels produced by the 
calculations in step (1). For each tier for which there has been an 
increase in the number of channels, multiply the per-channel adjustment 
factor times the change in the number of channels on that tier. The 
result is the total adjustment for that tier.
    (3) Alternative methodology for adjusting rates for changes in the 
number of channels offered on a cable programming service tier or a 
single tier system between May 15, 1994, and December 31, 1997. This 
paragraph at the Operator's discretion as set forth in paragraph (g)(1) 
of this section shall be used to adjust permitted rates for a CPST after 
December 31, 1994, for changes in the number of channels offered on a 
CPST between May 15, 1994, and December 31, 1997. For purposes of 
paragraph (g)(3) of this section, a single tier system may be treated as 
if it were a CPST.
    (i) Operators Cap Attributable to New Channels on All CPSTs Through 
December 31, 1997. Operators electing to use the methodology set forth 
in this paragraph may increase their rates between January 1, 1995, and 
December 31, 1997, by up to 20 cents per channel, exclusive of 
programming costs, for new channels added to CPSTs on or after May 15, 
1994, except that they may not make rate adjustments totalling more than 
$1.20 per month, per subscriber through December 31, 1996, and by more 
than $1.40 per month, per subscriber through December 31, 1997 (the 
``Operator's Cap''). Except to the extent that the programming costs of 
such channels are covered by the License Fee Reserve provided for in 
paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section, programming costs associated with 
channels for which a rate adjustment is made pursuant to this paragraph 
(g)(3) of this section must fall within the Operators' Cap if the 
programming costs (including any increases therein) are reflected in 
rates before January 1, 1997. Inflation adjustments pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(2) or (e)(2) of this section are not counted against the 
Operator's Cap.
    (ii) Per Channel Adjustment. Operators may increase rates by a per 
channel adjustment of up to 20 cents per subscriber per month, exclusive 
of programming costs, for each channel added to a CPST between May 15, 
1994, and December 31, 1997, except that an operator may take the per 
channel adjustment only for channel additions that result in an increase 
in the highest number of channels offered on all CPSTs as compared to 
May 14, 1994, and each date thereafter. Any revenues received from a 
programmer, or shared by a programmer and an operator in connection with 
the addition of a channel to a CPST shall first be deducted from 
programming costs for that channel pursuant to paragraph (f)(7) of this 
section and then, to the extent revenues received from the programmer 
are greater than the programming costs, shall be deducted from the per 
channel adjustment. This deduction will apply on a channel by channel 
basis.
    (iii) License Fee Reserve. In addition to the rate adjustments 
permitted in paragraphs (g)(3)(i) and (g)(3)(ii) of this section, 
operators that make channel additions on or after May 15, 1994 may 
increase their rates by a total of 30 cents per month, per subscriber 
between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1996, for license fees 
associated with such channels (the ``License Fee Reserve''). The License 
Fee Reserve may be applied against the initial license fee and any 
increase in the license fee for such channels during this period. An 
operator may pass-through to subscribers more than the 30 cents between 
January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1996, for license fees associated with 
channels added after May 15, 1994, provided that the total amount 
recovered

[[Page 579]]

from subscribers for such channels, including the License Fee Reserve, 
does not exceed $1.50 per subscriber, per month. After December 31, 
1996, license fees may be passed through to subscribers pursuant to 
paragraph (f) of this section, except that license fees associated with 
channels added pursuant to this paragraph (3) will not be eligible for 
the 7.5% mark-up on increases in programming costs.
    (iv) Timing. For purposes of determining whether a rate increase 
counts against the maximum rate increases specified in paragraphs 
(g)(3)(i) through (g)(3)(ii) of this section, the relevant date shall be 
when rates are increased as a result of channel additions, not when the 
addition occurs.
    (4) Deletion of Channels. When dropping a channel from a BST or 
CPST, operators shall reflect the net reduction in external costs in 
their rates pursuant to paragraphs (d)(3)(i) and (d)(3)(ii) of this 
section, or paragraphs (e)(2)(ii)(A) and (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. 
With respect to channels to which the 7.5% mark-up on programming costs 
applied pursuant to paragraph (f)(8) of this section, the operator shall 
treat the mark-up as part of its programming costs and subtract the 
mark-up from its external costs. Operators shall also reduce the price 
of that tier by the ``residual'' associated with that channel. For 
channels that were on a BST or CPST on May 14, 1994, or channels added 
after that date pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the per 
channel residual is the charge for their tier, minus the external costs 
for the tier, and any per channel adjustments made after that date, 
divided by the total number of channels on the tier minus the number of 
channels on the tier that received the per channel adjustment specified 
in paragraph (g)(3) of this section. For channels added to a CPST after 
May 14, 1994, pursuant to paragraph (g)(3) of this section, the 
residuals shall be the actual per channel adjustment taken for that 
channel when it was added to the tier.
    (5) Movement of Channels Between Tiers. When a channel is moved from 
a CPST or a BST to another CPST or BST, the price of the tier from which 
the channel is dropped shall be reduced to reflect the decrease in 
programming costs and residual as described in paragraph (g)(4) of this 
section. The residual associated with the shifted channel shall then be 
converted from per subscriber to aggregate numbers to ensure aggregate 
revenues from the channel remain the same when the channel is moved. The 
aggregate residual associated with the shifted channel may be shifted to 
the tier to which the channel is being moved. The residual shall then be 
converted to per subscriber figures on the new tier, plus any subsequent 
inflation adjustment. The price of the tier to which the channel is 
shifted may then be increased to reflect this amount. The price of that 
tier may also be increased to reflect any increase in programming cost. 
An operator may not shift a channel for which it received a per channel 
adjustment pursuant to paragraph (g)(3) of this section from a CPST to a 
BST.
    (6) Substitution of Channels on a BST or CPST. If an operator 
substitutes a new channel for an existing channel on a CPST or a BST, no 
per channel adjustment may be made. Operators substituting channels on a 
CPST or a BST shall be required to reflect any reduction in programming 
costs in their rates and may reflect any increase in programming costs 
pursuant to paragraphs (d)(3)(i) and (d)(3)(ii), or paragraphs 
(e)(2)(ii)(A) and (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. If the programming cost 
for the new channel is greater than the programming cost for the 
replaced channel, and the operator chooses to pass that increase through 
to subscribers, the excess shall count against the License Fee Reserve 
or the Operator Cap when the increased cost is passed through to 
subscribers. Where an operator substitutes a new channel for a channel 
on which a 7.5% mark-up on programming costs was taken pursuant to 
paragraph (f)(8) of this section, the operator may retain the 7.5% mark-
up on the license fee of the dropped channel to the extent that it is no 
greater than 7.5% of programming cost of the new service.
    (7) Headend upgrades. When adding channels to CPSTs and single-tier 
systems, cable systems that are owned by a small cable company and incur 
additional monthly per subscriber headend

[[Page 580]]

costs of one full cent or more for an additional channel may choose 
among the methodologies set forth in paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) of 
this section. In addition, such systems may increase rates to recover 
the actual cost of the headend equipment required to add up to seven 
such channels to CPSTs and single-tier systems, not to exceed $5,000 per 
additional channel. Rate increases pursuant to this paragraph may occur 
between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1997, as a result of 
additional channels offered on those tiers after May 14, 1994. Headend 
costs shall be depreciated over the useful life of the equipment. The 
rate of return on this investment shall not exceed 11.25 percent. In 
order to recover costs for headend equipment pursuant to this paragraph, 
systems must certify to the Commission their eligibility to use this 
paragraph, and the level of costs they have actually incurred for adding 
the headend equipment and the depreciation schedule for the equipment.
    (8) Sunset Provision. Paragraph (g) of this section shall cease to 
be effective on January 1, 1998 unless renewed by the Commission.
    (h) Permitted charges for a tier shall be determined in accordance 
with forms and associated instructions established by the Commission.
    (i) Cost of Service Charge. (1) For purposes of this section, a 
monthly cost-of-service charge for a basic service tier or a cable 
programming service tier is an amount equal to the annual revenue 
requirement for that tier divided by a number that is equal to 12 times 
the average number of subscribers to that tier during the test year, 
except that a monthly charge for a system or tier in service less than 
one year shall be equal to the projected annual revenue requirement for 
the first 12 months of operation or service divided by a number that is 
equal to 12 times the projected average number of subscribers during the 
first 12 months of operation or service. The calculation of the average 
number of subscribers shall include all subscribers, regardless of 
whether they receive service at full rates or at discounts.
    (2) A test year for an initial regulated charge is the cable 
operator's fiscal year preceding the initial date of regulation. A test 
year for a change in the basic service charge that is after the initial 
date of regulation is the cable operator's fiscal year preceding the 
mailing or other delivery of written notice pursuant to Section 76.932. 
A test year for a change in a cable programming service charge after the 
initial date of regulation is the cable operator's fiscal year preceding 
the filing of a complaint regarding the increase.
    (3) The annual revenue requirement for a tier is the sum of the 
return component and the expense component for that tier.
    (4) The return component for a tier is the average allowable test 
year ratebase allocable to the tier adjusted for known and measurable 
changes occurring between the end of the test year and the effective 
date of the rate multiplied by the rate of return specified by the 
Commission or franchising authority.
    (5) The expense component for a tier is the sum of allowable test 
year expenses allocable to the tier adjusted for known and measurable 
changes occurring between the end of the test year and the effective 
date of the rate.
    (6) The ratebase may include the following:
    (i) Prudent investment by a cable operator in tangible plant that is 
used and useful in the provision of regulated cable services less 
accumulated depreciation. Tangible plant in service shall be valued at 
the actual money cost (or the money value of any consideration other 
than money) at the time it was first used to provide cable service, 
except that in the case of systems purchased before May 15, 1994 shall 
be presumed to equal 66% of the total purchase price allocable to assets 
(including tangible and intangible assets) used to provide regulated 
services. The 66% allowance shall not be used to justify any rate 
increase taken after the effective date of this rule. The actual money 
cost of plant may include an allowance for funds used during 
construction at the prime rate or the operator's actual cost of funds 
during construction. Cost overruns are presumed to be imprudent 
investment in the absence of a showing that the overrun occurred through 
no fault of the operator.

[[Page 581]]

    (ii) An allowance for start-up losses including depreciation, 
amortization and interest expenses related to assets that are included 
in the ratebase. Capitalized start-up losses, may include cumulative net 
losses, plus any unrecovered interest expenses connected to funding the 
regulated ratebase, amortized over the unexpired life of the franchise, 
commencing with the end of the loss accumulation phase. However, losses 
attributable to accelerated depreciation methodologies are not 
permitted.
    (iii) An allowance for start-up losses, if any, that is equal to the 
lesser of the first two years of operating costs or accumulated losses 
incurred until the system reached the end of its prematurity stage as 
defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board Standard 51 (``FASB 
51'') less straight-line amortization over a reasonable period not 
exceeding 15 years that commences at the end of the prematurity phase of 
operation.
    (iv) Intangible assets less amortization that reflect the original 
costs prudently incurred by a cable operator in organizing and 
incorporating a company that provides regulated cable services, 
obtaining a government franchise to provide regulated cable services, or 
obtaining patents that are used and useful in the provision of cable 
services.
    (v) The cost of customer lists if such costs were capitalized during 
the prematurity phase of operations less amortization.
    (vi) An amount for working capital to the extent that an allowance 
or disallowance for funds needed to sustain the ongoing operations of 
the regulated cable service is demonstrated.
    (vii) Other intangible assets to the extent the cable operator 
demonstrates that the asset reflects costs incurred in an activity or 
transaction that produced concrete benefits or savings for subscribers 
to regulated cable services that would not have been realized otherwise 
and the cable operator demonstrates that a return on such an asset does 
not exceed the value of such a subscriber benefit.
    (viii) The portion of the capacity of plant not currently in service 
that will be placed in service within twelve months of the end of the 
test year.
    (7) Deferred income taxes accrued after the date upon which the 
operator became subject to regulation shall be deducted from items 
included in the ratebase.
    (8) Allowable expenses may include the following:
    (i) All regular expenses normally incurred by a cable operator in 
the provision of regulated cable service, but not including any lobbying 
expense, charitable contributions, penalties and fines paid on account 
of violations of statutes or rules, or membership fees in social, 
service, recreational or athletic clubs or organizations.
    (ii) Reasonable depreciation expense attributable to tangible assets 
allowable in the ratebase.
    (iii) Reasonable amortization expense for prematurely abandoned 
tangible assets formerly includable in the ratebase that are amortized 
over the remainder of the original expected life of the asset.
    (iv) Reasonable amortization expense for start-up losses and 
capitalized intangible assets that are includable in ratebase.
    (v) Taxes other than income taxes attributable to the provision of 
regulated cable services.
    (vi) An income tax allowance.
    (j) Network upgrade rate increase. (1) Cable operators that 
undertake significant network upgrades requiring added capital 
investment may justify an increase in rates for regulated services by 
demonstrating that the capital investment will benefit subscribers.
    (2) A rate increase on account of upgrades shall not be assessed on 
customers until the upgrade is complete and providing benefits to 
customers of regulated services.
    (3) Cable operators seeking an upgrade rate increase have the burden 
of demonstrating the amount of the net increase in costs, taking into 
account current depreciation expense, likely changes in maintenance and 
other costs, changes in regulated revenues and expected economies of 
scale.
    (4) Cable operators seeking a rate increase for network upgrades 
shall allocate net cost increases in conformance

[[Page 582]]

with the cost allocation rules as set forth in Sec. 76.924.
    (5) Cable operators that undertake significant upgrades shall be 
permitted to increase rates by adding the benchmark/price cap rate to 
the rate increment necessary to recover the net increase in cost 
attributable to the upgrade.
    (k) Hardship rate relief. A cable operator may adjust charges by an 
amount specified by the Commission for the cable programming service 
tier or the franchising authority for the basic service tier if it is 
determined that:
    (1) Total revenues from cable operations, measured at the highest 
level of the cable operator's cable service organization, will not be 
sufficient to enable the operator to attract capital or maintain credit 
necessary to enable the operator to continue to provide cable service;
    (2) The cable operator has prudent and efficient management; and
    (3) Adjusted charges on account of hardship will not result in total 
charges for regulated cable services that are excessive in comparison to 
charges of similarly situated systems.
    (l) Cost of service showing. A cable operator that elects to 
establish a charge, or to justify an existing or changed charge for 
regulated cable service, based on a cost-of-service showing must submit 
data to the Commission or the franchising authority in accordance with 
forms established by the Commission. The cable operator must also submit 
any additional information requested by franchising authorities or the 
Commission to resolve questions in cost-of-service proceedings.
    (m) Subsequent Cost of Service Charges. No cable operator may use a 
cost-of-service showing to justify an increase in any charge established 
on a cost-of-service basis for a period of 2 years after that rate takes 
effect, except that the Commission or the franchising authority may 
waive this prohibition upon a showing of unusual circumstances that 
would create undue hardship for a cable operator.
    (n) Further rate adjustments--Uniform rates. A cable operator that 
has established rates in accordance with this section may then be 
permitted to establish a uniform rate for uniform services offered in 
multiple franchise areas. This rate shall be determined in accordance 
with the Commission's procedures and requirements set forth in CS Docket 
No. 95-174.

<R05>
Sec. 76.923  Rates for equipment and installation used to receive the basic service tier.

    (a) Scope. (1) The equipment regulated under this section consists 
of all equipment in a subscriber's home, provided and maintained by the 
operator, that is used to receive the basic service

[[Page 583]]

tier, regardless of whether such equipment is additionally used to 
receive other tiers of regulated programming service and/or unregulated 
service. Such equipment shall include, but is not limited to:
    (i) Converter boxes;
    (ii) Remote control units; and
    (iii) Inside wiring.
    (2) Subscriber charges for such equipment shall not exceed charges 
based on actual costs in accordance with the requirements set forth in 
this section.
    Subscriber charges for such equipment shall not exceed charges based 
on actual costs in accordance with the requirements set forth below.
    (b) Unbundling. A cable operator shall establish rates for remote 
control units, converter boxes, other customer equipment, installation, 
and additional connections separate from rates for basic tier service. 
In addition, the rates for such equipment and installations shall be 
unbundled one from the other.
    (c) Equipment basket. A cable operator shall establish an Equipment 
Basket, which shall include all costs associated with providing customer 
equipment and installation under this section. Equipment Basket costs 
shall be limited to the direct and indirect material and labor costs of 
providing, leasing, installing, repairing, and servicing customer 
equipment, as determined in accordance with the cost accounting and cost 
allocation requirements of Sec. 76.924, except that operators do not 
have to aggregate costs in a manner consistent with the accounting 
practices of the operator on April 3, 1993. The Equipment Basket shall 
not include general administrative overhead including marketing 
expenses. The Equipment Basket shall include a reasonable profit.
    (1) Customer equipment. Costs of customer equipment included in the 
Equipment Basket may be aggregated, on a franchise, system, regional, or 
company level, into broad categories. Except to the extent indicated in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, such categorization may be made, 
provided that each category includes only equipment of the same type, 
regardless of the levels of functionality of the equipment within each 
such broad category. When submitting its equipment costs based on 
average charges, the cable operator must provide a general description 
of the averaging methodology employed and a justification that its 
averaging methodology produces reasonable equipment rates. Equipment 
rates should be set at the same organizational level at which an 
operator aggregates its costs.
    (2) Basic service tier only equipment. Costs of customer equipment 
used by basic-only subscribers may not be aggregated with the costs of 
equipment used by non-basic-only subscribers. Costs of customer 
equipment used by basic-only subscribers may, however, be aggregated, 
consistent with an operator's aggregation under paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, on a franchise, system, regional, or company level. The 
prohibition against aggregation applies to subscribers, not to a 
particular type of equipment. Alternatively, operators may base its 
basic-only subscriber cost aggregation on the assumption that all basic-
only subscribers use equipment that is the lowest level and least 
expensive model of equipment offered by the operator, even if some 
basic-only subscribers actually have higher level, more expensive 
equipment.
    (3) Installation costs. Installation costs, consistent with an 
operator's aggregation under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, may be 
aggregated, on a franchise, system, regional, or company level. When 
submitting its installation costs based on average charges, the cable 
operator must provide a general description of the averaging methodology 
employed and a justification that its averaging methodology produces 
reasonable equipment rates. Installation rates should be set at the same 
organizational level at which an operator aggregates its costs.
    (d) Hourly service charge. A cable operator shall establish charges 
for equipment and installation using the Hourly Service Charge (HSC) 
methodology. The HSC shall equal the operator's annual Equipment Basket 
costs, excluding the purchase cost of customer equipment, divided by the 
total person hours involved in installing, repairing, and servicing 
customer equipment during the same period. The HSC

[[Page 584]]

is calculated according to the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MR91.116

Where, EB=annual Equipment Basket Cost; CE=annual purchase cost of all 
customer equipment; and H=person hours involved in installing and 
repairing equipment per year. The purchase cost of customer equipment 
shall include the cable operator's invoice price plus all other costs 
incurred with respect to the equipment until the time it is provided to 
the customer.
    (e) Installation charges. Installation charges shall be either:
    (1) The HSC multiplied by the actual time spent on each individual 
installation; or
    (2) The HSC multiplied by the average time spent on a specific type 
of installation.
    (f) Remote charges. Monthly charges for rental of a remote control 
unit shall consist of the average annual unit purchase cost of remotes 
leased, including acquisition price and incidental costs such as sales 
tax, financing and storage up to the time it is provided to the 
customer, added to the product of the HSC times the average number of 
hours annually repairing or servicing a remote, divided by 12 to 
determine the monthly lease rate for a remote according to the following 
formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25JN96.006

Where, HR=average hours repair per year; and UCE=average annual unit 
cost of remote.

    (g) Other equipment charges. The monthly charge for rental of 
converter boxes and other customer equipment shall be calculated in the 
same manner as for remote control units. Separate charges may be 
established for each category of other customer equipment.
    (h) Additional connection charges. The costs of installation and 
monthly use of additional connections shall be recovered as charges 
associated with the installation and equipment cost categories, and at 
rate levels determined by the actual cost methodology presented in the 
foregoing paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section. An operator may 
recover additional programming costs and the costs of signal boosters on 
the customers premises, if any, associated with the additional 
connection as a separate monthly unbundled charge for additional 
connections.
    (i) Charges for equipment sold. A cable operator may sell customer 
premises equipment to a subscriber. The equipment price shall recover 
the operator's cost of the equipment, including costs associated with 
storing and preparing the equipment for sale up to the time it is sold 
to the customer, plus a reasonable profit. An operator may sell service 
contracts for the maintenance and repair of equipment sold to 
subscribers. The charge for a service contract shall be the HSC times 
the estimated average number of hours for maintenance and repair over 
the life of the equipment.
    (j) Promotions. A cable operator may offer equipment or installation 
at charges below those determined under paragraphs (e) through (g) of 
this section, as long as those offerings are reasonable in scope in 
relation to the operator's overall offerings in the Equipment Basket and 
not unreasonably discriminatory. Operators may not recover the cost of a 
promotional offering by increasing charges for other Equipment Basket 
elements, or by increasing programming service rates above the maximum 
monthly charge per subscriber prescribed by these rules. As part of a 
general cost-of-service showing, an operator may include the cost of 
promotions in its general system overhead costs.
    (k) Franchise fees. Equipment charges may include a properly 
allocated portion of franchise fees.
    (l) Company-wide averaging of equipment costs. For the purpose of 
developing unbundled equipment charges as required by paragraph (b) of 
this section, a cable operator may average the equipment costs of its 
small systems at any level, or several levels, within its operations. 
This company-wide averaging applies only to an operator's small systems 
as defined in Sec. 76.901(c); is permitted only for equipment charges, 
not

[[Page 585]]

installation charges; and may be established only for similar types of 
equipment. When submitting its equipment costs based on average charges 
to the local franchising authority or the Commission, an operator that 
elects company-wide averaging of equipment costs must provide a general 
description of the averaging methodology employed and a justification 
that its averaging methodology produces reasonable equipment rates. The 
local authority or the Commission may require the operator to set 
equipment rates based on the operator's level of averaging in effect on 
April 3, 1993, as required by Sec. 76.924(d).
    (m) Cable operators shall set charges for equipment and 
installations to recover Equipment Basket costs. Such charges shall be 
set, consistent with the level at which Equipment Basket costs are 
aggregated as provided in Sec. 76.923(c). Cable operators shall maintain 
adequate documentation to demonstrate that charges for the sale and 
lease of equipment and for installations have been developed in 
accordance with the rules set forth in this section.
    (n) Timing of Filings. An operator shall file FCC Form 1205 in order 
to establish its maximum permitted rates at the following times:
    (1) When the operator sets its initial rates under either the 
benchmark system or through a cost-of-service showing;
    (2) Within 60 days of the end of its fiscal year, for an operator 
that adjusts its rates under the system described in Section 76.922(d) 
that allows it to file up to quarterly;
    (3) On the same date it files its FCC Form 1240, for an operator 
that adjusts its rates under the annual rate adjustment system described 
in Section 76.922(e). If an operator elects not to file an FCC Form 1240 
for a particular year, the operator must file a Form 1205 on the 
anniversary date of its last Form 1205 filing; and
    (4) When seeking to adjust its rates to reflect the offering of new 
types of customer equipment other than in conjunction with an annual 
filing of Form 1205, 60 days before it seeks to adjust its rates to 
reflect the offering of new types of customer equipment.
    (o) Introduction of new equipment. In setting the permitted charge 
for a new type of equipment at a time other than at its annual filing, 
an operator shall only complete Schedule C and the relevant step of the 
Worksheet for Calculating Permitted Equipment and Installation Charges 
of a Form 1205. The operator shall rely on entries from its most 
recently filed FCC Form 1205 for information not specifically related to 
the new equipment, including but not limited to the Hourly Service 
Charge. In calculating the annual maintenance and service hours for the 
new equipment, the operator should base its entry on the average annual 
expected time required to maintain the unit, i.e., expected service 
hours required over the life of the equipment unit being introduced 
divided by the equipment unit's expected life.

Sec. 76.924  Allocation to service cost categories.

    (a) Applicability. The requirements of this section are applicable 
to cable operators for which the basic service tier is regulated by 
local franchising authorities or the Commission, or, with respect to a 
cable programming services tier, for which a complaint has been filed 
with the Commission. The requirements of this section are applicable for 
purposes of rate adjustments on account of external costs and for cost-
of-service showings.
    (b) Accounting requirements. Cable operators electing cost-of-
service regulation or seeking rate adjustments due to changes in 
external costs shall maintain their accounts:
    (1) in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; and
    (2) in a manner that will enable identification of appropriate 
investments, revenues, and expenses.
    (c) Accounts level. Except to the extent indicated below, cable 
operators

[[Page 586]]

changes in external costs shall identify investments, expenses and 
revenues at the franchise, system, regional, and/or company level(s) in 
a manner consistent with the accounting practices of the operator on 
April 3, 1993. However, in all events, cable operators shall identify at 
the franchise level their costs of franchise requirements, franchise 
fees, local taxes and local programming.
    (d) Summary accounts. (1) Cable operators filing for cost-of-service 
regulation, other than small systems owned by small cable companies,

    (e) Allocation to service cost categories.
    (1) For cable operators electing cost-of-service regulation, 
investments, expenses, and revenues contained in the summary accounts 
identified in paragraph (d) of this section shall be allocated among the 
Equipment Basket, as specified in Sec. 76.923, and the following service 
cost categories:
    (i) Basic service cost category. The basic service category, shall 
include the cost of providing basic service as defined by 
Sec. 76.901(a). The basic service cost category may only include 
allowable costs as defined by Secs. 76.922(g) through 76.922(k).
    (ii) Cable programming services cost category. The cable programming 
services category shall include the cost of providing cable programming 
services as defined by Sec. 76.901(b). This service cost category shall 
contain subcategories that represent each programming tier that is 
offered as a part of the operator's cable programming services. All 
costs that are allocated to the cable programming service cost cateogry 
shall be further allocated among the programming tiers in this category. 
The cable programming service cost category may include only allowable 
costs as defined in Sec. 76.922(g) through 76.922(k).
    (iii) All other services cost category. The all other services cost 
category shall include the costs of providing all other services that 
are not included the basic service or a cable programming services cost 
categories as defined in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (2) Cable operators seeking an adjustment due to changes in external 
costs identified in FCC Form 1210 shall allocate such costs among the 
equipment basket, as specified in Sec. 76.923, and the following service 
cost categories:
    (i) The basic service category as defined by paragraph (e)(1)(i) of 
this section;
    (ii) The cable programming services category as defined by paragraph 
(e)(1)(ii) of this section;
    (iii) The all other services cost category as defined by paragraph 
(e)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (f) Cost allocation requirements. (1) Allocations of investments, 
expenses and revenues among the service cost categories and the 
equipment basket shall be made at the organizational level in which such 
costs and revenues have been identified for accounting purposes pursuant 
to Sec. 76.924(c).
    (2) Costs of programming and retransmission consent fees shall be 
directly assigned or allocated only to the service cost category in 
which the programming or broadcast signal at issue is offered.
    (3) Costs of franchise fees shall be allocated among the equipment 
basket and the service cost categories in a manner that is most 
consistent with the methodology of assessment of franchise fees by local 
authorities.
    (4) Costs of public, educational, and governmental access channels 
carried on the basic tier shall be directly assigned to the basic tier 
where possible.
    (5) Commission cable television system regulatory fees imposed 
pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 159 shall be directly assigned to the basic 
service tier.
    (6) All other costs that are incurred exclusively to support the 
equipment basket or a specific service cost category shall be directly 
assigned to that service cost category or the equipment basket where 
possible.
    (7) Costs that are not directly assigned shall be allocated to the 
service cost categories in accordance with the following allocation 
procedures:
    (i) Wherever possible, common costs for which no allocator has been 
specified by the Commission are to be allocated among the service cost 
categories and the equipment basket based on direct analysis of the 
origin of the costs.
    (ii) Where allocation based on direct analysis is not possible, 
common costs for which no allocator has been specified by the Commission 
shall, if possible, be allocated among the service costs categories and 
the equipment

[[Page 588]]

basket based on indirect, cost-causative linkage to other costs directly 
assigned or allocated to the service cost categories and the equipment 
basket.
    (iii) Where neither direct nor indirect measures of cost allocation 
can be found, common costs shall be allocated to each service cost 
category based on the ratio of all other costs directly assigned and 
attributed to a service cost category over total costs directly or 
indirectly assigned and directly or indirectly attributable.
    (g) Cost identification at the franchise level. After costs have 
been directly assigned to and allocated among the service cost 
categories and the equipment basket, cable operators that have 
aggregated costs at a higher level than the franchise level must 
identify all applicable costs at the franchise level in the following 
manner:
    (1) Recoverable costs that have been identified at the highest 
organizational level at which costs have been identified shall be 
allocated to the next (lower) organizational level at which recoverable 
costs have been identified on the basis of the ratio of the total number 
of subscribers served at the lower level to the total number of 
subscribers served at the higher level.
    (2) Cable operators shall repeat the procedure specified in 
paragraph (g)(1) of this section at every organizational level at which 
recoverable costs have been identified until such costs have been 
allocated to the franchise level.
    (h) Part-time channels. In situations where a single channel is 
divided on a part-time basis and is used to deliver service associated 
with different tiers or with pay per channel or pay per view service, a 
reasonable and documented allocation of that channel between services 
shall be required along with the associated revenues and costs.
    (i) Transactions and affiliates. Adjustments on account of external 
costs and rates set on a cost-of-service basis shall exclude any amounts 
not calculated in accordance with the following:
    (1) Charges for assets purchased by or transferred to the regulated 
activity of a cable operator from affiliates shall equal the invoice 
price if that price is determined by a prevailing company price. The 
invoice price is the prevailing company price if the affiliate has sold 
a substantial number of like assets to nonaffiliates. If a prevailing 
company price for the assets received by the regulated activity is not 
available, the changes for such assets shall be the lower of their cost 
to the originating activity of the affiliated group less all applicable 
valuation reserves, or their fair market value.
    (2) The proceeds from assets sold or transferred from the regulated 
activity of the cable operator to affiliates shall equal the prevailing 
company price if the cable operator has sold a substantial number of 
like assets to nonaffiliates. If a prevailing company price is not 
available, the proceeds from such sales shall be determined at the 
higher of cost less all applicable valuation reserves, or estimated fair 
market value of the asset.
    (3) Charges for services provided to the regulated activity of a 
cable operator by an affiliate shall equal the invoice price if that 
price is determined by a prevailing company price. The invoice price is 
the prevailing company price if the affiliate has sold like services to 
a substantial number of nonaffiliates. If a prevailing company price for 
the services received by the regulated activity is not available, the 
charges of such services shall be at cost.
    (4) The proceeds from services sold or transferred from the 
regulated activity of the cable operator to affiliates shall equal the 
prevailing company price if the cable operator has sold like services to 
a substantial number of nonaffiliates. If a prevailing company price is 
not available, the proceeds from such sales shall be determined at cost.
    (5) For purposes of Sec. 76.924(i)(1) through 76.924(i)(4), costs 
shall be determined in accordance with the standards and procedures 
specified in Sec. 76.922 and paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section.
    (j) Unrelated expenses and revenues. Cable operators shall exclude 
from cost categories used to develop rates for the provision of 
regulated cable service, equipment, and leased commercial access, any 
direct or indirect expenses and revenues not related to the provision of 
such services. Common costs of providing regulated cable service,

[[Page 589]]

equipment, and leased commercial access and unrelated activities shall 
be allocated between them in accordance with paragraph (f) of this 
section.

<R05>
Sec. 76.930  Initiation of review of basic cable service and equipment rates.

    A cable operator shall file its schedule of rates for the basic 
service tier and associated equipment with a franchising authority 
within 30 days of receiving written notification from the franchising 
authority that the franchising authority has been certified by the 
Commission to regulate rates for the basic service tier. Basic service 
and equipment rate schedule filings for existing rates or proposed rate 
increases (including increases in the baseline channel change that 
results from reductions in the number of channels in a tier) must use 
the appropriate official FCC form, a copy thereof, or a copy generated 
by FCC software. Failure to file on the official FCC form, a copy 
thereof, or a copy generated by FCC software, may result in the 
imposition of sanctions specified in Sec. 76.937(d). A cable operator 
shall include rate cards and channel line-ups with its filing and 
include an explanation of any discrepancy in the figures provided in 
these documents and its rate filing.

[59 FR 17973, Apr. 15, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 76.931  Notification of basic tier availability.

    A cable operator shall provide written notification to subscribers 
of the availability of basic tier service by November 30, 1993, or three 
billing cycles from September 1, 1993, and to new subscribers at the 
time of installation. This notification shall include the following 
information:
    (a) That basic tier service is available;
    (b) The cost per month for basic tier service;

[[Page 590]]

    (c) A list of all services included in the basic service tier.

[58 FR 46735, Sept. 2, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 76.932  Notification of proposed rate increase.

    A cable operator shall provide written notice to a subscriber of any 
increase in the price to be charged for the basic service tier or 
associated equipment at least 30 days before any proposed increase is 
effective. The notice should include the name and address of the local 
franchising authority.


<R05>
Sec. 76.933  Franchising authority review of basic cable rates and equipment costs.

    (a) After a cable operator has submitted for review its existing 
rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment costs, or a 
proposed increase in these rates (including increases in the baseline 
channel change that results from reductions in the number of channels in 
a tier) under the quarterly rate adjustment system pursuant to Section 
76.922(d), the existing rates will remain in effect or the proposed 
rates will become effective after 30 days from the date of submission; 
Provided, however, that the franchising authority may toll this 30-day 
deadline for an additional time by issuing a brief written order as 
described in paragraph (b) within 30 days of the rate submission 
explaining that it needs additional time to review the rates.
    (b) If the franchising authority is unable to determine, based upon 
the material submitted by the cable operator, that the existing, or 
proposed rates under the quarterly adjustment system pursuant to Section 
76.922(d), are within the Commission's permitted basic service tier 
charge or actual cost of equipment as defined in Secs. 76.922 and 
76.923, or if a cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing 
pursuant Secs. 76.937(c) and 76.924, seeking to justify a rate above the 
Commission's basic service tier charge as defined in Secs. 76.922 and 
76.923, the franchising authority may toll the 30-day deadline in 
paragraph (a) of this section to request and/or consider additional 
information or to consider the comments from interested parties as 
follows:
    (1) For an additional 90 days in cases not involving cost-of-service 
showings; or
    (2) For an additional 150 days in cases involving cost-of-service 
showings.
    (c) If a franchising authority has availed itself of the additional 
90 or 150 days permitted in paragraph (b) of this section, and has taken 
no action within these additional time periods, then the proposed rates 
will go into effect at the end of the 90 or 150 day periods, or existing 
rates will remain in effect at such times, subject to refunds if the 
franchising authority subsequently issues a written decision 
disapproving any portion of such rates: Provided, however, That in order 
to order refunds, a franchising authority must have issued a brief 
written order to the cable operator by the end of the 90 or 150-day 
period permitted in paragraph (b) of this section directing the operator 
to keep an accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the 
rate in issue and on whose behalf such amounts were paid.
    (d) A franchising authority may request, pursuant to a petition for 
special relief under Sec. 76.7, that the Commission examine a cable 
operator's cost-of-service showing, submitted to the franchising 
authority as justification of basic tier rates, within 30 days of 
receipt of a cost-of-service showing. In its petition, the franchising 
authority shall document its reasons for seeking Commission assistance. 
The franchising authority shall issue an order stating that it is 
seeking Commission assistance and serve a copy before the 30-day 
deadline on the cable operator submitting the cost showing. The cable 
operator shall deliver a copy of the cost showing, together with all 
relevant attachments, to the Commission within 15 days of receipt of the 
local authority's notice to seek Commission assistance. The Commission 
shall notify the local franchising authority and the cable operator of 
its ruling and of the basic tier rate, as established by the Commission. 
The rate shall take effect upon implementation by the franchising 
authority of such ruling and refund liability shall be governed thereon. 
The Commission's ruling shall be binding on the franchising authority

[[Page 591]]

and the cable operator. A cable operator or franchising authority may 
seek reconsideration of the ruling pursuant to Sec. 1.106(a)(1) of this 
chapter or review by the Commission pursuant to Sec. 1.115(a) of this 
chapter.
    (e) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, when 
the franchising authority is regulating basic service tier rates, a 
cable operator that sets its rates pursuant to the quarterly rate 
adjustment system pursuant to Sec. 76.922(d) may increase its rates for 
basic service to reflect the imposition of, or increase in, franchise 
fees or Commission cable television system regulatory fees imposed 
pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 159. For the purposes of paragraphs (a) through 
(c) of this section, the increased rate attributable to Commission 
regulatory fees or franchise fees shall be treated as an ``existing 
rate'', subject to subsequent review and refund if the franchising 
authority determines that the increase in basic tier rates exceeds the 
increase in regulatory fees or in franchise fees allocable to the basic 
tier. This determination shall be appealable to the Commission pursuant 
to Sec. 76.944. When the Commission is regulating basic service tier 
rates pursuant to Sec. 76.945 or cable programming service rates 
pursuant to Sec. 76.960, an increase in those rates resulting from 
franchise fees or Commission regulatory fees shall be reviewed by the 
Commission pursuant to the mechanisms set forth in Sec. 76.945. A cable 
operator must adjust its rates to reflect decreases in franchise fees or 
Commission regulatory fees within the periods set forth in 
Sec. 76.922(d)(3)(i),(iii).
    (f) For an operator that sets its rates pursuant to the quarterly 
rate adjustment system pursuant to Section 76.922(d), cable television 
system regulatory fees assessed by the Commission pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 
Sec. 159 shall be recovered in monthly installments during the fiscal 
year following the year for which the payment was imposed. Payments 
shall be collected in equal monthly installments, except that for so 
many months as may be necessary to avoid fractional payments, an 
additional $0.01 payment per month may be collected. All such additional 
payments shall be collected in the last month or months of the fiscal 
year, so that once collections of such payments begin there shall be no 
month remaining in the year in which the operator is not entitled to 
such an additional payment. Operators may not assess interest. Operators 
may provide notice of the entire fiscal year's regulatory fee pass-
through in a single notice.
    (g) A cable operator that submits for review a proposed change in 
its existing rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment 
costs using the annual filing system pursuant to Section 76.922(e) shall 
do so no later than 90 days from the effective date of the proposed 
rates. The franchising authority will have 90 days from the date of the 
filing to review it. However, if the franchising authority or its 
designee concludes that the operator has submitted a facially incomplete 
filing, the franchising authority's deadline for issuing a decision, the 
date on which rates may go into effect if no decision is issued, and the 
period for which refunds are payable will be tolled while the 
franchising authority is waiting for this information, provided that, in 
order to toll these effective dates, the franchising authority or its 
designee must notify the operator of the incomplete filing within 45 
days of the date the filing is made.
    (1) If there is a material change in an operator's circumstances 
during the 90-day review period and the change affects the operator's 
rate change filing, the operator may file an amendment to its Form 1240 
prior to the end of the 90-day review period. If the operator files such 
an amendment, the franchising authority will have at least 30 days to 
review the filing. Therefore, if the amendment is filed more than 60 
days after the operator made its initial filing, the operator's proposed 
rate change may not go into effect any earlier than 30 days after the 
filing of its amendment. However, if the operator files its amended 
application on or prior to the sixtieth day of the 90-day review period, 
the operator may implement its proposed rate adjustment, as modified by 
the amendment, 90 days after its initial filing.
    (2) If a franchising authority has taken no action within the 90-day 
review period, then the proposed rates

[[Page 592]]

may go into effect at the end of the review period, subject to a 
prospective rate reduction and refund if the franchising authority 
subsequently issues a written decision disapproving any portion of such 
rates, provided, however, that in order to order a prospective rate 
reduction and refund, if an operator inquires as to whether the 
franchising authority intends to issue a rate order after the initial 
review period, the franchising authority or its designee must notify the 
operator of its intent in this regard within 15 days of the operator's 
inquiry. If a proposed rate goes into effect before the franchising 
authority issues its rate order, the franchising authority will have 12 
months from the date the operator filed for the rate adjustment to issue 
its rate order. In the event that the franchising authority does not act 
within this 12-month period, it may not at a later date order a refund 
or a prospective rate reduction with respect to the rate filing.
    (3) At the time an operator files its rates with the franchising 
authority, the operator may give customers notice of the proposed rate 
changes. Such notice should state that the proposed rate change is 
subject to approval by the franchising authority. If the operator is 
only permitted a smaller increase than was provided for in the notice, 
the operator must provide an explanation to subscribers on the bill in 
which the rate adjustment is implemented. If the operator is not 
permitted to implement any of the rate increase that was provided for in 
the notice, the operator must provide an explanation to subscribers 
within 60 days of the date of the franchising authority's decision. 
Additional advance notice is only required in the unlikely event that 
the rate exceeds the previously noticed rate.
    (4) If an operator files for a rate adjustment under Section 
76.922(e)(2)(iii)(B) for the addition of required channels to the basic 
service tier that the operator is required by federal or local law to 
carry, or, if a single-tier operator files for a rate adjustment based 
on a mid-year channel addition allowed under Section 
76.922(e)(2)(iii)(C), the franchising authority has 60 days to review 
the requested rate. The proposed rate shall take effect at the end of 
this 60-day period unless the franchising authority rejects the proposed 
rate as unreasonable. In order to order refunds and prospective rate 
reductions, the franchising authority shall be subject to the 
requirements described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
    (5) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, when 
the franchising authority is regulating basic service tier rates, a 
cable operator may increase its rates for basic service to reflect the 
imposition of, or increase in, franchise fees. The increased rate 
attributable to Commission regulatory fees or franchise fees shall be 
subject to subsequent review and refund if the franchising authority 
determines that the increase in basic tier rates exceeds the increase in 
regulatory fees or in franchise fees allocable to the basic tier. This 
determination shall be appealable to the Commission pursuant to 
Sec. 76.944. When the Commission is regulating basic service tier rates 
pursuant to Sec. 76.945 or cable programming service rates pursuant to 
Sec. 76.960, an increase in those rates resulting from franchise fees or 
Commission regulatory fees shall be reviewed by the Commission pursuant 
to the mechanisms set forth in Sec. 76.945.
    (h) If an operator files an FCC Form 1205 for the purpose of setting 
the rate for a new type of equipment under Section 76.923(o), the 
franchising authority has 60 days to review the requested rate. The 
proposed rate shall take effect at the end of this 60-day period unless 
the franchising authority rejects the proposed rate as unreasonable.
    (1) If the operator's most recent rate filing was based on the 
system that enables them to file up to once per quarter found at Section 
76.922(d), the franchising authority must issue an accounting order 
before the end of the 60-day period in order to order refunds and 
prospective rate reductions.
    (2) If the operator's most recent rate filing was based on the 
annual rate system at Section 76.922(e), in order to order refunds and 
prospective rate reductions, the franchising authority

[[Page 593]]

shall be subject to the requirements described in paragraph (g)(1) of 
this section.

<R05>
Sec. 76.934  Small systems and small cable companies.

    (a) For purposes of rules governing the reasonableness of rates 
charged by small systems, the size of a system or company shall be 
determined by reference to its size as of the date the system files with 
its franchising authority or the Commission the documentation necessary 
to qualify for the relief sought or, at the option of the company, by 
reference to system or company size as of the effective date of this 
paragraph. Where relief is dependent upon the size of both the system 
and the company, the operator must measure the size of both the system 
and the company as of the same date. A small system shall be considered 
affiliated with a cable company if the company holds a 20 percent or 
greater equity interest in the system or exercises de jure control over 
the system.
    (b) A franchising authority that has been certified, pursuant to 
Sec. 76.910, to regulate rates for basic service and associated 
equipment may permit a small system as defined in Sec. 76.901 to certify 
that the small system's rates for basic service and associated equipment 
comply with Sec. 76.922, the Commission's substantive rate regulations.
    (c) Initial regulation of small systems:
    (1) If certified by the Commission, a local franchising authority 
may provide an initial notice of regulation to a small system, as 
defined by Sec. 76.901(c), on May 15, 1994. Any initial notice of 
regulation issued by a certified local franchising authority prior to 
May 15, 1994 shall be considered as having been issued on May 15, 1994.
    (2) The Commission will accept complaints concerning the rates for 
cable programming service tiers provided by small systems on or after 
May 15, 1994. Any complaints filed with the Commission about the rates 
for a cable programming service tier provided by a small system prior to 
May 15, 1994 shall be considered as having been filed on May 15, 1994.
    (3) A small system that receives an initial notice of regulation 
from its local franchising authority, or a complaint filed with the 
Commission for its cable programming service tier, must respond within 
the time periods prescribed in Secs. 76.930 and 76.956.
    (d) Statutory period for filing initial complaint: A complaint 
concerning a rate for cable programming service or associated equipment 
provided by a small system that was in effect on May 15, 1994 must be 
filed within 180 days from May 15, 1994.
    (e) Petitions for extension of time: Small systems may obtain an 
extension of time to establish compliance with rate regulations provided 
they can demonstrate that timely compliance would result in severe 
economic hardship. Requests for extension of time should be addressed to 
the local franchising authority concerning basic service and equipment 
rates and to the Commission concerning rates for a cable programming 
service tier and associated equipment. The filing of a request for an 
extension of time to comply with the rate regulations will not toll the 
effective date of rate regulation for small systems or alter refund 
liability for rates that exceed permitted levels after May 15, 1994.
    (f) Small Systems Owned by Small Cable Companies. Small systems 
owned by small cable companies shall have 90 days from their initial 
date of regulation on a tier to bring their rates for that tier into 
compliance with the requirements of Sections 76.922 and 76.923. Such 
systems shall have sixty days from the initial date of regulation to 
file FCC Forms 1200, 1205, 1210, 1211, 1215, 1220, 1225, 1230, and 1240 
and any similar forms as appropriate. Rates established during the 90-
day period shall not be subject to prior approval by

franchising authorities or the Commission, but shall be subject to 
refund pursuant to sections 76.942 and 76.961.
    (g) Alternative rate regulation agreements:
    (1) Local franchising authorities, certified pursuant to 
Sec. 76.910, and small systems owned by small cable companies may enter 
into alternative rate regulation agreements affecting the basic service 
tier and the cable programming service tier.
    (i) Small systems must file with the Commission a copy of the 
operative alternative rate regulation agreement within 30 days after its 
effective date.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (2) Alternative rate regulation agreements affecting the basic 
service tier shall take into account the following:
    (i) The rates for cable systems that are subject to effective 
competition;
    (ii) The direct costs of obtaining, transmitting, and otherwise 
providing signals carried on the basic service tier, including signals 
and services carried on the basic service tier, pursuant to Secs. 76.56 
and 76.64 of this subpart, and changes in such costs;
    (iii) Only such portion of the joint and common costs of obtaining, 
transmitting, and otherwise providing such signals as is determined to 
be reasonably and properly allocable to the basic service tier, and 
changes in such costs;
    (iv) The revenues received by a cable operator from advertising from 
programming that is carried as part of the basic service tier or from 
other consideration obtained in connection with the basic service tier;
    (v) The reasonably and properly allocable portion of any amount 
assessed as a franchise fee, tax, or charge of any kind imposed by any 
State or local authority on the transactions between cable operators and 
cable subscribers or any other fee, tax, or assessment of general 
applicability imposed by a governmental entity applied against cable 
operators or cable subscribers;
    (vi) Any amount required to satisfy franchise requirements to 
support public, educational, or governmental channels or the use of such 
channels or any other services required under the franchise; and
    (vii) A reasonable profit. The rate agreed to in such an alternative 
rate regulation agreement shall be deemed to be a reasonable rate.
    (3) Alternative rate regulation agreements affecting the cable 
programming service tier shall take into account, among other factors, 
the following:
    (i) The rates for similarly situated cable systems offering 
comparable cable programming services, taking into account similarities 
in facilities, regulatory and governmental costs, the number of 
subscribers, and other relevant factors;
    (ii) The rates for cable systems, if any, that are subject to 
effective competition;
    (iii) The history of the rates for cable programming services of the 
system, including the relationship of such rates to changes in general 
consumer prices;
    (iv) The rates, as a whole, for all the cable programming, cable 
equipment, and cable services provided by the system, other than 
programming provided on a per channel or per program basis;
    (v) Capital and operating costs of the cable system, including the 
quality and costs of the customer service provided by the cable system; 
and
    (vi) The revenues received by a cable operator from advertising from 
programming that is carried as part of the service for which a rate is 
being established, and changes in such revenues, or from other 
considerations obtained in connection with the cable programming 
services concerned. The rate agreed to in such an alternative rate 
regulation agreement shall be deemed to be a reasonable rate.
    (4) Certified local franchising authorities shall provide a 
reasonable opportunity for consideration of the views of interested 
parties prior to finally entering into an alternative rate regulation 
agreement.
    (5) A basic service rate decision by a certified local franchising 
authority made pursuant to an alternative rate regulation agreement may 
be appealed by an interested party to the Commission pursuant to 
Sec. 76.944 as if the decision were made according to Secs. 76.922 and 
76.923.
    (h) Small system cost-of-service showings:
    (1) At any time, a small system owned by a small cable company may 
establish new rates, or justify existing

[[Page 595]]

rates, for regulated program services in accordance with the small cable 
company cost-of-service methodology described below.
    (2) The maximum annual per subscriber rate permitted initially by 
the small cable company cost-of-service methodology shall be calculated 
by adding
    (i) The system's annual operating expenses to
    (ii) The product of its net rate base and its rate of return, and 
then dividing that sum by (iii) the product of
    (A) The total number of channels carried on the system's basic and 
cable programming service tiers and
    (B) The number of subscribers. The annual rate so calculated must 
then be divided by 12 to arrive at a monthly rate.
    (3) The system shall calculate its maximum permitted rate as 
described in paragraph (b) of this section by completing Form 1230. The 
system shall file Form 1230 as follows:
    (i) Where the franchising authority has been certified by the 
Commission to regulate the system's basic service tier rates, the system 
shall file Form 1230 with the franchising authority.
    (ii) Where the Commission is regulating the system's basic service 
tier rates, the system shall file Form 1230 with the Commission.
    (iii) Where a complaint about the system's cable programming service 
rates is filed with the Commission, the system shall file Form 1230 with 
the Commission.
    (4) In completing Form 1230:
    (i) The annual operating expenses reported by the system shall equal 
the system's operating expenses allocable to its basic and cable 
programming service tiers for the most recent 12 month period for which 
the system has the relevant data readily available, adjusted for known 
and measurable changes occurring between the end of the 12 month period 
and the effective date of the rate. Expenses shall include all regular 
expenses normally incurred by a cable operator in the provision of 
regulated cable service, but shall not include any lobbying expense, 
charitable contributions, penalties and fines paid one account of 
statutes or rules, or membership fees in social service, recreational or 
athletic clubs or associations.
    (ii) The net rate base of a system is the value of all of the 
system's assets, less depreciation.
    (iii) The rate of return claimed by the system shall reflect the 
operator's actual cost of debt, its cost of equity, or an assumed cost 
of equity, and its capital structure, or an assumed capital structure.
    (iv) The number of subscribers reported by the system shall be 
calculated according to the most recent reliable data maintained by the 
system.
    (v) The number of channels reported by the system shall be the 
number of channels it has on its basic and cable programming service 
tiers on the day it files Form 1230.
    (vi) In establishing its operating expenses, net rate base, and 
reasonable rate of return, a system may rely on previously existing 
information such as tax forms or company financial statements, rather 
than create or recreate financial calculations. To the extent existing 
information is incomplete or otherwise insufficient to make exact 
calculations, the system may establish its operating expenses, net rate 
base, and reasonable rate of return on the basis of reasonable, good 
faith estimates.
    (5) After the system files Form 1230, review by the franchising 
authority, or the Commission when appropriate, shall be governed by 
Sec. 76.933, subject to the following conditions.
    (i) If the maximum rate established on Form 1230 does not exceed 
$1.24 per channel, the rate shall be rebuttably presumed reasonable. To 
disallow such a rate, the franchising authority shall bear the burden of 
showing that the operator did not reasonably interpret and allocate its 
cost and expense data in deriving its annual operating expenses, its net 
rate base, and a reasonable rate of return.
    (ii) In the course of reviewing Form 1230, a franchising authority 
shall be permitted to obtain from the cable operator the information 
necessary for judging the validity of methods used for calculating its 
operating costs, rate base, and rate of return. If the maximum rate 
established in Form 1230

[[Page 596]]

does not exceed $1.24 per channel, any request for information by the 
franchising authority shall be limited to existing relevant documents or 
other data compilations and should not require the operator to create 
documents, although the operator should replicate responsive documents 
that are missing or destroyed.
    (iii) A system may file with the Cable Services Bureau an 
interlocutory appeal from any decision by the franchising authority 
requesting information from the system or tolling the effective date of 
a system's proposed rates. The appeal may be made by an informal letter 
to the Chief of the Cable Services Bureau, served on the franchising 
authority. The franchising authority must respond within seven days of 
its receipt of the appeal and shall serve the operator with its 
response. The operator shall have four days from its receipt of the 
response in which to file a reply, if desired. If the maximum rate 
established on Form 1230 does not exceed $1.24 per channel, the burden 
shall be on the franchising authority to show the reasonableness of its 
order. If the maximum rate established on Form 1230 exceeds $1.24 per 
channel, the burden shall be on the operator to show the 
unreasonableness of the order.
    (iv) In reviewing Form 1230 and issuing a decision, the franchising 
authority shall determine the reasonableness of the maximum rate 
permitted by the form, not simply the rate which the operator intends to 
establish.
    (v) A final decision of the franchising authority with respect to 
the requested rate shall be subject to appeal pursuant to Sec. 76.944. 
The filing of an appeal shall stay the effectiveness of the final 
decision pending the disposition of the appeal by the Commission. An 
operator may bifurcate its appeal of a final rate decision by initially 
limiting the scope of the appeal to the reasonableness of any request 
for information made by the franchising authority. The operator may 
defer addressing the substantive rate-setting decision of the 
franchising authority until after the Commission has ruled on the 
reasonableness of the request for information. At its option, the 
operator may forego the bifurcated appeal and address both the request 
for documentation and the substantive rate-setting decision in a single 
appeal. When filing an appeal from a final rate-setting decision by the 
franchising authority, the operator may raise as an issue the scope of 
the request for information only if that request was not approved by the 
Commission on a previous interlocutory appeal by the operator.
    (6) Complaints concerning the rates charged for a cable programming 
services tier by a system that has elected the small cable company cost-
of-service methodology may be filed pursuant to Sec. 76.957. Upon 
receipt of a complaint, the Commission shall review the system's rates 
in accordance with the standards set forth above with respect to basic 
tier rates.
    (7) Unless otherwise ordered by the franchising authority or the 
Commission, the system may establish its per channel rate at any level 
that does not exceed the maximum rate permitted by Form 1230, provided 
that the system has given the required written notice to subscribers. If 
the system establishes its per channel rate at a level that is less than 
the maximum amount permitted by the form, it may increase rates at any 
time thereafter to the maximum amount upon providing the required 
written notice to subscribers.
    (8) After determining the maximum rate permitted by Form 1230, the 
system may adjust that rate in accordance with this paragraph. Electing 
to adjust rates pursuant to one of the options set forth below shall not 
prohibit the system from electing a different option when adjusting 
rates thereafter. The system may adjust its maximum permitted rate 
without adjusting the actual rate it charges subscribers.
    (i) The system may adjust its maximum permitted rate in accordance 
with the price cap requirements set forth in Sec. 76.922(d).
    (ii) The system may adjust its maximum permitted rate in accordance 
with the requirements set forth in Sec. 76.922(e) for changes in the 
number of channels on regulated tiers. For any system that files Form 
1230, no rate adjustments made prior to the effective date of this rule 
shall be charged against the system's Operator's Cap and License Reserve 
Fee described in Sec. 76.922(e)(3).

[[Page 597]]

    (iii) The system may adjust its maximum permitted rate by filing a 
new Form 1230 that permits a higher rate.
    (iv) The system may adjust its maximum permitted rate by complying 
with any of the options set forth in Sec. 76.922(b)(1) for which it 
qualifies or under an alternative rate agreement as provided in 
paragraph (g) of this section.
    (9) In any rate proceeding before a franchising authority in which a 
final decision had not been issued as of June 5, 1995, a small system 
owned by a small cable company may elect the form of rate regulation set 
forth in this section to justify the rates that are the subject of the 
proceeding, if the system and affiliated company were a small system and 
small company respectively as of the effective date of this rule and as 
of the period during which the disputed rates were in effect. This rule 
shall not affect the validity of a final rate decision made by a 
franchising authority before June 5, 1995.
    (10) In any proceeding before the Commission involving a cable 
programming services tier complaint in which a final decision had not 
been issued as of June 5, 1995, a small system owned by a small cable 
company may elect the form of rate regulation set forth in this section 
to justify rates charged prior to the adoption of this rule and to 
establish new rates. For purposes of this paragraph, a decision shall 
not be deemed final until the operator has exhausted or is time-barred 
from pursuing any avenue of appeal, review, or reconsideration.

    Effective Date Note: At 60 FR 52120, Oct. 5, 1995, in Sec. 76.934, 
paragraph (f) was revised. Paragraph (f) contains information collection 
and recordkeeping requirements and will not become effective until 30 
days after approval has been given by the Office of Management and 
Budget.


<R05>
Sec. 76.935  Participation of interested parties.

    In order to regulate basic tier rates or associated equipment costs, 
a franchising authority must have procedural laws or regulations 
applicable to rate regulation proceedings that provide a reasonable 
opportunity for consideration of the views of interested parties. Such 
rules must take into account the 30, 120, or 180-day time periods that 
franchising authorities have to review rates under Sec. 76.933.


<R05>
Sec. 76.936  Written decision.

    (a) A franchising authority must issue a written decision in a 
ratemaking proceeding whenever it disapproves an initial rate for the 
basic service tier or associated equipment in whole or in part, 
disapproves a request for a rate increase in whole or in part, or 
approves a request for an increase in whole or in part over the 
objections of interested parties. A franchising authority is not 
required to issue a written decision that approves an unopposed existing 
or proposed rate for the basic service tier or associated equipment.
    (b) Public notice must be given of any written decision required in 
paragraph (a) of this section, including releasing the text of any 
written decision to the public.


<R05>
Sec. 76.937  Burden of proof.

    (a) A cable operator has the burden of proving that its existing or 
proposed rates for basic service and associated equipment comply with 47 
U.S.C. 543, and Secs. 76.922 and 76.923.
    (b) For an existing or a proposed rate for basic tier service or 
associated equipment that is within the permitted tier charge and actual 
cost of equipment as set forth in Secs. 76.922 and 76.923, the cable 
operator must submit the appropriate FCC form.
    (c) For an existing or a proposed rate for basic tier service that 
exceeds the permitted tier charge as set forth in Secs. 76.922 and 
76.923, the cable operator must submit a cost-of-service showing to 
justify the proposed rate.
    (d) A franchising authority or the Commission may find a cable 
operator that does not attempt to demonstrate the reasonableness of its 
rates in default and, using the best information available, enter an 
order finding the cable operator's rates unreasonable and mandating 
appropriate relief, as specified in Secs. 76.940, 76.941, and 76.942.
    (e) A franchising authority or the Commission may order a cable 
operator that has filed a facially incomplete

[[Page 598]]

form to file supplemental information, and the franchising authority's 
deadline to rule on the reasonableness of the proposed rates will be 
tolled pending the receipt of such information. A franchising authority 
may set reasonable deadlines for the filing of such information, and may 
find the cable operator in default and mandate appropriate relief, 
pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, for the cable operator's 
failure to comply with the deadline or otherwise provide complete 
information in good faith.

<R05>
Sec. 76.938  Proprietary information.

    A franchising authority may require the production of proprietary 
information to make a rate determination in those cases where cable 
operators have submitted initial rates, or have proposed rate increases, 
pursuant to an FCC Form 393 (and/or FCC Forms 1200/1205) filing or a 
cost-of-service showing. The franchising authority shall state a 
justification for each item of information requested and, where related 
to an FCC Form 393 (and/or FCC Forms 1200/1205) filing, indicate the 
question or section of the form to which the request specifically 
relates. Upon request to the franchising authority, the parties to a 
rate proceeding shall have access to such information, subject to the 
franchising authority's procedures governing non-disclosure by the 
parties. Public access to such proprietary information shall be governed 
by applicable state or local law.

[59 FR 17973, Apr. 15, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 76.939  Truthful written statements and responses to requests of franchising authority.

    Cable operators shall comply with franchising authorities' and the 
Commission's requests for information, orders, and decisions. No cable 
operator shall, in any information submitted to a franchising authority 
or the Commission in making a rate determination pursuant to an FCC Form 
393 (and/or FCC Forms 1200/1205) filing or a cost-of-service showing, 
make any misrepresentation or willful material omission bearing on any 
matter within the franchising authority's or the Commission's 
jurisdiction.

[59 FR 17974, Apr. 15, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 76.940  Prospective rate reduction.

    A franchising authority may order a cable operator to implement a 
reduction in basic service tier or associated equipment rates where 
necessary to bring rates into compliance with the standards set forth in 
Secs. 76.922 and 76.923


<R05>
Sec. 76.941  Rate prescription.

    A franchising authority may prescribe a reasonable rate for the 
basic service tier or associated equipment after it determines that a 
proposed rate is unreasonable.


<R05>
Sec. 76.942  Refunds.

    (a) A franchising authority (or the Commission, pursuant to 
Sec. 76.945) may order a cable operator to refund to subscribers that 
portion of previously paid rates determined to be in excess of the 
permitted tier charge or above the actual cost of equipment, unless the 
operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing which justifies the 
rate charged as reasonable. An operator's liability for refunds shall be 
based on the difference between the old bundled rates and the sum of the 
new unbundled program service charge(s) and the new unbundled equipment 
charge(s). Where an operator was charging separately for program 
services and equipment but the rates were not in compliance with the 
Commission's rules, the operator's refund liability shall be based on 
the difference between the sum of the old charges and the sum of the 
new, unbundled program service and equipment charges. Before ordering a 
cable operator to refund previously paid rates to subscribers, a 
franchising authority (or the Commission) must give the operator notice 
and opportunity to comment.
    (b) An operator's liability for refunds in limited to a one-year 
period, except that an operator that fails to comply with a valid rate 
order issued by a franchising authority or the Commission shall be 
liable for refunds commencing from the effective date of such order

[[Page 599]]

until such time as it complies with such order.
    (c) The refund period shall run as follows:
    (1) From the date the operator implements a prospective rate 
reduction back in time to September 1, 1993, or one year, whichever is 
shorter.
    (2) From the date a franchising authority issues an accounting order 
pursuant to Sec. 76.933(c), to the date a prospective rate reduction is 
issued, then back in time from the date of the accounting order to the 
effective date of the rules; however, the total refund period shall not 
exceed one year from the date of the accounting order.
    (3) Refund liability shall be calculated on the reasonableness of 
the rates as determined by the rules in effect during the period under 
review by the franchising authority or the Commission.
    (d) The cable operator, in its discretion, may implement a refund in 
the following manner:
    (1) By returning overcharges to those subscribers who actually paid 
the overcharges, either through direct payment or as a specifically 
identified credit to those subscribers' bills; or
    (2) By means of a prospective percentage reduction in the rates for 
the basic service tier or associated equipment to cover the cumulative 
overcharge. This shall be reflected as a specifically identified, one-
time credit on prospective bills to the class of subscribers that 
currently subscribe to the cable system.
    (e) Refunds shall include interest computed at applicable rates 
published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional 
tax payments.
    (f) Once an operator has implemented a rate refund to subscribers in 
accordance with a refund order by the franchising authority (or the 
Commission, pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section), the franchising 
authority must return to the cable operator an amount equal to that 
portion of the franchise fee that was paid on the total amount of the 
refund to subscribers. The franchising authority must promptly return 
the franchise fee overcharge either in an immediate lump sum payment, or 
the cable operator may deduct it from the cable system's future 
franchise fee payments. The franchising authority has the discretion to 
determine a reasonable repayment period, but interest shall accrue on 
any outstanding portion of the franchise fee starting on the date the 
operator has completed implementation of the refund order. In 
determining the amount of the refund, the franchise fee overcharge 
should be offset against franchise fees the operator holds on behalf of 
the franchising authority for lump sum payment. The interest rate on any 
refund owed to the operator presumptively shall be 11.25%.

Sec. 76.943  Fines.

    (a) A franchising authority may impose fines or monetary forfeitures 
on a cable operator that does not comply with a rate decision or refund 
order directed specifically at the cable operator, provided the 
franchising authority has such power under state or local laws.
    (b) If a cable operator willfully fails to comply with the terms of 
any franchising authority's order, decision, or request for information, 
as required by Sec. 76.939, the Commission may, in addition to other 
remedies, impose a forfeiture pursuant to section 503(b) of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 503(b).
    (c) A cable operator shall not be subject to forfeiture because its 
rate for basic service or equipment is determined to be unreasonable.

<R05>
Sec. 76.944  Commission review of franchising authority decisions on rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment.

    (a) The Commission shall be the sole forum for appeals of decisions 
by franchising authorities on rates for the

[[Page 600]]

basic service tier or associated equipment involving whether or not a 
franchising authority has acted consistently with the Cable Act or 
Secs. 76.922 and 76.923. Appeals of ratemaking decisions by franchising 
authorities that do not depend upon determining whether a franchising 
authority has acted consistently with the Cable Act or Secs. 76.922 and 
76.923, may be heard in state or local courts.
    (b) Any participant at the franchising authority level in a 
ratemaking proceeding may file an appeal of the franchising authority's 
decision with the Commission within 30 days of release of the text of 
the franchising authority's decision as computed under Sec. 1.4(b) of 
this chapter. Appeals shall be served on the franchising authority or 
other authority that issued the rate decision. Where the state is the 
appropriate decisionmaking authority, the state shall forward a copy of 
the appeal to the appropriate local official(s). Oppositions may be 
filed within 15 days after the appeals is filed, and must be served on 
the party(ies) appealing the rate decision. Replies may be filed 7 days 
after the last day for oppositions and shall be served on the parties to 
the proceeding.
    (c) An operator that uses the annual rate adjustment method under 
Section 76.922(e) may include in its next true up under Section 
76.922(e)(3) any amounts to which the operator would have been entitled 
but for a franchising authority decision that is not upheld on appeal.

<R05>
Sec. 76.945  Procedures for Commission review of basic service rates.

    (a) Upon assumption of rate regulation authority, the Commission 
will notify the cable operator and require the cable operator to file 
its basic rate schedule with the Commission within 30 days, with a copy 
to the local franchising authority.
    (b) Basic service and equipment rate schedule filings for existing 
rates or proposed rate increases (including increases in the baseline 
channel change that results from reductions in the number of channels in 
a tier) must use the official FCC form, a copy thereof, or a copy 
generated by FCC software. Failure to file on the official FCC form or a 
copy may result in the imposition of sanctions specified in 
Sec. 76.937(d). Cable operators seeking to justify the reasonableness of 
existing or proposed rates above the permitted tier rate must submit a 
cost-of-service showing sufficient to support a finding that the rates 
are reasonable.
    (c) Filings proposing annual adjustments or rates within the rates 
regulation standards in Secs. 76.922 and 76.923, must be made 30 days 
prior to the proposed effective date and can become effective on the 
proposed effective date unless the Commission issues an order deferring 
the effective date or denying the rate proposal. Petitions opposing such 
filings must be filed within 15 days of public notice of the filing by 
the cable operator and be accompanied by a certificate that service was 
made on the cable operator and the local franchising authority. The 
cable operator may file an opposition within five days of filing of the 
petition, certifying to service on both the petitioner and the local 
franchising authority.
    (d) Filings proposing a rate not within the rate regulation 
standards of Secs. 76.922 and 76.923, must be made 90 days before the 
requested effective date. Petitions opposing such filings must be filed 
within 30 days of public notice of the filing, and be accompanied by a 
certificate that service was made on the cable operator and the local 
franchising authority. The cable operator may file an opposition within 
10 days of the filing of the petition, and certifying that service was 
made on the petitioner and the local franchising authority.

and fees. Cable systems that cover multiple franchise areas having 
differing franchise fees or other franchise costs, different channel 
line-ups, or different rate structures may advertise a complete range of 
fees without specific identification of the rate for each individual 
area. In such circumstances, the operator may advertise a ``fee plus'' 
rate that indicates the core rate plus the range of possible additions, 
depending on the particular location of the subscriber.

Sec. 76.950  Complaints regarding cable programming service rates.

    (a) A franchising authority may file with the Commission a complaint 
challenging the reasonableness of its cable operator's rate for cable 
programming service, or the reasonableness of the cable operator's 
charges for installation or rental of equipment used for the receipt of 
cable programming service. The franchise authority may file a complaint 
with the Commission only upon receipt of more than one subscriber 
complaint made to the franchise authority within 90 days after the 
effective date of the challenged rate increase.
    (b) The Commission shall not review any complaint with respect to 
cable programming services filed after March 31, 1999.

Sec. 76.951  Standard complaint form; other filing requirements.

    (a) Any complaint regarding a cable operator's rate for cable 
programming service or associated equipment must be filed using standard 
complaint form, FCC 329.
    (b) The following information must be provided on the standard 
complaint form:
    (1) The name, mailing address and phone number of the franchising 
authority that is filing the complaint;
    (2) The name, mailing address, and FCC community unit identifier of 
the relevant cable operator;
    (3) A description of the cable programming service or associated 
equipment involved and, if applicable, how the service or associated 
equipment has changed;
    (4) The current rate for the cable programming service or associated 
equipment at issue and, if the complainant is challenging the 
reasonableness of a rate increase, the most recent rate for the service 
or associated equipment immediately prior to the rate increase;
    (5) If the complainant is filing a corrected complaint, an 
indication of the date the complainant filed the prior complaint and the 
date the complainant received notification from the Commission that the 
prior complaint was defective;
    (6) A certification that a copy of the complaint, including all 
attachments, is being served contemporaneously via certified mail on the 
cable operator;
    (7) An indication that the complainant franchising authority 
received more than one subscriber complaint within 90 days of the 
operator's imposition of the rate in question; and
    (8) A certification that, to the best of the complainant's 
knowledge, the information provided on the form is true and correct.

Sec. 76.953  Limitation on filing a complaint.

    (a) Complaint regarding a rate change. A complaint alleging an 
unreasonable rate for cable programming service or associated equipment 
may be filed against a cable operator only in the event of a rate 
change, including an increase or decrease in rates, or a change in rates 
that results from a change in a system's service tiers. A rate change 
may involve an implicit rate increase (such as deleting channels from a 
tier

[[Page 602]]

without a corresponding lowering of the rate for that tier). A complaint 
regarding a rate change for cable programming service or associated 
equipment may be filed against a cable operator only in the event of a 
rate change.
    (b) Late-filed complaints will be dismissed with prejudice.

<R05>
Sec. 76.954  Initial review of complaint; minimum showing requirement; dismissal of defective complaints.

    (a) The Commission will conduct an initial review of a complaint to 
determine if it meets the minimum showing required to allow the 
complaint to go forward. The minimum showing shall be satisfied if the 
complaint is filed using the standard complaint form described in 
Sec. 76.951 and includes all information and attachments required by 
that form. A complainant will not be required, as part of the minimum 
showing, to provide the underlying information and calculations 
necessary to judge the cable programming service rate in question 
against the Commission's rate standards.
    (b) A complaint that does not meet the minimum showing requirement 
described in paragraph (a) of this section will be considered defective. 
A defective complaint will be dismissed without prejudice to filing a 
corrected complaint as provided by Sec. 76.955. The Commission will 
notify the complainant by mail of the dismissal. The filing of a 
complaint on the applicable form, but which is otherwise defective, will 
toll the limitation period established by Sec. 76.953.


<R05>
Sec. 76.955  Additional opportunity to file corrected complaint.

    (a) If the Commission dismisses an initial complaint without 
prejudice pursuant to Sec. 76.954, the complainant shall have one 
additional opportunity to cure the defect and file a corrected 
complaint.
    (b) For a complaint filed on the applicable form but is otherwise 
defective, the complainant must cure the defect and file a corrected 
complaint with the Commission within 30 days from the date of the 
Commission's dismissal notice. Failure to cure the defect and file a 
corrected complaint within this time period will result in dismissal of 
the complaint with prejudice.


<R05>
Sec. 76.956  Cable operator response.

    (a) Unless the Commission notifies a cable operator to the contrary, 
the cable operator must file with the Commission a response to the 
complaint filed on the applicable form, within 30 days of the date of 
service of the complaint. The response shall indicate when service 
occurred. Service by mail is complete upon mailing. See Sec. 1.47(f) of 
this chapter. The response shall include the information required by the 
appropriate FCC Form, including rate cards, channel line-ups, and an 
explanation of any discrepancy in the figures provided in these 
documents and the rate filing. The cable operator must serve its 
response on the complainant via first class mail.
    (b) The burden shall be on the cable operator to prove that the 
service rate or equipment charge in question is not unreasonable. The 
cable operator may carry its burden in the following manner:
    (1) For a service rate at or below the permitted level, by providing 
information and calculations that demonstrate that the rate in question 
falls at or below the permitted level;
    (2) For a service rate that exceeds the permitted level;
    (i) By providing proof that the cable system has reduced the rate 
for the cable programming service at issue to a level at or below the 
permitted level; or
    (ii) By providing detailed cost-based information that demonstrates 
that the rate in question is reasonable despite the fact that it exceeds 
the permitted level.
    (3) For a charge for equipment installation or rental, by providing 
information that demonstrates that the charge is based on the cable 
operator's actual cost.
    (c) In addition to responding to the merits of a complaint, the 
cable operator may also move for dismissal of the complaint for failure 
to meet the minimum showing requirement. Any such

[[Page 603]]

motion for dismissal must state with particularity the reasons the cable 
operator believes the complaint is defective and shall not relieve the 
cable operator of its obligation to respond to the merits of the 
complaint.
    (d) A cable operator may file a consolidated response to multiple 
complaints regarding the identical rate or rate increase. A consolidated 
response must be filed within 30 days from the date of service of the 
first complaint received, unless the Commission notifies the cable 
operator to the contrary. A cable operator may amend a consolidated 
response to address new issues raised by complaints received after the 
cable operator's initial response.
    (e) A cable operator that fails to file and serve a response to a 
valid complaint may be deemed in default. If the Commission deems a 
cable operator in default, the Commission may enter an order against the 
cable operator finding the rate to be unreasonable and mandating 
appropriate relief.
    (f) A cable operator need not respond to any complaint that is:
    (1) Not filed on the applicable form; or
    (2) That the Commission determined is defective and has so notified 
the cable operator.

Sec. 76.957  Commission adjudication of the complaint.

    The Commission will consider the complaint and the cable operator's 
response and then determine by written decision whether the rate for the 
cable programming service or associated equipment is unreasonable or 
not. In making its determination, the Commission will only review the 
amount of the rate increase subject to the complaint. If the Commission 
determines that the rate change in question is unreasonable, it will 
grant the complaint and may order appropriate relief, including, but not 
limited to, prospective rate reductions and refunds. If it determines 
that the rate in question is reasonable, the Commission will deny the 
complaint.

Sec. 76.960  Prospective rate reductions.

    Upon a finding that a rate for cable programming service or 
associated equipment is unreasonable, the Commission may order the cable 
operator to implement a prospective rate reduction to the class of 
customers subscribing to the cable programming service at issue.
    (a) For an operator that adjusts its rates using the quarterly rate 
adjustment system pursuant to Section 76.922(d), the Commission's 
decision regarding a prospective rate reduction shall remain binding on 
the cable operator for one year unless the Commission specifies 
otherwise.
    (b) For an operator that adjusts its rates using the annual rate 
adjustment system pursuant to Section 76.922(e), for one year following 
the Commission's decision, the operator shall provide the Commission at 
least 30 days' notice of any proposed change.

<R05>
Sec. 76.961  Refunds.

    (a) Upon a finding that a rate for cable programming service or 
associated equipment is unreasonable, the Commission may order the cable 
operator to refund to subscribers that portion of previously paid rates 
which is deemed unreasonable.

[[Page 604]]

    (b) The cumulative refund due subscribers shall be calculated from 
the date a valid complaint is filed until the date a cable operator 
implements a prospective rate reduction as ordered by the Commission 
pursuant to Sec. 76.960. The Commission shall calculate refund liability 
according to the rules in effect for determining the reasonableness of 
the rates for the period of time covered by the complaint.
    (c) The cable operator, in its discretion, may implement a refund in 
the following manner:
    (1) By returning overcharges to those subscribers who actually paid 
the overcharges, either through direct payment or as a specifically 
identified, one-time credit to those subscribers' bills; or
    (2) By means of a prospective percentage reduction in the 
unreasonable cable programming service rate or equipment charge to cover 
the cumulative overcharge. This shall be reflected as a specifically 
identified, one-time credit on prospective bills to the class of 
subscribers that currently subscribe to the cable programming service or 
associated equipment at issue.
    (d) Refunds shall include interest computed at applicable rates 
published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional 
tax payments. Interest shall accrue from the date a valid complaint is 
filed until the refund issues.
    (e) At the time the Commission orders a cable operator to pay 
refunds to subscribers, the franchising authority must return to the 
cable operator an amount equal to that portion of the franchise fee that 
was paid on the total amount of the refund to subscribers. The 
franchising authority may return the franchise fee overcharge either in 
an immediate lump sum payment, or the cable operator may deduct it from 
the cable system's future franchise fee payments.

Sec. 76.962  Implementation and certification of compliance.

    (a) Implementation. A cable operator must implement remedial 
requirements, including prospective rate reductions and refunds, within 
60 days from the date the Commission releases an order mandating a 
remedy.
    (b) Certification of compliance. A cable operator must certify to 
the Commission its compliance with any Commission order mandating 
remedial requirements. Such certification shall:
    (1) Be filed with the Commission within 90 days from the date the 
Commission releases an order mandating a remedy;
    (2) Reference the applicable Commission order;
    (3) State that the cable operator has complied fully with all 
provisions of the Commission's order;
    (4) Include a description of the precise measures the cable operator 
has taken to implement the remedies ordered by the Commission; and
    (5) Be signed by an authorized representative of the cable operator.


<R05>
Sec. 76.963  Forfeiture.

    (a) If any cable operator willfully fails to comply with the terms 
of any Commission order, including an order mandating remedial 
requirements after a finding of unreasonable cable programming service 
or equipment rates, or any Commission rule, the Commission may, in 
addition to other remedies, impose a forfeiture pursuant to Section 
503(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 503(b).
    (b) A cable operator shall not be subject to forfeiture because its 
rate for cable programming service or equipment is determined to be 
unreasonable.


<R05>
Sec. 76.964  Written notification of changes in rates and services.

    (a) In addition to the requirement of Sec. 76.309(c)(3)(i)(B) 
regarding advance notification to customers of any changes in rates, 
programming services or channel positions, cable systems shall give 30 
days written notice to both subscribers and local franchising 
authorities before implementing any rate or service change. Such notice 
shall state the precise amount of any rate change and briefly explain in 
readily understandable fashion the cause of the rate change (e.g., 
inflation, changes in external costs or the addition/deletion of 
channels). When the change involves the addition or deletion of 
channels,

[[Page 605]]

each channel added or deleted must be separately identified. Notices to 
subscribers shall inform them of their right to file complaints about 
changes in cable programming service tier rates and services, shall 
state that the subscriber may file the complaint within 90 days of the 
effective date of the rate change, and shall provide the address and 
phone number of the local franchising authority.
    (b) To the extent the operator is required to provide notice of 
service and rate changes to subscribers, the operator may provide such 
notice using any reasonable means at its sole discretion.
    (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of Part 76, a cable operator 
shall not be required to provide prior notice of any rate change that is 
the result of a regulatory fee, franchise fee, or any other fee, tax, 
assessment, or charge of any kind imposed by any Federal agency, State, 
or franchising authority on the transaction between the operator and the 
subscriber.

[61 FR 18979, Apr. 30, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 76.970  Commercial leased access rates.

    (a) Cable operators shall designate channel capacity for commercial 
use by persons unaffiliated with the operator in accordance with the 
requirement of 47 U.S.C. 532. For purposes of 47 U.S.C. 532(b)(1)(A) and 
(B), only those channels that must be carried pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 534 
and 535 qualify as channels that are required for use by Federal law or 
regulation. For cable systems with 100 or fewer channels, channels that 
cannot be used due to technical and safety regulations of the Federal 
Government (e.g., aeronautical channels) shall be excluded when 
calculating the set-aside requirement.
    (b) In determining whether a party is an ``affiliate'' for purposes 
of commercial leased access, the definitions contained in the notes to 
Sec. 76.501 shall be used, provided, however, that the single majority 
shareholder provision of Note 2(b) to Sec. 76.501 and the limited 
partner insulation provisions of Note 2(g) to Sec. 76.501 shall not 
apply, and the provisions of Note 2(a) to Sec. 76.501 regarding five (5) 
percent interest shall include all voting or nonvoting stock or limited 
partnership equity interest of five (5) percent or more. Actual working 
control, in whatever manner exercised, shall also be deemed a cognizable 
interest.
    (c) The maximum commercial leased access rate that a cable operator 
may charge for full-time channel placement on a tier exceeding a 
subscriber penetration of 50 percent is the average implicit fee for 
full-time channel placement on all such tier(s).
    (d) The average implicit fee identified in paragraph (c) of this 
section for a full-time channel on a tier with a subscriber penetration 
over 50 percent shall be calculated by first calculating the total 
amount the operator receives in subscriber revenue per month for the 
programming on all such tier(s), and then subtracting the total amount 
it pays in programming costs per month for such tier(s) (the ``total 
implicit fee calculation''). A weighting scheme that accounts for 
differences in the number of subscribers and channels on all such 
tier(s) must be used to determine how much of the total implicit fee 
calculation will be recovered from any particular tier. The weighting 
scheme is determined in two steps. First, the number of subscribers is 
multiplied by the number of channels (the result is the number of 
``subscriber-channels'') on each tier with subscriber penetration over 
50 percent. For instance, a tier with 10 channels and 1,000 subscribers 
would have a total of 10,000 subscriber-channels. Second, the 
subscriber-channels on each of these tiers is divided by the total 
subscriber-channels on all such tiers. Given the percent of subscriber-
channels for the particular tier, the implicit fee for the tier is 
computed by multiplying the subscriber-channel percentage for the tier 
by the total implicit fee calculation. Finally, to calculate the average 
implicit fee per channel, the implicit fee for the tier must be divided 
by the corresponding number of channels on the tier. The final result is 
the maximum rate per month that the operator may charge the leased 
access programmer for a full-time channel on that particular tier. The 
average implicit fee shall be calculated by using all channels carried 
on any tier exceeding 50 percent

[[Page 606]]

subscriber penetration (including channels devoted to affiliated 
programming, must-carry and public, educational and government access 
channels). In the event of an agreement to lease capacity on a tier with 
less than 50 percent penetration, the average implicit fee should be 
determined on the basis of subscriber revenues and programming costs for 
that tier alone. The license fees for affiliated channels used in 
determining the average implicit fee shall reflect the prevailing 
company prices offered in the marketplace to third parties. If a 
prevailing company price does not exist, the license fee for that 
programming shall be priced at the programmer's cost or the fair market 
value, whichever is lower. The average implicit fee shall be based on 
contracts in effect in the previous calendar year. The implicit fee for 
a contracted service may not include fees, stated or implied, for 
services other than the provision of channel capacity (e.g., billing and 
collection, marketing, or studio services).
    (e) The maximum commercial leased access rate that a cable operator 
may charge for full-time channel placement as an a la carte service is 
the highest implicit fee on an aggregate basis for full-time channel 
placement as an a la carte service.
    (f) The highest implicit fee on an aggregate basis for full-time 
channel placement as an a la carte service shall be calculated by first 
determining the total amount received by the operator in subscriber 
revenue per month for each non-leased access a la carte channel on its 
system (including affiliated a la carte channels) and deducting the 
total amount paid by the operator in programming costs (including 
license and copyright fees) per month for programming on such individual 
channels. This calculation will result in implicit fees determined on an 
aggregate basis, and the highest of these implicit fees shall be the 
maximum rate per month that the operator may charge the leased access 
programmer for placement as a full-time a la carte channel. The license 
fees for affiliated channels used in determining the highest implicit 
fee shall reflect the prevailing company prices offered in the 
marketplace to third parties. If a prevailing company price does not 
exist, the license fee for that programming shall be priced at the 
programmer's cost or the fair market value, whichever is lower. The 
highest implicit fee shall be based on contracts in effect in the 
previous calendar year. The implicit fee for a contracted service may 
not include fees, stated or implied, for services other than the 
provision of channel capacity (e.g., billing and collection, marketing, 
or studio services). Any subscriber revenue received by a cable operator 
for an a la carte leased access service shall be passed through to the 
leased access programmer.
    (g) The maximum commercial leased access rate that a cable operator 
may charge for part-time channel placement shall be determined by either 
prorating the maximum full-time rate uniformly, or by developing a 
schedule of and applying different rates for different times of the day, 
provided that the total of the rates for a 24-hour period does not 
exceed the maximum daily leased access rate.
    (h)(1) Cable system operators shall provide prospective leased 
access programmers with the following information within 15 calendar 
days of the date on which a request for leased access information is 
made:
    (i) How much of the operator's leased access set-aside capacity is 
available;
    (ii) A complete schedule of the operator's full-time and part-time 
leased access rates;
    (iii) Rates associated with technical and studio costs; and
    (iv) If specifically requested, a sample leased access contract.
     (2) Operators of systems subject to small system relief shall 
provide the information required in paragraph (h)(1) of this section 
within 30 calendar days of a bona fide request from a prospective leased 
access programmer. For these purposes, systems subject to small system 
relief are systems that either:
    (i) Qualify as small systems under Sec. 76.901(c) and are owned by a 
small cable company as defined under Sec. 76.901(e); or
    (ii) Have been granted special relief.
    (3) Bona fide requests, as used in this section, are defined as 
requests from potential leased access programmers

[[Page 607]]

that have provided the following information:
    (i) The desired length of a contract term;
    (ii) The time slot desired;
    (iii) The anticipated commencement date for carriage; and
    (iv) The nature of the programming.
    (4) All requests for leased access must be made in writing and must 
specify the date on which the request was sent to the operator.
    (5) Operators shall maintain, for Commission inspection, sufficient 
supporting documentation to justify the scheduled rates, including 
supporting contracts, calculations of the implicit fees, and 
justifications for all adjustments.
    (i) Cable operators are permitted to negotiate rates below the 
maximum rates permitted in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section.

FR 11380, Mar. 12, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 76.971  Commercial leased access terms and conditions.

    (a)(1) Cable operators shall place leased access programmers that 
request access to a tier actually used by most subscribers on any tier 
that has a subscriber penetration of more than 50 percent, unless there 
are technical or other compelling reasons for denying access to such 
tiers.
    (2) Cable operators shall be permitted to make reasonable selections 
when placing leased access channels at specific channel locations. The 
Commission will evaluate disputes involving channel placement on a case-
by-case basis and will consider any evidence that an operator has acted 
unreasonably in this regard.
    (3) On systems with available leased access capacity sufficient to 
satisfy current leased access demand, cable operators shall be required 
to accommodate as expeditiously as possible all leased access requests 
for programming that is not obscene or indecent. On systems with 
insufficient available leased access capacity to satisfy current leased 
access demand, cable operators shall be permitted to select from among 
leased access programmers using objective, content-neutral criteria.
    (4) Cable operators that have not satisfied their statutory leased 
access requirements shall accommodate part-time leased access requests 
as set forth in this paragraph. Cable operators shall not be required to 
accept leases for less than one half-hour of programming. Cable 
operators may accommodate part-time leased access requests by opening 
additional channels for part-time use or providing comparable time slots 
on channels currently carrying leased or non-leased access programming. 
The comparability of time slots shall be determined by objective factors 
such as day of the week, time of day, and audience share. A cable 
operator that is unable to provide a comparable time slot to accommodate 
a part-time programming request shall be required to open an additional 
channel for part-time use unless such operator has at least one channel 
designated for part-time leased access use that is programmed with less 
than 18 hours of part-time leased access programming every day. However, 
regardless of the availability of partially programmed part-time leased 
access channels, a cable operator shall be required to open an 
additional channel to accommodate any request for part-time leased 
access for at least eight contiguous hours, for the same time period 
every day, for at least a year. Once an operator has opened a vacant 
channel to accommodate such a request, our other leased access rules 
apply. If, however, the operator has accommodated such a request on a 
channel already carrying an existing full-time non-leased access 
programmer, the operator does not have to accommodate other part-time 
requests of less than eight hours on that channel until all other 
existing part-time leased access channels are substantially filled with 
leased access programming.
    (b) Cable operators may not apply programming production standards 
to leased access that are any higher than those applied to public, 
educational and governmental access channels.
    (c) Cable operators are required to provide unaffiliated leased 
access users the minimal level of technical support necessary for users 
to present their

[[Page 608]]

material on the air, and may not unreasonably refuse to cooperate with a 
leased access user in order to prevent that user from obtaining channel 
capacity. Leased access users must reimburse operators for the 
reasonable cost of any technical support actually provided by the 
operator that is beyond that provided for non-leased access programmers 
on the system. A cable operator may charge leased access programmers for 
the use of technical equipment that is provided at no charge for public, 
educational and governmental access programming, provided that the 
operator's franchise agreement requires it to provide the equipment and 
does not preclude such use, and the equipment is not being used for any 
other non-leased access programming. Cable operators that are required 
to purchase technical equipment in order to accommodate a leased access 
programmer shall have the option of either requiring the leased access 
programmer to pay the full purchase price of the equipment, or 
purchasing the equipment and leasing it to the leased access programmer 
at a reasonable rate. Leased access programmers that are required to pay 
the full purchase price of additional equipment shall have all rights of 
ownership associated with the equipment under applicable state and local 
law.
    (d) Cable operators may require reasonable security deposits or 
other assurances from users who are unable to prepay in full for access 
to leased commercial channels. Cable operators may impose reasonable 
insurance requirements on leased access programmers. Cable operators 
shall bear the burden of proof in establishing reasonableness.
    (e) Cable operators may not set terms and conditions for commercial 
leased access use based on content, except:
    (1) To the limited extent necessary to establish a reasonable price 
for the commercial use of designated channel capacity by an unaffiliated 
person; or
    (2) To comply with 47 U.S.C. 532 (h), (j) and Sec. 76.701.
    (f)(1) A cable operator shall provide billing and collection 
services for commercial leased access cable programmers, unless the 
operator demonstrates the existence of third party billing and 
collection services which in terms of cost and accessibility, offer 
leased access programmers an alternative substantially equivalent to 
that offered to comparable non-leased access programmers.
    (2) If an operator can make the showing required in paragraph (f)(1) 
of this section, it must, to the extent technically feasible make 
available data necessary to enable a third party to bill and collect for 
the leased access user.
    (g) Cable operators shall not unreasonably limit the length of 
leased access contracts. The termination provisions of leased access 
contracts shall be commercially reasonable and may not allow operators 
to terminate leased access contracts without a reasonable basis.
    (h) Cable operators may not prohibit the resale of leased access 
capacity to persons unaffiliated with the operator, but may provide in 
their leased access contracts that any sublessees will be subject to the 
non-price terms and conditions that apply to the initial lessee, and 
that, if the capacity is resold, the rate for the capacity shall be the 
maximum permissible rate.

<R05>
Sec. 76.975  Commercial leased access dispute resolution.

    (a) Any person aggrieved by the failure or refusal of a cable 
operator to make commercial channel capacity available in accordance 
with the provisions of Title VI of the Communications Act may bring an 
action in the district court of the United States for the Judicial 
district in which the cable system is located to compel that such 
capacity be made available.
    (b)(1) Any person aggrieved by the failure or refusal of a cable 
operator to make commercial channel capacity available or to charge 
rates for such capacity in accordance with the provisions of Title VI of 
the Communications Act, or our implementing regulations, Secs. 76.970 
and 76.971, may file a petition for relief with the Commission. Persons 
alleging that a cable operator's leased access rate is unreasonable must 
receive a determination of the cable operator's maximum permitted

[[Page 609]]

rate from an independent accountant prior to filing a petition for 
relief with the Commission.
    (2) Parties to a dispute over leased access rates shall have five 
business days to agree on a mutually acceptable accountant from the date 
on which the programmer provides the cable operator with a written 
request for a review of its leased access rates. Parties that fail to 
agree on a mutually acceptable accountant within five business days of 
the programmer's request for a review shall each be required to select 
an independent accountant on the sixth business day. The two accountants 
selected shall have five business days to select a third independent 
accountant to perform the review. Operators of systems subject to small 
system relief shall have 14 business days to select an independent 
accountant when an agreement cannot be reached. For these purposes, 
systems subject to small system relief are systems that either:
    (i) Qualify as small systems under Sec. 76.901(c) and are owned by a 
small cable company as defined under Sec. 76.901(e); or
    (ii) Have been granted special relief.
    (3) The final accountant's report must be completed within 60 days 
of the date on which the final accountant is selected to perform the 
review. The final accountant's report must, at a minimum, state the 
maximum permitted rate, and explain how it was determined without 
revealing proprietary information. The report must be signed, dated and 
certified by the accountant. The report shall be filed in the cable 
system's local public file.
    (4) If the accountant's report indicates that the cable operator's 
leased access rate exceeds the maximum permitted rate by more than a de 
minimis amount, the cable operator shall be required to pay the full 
cost of the review. If the final accountant's report does not indicate 
that the cable operator's leased access rate exceeds the maximum 
permitted rate by more than a de minimis amount, each party shall be 
required to split the cost of the final accountant's review, and to pay 
its own expenses incurred in making the review.
    (5) Parties may use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) processes 
to settle disputes that are not resolved by the final accountant's 
report.
    (c) A petition must contain a concise statement of the facts 
constituting a violation of the statute or the Commission's Rules, the 
specific statute(s) or rule(s) violated, and certify that the petition 
was served on the cable operator. Where a petition is based on 
allegations that a cable operator's leased access rates are 
unreasonable, the petitioner must attach a copy of the final 
accountant's report. In proceedings before the Commission, there will be 
a rebuttable presumption that the final accountant's report is correct.
    (d) Where a petition is not based on allegations that a cable 
operator's leased access rates are unreasonable, the petition must be 
filed within 60 days of the alleged violation. Where a petition is based 
on allegations that the cable operator's leased access rates are 
unreasonable, the petition must be filed within 60 days of the final 
accountant's report, or within 60 days of the termination of ADR 
proceedings. Aggrieved parties must certify that their petition was 
filed within 60 days of the termination of ADR proceedings in order to 
file a petition later than 60 days after completion of the final 
accountant's report. Cable operators may rebut such certifications.
    (e) The cable operator or other respondent will have 30 days from 
the filing of the petition to file a response. If a leased access rate 
is disputed, the response must show that the rate charged is not higher 
than the maximum permitted rate for such leased access, and must be 
supported by the affidavit of a responsible company official. If, after 
a response is submitted, the staff finds a prima facie violation of our 
rules, the staff may require a respondent to produce additional 
information, or specify other procedures necessary for resolution of the 
proceeding.
    (f) The Commission, after consideration of the pleadings, may grant 
the relief requested, in whole or in part, including, but not limited to 
ordering refunds, injunctive measures, or forfeitures pursuant 47 U.S.C. 
503, denying the petition, or issuing a ruling on the petition or 
dispute.

[[Page 610]]

    (g) To be afforded relief, the petitioner must show by clear and 
convincing evidence that the cable operator has violated the 
Commission's leased access provisions in 47 U.S.C. 532 or Secs. 76.970 
and 76.971, or otherwise acted unreasonably or in bad faith in failing 
or refusing to make capacity available or to charge lawful rates for 
such capacity to an unaffiliated leased access programmer.
    (h) During the pendency of a dispute, a party seeking to lease 
channel capacity for commercial purposes, shall comply with the rates, 
terms and conditions prescribed by the cable operator, subject to refund 
or other appropriate remedy.

<R05>
Sec. 76.977  Minority and educational programming used in lieu of designated commercial leased access capacity.

    (a) A cable operator required by this section to designate channel 
capacity for commercial use pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 532, may use any such 
channel capacity for the provision of programming from a qualified 
minority programming source or from any qualified educational 
programming sources, whether or not such source is affiliated with cable 
operator. The channel capacity used to provide programming from a 
qualified minority programming source or from any qualified educational 
programming source pursuant to this section may not exceed 33 percent of 
the channel capacity designated pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 532 and must be 
located on a tier with more than 50 percent subscriber penetration.
    (b) For purposes of this section, a qualified minority programming 
source is a programming source that devotes substantially all of its 
programming to coverage of minority viewpoints, or to programming 
directed at members of minority groups, and which is over 50 percent 
minority-owned.
    (c) For purposes of this section, a qualified educational 
programming source is a programming source that devotes substantially 
all of its programming to educational or instructional programming that 
promotes public understanding of mathematics, the sciences, the 
humanities, or the arts and has a documented annual expenditure on 
programming exceeding $15 million. The annual expenditure on programming 
means all annual costs incurred by the programming source to produce or 
acquire programs which are scheduled to be televised, and specifically 
excludes marketing, promotion, satellite transmission and operational 
costs, and general administrative costs.
    (d) For purposes of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, 
substantially all means that 90% or more of the programming offered must 
be devoted to minority or educational purposes, as defined in paragraphs 
(b) and (c) of this section, respectively.
    (e) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, ``minority'' is 
defined as in 47 U.S.C. 309(i)(3)(c)(ii) to include Blacks, Hispanics, 
American Indians, Alaska Natives, Asians and Pacific Islanders.

<R05>
Sec. 76.980  Charges for customer changes.

    (a) This section shall govern charges for any changes in service 
tiers or equipment provided to the subscriber that are initiated at the 
request of a subscriber after initial service installation.
    (b) The charge for customer changes in service tiers effected solely 
by coded entry on a computer terminal or by other similarly simple 
methods shall be a nominal amount, not exceeding actual costs, as 
defined in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) The charge for customers changes in service tiers or equipment 
that involve more than coded entry on a computer or other similarly 
simple method shall be based on actual cost. The actual cost charge 
shall be either the HSC, as defined in Section 76.923 of the rules, 
multiplied by the number of persons hours needed to implement the 
change, or the HSC multiplied by the average number of persons hours 
involved in implementing customer changes.

[[Page 611]]

    (d) A cable operator may establish a higher charge for changes 
effected solely by coded entry on a computer terminal or by other 
similarly simple methods, subject to approval by the franchising 
authority, for a subscriber changing service tiers more than two times 
in a twelve month period, except for such changes ordered in response to 
a change in price or channel line-up. If a cable system adopts such an 
increased charge, the cable system must notify all subscribers in 
writing that they may be subject to such a charge for changing service 
tiers more than the specified number of times in any twelve month 
period.
    (e) Downgrade charges that are the same as, or lower than, upgrade 
charges are evidence of the reasonableness of such downgrade charges.
    (f) For 30 days after notice of retiering or rate increases, a 
customer may obtain changes in service tiers at no additional charge.


<R05>
Sec. 76.981  Negative option billing.

    (a) A cable operator shall not charge a subscriber for any service 
or equipment that the subscriber has not affirmatively requested by 
name. A subscriber's failure to refuse a cable operator's proposal to 
provide such service or equipment is not an affirmative request for 
service or equipment. A subscriber's affirmative request for service or 
equipment may be made orally or in writing.
    (b) The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section shall not 
preclude the adjustment of rates to reflect inflation, cost of living 
and other external costs, the addition or deletion of a specific program 
from a service offering, the addition or deletion of specific channels 
from an existing tier or service, the restructuring or division of 
existing tiers of service, or the adjustment of rates as a result of the 
addition, deletion or substitution of channels pursuant to Sec. 76.922, 
provided that such changes do not constitute a fundamental change in the 
nature of an existing service or tier of service and are otherwise 
consistent with applicable regulations.
    (c) State and local governments may not enforce state and local 
consumer protection laws that conflict with or undermine paragraph (a) 
or (b) of this section or any other sections of this Subpart that were 
established pursuant to Section 3 of the 1992 Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. 543.

[59 FR 62625, Dec. 6, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 76.982  Continuation of rate agreements.

    During the term of an agreement executed before July 1, 1990, by a 
franchising authority and a cable operator providing for the regulation 
of basic cable service rates, where there was not effective competition 
under Commission rules in effect on that date, the franchising authority 
may regulate basic cable rates without following section 623 of the 1992 
Cable Act or Secs. 76.910 through 76.942. A franchising authority 
regulating basic cable rates pursuant to such a rate agreement is not 
required to file for certification during the remaining term of the 
agreement but shall notify the Commission of its intent to continue 
regulating basic cable rates.


<R05>
Sec. 76.983  Discrimination.

    (a) No Federal agency, state, or local franchising authority may 
prohibit a cable operator from offering reasonable discounts to senior 
citizens or to economically disadvantaged groups.
    (1) Such discounts must be offered equally to all subscribers in the 
franchise area who qualify as members of these categories, or any 
reasonable subcategory thereof.
    (2) For purposes of this section, members of economically 
disadvantaged groups are those individuals who receive federal, state or 
local welfare assistance.
    (b) Nothing herein shall preclude any Federal agency, state, or 
local franchising authority from requiring and regulating the reception 
of cable service by hearing impaired individuals.


<R05>
Sec. 76.984  Geographically uniform rate structure.

    (a) The rates charged by cable operators for basic service, cable 
programming service, and associated equipment and installation shall be 
provided pursuant to a rate structure that is uniform throughout each 
franchise area in which cable service is provided.

[[Page 612]]

    (b) This section does not prohibit the establishment by cable 
operators of reasonable categories of service and customers with 
separate rates and terms and conditions of service, within a franchise 
area. Cable operators may offer different rates to multiple dwelling 
units of different sizes and may set rates based on the duration of the 
contract, provided that the operator can demonstrate that its costs 
savings vary with the size of the building and the duration of the 
contract, and as long as the same rate is offered to buildings of the 
same size with contracts of similar duration.
    (c) This section does not apply to:
    (1) A cable operator with respect to the provision of cable service 
over its cable system in any geographic area in which the video 
programming services offered by the operator in that area are subject to 
effective competition, or
    (2) Any video programming offered on a per channel or per program 
basis. Bulk discounts to multiple dwelling units shall not be subject to 
this section, except that a cable operator of a cable system that is not 
subject to effective competition may not charge predatory prices to a 
multiple dwelling unit. Upon a prima facie showing by a complainant that 
there are reasonable grounds to believe that the discounted price is 
predatory, the cable system shall have the burden of showing that its 
discounted price is not predatory.

[59 FR 17975, Apr. 15, 1994, as amended at 61 FR 18979, Apr. 30, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 76.985  Subscriber bill itemization.

    (a) Cable operators may identify as a separate line item of each 
regular subscriber bill the following:
    (1) The amount of the total bill assessed as a franchise fee and the 
identity of the franchising authority to which the fee is paid.
    (2) The amount of the total bill assessed to satisfy any 
requirements imposed on the cable operator by the franchise agreement to 
support public, educational, or governmental channels or the use of such 
channels.
    (3) The amount of any other fee, tax, assessment, or charge of any 
kind imposed by any governmental authority on the transaction between 
the operator and the subscriber. In order for a governmental fee or 
assessment to be separately identified under this section, it must be 
directly imposed by a governmental body on a transaction between a 
subscriber and an operator.
    (b) The charge identified on the subscriber bill as the total charge 
for cable service should include all fees and costs itemized pursuant to 
this section.
    (c) Local franchising authorities may adopt regulations consistent 
with this section.

<R05>
Sec. 76.986  ``A la carte'' offerings.

    (a) Collective offerings of unregulated per-channel or per-program 
(``a la carte'') video programming shall be regulated as CPSTs pursuant 
to Sec. 76.922. For purposes of this section, ``multiplexed'' channels 
shall be treated as one channel.
    (b) A discounted package price offered by a cable system is not 
unreasonable with respect to any collective offering of channels if the 
component channels' collective offering also have been continuously 
available on the system on a per channel basis since April 1, 1993.
    (c) A collective offering of per channel offerings may be treated as 
New Product Tier if:
    (1) The collective offering meets the conditions set forth in 
Sec. 76.987; or
    (2) The operator had reasonable grounds to believe the collective 
offering involving only a small number of migrated channels complied 
with the Commission's requirements as of the date it was first offered.
    (d) In reviewing a basic service rate filing, local franchising 
authorities may make an initial decision addressing whether a collective 
offering of ``a la carte'' channels will be treated as a cable 
programming service tier that is an NPT under Sec. 76.987 or a CPST that 
is regulated under Sec. 76.922. The franchising authority must make this 
initial decision within the 30 day period established for review of 
basic cable rates and equipment costs in Sec. 76.933(a), or within the 
first 60 days of an extended 120 day period (if the franchise authority 
has requested an additional 90 days) pursuant to Sec. 76.933(b). The 
franchising authority shall provide notice of its decision to the cable 
system and shall provide public notice of its initial decision within 
seven days pursuant to local procedural rules for public notice. 
Operators or consumers may make an interlocutory appeal of the initial 
decision to the Commission within 14 days of the initial decision. 
Operators shall provide notice to franchise authorities of their 
decision whether or not to appeal to the Commission within this period. 
Consumers shall provide notice to franchise authorities of their 
decision to appeal to the Commission within this period.
    (e) A limited initial decision under paragraph (b) of this section 
shall toll the time periods under Sec. 76.933 within which local 
authorities must decide local rate cases. The time period shall resume 
running seven days after the Commission decides the interlocutory 
appeal, or seven days following the expiration of the period in which an 
interlocutory appeal pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section may be 
filed.
    (f) A local franchising authority alternatively may decide whether a 
collective offering of ``a la carte'' channels will be treated as an NPT 
as a part of its final decision setting rates for the basic service 
tier. That decision may then be appealed to the Commission as provided 
for under Sec. 76.945.

[59 FR 62625, Dec. 6, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 76.987  New product tiers.

    (a) Operators may establish a category of CPSTs, referred to as 
``new product tiers'' (``NPTs''), and offer these tiers to subscribers 
at prices they elect.
    (b) In order to be eligible to offer NPTs, cable operators must meet 
the following conditions:
    (1) Operators offering NPTs are prohibited from making fundamental 
changes to what they offer on their BSTs and CPSTs offerings on 
September 30, 1994. Operators may drop channels or move channels between 
BSTs and/or CPSTs or to an a la carte offering so long as the 
aggregation of such changes do not constitute a fundamental change in 
their BST or CPSTs.
    (2) Operators may not drop channels that were offered on their BSTs 
or CPSTs on September 30, 1994 and move them to NPTs unless they wait at 
least two years from the date the channels were dropped from the BSTs or 
CPSTs. Time shifted versions, slightly altered versions or renamed 
versions of channels offered on BSTs and CPSTs on September 30, 1994 
shall not be exempt from this restriction.
    (3) Operators must market their BSTs and CPSTs so that customers 
should be reasonably aware that:
    (i) Those tiers are being offered to the public;
    (ii) The names of the channels available on those tiers; and

[[Page 618]]

    (iii) The price of the tiers. A subscriber may not be charged for an 
NPT unless the cable operator has obtained the subscriber's affirmative 
consent. Changes to the fundamental nature of an NPT must be approved by 
subscribers in accordance with Sec. 76.981.
    (4) Operators may not require the subscription to any tier, other 
than a BST, as a condition for subscribing to an NPT and operators may 
not require subscription to an NPT as a condition for subscribing to a 
CPST. These restrictions will not apply to cable operators prior to 
October 5, 2002, if such operators lack the capacity to offer BSTs and 
NPTs without also providing other intermediate tiers of service as 
provided in Sec. 76.900(c).
    (c) Operators may offer the same service on NPTs as are on one or 
more BSTs or CPSTs. A channel that occupied a CPST or BST part-time on 
September 30, 1994 also may be offered full-time on an NPT as long as it 
continues to be offered at least part-time on CPST or BST, under 
substantially the same conditions as before it was offered on the NPT. 
If a channel occupies a BST or CPST (regulated pursuant to Sec. 76.922) 
full-time on September 30, 1994, and is subsequently reduced to part-
time on the BST or CPST, that channel may not be offered on an NPT full-
time. Operators that offer a channel both on an NPT and a BST or CPST 
will have a continuing obligation to ensure that subscribers are aware 
that the channels are available on the CPST or BST.
    (d) Operators may temporarily place new channels on CPSTs for 
marketing purposes and then move them to NPTs. In order for an operator 
to move a channel from a CPST to an NPT pursuant to this paragraph, the 
channel must not have been offered on a BST or CPST prior to October 1, 
1994.
    (e) After initially electing to offer an NPT, a cable operator may 
cease to provide the NPT, upon proper notice to subscribers pursuant to 
Sec. 76.964. If an operator drops an NPT and subsequently determines to 
reestablish that tier, at the time of the reestablishment it must comply 
with the conditions for offering NPTs set forth in paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (f) If the Commission receives a complaint about an NPT, the 
operator need not file the rate justification provided in Sec. 76.956, 
but shall within the time period provided by that rule file 
documentation that the NPT meets all the conditions set forth in this 
section.
    (g) Within 30 days of the offering of an NPT, operators shall file 
with the Commission, a copy of the new rate card that contains the 
following information on their BSTs, CPSTs and NPTs:
    (1) The names of the programming services contained on each tier; 
and
    (2) The price of each tier. Operators also must file with the 
Commission, copies of notifications that were sent to subscribers 
regarding the initial offering of NPTs. After this initial filing, cable 
operators must file updated rate cards and copies of customer 
notifications with the Commission within 30 days of rate or service 
changes affecting the NPT.

[59 FR 62625, Dec. 6, 1994]

    Effective Date Note: At 60 FR 62625, Dec. 6, 1994, Sec. 76.987, was 
revised. Paragraph (g) contains information collection and recordkeeping 
requirements and will not become effective until approval has been given 
by the Office of Management and Budget.


<R04>
           Subpart O--Competitive Access to Cable Programming


<R05>
Sec. 76.1000  Definitions

    As used in this subpart:
    (a) Area served by cable system. The term ``area served'' by a cable 
system means an area actually passed by a cable system and which can be 
connected for a standard connection fee.
    (b) Attributable interest. For purposes of determining whether a 
party has an ``attributable interest'' as used in this subpart, the 
definitions contained in the notes to Sec. 76.501 shall be used, 
provided, however that:
    (1) The single majority shareholder provisions of Note 2(b) to 
Sec. 76.501 and the limited partner insulation provisions of Note 2(g) 
to Sec. 76.501 shall not apply; and
    (2) The provisions of Note 2(a) to Sec. 76.501 regarding five (5) 
percent interests shall include all voting or nonvoting stock or limited 
partnership equity interests of five (5) percent or more.

[[Page 619]]

    (c) Buying groups. The term ``buying group'' or ``agent,'' for 
purposes of the definition of a multichannel video programming 
distributor set forth in paragraph (e) of this section, means an entity 
representing the interests of more than one entity distributing 
multichannel video programming that:
    (1) Agrees to be financially liable for any fees due pursuant to a 
satellite cable programming, or satellite broadcast programming, 
contract which it signs as a contracting party as a representative of 
its members or whose members, as contracting parties, agree to joint and 
several liability; and
    (2) Agrees to uniform billing and standardized contract provisions 
for individual members; and
    (3) Agrees either collectively or individually on reasonable 
technical quality standards for the individual members of the group.
    (d) Competing distributors. The term ``competing,'' as used with 
respect to competing multichannel video programming distributors, means 
distributors whose actual or proposed service areas overlap.
    (e) Multichannel video programming distributor. The term 
``multichannel video programming distributor'' means an entity engaged 
in the business of making available for purchase, by subscribers or 
customers, multiple channels of video programming. Such entities 
include, but are not limited to, a cable operator, a multichannel 
multipoint distribution service, a direct broadcast satellite service, a 
television receive-only satellite program distributor, and a satellite 
master antenna television system operator, as well as buying groups or 
agents of all such entities.

    Note to paragraph (e): A video programming provider that provides 
more than one channel of video programming on an open video system is a 
multichannel video programming distributor for purposes of this subpart 
O and Section 76.1507.

    (f) Satellite broadcast programming. The term ``satellite broadcast 
programming'' means broadcast video programming when such programming is 
retransmitted by satellite and the entity retransmitting such 
programming is not the broadcaster or an entity performing such 
retransmission on behalf of and with the specific consent of the 
broadcaster.
    (g) Satellite broadcast programming vendor. The term ``satellite 
broadcast programming vendor'' means a fixed service satellite carrier 
that provides service pursuant to section 119 of title 17, United States 
Code, with respect to satellite broadcast programming.
    (h) Satellite cable programming. The term ``satellite cable 
programming'' means video programming which is transmitted via satellite 
and which is primarily intended for direct receipt by cable operators 
for their retransmission to cable subscribers, except that such term 
does not include satellite broadcast programming.

    Note to paragraph (h): Satellite programming which is primarily 
intended for the direct receipt by open video system operators for their 
retransmission to open video system subscribers shall be included within 
the definition of satellite cable programming.

    (i) Satellite cable programming vendor. The term ``satellite cable 
programming vendor'' means a person engaged in the production, creation, 
or wholesale distribution for sale of satellite cable programming, but 
does not include a satellite broadcast programming vendor.
    (j) Similarly situated. The term `'similarly situated'' means, for 
the purposes of evaluating alternative programming contracts offered by 
a defendant programming vendor, that an alternative multichannel video 
programming distributor has been identified by the defendant as being 
more properly compared to the complainant in order to determine whether 
a violation of Sec. 76.1002(b) has occurred. The analysis of whether an 
alternative multichannel video programming distributor is properly 
comparable to the complainant includes consideration of, but is not 
limited to, such factors as whether the alternative multichannel video 
programming distributor operates within a geographic region proximate to 
the complainant, has roughly the same number of subscribers as the 
complainant, and purchases a similar service as the complainant. Such 
alternative multichannel video programming distributor, however, must 
use the same distribution technology as the ``competing'' distributor 
with whom the complainant seeks to compare itself.

    (k) Subdistribution agreement. The term ``subdistribution 
agreement'' means an arrangement by which a local cable operator is 
given the right by a satellite cable programming vendor or satellite 
broadcast programming vendor to distribute the vendor's programming to 
competing multichannel video programming distributors.

[58 FR 27670, May 11, 1993, as amended at 61 FR 28708, June 5, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 76.1001  Unfair practices generally.

    No cable operator, satellite cable programming vendor in which a 
cable operator has an attributable interest, or satellite broadcast 
programming vendor shall engage in unfair methods of competition or 
unfair or deceptive acts or practices, the purpose or effect of which is 
to hinder significantly or prevent any multichannel video programming 
distributor from providing satellite cable programming or satellite 
broadcast programming to subscribers or consumers.

[58 FR 27671, May 11, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 76.1002  Specific unfair practices prohibited.

    (a) Undue or improper influence. No cable operator that has an 
attributable interest in a satellite cable programming vendor or in a 
satellite broadcast programming vendor shall unduly or improperly 
influence the decision of such vendor to sell, or unduly or improperly 
influence such vendor's prices, terms and conditions for the sale of, 
satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast programming to any 
unaffiliated multichannel video programming distributor.
    (b) Discrimination in prices, terms or conditions. No satellite 
cable programming vendor in which a cable operator has an attributable 
interest, or satellite broadcast programming vendor, shall discriminate 
in the prices, terms, and conditions of sale or delivery of satellite 
cable programming or satellite broadcast programming among or between 
competing cable systems, competing cable operators, or any competing 
multichannel video programming distributors. Nothing in this subsection, 
however, shall preclude:
    (1) The imposition of reasonable requirements for creditworthiness, 
offering of service, and financial stability and standards regarding 
character and technical quality;

    Note 1: Vendors are permitted to create a distinct class or classes 
of service in pricing based on credit considerations or financial 
stability, although any such distinctions must be applied for reasons 
for other than a multichannel video programming distributor's 
technology. Vendors are not permitted to manifest factors such as 
creditworthiness or financial stability in price differentials if such 
factors are already taken into account through different terms or 
conditions such as special credit requirements or payment guarantees.

    Note 2: Vendors may establish price differentials based on factors 
related to offering of service, or difference related to the actual 
service exchanged between the vendor and the distributor, as manifested 
in standardly applied contract terms based on a distributor's particular 
characteristics or willingness to provide secondary services that are 
reflected as a discount or surcharge in the programming service's price. 
Such factors include, but are not limited to, penetration of programming 
to subscribers or to particular systems; retail price of programming to 
the consumer for pay services; amount and type of promotional or 
advertising services by a distributor; a distributor's purchase of 
programming in a package or a la carte; channel position; importance of 
location for non-volume reasons; prepayment discounts; contract 
duration; date of purchase, especially purchase of service at launch; 
meeting competition at the distributor level; and other legitimate 
factors as standardly applied in a technology neutral fashion.

    (2) The establishment of different prices, terms, and conditions to 
take into account actual and reasonable differences in the cost of 
creation, sale, delivery, or transmission of satellite cable programming 
or satellite broadcast programming;

    Note: Vendors may base price differentials, in whole or in part, on 
differences in the cost of delivering a programming service to 
particular distributors, such as differences in costs, or additional 
costs, incurred for advertising expenses, copyright fees, customer 
service, and signal security. Vendors may base price differentials on 
cost differences that occur within a given technology as well as between 
technologies. A price differential for a program service may not be 
based on a distributor's retail costs in delivering service to 
subscribers unless the program vendor can demonstrate that subscribers 
do not or

[[Page 621]]

will not benefit from the distributor's cost savings that result from a 
lower programming price.

    (3) The establishment of different prices, terms, and conditions 
which take into account economies of scale, cost savings, or other 
direct and legitimate economic benefits reasonably attributable to the 
number of subscribers served by the distributor; or

    Note: Vendors may use volume-related justifications to establish 
price differentials to the extent that such justifications are made 
available to similarly situated distributors on a technology-neutral 
basis. When relying upon standardized volume-related factors that are 
made available to all multichannel video programming distributors using 
all technologies, the vendor may be required to demonstrate that such 
volume discounts are reasonably related to direct and legitimate 
economic benefits reasonably attributable to the number of subscribers 
served by the distributor if questions arise about the application of 
that discount. In such demonstrations, vendors will not be required to 
provide a strict cost justification for the structure of such standard 
volume-related factors, but may also identify non-cost economic benefits 
related to increased viewership.

    (4) Entering into exclusive contracts in areas that are permitted 
under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(4) of this section.
    (c) Exclusive contracts and practices.--(1) Unserved areas. No cable 
operator shall engage in any practice or activity or enter into any 
understanding or arrangement, including exclusive contracts, with a 
satellite cable programming vendor or satellite broadcast programming 
vendor for satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast 
programming that prevents a multichannel video programming distributor 
from obtaining such programming from any satellite cable programming 
vendor in which a cable operator has an attributable interest, or any 
satellite broadcast programming vendor in which a cable operator has an 
attributable interest for distribution to persons in areas not served by 
a cable operator as of October 5, 1992.
    (2) Served areas. No cable operator shall enter into any exclusive 
contracts, or engage in any practice, activity or arrangement tantamount 
to an exclusive contract, for satellite cable programming or satellite 
broadcast programming with a satellite cable programming vendor in which 
a cable operator has an attributable interest or a satellite broadcast 
programming vendor in which a cable operator has an attributable 
interest, with respect to areas served by a cable operator, unless the 
Commission determines in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section that such contract, practice, activity or arrangement is in the 
public interest.
    (3) Specific arrangements: Subdistribution agreements.--(i) Served 
areas. No cable operator shall enter into any subdistribution agreement 
or arrangement for satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast 
programming with a satellite cable programming vendor in which a cable 
operator has an attributable interest or a satellite broadcast 
programming vendor in which a cable operator has an attributable 
interest, with respect to areas served by a cable operator, unless such 
agreement or arrangement complies with the limitations set forth in 
paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (ii) Limitations on subdistribution agreements in served areas. No 
cable operator engaged in subdistribution of satellite cable programming 
or satellite broadcast programming may require a competing multichannel 
video programming distributor to
    (A) Purchase additional or unrelated programming as a condition of 
such subdistribution; or
    (B) Provide access to private property in exchange for access to 
programming. In addition, a subdistributor may not charge a competing 
multichannel video programming distributor more for said programming 
than the satellite cable programming vendor or satellite broadcast 
programming vendor itself would be permitted to charge. Any cable 
operator acting as a subdistributor of satellite cable programming or 
satellite broadcast programming must respond to a request for access to 
such programming by a competing multichannel video programming 
distributor within fifteen (15) days of the request. If the request is 
denied, the competing multichannel video programming distributor must be 
permitted to negotiate directly with the satellite cable programming 
vendor or

[[Page 622]]

satellite broadcast programming vendor.
    (4) Public interest determination. In determining whether an 
exclusive contract is in the public interest for purposes of paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section, the Commission will consider each of the 
following factors with respect to the effect of such contract on the 
distribution of video programming in areas that are served by a cable 
operator:
    (i) The effect of such exclusive contract on the development of 
competition in local and national multichannel video programming 
distribution markets;
    (ii) The effect of such exclusive contract on competition from 
multichannel video programming distribution technologies other than 
cable;
    (iii) The effect of such exclusive contract on the attraction of 
capital investment in the production and distribution of new satellite 
cable programming;
    (iv) The effect of such exclusive contract on diversity of 
programming in the multichannel video programming distribution market; 
and
    (v) The duration of the exclusive contract.
    (5) Prior Commission approval required. Any cable operator, 
satellite cable programming vendor in which a cable operator has an 
attributable interest, or satellite broadcast programming vendor in 
which a cable operator has an attributable interest seeking to enforce 
or enter into an exclusive contract in an area served by a cable 
operator must submit a ``Petition for Exclusivity'' to the Commission 
for approval.
    (i) The petition for exclusivity shall contain those portions of the 
contract relevant to exclusivity, including:
    (A) A description of the programming service;
    (B) The extent and duration of exclusivity proposed; and
    (C) Any other terms or provisions directly related to exclusivity or 
to any of the criteria set forth in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. 
The petition for exclusivity shall also include a statement setting 
forth the petitioner's reasons to support a finding that the contract is 
in the public interest, addressing each of the five factors set forth in 
paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
    (ii) Any competing multichannel video programming distributor 
affected by the proposed exclusivity may file an opposition to the 
petition for exclusivity within thirty (30) days of the date on which 
the petition is placed on public notice, setting forth its reasons to 
support a finding that the contract is not in the public interest under 
the criteria set forth in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. Any such 
formal opposition must be served on petitioner on the same day on which 
it is filed with the Commission.
    (iii) The petitioner may file a response within ten (10) days of 
receipt of any formal opposition. The Commission will then approve or 
deny the petition for exclusivity.
    (6) Sunset provision. The prohibition of exclusive contracts set 
forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall cease to be effective on 
October 5, 2002, unless the Commission finds, during a proceeding to be 
conducted during the year preceding such date, that said prohibition 
continues to be necessary to preserve and protect competition and 
diversity in the distribution of video programming.
    (d) Limitations--(1) Geographic limitations. Nothing in this section 
shall require any person who is engaged in the national or regional 
distribution of video programming to make such programming available in 
any geographic area beyond which such programming has been authorized or 
licensed for distribution.
    (2) Applicability to satellite retransmissions. Nothing in this 
section shall apply:
    (i) To the signal of any broadcast affiliate of a national 
television network or other television signal that is retransmitted by 
satellite but that is not satellite broadcast programming; or
    (ii) To any internal satellite communication of any broadcast 
network or cable network that is not satellite broadcast programming.
    (e) Exemptions for prior contracts.--(1) In general. Nothing in this 
section shall affect any contract that grants exclusive distribution 
rights to any person with respect to satellite cable programming and 
that was entered into or

[[Page 623]]

before June 1, 1990, except that the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section shall apply for distribution to persons in areas not served 
by a cable operator.
    (2) Limitation on renewals. A contract that was entered into on or 
before June 1, 1990, but that was renewed or extended after October 5, 
1992, shall not be exempt under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (f) Application to existing contracts. All contracts, except those 
specified in paragraph (e) of this section, related to the provision of 
satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast programming to any 
multichannel video programming distributor must be brought into 
compliance with the requirements specified in this subpart no later than 
November 15, 1993.

completeness of all information and supporting authority furnished in a 
pending complaint proceeding. Information submitted, as well as relevant 
legal authorities, must be current and updated as necessary and in a 
timely manner at any time before a decision is rendered on the merits of 
the complaint.
    (c) Complaint. (1) A program access complaint shall contain:
    (i) The name of the complainant and each defendant;
    (ii) The type of multichannel video programming distributor that 
describes complainant, the address and telephone number of the 
complainant, whether the defendant is a cable operator, satellite 
broadcast programming vendor or satellite cable programming vendor 
(describing each defendant), and the address and telephone number of 
each defendant;
    (iii) The name, address and telephone number of complainant's 
attorney, if represented by counsel;
    (iv) Citation to the section of the Communications Act and/or 
Commission regulation or order alleged to have been violated;

[[Page 624]]

    (v) A complete statement of facts, which, if proven true, would 
constitute such a violation;
    (vi) Any evidence that supports the truth or accuracy of the alleged 
facts;
    (vii) Evidence that supports complainant's belief that the 
defendant, where necessary, meets the attribution standards for 
application of the program access requirements;
    (viii) Evidence that the complainant competes with the defendant 
cable operator, or with a multichannel video programming distributor 
that is a customer of the defendant satellite cable programming or 
satellite broadcast programming vendor;
    (ix) In complaints alleging discrimination, documentary evidence 
such as a rate card or a programming contract that demonstrates a 
differential in price, terms or conditions between complainant and a 
competing multichannel video programming distributor or, if no 
programming contract or rate card is submitted with the complaint, an 
affidavit signed by an officer of complainant alleging that a 
differential in price, terms or conditions exits, a description of the 
nature and extent (if known or reasonably estimated by the complainant) 
of the differential, together with a statement that defendant refused to 
provide any further specific comparative information;
    (x) If a programming contract or a rate card is submitted with the 
complaint in support of the alleged violation, specific references to 
the relevant provisions therein;
    (xi) In complaints alleging exclusivity violations:
    (A) The identity of both the programmer and cable operator who are 
parties to the alleged prohibited agreement,
    (B) Evidence that complainant can or does serve the area specified 
in the complaint, and
    (C) Evidence that the complainant has requested to purchase the 
relevant programming and has been refused or unanswered;
    (xii) In complaints alleging a violation of Sec. 76.1001, evidence 
demonstrating that the behavior complained of has harmed complainant; 
and
    (xiii) The specific relief sought.
    (2) Every complaint alleging a violation of the program access 
requirements shall be accompanied by a sworn affidavit signed by an 
authorized officer or agent of the complainant. This affidavit shall 
contain a statement that the affiant has read the complaint and that to 
the best of the affiant's knowledge, information and belief formed after 
reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in fact and is warranted under 
Commission regulations and policies or is a good faith argument for the 
extension, modification or reversal of such regulations or policies, and 
it is not interposed for any improper purpose. If the complaint is 
signed in violation of this rule, the Commission upon motion or its own 
initiative shall impose upon the complainant an appropriate sanction.
    (3) The following format may be used in cases to which it is 
applicable, with such modifications as the circumstances may render 
necessary;

    Before The Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554. 
In the matter of Complainant, v. Defendant. File No. (To be inserted by 
the Commission) [Insert Subject/Nature of Issue: Discrimination; 
Exclusivity; Undue Influence; Unfair Practice]

                        Program Access Complaint

    To: The Commission.
    The complainant (here insert full name of complainant, and if a 
corporation, the corporate title of such complainant).
    1. (Here state the complainant's method of multichannel video 
program distribution; post office address, and telephone number of the 
complainant).
    2. (Here insert the name, whether a cable operator, satellite 
broadcast programming vendor or satellite cable programming vendor, 
address and telephone number of each defendant).
    3. (Here insert fully and clearly the specific act or thing 
complained of, together with such facts as are necessary to give full 
understanding of the matter, including relevant legal and documentary 
support).
    Wherefore, complainant asks (here state specifically the relief 
desired).

(Date)

(Name of complainant)

(Name, address, and telephone number of attorney, if any)

    (4) The complaint must be accompanied by appropriate evidence 
demonstrating that the required notification pursuant to paragraph (a) 
of this section has been made.

[[Page 625]]

    (d) Answer. (1) Any cable operator, satellite cable programming 
vendor or satellite broadcast programming vendor upon which a program 
access complaint is served under this section shall answer within thirty 
(30) days of service of the complaint, unless otherwise directed by the 
Commission.
    (2) The answer shall advise the parties and the Commission fully and 
completely of the nature of any and all defenses, and shall respond 
specifically to all material allegations of the complaint. Collateral or 
immaterial issues shall be avoided in answers and every effort should be 
made to narrow the issues. Any defendant failing to file and serve an 
answer within the time and in the manner prescribed by these rules may 
be deemed in default and an order may be entered against defendant in 
accordance with the allegations contained in the complaint.
    (3) The answer shall state concisely any and all defenses to each 
claim asserted and shall admit or deny the averments on which the 
adverse party relies. If the defendant is without knowledge or 
information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of an averment, 
the defendant shall so state and this has the effect of a denial. When a 
defendant intends in good faith to deny only part of an averment, the 
answer shall specify so much of it as is true and shall deny only the 
remainder. The defendant may make its denials as specific denials of 
designated averments or paragraphs, or may generally deny all the 
averments except such designated averments or paragraphs as the 
defendant expressly admits. When the defendant intends to controvert all 
averments, the defendant may do so by general denial.
    (4) Averments in a complaint are deemed to be admitted when not 
denied in the answer.
    (5) An answer to an exclusivity complaint shall provide the 
defendant's reasons for refusing to sell the subject programming to the 
complainant. In addition, the defendant may submit to the Commission its 
programming contracts covering the area specified in the complaint with 
its answer to refute allegations concerning the existence of an 
impermissible exclusive contract. If there are no contracts governing 
the specified area, the defendant shall so certify in its answer. Any 
contracts submitted pursuant to this provision may be protected as 
proprietary pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section.
    (6) An answer to a discrimination complaint shall state the reasons 
for any differential in prices, terms or conditions between the 
complainant and its competitor, and shall specify the particular 
justification set forth in Sec. 76.1002(b) relied upon in support of the 
differential.
    (i) When responding to allegations concerning price discrimination, 
except in cases in which the alleged price differential is de minimis 
(less than or equal to five cents per subscriber or five percent, 
whichever is greater), the defendant shall provide documentary evidence 
to support any argument that the magnitude of the differential is not 
discriminatory.
    (ii) In cases involving a price differential of less than or equal 
to five cents per subscriber or five percent, whichever is greater, the 
answer shall identify the differential as de minimis and state that the 
defendant is therefore not required to justify the magnitude of the 
differential.
    (iii) If the defendant believes that the complainant and its 
competitor are not sufficiently similar, the answer shall set forth the 
reasons supporting this conclusion, and the defendant may submit an 
alternative contract for comparison with a similarly situated 
multichannel video programming distributor that uses the same 
distribution technology as the competitor selected for comparison by the 
complainant. The answer shall state the defendant's reasons for any 
differential between the prices, terms and conditions between the 
complainant and such similarly situated distributor, and shall specify 
the particular justifications in Sec. 76.1002(b) relied upon in support 
of the differential. The defendant shall also provide with its answer 
written documentary evidence to support its justification of the 
magnitude of any price differential between the complainant and such 
similarly situated distributor that is not de minimus.
    (iv) Any documents or contracts submitted pursuant to this 
subparagraph

[[Page 626]]

may be protected as proprietary pursuant to paragraph (h) of this 
section.
    (7) An answer to a complaint alleging an unreasonable refusal to 
sell programming shall state the defendant's reasons for refusing to 
sell to the complainant, or for refusing to sell to the complainant on 
the same terms and conditions as complainant's competitor, and shall 
specify why the defendant's actions are not discriminatory.
    (e) Reply. Within twenty (20) days after service of an answer, the 
complainant may file and serve a reply which shall be responsive to 
matters contained in the answer and shall not contain new matters. 
Failure to reply will not be deemed an admission of any allegations 
contained in the answer, except with respect to any affirmative defense 
set forth therein. Replies containing information claimed by defendant 
to be proprietary under paragraph (h) of this section shall be submitted 
to the Commission in confidence pursuant to the requirements of 
Sec. 0.459 of this chapter and clearly marked ``Not for Public 
Inspection.'' An edited version removing all proprietary data shall be 
filed with the Commission for inclusion in the public file within five 
(5) days from the date the unedited reply is submitted, and shall be 
served on the defendant.
    (f) Motions. Except as provided in this section, or upon a showing 
of extraordinary circumstances, additional motions or pleadings by any 
party will not be accepted.
    (g) Discovery. (1) The Commission staff may in its discretion order 
discovery limited to the issues specified by the Commission. Such 
discovery may include answers to written interrogatories or document 
production.
    (2) The Commission staff may in its discretion direct the parties to 
submit discovery proposals, together with a memorandum in support of the 
discovery requested. Such discovery requests may include answers to 
written interrogatories, document production or depositions. The 
Commission staff will then hold a status conference with the parties, 
pursuant to paragraph (j) of this section, to determine the scope of 
discovery. If the Commission staff determines that extensive discovery 
is required or that depositions are warranted, the staff will advise the 
parties that the proceeding will be referred to an administrative law 
judge in accordance with paragraph (m) of this section.
    (h) Confidentiality of proprietary information. (1) Any materials 
generated or provided by a party in connection with the pre-complaint 
notification procedure required under Sec. 76.1003(a) and in the course 
of adjudicating a program access complaint under this provision may be 
designated as proprietary by that party if the party believes in good 
faith that the materials fall within an exemption to disclosure 
contained in the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(b). Any 
party asserting confidentiality for such materials shall so indicate by 
clearly marking each page, or portion thereof, for which a proprietary 
designation is claimed. If a proprietary designation is challenged, the 
party claiming confidentiality will have the burden of demonstrating, by 
a preponderance of the evidence, that the material designated as 
proprietary falls under the standards for nondisclosure enunciated in 
the FOIA.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(3) of this section, 
materials marked as proprietary may be disclosed solely to the following 
persons, only for use in prosecuting or defending a party to the 
complaint action, and only to the extent necessary to assist in the 
prosecution or defense of the case:
    (i) Counsel of record representing the parties in the complaint 
action and any support personnel employed by such attorneys;
    (ii) Officers or employees of the opposing party who are named by 
the opposing party as being directly involved in the prosecution or 
defense of the case;
    (iii) Consultants or expert witnesses retained by the parties;
    (iv) The Commission and its staff; and
    (v) Court reporters and stenographers in accordance with the terms 
and conditions of this section.
    (3) The Commission will entertain, subject to a proper showing, a 
party's request to further restrict access to proprietary information as 
specified by the party. The opposing party will have

[[Page 627]]

an opportunity to respond to such requests.
    (4) The persons designated in paragraphs (h) (2) and (3) of this 
section shall not disclose information designated as proprietary to any 
person who is not authorized under this section to receive such 
information, and shall not use the information in any activity or 
function other than the prosecution or defense in the case before the 
Commission. Each individual who is provided access to the information by 
the opposing party shall sign a notarized statement affirmatively 
stating, or shall certify under penalty of perjury, that the individual 
has personally reviewed the Commission's rules and understands the 
limitations they impose on the signing party.
    (5) No copies of materials marked proprietary may be made except 
copies to be used by persons designated in paragraphs (h) (2) or (3) of 
this section. Each party shall maintain a log recording the number of 
copies made of all proprietary material and the persons to whom the 
copies have been provided.
    (6) Upon termination of the complaint proceeding, including all 
appeals and petitions, all originals and reproductions of any 
proprietary materials, along with the log recording persons who received 
copies of such materials, shall be provided to the producing party. In 
addition, upon final termination of the complaint proceeding, any notes 
or other work product derived in whole or in part from the proprietary 
materials of an opposing or third party shall be destroyed.
    (i) Other required written submissions. (1) The Commission may, in 
its discretion, require the parties to file briefs summarizing the facts 
and issues presented in the pleadings and other record evidence. These 
briefs shall contain the findings of fact and conclusions of law which 
that party is urging the Commission to adopt, with specific citations to 
the record, and supported by relevant authority and analysis.
    (2) The Commission may require the parties to submit any additional 
information it deems appropriate for a full, fair, and expeditious 
resolution of the proceeding, including copies of all contracts and 
documents reflecting arrangements and understandings alleged to violate 
the program access requirements set forth in the Communications Act and 
Secs. 76.1001 and 76.1002, as well as affidavits and exhibits.
    (3) Any briefs submitted shall be filed concurrently by both the 
complainant and defendant at such time as is designated by the staff. 
Such briefs shall not exceed fifty (50) pages.
    (4) Reply briefs may be submitted by either party within twenty (20) 
days from the date initial briefs are due. Reply briefs shall not exceed 
thirty (30) pages.
    (5) Briefs containing information which is claimed by an opposing or 
third party to be proprietary under paragraph (h) of this section shall 
be submitted to the Commission in confidence pursuant to the 
requirements of Sec. 0.459 of this chapter, and shall be clearly marked 
``Not for Public Inspection.'' An edited version removing all 
proprietary data shall be filed with the Commission for inclusion in the 
public file within five (5) days from the date the unedited version is 
submitted and served on opposing parties.
    (j) Status conference. (1) In any program access complaint 
proceeding, the Commission staff may in its discretion direct the 
attorneys and/or the parties to appear for a conference to consider:
    (i) Simplification or narrowing of the issues;
    (ii) The necessity for or desirability of amendments to the 
pleadings, additional pleadings, or other evidentiary submissions;
    (iii) Obtaining admissions of fact or stipulations between the 
parties as to any or all of the matters in controversy;

further conferences; and
    (vii) Such other matters that may aid in the disposition of the 
complaint.
    (2) Any party may request that a conference be held at any time 
after the complaint has been filed.

[[Page 628]]

    (3) Conferences will be scheduled by the Commission at such time and 
place as it may designate, to be conducted in person or by telephone 
conference call.
    (4) The failure of any attorney or party, following reasonable 
notice, to appear at a scheduled conference will be deemed a waiver and 
will not preclude the Commission from conferring with those parties or 
counsel present.
    (5) During a status conference, the Commission staff may issue oral 
rulings pertaining to a variety of interlocutory matters relevant to the 
conduct of a program access complaint proceeding including, inter alia, 
procedural matters, discovery, and the submission of briefs or other 
evidentiary materials. These rulings will be promptly memorialized in 
writing and served on the parties. When such rulings require a party to 
take affirmative action not subject to deadlines established by another 
provision of this subpart, such action will be required within ten (10) 
days from the date of the written memorialization unless otherwise 
directed by the staff.
    (k) Specifications as to pleadings, briefs, and other documents;

occurrence and each affirmative defense shall be separately stated to 
facilitate the clear presentation of the matters set forth.
    (3) The original of all pleadings and submissions by any party shall 
be signed by that party, or by the party's attorney. Complaints must be 
signed by the complainant. The signing party shall state his or her 
address and telephone number and the date on which the document was 
signed. Copies should be conformed to the original. Except when 
otherwise specifically provided by rule or statute, pleadings need not 
be verified. The signature of an attorney or party shall be a 
certificate that the attorney or party has read the pleading, motion, or 
other paper; that to the best of his or her knowledge, information and 
belief formed after reasonable inquiry, it is well grounded in fact and 
is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, 
modification or reversal of existing law; and that it is not interposed 
for any improper purpose. If any pleading or other submission is signed 
in violation of this provision, the Commission shall upon motion or upon 
its own initiative impose upon the party an appropriate sanction. Where 
the pleading or submission is signed by counsel, the provisions of 
Secs. 1.52 and 1.24 of this chapter shall also apply.
    (l) Copies; service. (1) The complainant shall file an original plus 
three copies of the complaint with the Commission. However, if the 
complaint is addressed against multiple defendants, complainant shall 
provide three additional copies of the complaint for each additional 
defendant.

such service in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 1.47 of this 
chapter.
    (5) The parties to any program access compliant proceeding brought 
pursuant to this section may be required to file additional copies of 
any or all papers filed in the proceeding.
    (m) Referral to administrative law judge. (1) After reviewing the 
complaint, answer and reply, and at any stage of the proceeding 
thereafter, the Commission staff may, in its discretion, designate any 
program access compliant proceeding for an adjudicatory hearing before 
an administrative law judge.
    (2) Before designation for hearing, the staff shall notify, either 
orally or in writing, the parties to the proceeding of its intent to so 
designate, and

[[Page 629]]

the parties shall be given a period of ten (10) days to elect to resolve 
the dispute through alternative dispute resolution procedures, or to 
proceed with an adjudicatory hearing. Such election shall be submitted 
in writing to the Commission.
    (3) Unless otherwise directed by the Commission, or upon motion by 
the Mass Media Bureau Chief, the Mass Media Bureau Chief shall not be 
deemed to be a party to a program access compliant proceeding designated 
for a hearing before an administrative law judge pursuant to this 
paragraph.
    (n) Petitions for reconsideration. Petitions for reconsideration of 
interlocutory actions by the Commission's staff or by an administrative 
law judge will not be entertained. Petitions for reconsideration of a 
decision on the merits made by the Commission's staff should be filed in 
accordance with Secs. 1.104-1.106 of this chapter.
    (o) Interlocutory review. (1) Except as provided below, no party may 
seek review of interlocutory rulings until a decision on the merits has 
been issued by the staff or administrative law judge.
    (2) Rulings listed in this paragraph are reviewable as a matter of 
right. An application for review of such ruling may not be deferred and 
raised as an exception to a decision on the merits.
    (i) If the staff's ruling denies or terminates the right of any 
person to participate as a party to the proceeding, such person, as a 
matter of right, may file an application for review of that ruling.
    (ii) If the staff's ruling requires production of documents or other 
written evidence, over objection based on a claim of privilege, the 
ruling on the claim of privilege is reviewable as a matter of right.
    (iii) If the staff's ruling denies a motion to disqualify a staff 
person from participating in the proceeding, the ruling is reviewable as 
a matter of right.
    (p) Expedited review. (1) Any party to a program access complaint 
proceeding aggrieved by any decision on the merits issued by the staff 
pursuant to delegated authority may file an application for review by 
the Commission in accordance with Sec. 1.115 of this chapter.
    (2) Any party to a program access complaint proceeding aggrieved by 
any decision on the merits by an administrative law judge may file an 
appeal of the decision directly with the Commission, in accordance with 
Sec. 1.276(a) and Secs. 1.277(a)-(c) of this chapter, except that unless 
a stay is granted by the Commission, the decision by the administrative 
law judge will become effective upon release and will remain in effect 
pending appeal.
    (q) Frivolous complaints. It shall be unlawful for any party to file 
a frivolous complaint with the Commission alleging any violation of this 
subpart. Any violation of this paragraph shall constitute an abuse of 
process subject to appropriate sanctions.

complainant alleges to violate one or more of the rules contained in 
this subpart; or
    (2) The satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast 
programming vendor offers to sell programming to the complainant 
pursuant to terms that the complainant alleges to violate one or more of 
the rules contained in this subpart; or
    (3) The complainant has notified a cable operator, or a satellite 
cable programming vendor or a satellite broadcast programming vendor 
that it intends to file a complaint with the Commission based on a 
request to purchase or negotiate to purchase satellite cable programming 
or satellite broadcast programming, or a request to amend an existing 
contract pertaining to such programming pursuant to Sec. 76.1002(f) that 
has been denied or unacknowledged, allegedly in violation of one or more 
of the rules contained in this subpart.
    (s) Remedies for violations--(1) Remedies authorized. Upon 
completion of such adjudicatory proceeding, the Commission shall order 
appropriate remedies, including, if necessary, the establishment of 
prices, terms, and conditions for the sale of programming

[[Page 630]]

to the aggrieved multichannel video programming distributor. Such order 
shall set forth a timetable for compliance, and shall become effective 
upon release.

of this section are in addition to and not in lieu of the sanctions 
available under title V or any other provision of the Communications 
Act.

Sec. 76.1004  Applicability of program access rules to common carriers and affiliates.

    (a) Any provision that applies to a cable operator under 
Secs. 76.1000 through 76.1003 shall also apply to a common carrier or 
its affiliate that provides video programming by any means directly to 
subscribers. Any such provision that applies to a satellite cable 
programming vendor in which a cable operator has an attributable 
interest shall apply to any satellite cable programming vendor in which 
such common carrier has an attributable interest. For the purposes of 
this section, two or fewer common officers or directors shall not by 
itself establish an attributable interest by a common carrier in a 
satellite cable programming vendor (or its parent company).
    (b) Sections 76.1002(c)(1) through (3) shall be applied to a common 
carrier or its affiliate that provides video programming by any means 
directly to subscribers in such a way that such common carrier or its 
affiliate shall be generally restricted from entering into an exclusive 
arrangement for satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast 
programming with a satellite cable programming vendor in which a common 
carrier or its affiliate has an attributable interest or a satellite 
broadcast programming vendor in which a common carrier or its affiliate 
has an attributable interest, unless the arrangement pertains to an area 
served by a cable system as of October 5, 1992, and the Commission 
determines in accordance with Section Sec. 76.1002(c)(4) that such 
arrangment is in the public interest.

<R05>
Sec. 76.1300  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart:
    (a) Affiliated. For purposes of determining whether a video 
programming vendor is ``affiliated'' with a multichannel video 
programming distributor, as used in this subpart, the definitions for 
``attributable interest'' contained in the notes to Sec. 76.501 shall be 
used, provided, however that:
    (1) The single majority shareholder provisions of Note 2(b) to 
Sec. 76.501 and the limited partner insulation provisions of Note 2(g) 
to Sec. 76.501 shall not apply; and
    (2) The provisions of Note 2(a) to Sec. 76.501 regarding five (5) 
percent interests shall include all voting or nonvoting stock or limited 
partnership equity interests of five (5) percent or more.
    (b) Buying groups. The term ``buying group'' or ``agent,'' for 
purposes of the definition of a multichannel video programming 
distributor set forth in paragraph (e) of this section, means an entity 
representing the interests of more than one entity distributing 
multichannel video programming that:
    (1) Agrees to be financially liable for any fees due pursuant to a 
satellite cable programming, or satellite broadcast programming, 
contract which it signs as a contracting party as a representative of 
its members or whose members, as contracting parties, agree to joint and 
several liability; and
    (2) Agrees to uniform billing and standardized contract provisions 
for individual members; and
    (3) Agrees either collectively or individually on reasonable 
technical quality standards for the individual members of the group.
    (c) Multichannel video programming distributor. The term 
``multichannel video programming distributor'' means an entity engaged 
in the business of

[[Page 631]]

making available for purchase, by subscribers or customers, multiple 
channels of video programming. Such entities include, but are not 
limited to, a cable operator, a multichannel multipoint distribution 
service, a direct broadcast satellite service, a television receive-only 
satellite program distributor, and a satellite master antenna television 
system operator, as well as buying groups or agents of all such 
entities.
    (d) Video programming vendor. The term ``video programming vendor'' 
means a person engaged in the production, creation, or wholesale 
distribution of video programming for sale.


<R05>
Sec. 76.1301  Prohibited practices.

    (a) Financial interest. No cable operator or other multichannel 
video programming distributor shall require a financial interest in any 
program service as a condition for carriage on one or more of such 
operator's/provider's systems.
    (b) Exclusive rights. No cable operator or other multichannel video 
programming distributor shall coerce any video programming vendor to 
provide, or retaliate against such a vendor for failing to provide, 
exclusive rights against any other multichannel video programming 
distributor as a condition for carriage on a system.
    (c) Discrimination. No multichannel video programming distributor 
shall engage in conduct the effect of which is to unreasonably restrain 
the ability of an unaffiliated video programming vendor to compete 
fairly by discriminating in video programming distribution on the basis 
of affiliation or non-affiliation of vendors in the selection, terms, or 
conditions for carriage of video programming provided by such vendors.


<R05>
Sec. 76.1302  Adjudicatory proceedings.

    Any video programming vendor or multichannel video programming 
distributor aggrieved by conduct that it alleges to constitute a 
violation of the regulations set forth in this subpart may commence an 
adjudicatory proceeding at the Commission.
    (a) Notice required. Any aggrieved video programming vendor or 
multichannel video programming distributor intending to file a complaint 
under this section must first notify the defendant multichannel video 
programming distributor that it intends to file a complaint with the 
Commission based on actions alleged to violate one or more of the 
provisions contained in Sec. 76.1301. The notice must be sufficiently 
detailed so that its recipient(s) can determine the specific nature of 
the potential complaint. The potential complainant must allow a minimum 
of ten (10) days for the potential defendant(s) to respond before filing 
a complaint with the Commission.
    (b) General pleading requirements. Carriage agreement complaint 
proceedings are generally resolved on a written record consisting of a 
complaint, answer and reply, but may also include other written 
submissions such as briefs and written interrogatories. All written 
submissions, both substantive and procedural, must conform to the 
following standards:
    (1) Pleadings must be clear, concise, and explicit. All matters 
concerning a claim, defense or requested remedy should be pleaded fully 
and with specificity.
    (2) Pleadings must contain facts which, if true, are sufficient to 
constitute a violation of the Act or Commission order or regulation, or 
a defense to such alleged violation.
    (3) Facts must be supported by relevant documentation or affidavit.
    (4) Legal arguments must be supported by appropriate judicial, 
Commission, or statutory authority.
    (5) Opposing authorities must be distinguished.
    (6) Copies must be provided of all non-Commission authorities relied 
upon which are not routinely available in national reporting systems, 
such as unpublished decisions or slip opinions of courts or 
administrative agencies.
    (7) Parties are responsible for the continuing accuracy and 
completeness of all information and supporting authority furnished in a 
pending complaint proceeding. Information submitted, as well as relevant 
legal authorities, must be current and updated as necessary and in a 
timely manner at any time before a decision is rendered on the merits of 
the complaint.
    (c) Complaint.

[[Page 632]]

    (1) A carriage agreement complaint shall contain:
    (i) The name of the complainant and defendant;
    (ii) The address and telephone number of the complainant, the type 
of multichannel video programming distributor that describes the 
defendant, and the address and telephone number of the defendant;
    (iii) The name, address and telephone number of complainant's 
attorney, if represented by counsel;
    (iv) Citation to the section of the Communications Act and/or 
Commission regulation or order alleged to have been violated;
    (v) A complete statement of facts, which, if proven true, would 
constitute such a violation;
    (vi) Any evidence that supports the truth or accuracy of the alleged 
facts, including, when relevant, any written carriage agreement between 
the complainant and the defendant, with proprietary information 
redacted;
    (vii) Evidence that supports complainant's belief that the 
defendant, where necessary, meets the attribution standards for 
application of the carriage agreement regulations;
    (viii) For complaints alleging a violation of Sec. 76.1301(c), 
evidence that supports complainant's claim that the effect of the 
conduct complained of is to unreasonably restrain the ability of the 
complainant to compete fairly;
    (ix) The specific relief sought, and the rationale and any evidence 
in support of the relief sought.
    (2) Every complaint alleging a violation of the carriage agreement 
requirements shall be accompanied by a sworn affidavit signed by an 
authorized officer or agent of the complainant. This affidavit shall 
contain a statement that the affiant has read the complaint and that to 
the best of the affiant's knowledge, information and belief formed after 
reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in fact and is warranted under 
Commission regulations and policies or is a good faith argument for the 
extension, modification or reversal of such regulations or policies, and 
it is not interposed for any improper purpose. If the complaint is 
signed in violation of this rule, the Commission upon motion or its own 
initiative shall impose upon the complainant an appropriate sanction.
    (3) The following format may be used in cases to which it is 
applicable, with such modifications as the circumstances may render 
necessary:

   Before the Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554

    In the matter of Complainant, v. Defendant.
    File No. (To be inserted by the Commission) [Insert Subject/Nature 
of Violation]

                      Carriage Agreement Complaint

    To: The Commission.

    The complainant (here insert full name of complainant, and if a 
corporation, the corporate title of such complainant).
    1. (Here state the complainant's post office address and telephone 
number.)
    2. (Here insert the name, defendant's method of multichannel video 
distribution, address and telephone number of defendant.)
    3. (Here insert fully and clearly the specific act or thing 
complained of, together with such facts as are necessary to give full 
understanding of the matter, including relevant legal and documentary 
support.)
    Wherefore, complainant asks (here state specifically the relief 
desired, including rationale and relevant legal and documentary support 
for such relief).
(Date)
(Name of complainant)
(Name, address, and telephone number of attorney, if any)

    (4) The complaint must be accompanied by appropriate evidence 
demonstrating that the required notification pursuant to paragraph (a) 
of this section has been made.
    (d) Answer.
    (1) Any multichannel video programming distributor upon which a 
carriage agreement complaint is served under this section shall answer 
within thirty (30) days of service of the complaint, unless otherwise 
directed by the Commission.
    (2) The answer shall advise the parties and the Commission fully and 
completely of the nature of any and all defenses, and shall respond 
specifically to all material allegations of the complaint. Collateral or 
immaterial issues shall be avoided in answers and every effort should be 
made to narrow the issues. Any defendant failing to file and serve an 
answer within the time and in the manner prescribed by these rules may 
be deemed in default and an order

[[Page 633]]

may be entered against defendant in accordance with the allegations 
contained in the complaint.
    (3) The answer shall state concisely any and all defenses to each 
claim asserted and shall admit or deny the averments on which the 
adverse party relies. If the defendant is without knowledge or 
information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of an averment, 
the defendant shall so state and this has the effect of a denial. When a 
defendant intends in good faith to deny only part of an averment, the 
answer shall specify so much of it as is true and shall deny only the 
remainder. The defendant may make its denials as specific denials of 
designated averments or paragraphs, or may generally deny all the 
averments except such designated averments or paragraphs as the 
defendant expressly admits. When the defendant intends to controvert all 
averments, the defendant may do so by general denial.
    (4) Averments in a complaint are deemed to be admitted when not 
denied in the answer.
    (5) The answer shall also address the relief requested in the 
complaint, including legal and documentary support for such response, 
and may include an alternative relief proposal without prejudice to any 
denials or defenses raised.
    (e) Reply. Within twenty (20) days after service of an answer, the 
complainant may file and serve a reply which shall be responsive to 
matters contained in the answer and shall not contain new matters. 
Failure to reply will not be deemed an admission of any allegations 
contained in the answer, except with respect to any affirmative defenses 
set forth therein.
    (f) Motions. Except as provided in this section, or upon a showing 
of extraordinary circumstances, additional motions or pleadings by any 
party will not be accepted.
    (g) Discovery.
    (1) The Commission staff may in its discretion order discovery 
limited to the issues specified by the Commission. Such discovery may 
include answers to written interrogatories or document production.
    (2) The Commission staff may in its discretion hold a status 
conference with the parties, pursuant to paragraph (j) of this section, 
to determine the scope of discovery.
    (3) If the Commission staff determines that extensive discovery is 
required or that resolution of the complaint will require resolution of 
disputed facts, the staff will advise the parties that the proceeding 
will be referred to an administrative law judge in accordance with 
paragraph (m) of this section.
    (h) Confidentiality of proprietary information.
    (1) Any materials generated or provided by a party in the course of 
adjudicating a carriage agreement complaint under this subpart may be 
designated as proprietary by that party if the party believes in good 
faith that the materials fall within an exemption to disclosure 
contained in the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(b). Any 
party asserting confidentiality for such materials shall so indicate by 
clearly marking each page, or portion thereof, for which a proprietary 
designation is claimed. If a proprietary designation is challenged, the 
party claiming confidentiality will have the burden of demonstrating, by 
a preponderance of the evidence, that the material designated as 
proprietary falls under the standards for nondisclosure enunciated in 
the FOIA.
    (2) Materials marked as proprietary may be disclosed solely to the 
following persons, only for use in prosecuting or defending a party to 
the complaint action, and only to the extent necessary to assist in the 
prosecution or defense of the case:
    (i) Counsel of record representing the parties in the complaint 
action and any support personnel employed by such attorneys;
    (ii) Officers or employees of the opposing party who are named by 
the opposing party as being directly involved in the prosecution or 
defense of the case;
    (iii) Consultants or expert witnesses retained by the parties;
    (iv) The Commission and its staff; and

[[Page 634]]

    (v) Court reporters and stenographers in accordance with the terms 
and conditions of this section. These individuals shall not disclose 
information designated as proprietary to any person who is not 
authorized under this section to receive such information, and shall not 
use the information in any activity or function other than the 
prosecution or defense in the case before the Commission. Each 
individual who is provided access to the information by the opposing 
party shall sign a notarized statement affirmatively stating, or shall 
certify under penalty of perjury, that the individual has personally 
reviewed the Commission's rules and understands the limitations they 
impose on the signing party.
    (3) No copies of materials marked proprietary may be made except 
copies to be used by persons designated in paragraph (h)(2) of this 
section. Each party shall maintain a log recording the number of copies 
made of all proprietary material and the persons to whom the copies have 
been provided.
    (4) Upon termination of the complaint proceeding, including all 
appeals and petitions, all originals and reproductions of any 
proprietary materials, along with the log recording persons who received 
copies of such materials, shall be provided to the producing party. In 
addition, upon final termination of the complaint proceeding, any notes 
or other work product derived in whole or in part from the proprietary 
materials of an opposing or third party shall be destroyed
    (i) Other required written submissions.
    (1) The Commission may, in its discretion, require the parties to 
file briefs summarizing the facts and issues presented in the pleadings 
and other record evidence. These briefs shall contain the findings of 
fact and conclusions of law which that party is urging the Commission to 
adopt, with specific citations to the record, and supported by relevant 
authority and analysis.
    (2) The Commission may require the parties to submit any additional 
information it deems appropriate for a full, fair, and expeditious 
resolution of the proceeding, including copies of all contracts and 
documents reflecting arrangements and understandings alleged to violate 
the carriage agreement requirements set forth in the Communications Act 
and Sec. 76.1301, as well as affidavits and exhibits.
    (3) Any briefs submitted shall be filed concurrently by both the 
complainant and defendant at such time as is designated by the staff. 
Such briefs shall not exceed fifty (50) pages.
    (4) Reply briefs may be submitted by either party within twenty (20) 
days from the date initial briefs are due. Reply briefs shall not exceed 
thirty (30) pages.
    (5) Briefs containing information which is claimed by an opposing or 
third party to be proprietary under paragraph (h) of this section shall 
be submitted to the Commission in confidence pursuant to the 
requirements of Sec. 0.459 of this chapter, and shall be clearly marked 
``Not for Public Inspection.'' An edited version removing all 
proprietary data shall be filed with the Commission for inclusion in the 
public file within five (5) days from the date the unedited version is 
submitted and served on opposing parties.
    (j) Status conference.
    (1) In any carriage agreement complaint proceeding, the Commission 
staff may in its discretion direct the attorneys and/or the parties to 
appear for a conference to consider:
    (i) Simplification or narrowing of the issues;
    (ii) The necessity for or desirability of amendments to the 
pleadings, additional pleadings, or other evidentiary submissions;
    (iii) Obtaining admissions of fact or stipulations between the 
parties as to any or all of the matters in controversy;
    (iv) Settlement of the matters in controversy by agreement of the 
parties;
    (v) The necessity for and extent of discovery, including objections 
to interrogatories or requests for written documents;
    (vi) The need and schedule for filing briefs, and the date for any 
further conferences; and
    (vii) Such other matters that may aid in the disposition of the 
complaint.
    (2) Any party may request that a conference be held at any time 
after the complaint has been filed.

[[Page 635]]

    (3) Conferences will be scheduled by the Commission at such time and 
place as it may designate, to be conducted in person or by telephone 
conference call.
    (4) The failure of any attorney or party, following reasonable 
notice, to appear at a scheduled conference will be deemed a waiver and 
will not preclude the Commission from conferring with those parties or 
counsel present.
    (5) During a status conference, the Commission staff may issue oral 
rulings pertaining to a variety of interlocutory matters relevant to the 
conduct of a carriage agreement complaint proceeding including, inter 
alia, procedural matters, discovery, and the submission of briefs or 
other evidentiary materials. These rulings will be promptly memorialized 
in writing and served on the parties. When such rulings require a party 
to take affirmative action not subject to deadlines established by 
another provision of this subpart, such action will be required within 
ten (10) days from the date of the written memorialization unless 
otherwise directed by the staff.
    (k) Specifications as to pleadings, briefs, and other documents; 
subscriptions.
    (1) All papers filed in a carriage agreement complaint proceeding 
must be drawn in conformity with the requirements of Secs. 1.49 and 1.50 
of this chapter.
    (2) All averments of claims or defenses in complaints and answers 
shall be made in numbered paragraphs. The contents of each paragraph 
shall be limited as far as practicable to a statement of a single set of 
circumstances. Each claim founded on a separate transaction or 
occurrence and each affirmative defense shall be separately stated to 
facilitate the clear presentation of the matters set forth.
    (3) The original of all pleadings and submissions by any party shall 
be signed by that party, or by the party's attorney. Complaints must be 
signed by the complainant. The signing party shall state his or her 
address and telephone number and the date on which the document was 
signed. Copies should be conformed to the original. Except when 
otherwise specifically provided by rule or statute, pleadings need not 
be verified. The signature of an attorney or party shall be a 
certification that the attorney or party has read the pleading, motion, 
or other paper; that to the best of his or her knowledge, information 
and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, it is well grounded in fact 
and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the 
extension, modification or reversal of existing law; and that it is not 
interposed for any improper purpose. If any pleading or other submission 
is signed in violation of this provision, the Commission shall upon 
motion or upon its own initiative impose upon the party an appropriate 
sanction. Where the pleading or submission is signed by counsel, the 
provisions of Secs. 1.52 and 1.24 of this chapter shall also apply
    (l) Copies; service.
    (1) The complainant shall file an original plus three copies of the 
complaint with the Commission.
    (2) An original plus two copies shall be filed of all pleadings and 
documents other than the complaint.
    (3) The complainant shall serve the complaint on each defendant at 
the same time that it is filed at the Commission.
    (4) All subsequent pleadings and briefs, as well as all letters, 
documents or other written submissions, shall be served by the filing 
party on all other parties to the proceeding, together with proof of 
such service in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 1.47 of this 
chapter.
    (5) The parties to any carriage agreement complaint proceeding 
brought pursuant to this section may be required to file additional 
copies of any or all papers filed in the proceeding.
    (m) Referral to administrative law judge.
    (1) After reviewing the complaint, answer and reply, and at any 
stage of the proceeding thereafter, the Commission staff may, in its 
discretion, designate any carriage agreement complaint proceeding for an 
adjudicatory hearing before an administrative law judge.
    (2) Before designation for hearing, the staff shall notify, either 
orally or in writing, the parties to the proceeding of its intent to so 
designate, and the parties shall be given a period of

[[Page 636]]

ten (10) days to elect to resolve the dispute resolution procedures, or 
to proceed with an adjudicatory hearing. Such election shall be 
submitted in writing to the Commission.
    (3) Unless otherwise directed by the Commission, or upon motion by 
the Mass Media Bureau Chief, the Mass Media Bureau Chief shall not be 
deemed to be a party to a carriage agreement complaint proceeding 
designated for a hearing before an administrative law judge pursuant to 
this paragraph (m).
    (n) Petitions for reconsideration. Petitions for reconsideration of 
interlocutory actions by the Commission's staff or by an administrative 
law judge will not be entertained. Petitions for reconsideration of a 
decision on the merits made by the Commission's staff should be filed in 
accordance with Secs. 1.104 through 1.106 of this chapter.
    (o) Interlocutory review.
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (o)(2) of this section, no party 
may seek review of interlocutory rulings until a decision on the merits 
has been issued by the staff or administrative law judge.
    (2) Rulings listed in this paragraph are reviewable as a matter of 
right. An application for review of such ruling may not be deferred and 
raised as an exception to a decision on the merits.
    (i) If the staff's ruling denies or terminates the right of any 
person to participate as a party to the proceeding, such person, as a 
matter of right, may file an application for review of that ruling.
    (ii) If the staff's ruling requires production of documents or other 
written evidence, over objection based on a claim of privilege, the 
ruling on the claim of privilege is reviewable as a matter of right.
    (iii) If the staff's ruling denies a motion to disqualify a staff 
person from participating in the proceeding, the ruling is reviewable as 
a matter of right.
    (p) Expedited review.
    (1) Any party to a carriage agreement complaint proceeding aggrieved 
by any decision on the merits issued by the staff pursuant to delegated 
authority may file an application for review by the Commission in 
accordance with Sec. 1.115 of this chapter.
    (2) Any party to a carriage agreement complaint proceeding aggrieved 
by any decision on the merits by an administrative judge may file an 
appeal of the decision directly with the Commission in accordance with 
Sec. 1.276(a) and Secs. 1.277 (a) through (c) of this chapter, except 
that unless a stay is granted by the Commission, the decision by the 
administrative law judge will become effective upon release and will 
remain in effect pending appeal.
    (q) Frivolous complaints. It shall be unlawful for any party to file 
a frivolous complaint with the Commission alleging any violation of this 
subpart. Any violation of this paragraph shall constitute an abuse of 
process subject to appropriate sanctions.
    (r) Statute of limitations. Any complaint filed pursuant to this 
paragraph must be filed within one year of the date on which one of the 
following events occurs:
    (1) The multichannel video programming distributor enters into a 
contract with a video programming vendor that a party alleges to violate 
one or more of the rules contained in this section; or
    (2) The multichannel video programming distributor offers to carry 
the video programming vendor's programming pursuant to terms that a 
party alleges to violate one or more of the rules contained in this 
section; or
    (3) A party has notified a multichannel video programming 
distributor that it intends to file a complaint with the Commission 
based on violations of one or more of the rules contained in this 
section.
    (s) Remedies for violations.
    (1) Remedies authorized. Upon completion of such adjudicatory 
proceeding, the Commission shall order appropriate remedies, including, 
if necessary, mandatory carriage of a video programming vendor's 
programming on defendant's video distribution system, or the 
establishment of prices, terms, and conditions for the carriage of a 
video programming vendor's programming. Such order shall set forth a 
timetable for compliance, and shall become effective upon release, 
unless any order of mandatory carriage would require the

[[Page 637]]

defendant multichannel video programming distributor to delete existing 
programming from its system to accommodate carriage of a video 
programming vendor's programming. In such instances, if the defendant 
seeks review of the staff or administrative law judge decision, the 
order for carriage of a video programming vendor's programming will not 
become effective unless and until the decision of the staff or 
administrative law judge is upheld by the Commission. If the Commission 
upholds the remedy ordered by the staff or administrative law judge in 
its entirety, the defendant will be required to carry the video 
programming vendor's programming for an additional period of time equal 
to the time elapsed between the staff or administrative law judge 
decision and the Commission's ruling, on the terms and conditions 
approved by the Commission.
    (2) Additional sanctions. The remedies provided in paragraph (s)(1) 
of this section are in addition to and not in lieu of the sanctions 
available under title V or any other provision of the Communications 
Act.

            Subpart R--Telecommunications Act Implementation

    Source:  61 FR 18980, Apr. 30, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 76.1400  Purpose.

    The rules and regulations set forth in this subpart provide 
procedures for administering certain aspects of cable regulation. These 
rules and regulations provide guidance for operators, subscribers and 
franchise authorities with respect to matters that are subject to 
immediate implementation under governing statutes but require specific 
regulatory procedures or definitions.


<R05>
Sec. 76.1401  Effective competition and local exchange carriers.

    (a) As used in Sec. 76.905(b)(4), the term ``comparable'' 
programming means access to at least 12 channels of programming, at 
least some of which are local television broadcasting signals.
    (b) As used in Sec. 76.905(b)(4), the term ``affiliate'' means a 
person that (directly or indirectly) owns or controls, is owned or 
controlled by, or is under common ownership or control with another 
person. For purposes of the section, the term ``own'' means to own an 
equity interest (or the equivalent thereof) of more than 10 percent.
    (c) An operator meeting the relevant criteria under 
Sec. 76.905(b)(4), may, at any time, file a petition for a determination 
of effective competition with the Commission. The petition should set 
forth information supporting a determination that effective competition 
exists as defined in Sec. 76.905(d)(4).
    (d) Upon filing of a petition described in paragraph (c) of this 
section with the Commission, the operator filing the petition shall 
provide a copy of the petition to the local franchise authority. The 
Commission will issue a public notice of the petition's filing to allow 
interested parties to respond. The Commission may then issue an order 
granting or denying the petition. The Commission may issue an order 
directing one or more persons to produce information relevant to the 
petition's disposition.


<R05>
Sec. 76.1402  CPST rate complaints.

    (a) A local franchise authority may file rate complaints with the 
Commission within 180 days of the effective date of a rate increase on 
the cable operator's cable programming services tier if within 90 days 
of that increase the local franchise authority receives more than one 
subscriber complaint concerning the increase.
    (b) Before filing a rate complaint with the Commission, the local 
franchise authority must first give the cable operator written notice, 
including a draft FCC Form 329, of the local franchise authority's 
intent to file the complaint. The local franchise authority must give an 
operator a minimum of 30 days to file with the local franchise authority 
the relevant FCC forms that must be filed to justify a rate increase or, 
where appropriate, certification that the operator is not subject to 
rate regulation. The operator must file a complete response with the 
local

[[Page 638]]

franchise authority within the time period specified by the local 
franchise authority. The local franchise authority shall file with the 
Commission the complaint and the operator's response to the Complaint. 
If the operator's response to the complaint asserts that the operator is 
exempt from rate regulation, the operator's response can be filed with 
the local franchise authority without filing specific FCC Forms.


<R05>
Sec. 76.1403  Small cable operators.

    (a) Effective February 8, 1996, a small cable operator is exempt 
from rate regulation on its cable programming services tier, or on its 
basic service tier if that tier was the only service tier subject to 
rate regulation as of December 31, 1994, in any franchise area in which 
that operator services 50,000 or fewer subscribers.
    (b) A small cable operator is an operator who, directly or through 
an affiliate, serves in the aggregate fewer than 617,000 subscribers in 
the United States and whose annual revenues, when combined with the 
total annual revenues of all of its affiliates, do not exceed $250 
million in the aggregate.
    (c) As used in this section, an operator shall be deemed affiliated 
with another entity if that entity holds a 20 percent or greater equity 
interest, passive or active, in the operator or exercises de jure or de 
facto control over the operator.
    (d) Procedures. (1) If a small cable operator has only a single tier 
that is subject to regulation, the operator, at any time, may certify in 
writing to its local franchise authority that it meets all criteria 
necessary to qualify as a small operator. Upon request of the local 
franchising authority, the operator shall identify in writing all of its 
affiliates that provide cable service, the total subscriber base of 
itself and each affiliate, and the aggregate gross revenues of its cable 
and non-cable affiliates. Within 90 days of receiving the original 
certification, the local franchising authority shall determine whether 
the operator qualifies for deregulation and shall notify the operator in 
writing of its decision, although this 90-day period shall be tolled for 
so long as it takes the operator to respond to a proper request for 
information by the local franchising authority. If the local franchising 
authority finds that the operator does not qualify for deregulation, its 
notice shall state the grounds for that decision. The operator may 
appeal the local franchising authority's decision to the Commission 
within 30 days.
    (2) Once the operator has certified its eligibility for deregulation 
on the basic service tier, the local franchising authority shall not 
prohibit the operator from taking a rate increase and shall not order 
the operator to make any refunds unless and until the local franchising 
authority has rejected the certification in a final order that is no 
longer subject to appeal or that the Commission has affirmed. The 
operator shall be liable for refunds for revenues gained (beyond 
revenues that could be gained under regulation) as a result of any rate 
increase taken during the period in which it claimed to be deregulated, 
plus interest, in the event the operator is later found not to be 
deregulated. The one-year limitation on refund liability will not be 
applicable during that period to ensure that the filing of an invalid 
small operator certification does not reduce any refund liability that 
the operator would otherwise incur.
    (3) Within 30 days of being served with a local franchising 
authority's notice that the local franchising authority intends to file 
a cable programming services tier rate complaint, an operator may 
certify to the local franchising authority that it meets the criteria 
for qualification as a small cable operator. This certification shall be 
filed in accordance with the cable programming services rate complaint 
procedure set forth in Sec. 76.1402. Absent a cable programming services 
rate complaint, the operator need not file for small cable operator 
certification in order to treat its cable programming services tier as 
deregulated.
    (4) If a pending CPST rate complaint was filed with the Commission 
before April 30, 1996 the operator should file its certification of 
small cable operator status directly with the Commission within 15 days 
of that date.

<R05>
Sec. 76.1404  Use of cable facilities by local exchange carriers.

    For purposes of Sec. 76.505(d)(2), the Commission will determine 
whether use of a cable operator's facilities by a local exchange carrier 
is reasonably limited in scope and duration according to the following 
procedures:
    (a) Within 10 days of final execution of a contract permitting a 
local exchange carrier to use that part of the transmission facilities 
of a cable system extending from the last multi-user terminal to the 
premises of the end use, the parties shall submit a copy of such 
contract, along with an explanation of how such contract is reasonably 
limited in scope and duration, to the Commission for review. The parties 
shall serve a copy of this submission on the local franchising 
authority, along with a notice of the local franchising authority's 
right to file comments with the Commission consistent with Sec. 76.7.
    (b) Based on the record before it, the Commission shall determine 
whether the local exchange carrier's use of that part of the 
transmission facilities of a cable system extending from the last multi-
use terminal to the premises of the end user is reasonably limited in 
scope and duration. In making this determination, the Commission will 
evaluate whether the proposed joint use of cable facilities promotes 
competition in both services and facilities, and encourages long-term 
investment in telecommunications infrastructure.

                      Subpart S--Open Video Systems

    Source:  61 FR 28708, June 5, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 76.1500  Definitions.

    (a) Open video system. A facility consisting of a set of 
transmission paths and associated signal generation, reception, and 
control equipment that is designed to provide cable service which 
includes video programming and which is provided to multiple subscribers 
within a community, provided that the Commission has certified that such 
system complies with this part.
    (b) Open video system operator (``operator''). Any person or group 
of persons who provides cable service over an open video system and 
directly or through one or more affiliates owns a significant interest 
in such open video system, or otherwise controls or is responsible for 
the management and operation of such an open video system.
    (c) Video programming provider. Any person or group of persons who 
has the right under the copyright laws to select and contract for 
carriage of specific video programming on an open video system.
    (d) Activated channels. This term shall have the same meaning as 
provided in the cable television rules, 47 CFR 76.5(nn).
    (e) Shared channel. Any channel that carries video programming that 
is selected by more than one video programming provider and offered to 
subscribers.
    (f) Cable service. This term shall have the same meaning as provided 
in the cable television rules, 47 CFR 76.5(ff).
    (g) Affiliate. For purposes of determining whether a party is an 
``affiliate'' as used in this subpart, the definitions contained in the 
notes to Sec. 76.501 shall be used, provided, however that:
    (1) The single majority shareholder provisions of Note 2(b) to 
Sec. 76.501 and the limited partner insulation provisions of Note 2(g) 
to Sec. 76.501 shall not apply; and
    (2) The provisions of Note 2(a) to Sec. 76.501 regarding five (5) 
percent interests shall include all voting or nonvoting stock or limited 
partnership equity interests of five (5) percent or more.
    (h) Other terms. Unless otherwise expressly stated, words not 
defined in this part shall be given their meaning as used in Title 47 of 
the United States Code, as amended, and, if not defined therein, their 
meaning as used in Part 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

[61 FR 28708, June 5, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 43175, Aug. 21, 1996]

    Effective Date Note: At 61 FR 43175, Aug. 21, 1996, in Sec. 76.1500, 
paragraph (g) was redesignated as (h); a new paragraph (g) was added. 
This amendment contains information collection and recordkeeping 
requirements and will not become effective until approval has been given 
by the Office of Management and Budget.

<R05>
Sec. 76.1501  Qualifications to be an open video system operator.

    Any person may obtain a certification to operate an open video 
system pursuant to Section 653(a)(1) of the Communications Act, 47 
U.S.C. 573(a)(1), except that an operator of a cable system, regardless 
of any other service that the cable operator may provide, may not obtain 
such a certification within its cable service area unless it is subject 
to ``effective competition,'' as defined in Section 623(l)(1) of the 
Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 543(l)(1). A cable operator that is not 
subject to effective competition within its cable service area may file 
a petition with the Commission, seeking a finding that particular 
circumstances exist that make it consistent with the public interest, 
convenience, and necessity to allow the operator to convert its cable 
system to an open video system. Nothing herein shall be construed to 
affect the terms of any franchising agreement or other contractual 
agreement.

    Note: Sec. 76.1501: An example of a circumstance in which the public 
interest, convenience and necessity would be served by permitting a 
cable operator not subject to effective competition to become an open 
video system operator within its cable service area is where the entry 
of a facilities-based competitor into its cable service area would 
likely be infeasible.


<R05>
Sec. 76.1502  Certification.

    (a) An operator of an open video system must certify to the 
Commission that it will comply with the Commission's regulations in 47 
CFR 76.1503, 76.1504, 76.1506(m), 76.1508, 76.1509, and 76.1513. If 
construction of new physical plant is required, the Commission must 
approve such certification prior to the commencement of construction. If 
no new construction is required, the Commission must approve such 
certification prior to the commencement of service at such a point in 
time that would allow the applicant sufficient time to comply with the 
Commission's notification requirements.
    (b) Certifications must be verified by an officer or director of the 
applicant, stating that, to the best of his or her information and 
belief, the representations made therein are accurate.
    (c) Certifications must be filed on FCC Form 1275 and must include:
    (1) The applicant's name, address and telephone number;
    (2) A statement of ownership, including all affiliated entities;
    (3) If the applicant is a cable operator applying for certification 
in its cable franchise area, a statement that the applicant is qualified 
to operate an open video system under Section 76.1501.
    (4) A statement that the applicant agrees to comply and to remain in 
compliance with each of the Commission's regulations in Secs. 76.1503, 
76.1504, 76.1506(m), 76.1508, 76.1509, and 76.1513;
    (5) If the applicant is required under 47 CFR 64.903(a) of this 
chapter to file a cost allocation manual, a statement that the applicant 
will file changes to its manual at least 60 days before the commencement 
of service;
    (6) A list of the names of the anticipated local communities to be 
served upon completion of the system;
    (7) The anticipated amount and type (i.e., analog or digital) of 
capacity (for switched digital systems, the anticipated number of 
available channel input ports); and
    (8) A statement that the applicant will comply with the Commission's 
notice and enrollment requirements for unaffiliated video programming 
providers.
    (d) Parties are required to attach a cover sheet to the filing 
indicating that the submission is an open video system certification 
application. The only wording on this cover sheet shall be ``Open Video 
System Certification Application'' and ``Attention: Cable Services 
Bureau.'' This wording shall be located in the center of the page and 
should be in letters at least \1/2\ inch in size. Parties shall also 
include the words ``open video systems'' on their mailing envelope.
    (e)(1) Comments or oppositions to a certification must be filed 
within five calendar days of the Commission's receipt of the 
certification and must be served on the party that filed the 
certification. If, after making the necessary calculations, the due date 
for filing comments falls on a holiday, comments shall be filed on the 
next business day before noon, unless the

[[Page 641]]

nearest business day precedes the fifth calendar day following a filing, 
in which case the comments will be due on the preceding business day. 
For example, if the fifth day falls on a Saturday, then the filing would 
be due on that preceding Friday. However, if the fifth day falls on 
Sunday, then the filing will be due on the next day, Monday, before noon 
(or Tuesday, before noon if the Monday is a holiday).
    (2) Parties wishing to respond to a FCC Form 1275 filing must submit 
comments or oppositions with the Office of the Secretary and the Bureau 
Chief, Cable Services Bureau. Comments will not be considered properly 
filed unless filed with both of these Offices. Parties are required to 
attach a cover sheet to the filing indicating that the submission is a 
pleading related to an open video system application, the only wording 
on this cover sheet shall be ``Open Video System Certification 
Application Comments.'' This wording shall be located in the center of 
the page and should be in letters at least \1/2\ inch in size. Parties 
shall also include the words ``open video systems'' on their mailing 
envelopes.
    (f) If the Commission does not disapprove the certification 
application within ten days after receipt of an applicant's request, the 
certification application will be deemed approved. If disapproved, the 
applicant may file a revised certification or refile its original 
submission with a statement addressing the issues in dispute. Such 
refilings must be served on any objecting party or parties and on all 
local communities in which the applicant intends to operate. The 
Commission will consider any revised or refiled FCC Form 1275 to be a 
new proceeding and any party who filed comments regarding the original 
FCC Form 1275 will have to refile their original comments if they think 
such comments should be considered in the subsequent proceeding.

<R05>
Sec. 76.1503  Carriage of video programming providers on open video systems.

    (a) Non-discrimination principle. Except as otherwise permitted in 
applicable law or in this part, an operator of an open video system 
shall not discriminate among video programming providers with regard to 
carriage on its open video system, and its rates, terms and conditions 
for such carriage shall be just and reasonable and not unjustly or 
unreasonably discriminatory.
    (b) Demand for carriage. An operator of an open video system shall 
solicit and determine the level of demand for carriage on the system 
among potential video programming providers in a non-discriminatory 
manner.
    (1) Notification. An open video system operator shall file with the 
Secretary of the Federal Communications Commission a ``Notice of 
Intent'' to establish an open video system, which the Commission will 
release in a Public Notice. Parties are required to attach a cover sheet 
to the filing indicating that the submission is an Open Video System 
Notice of Intent. The only wording on this cover sheet shall be ``Open 
Video System Notice of Intent'' and ``Attention: Cable Services 
Bureau.'' This wording shall be located in the center of the page and 
should be in letters at least \1/2\ inch in size. Parties shall also 
include the words ``open video systems'' on their mailing envelopes. 
Parties must submit copies of the Notice of Intent with the Office of 
the Secretary and the Bureau Chief, Cable Services Bureau. The Notice of 
Intent shall include the following information:
    (i) A heading clearly indicating that the document is a Notice of 
Intent to establish an open video system;
    (ii) The name, address and telephone number of the open video system 
operator;
    (iii) A description of the system's projected service area;
    (iv) A description of the system's projected channel capacity, in 
terms of analog, digital and other type(s) of capacity upon activation 
of the system;
    (v) A description of the steps a potential video programming 
provider must

[[Page 642]]

follow to seek carriage on the open video system, including the name, 
address and telephone number of a person to contact for further 
information;
    (vi) The starting and ending dates of the initial enrollment period 
for video programming providers;
    (vii) The process for allocating the system's channel capacity, in 
the event that demand for carriage on the system exceeds the system's 
capacity; and
    (viii) A certification that the operator has complied with all 
relevant notification requirements under the Commission's open video 
system regulations concerning must-carry and retransmission consent 
(Sec. 76.1506), including a list of all local commercial and non-
commercial television stations served, and a certificate of service 
showing that the Notice of Intent has been served on all local cable 
franchising authorities entitled to establish requirements concerning 
the designation of channels for public, educational and governmental 
use.
    (2) Information. An open video system operator shall provide the 
following information to a video programming provider within five 
business days of receiving a written request from the provider, unless 
otherwise included in the Notice of Intent:
    (i) The projected activation date of the open video system. If a 
system is to be activated in stages, the operator should describe the 
respective stages and the projected dates on which each stage will be 
activated;
    (ii) A preliminary carriage rate estimate;
    (iii) The information a video programming provider will be required 
to provide to qualify as a video programming provider, e.g., 
creditworthiness;
    (iv) Technical information that is reasonably necessary for 
potential video programming providers to assess whether to seek capacity 
on the open video system, including what type of customer premises 
equipment subscribers will need to receive service;
    (v) Any transmission or reception equipment needed by a video 
programming provider to interface successfully with the open video 
system; and
    (vi) The equipment available to facilitate the carriage of 
unaffiliated video programming and the electronic form(s) that will be 
accepted for processing and subsequent transmission through the system.
    (3) Qualifications of video programming providers. An open video 
system operator may impose reasonable, non-discriminatory requirements 
to assure that a potential video programming provider is qualified to 
obtain capacity on the open video system.
    (c) One-third limit. If carriage demand by video programming 
providers exceeds the activated channel capacity of the open video 
system, the operator of the open video system and its affiliated video 
programming providers may not select the video programming services for 
carriage on more than one-third of the activated channel capacity on 
such system.
    (1) Measuring capacity. For purposes of this section:
    (i) If an open video system carries both analog and digital signals, 
an open video system operator shall measure analog and digital activated 
channel capacity independently;
    (ii) Channels that an open video system is required to carry 
pursuant to the Commission's regulations concerning public, educational 
and governmental channels and must-carry channels shall be included in 
``activated channel capacity'' for purposes of calculating the one-third 
of such capacity on which the open video system operator and its 
affiliates are allowed to select the video programming for carriage. 
Such channels shall not be included in the one-third of capacity on 
which the open video system operator is permitted to select programming 
where demand for carriage exceeds system capacity;
    (iii) Channels that an open video system operator carries pursuant 
to the Commission's regulations concerning retransmission consent shall 
be included in ``activated channel capacity'' for purposes of 
calculating the one-third of such capacity on which the open video 
system operator and its affiliates are allowed to select the video 
programming for carriage. Such channels shall be included in the one-
third of capacity on which the open video system operator is permitted 
to select programming, where demand for carriage exceeds system 
capacity, to the

[[Page 643]]

extent that the channels are carried as part of the programming service 
of the operator or its affiliate, subject to paragraph (c)(1)(iv); and
    (iv) Any channel on which shared programming is carried shall be 
included in ``activated channel capacity'' for purposes of calculating 
the one-third of such capacity on which the open video system operator 
and its affiliates are allowed to select the video programming for 
carriage. Such channels shall be included in the one-third of capacity 
on which the open video system operator is permitted to select 
programming, where demand for carriage exceeds system capacity, to the 
extent the open video system operator or its affiliate is one of the 
video programming providers sharing such channel.

    Note to paragraph (c)(1)(iv): For example, if the open video system 
operator and two unaffiliated video programming providers each carry a 
programming service that is placed on a shared channel, the shared 
channel shall count as 0.33 channels against the one-third amount of 
capacity allocable to the open video system operator, where demand for 
carriage exceeds system capacity.

    (2) Allocating capacity. An operator of an open video system shall 
allocate activated channel capacity through a fair, open and non-
discriminatory process; the process must be insulated from any bias of 
the open video system operator and verifiable.
    (i) If an open video system carries both analog and digital signals, 
an open video system operator shall treat analog and digital capacity 
separately in allocating system capacity.
    (ii) Subsequent changes in capacity or demand. An open video system 
operator must allocate open capacity, if any, at least once every three 
years, beginning three years from the date of service commencement. Open 
capacity shall be allocated in accordance with this section. Open 
capacity shall include all capacity that becomes available during the 
course of the three-year period, as well as capacity in excess of one-
third of the system's activated channel capacity on which the operator 
of the open video system or its affiliate selects programming. An 
operator shall maintain a file of qualified video programming providers 
who have requested carriage or additional carriage since the previous 
allocation of capacity. Information regarding how a video programming 
provider should apply for carriage must be made available upon request.

    Note 1 to paragraph (c)(2)(ii): An open video system operator will 
not be required to comply with the regulations contained in this section 
if there is no open capacity to be allocated at the end of the three 
year period.
    Note 2 to paragraph (c)(2)(ii): An open video system operator shall 
be required to accommodate changes in obligations concerning public, 
educational or governmental channels or must-carry channels in 
accordance with Sections 611, 614 and 615 of the Communications Act and 
the regulations contained in this part.

    (iii) Channel sharing. An open video system operator may carry on 
only one channel any video programming service that is offered by more 
than one video programming provider (including the operator's video 
programming affiliate), provided that subscribers have ready and 
immediate access to any such programming service. Nothing in this 
section shall be construed to impair the rights of programming services.

    Note 1 to paragraph (c)(2)(iii): An open video system operator may 
implement channel sharing only after it becomes apparent that one or 
more video programming services will be offered by multiple video 
programming providers. An open video system operator may not select, in 
advance of any duplication among video programming providers, which 
programming services shall be placed on shared channels.
    Note 2 to paragraph (c)(2)(iii): Each video programming provider 
offering a programming service that is carried on a shared channel must 
have the contractual permission of the video programming service to 
offer the service to subscribers. The placement of a programming service 
on a shared channel, however, is not subject to the approval of the 
video programming service or vendor.
    Note 3 to paragraph (c)(2)(iii): Ready and immediate access in this 
context means that the channel sharing is ``transparent'' to 
subscribers.

    (iv) Open video system operator discretion. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, an operator of an open video system may:
    (A) Require video programming providers to request and obtain system 
capacity in increments of no less than one full-time channel; however, 
an operator of an open video system may not require video programming 
providers

[[Page 644]]

to obtain capacity in increments of more than one full-time channel;
    (B) Limit video programming providers from selecting the programming 
on more capacity than the amount of capacity on which the system 
operator and its affiliates are selecting the programming for carriage; 
and
    (v) Notwithstanding the general prohibition on an open video system 
operator's discrimination among video programming providers contained in 
paragraph (a) of this section, a competing, in-region cable operator or 
its affiliate(s) that offers cable service to subscribers located in the 
service area of an open video system shall not be entitled to obtain 
capacity on such an open video system, except:
    (A) Where the operator of an open video system determines that 
granting access to the competing, in-region cable operator is in its 
interests; or
    (B) Where a showing is made that facilities-based competition will 
not be significantly impeded.

    Note to paragraph (c)(2)(v)(B): The Commission finds that 
facilities-based competition will not be significantly impeded, for 
example, where:
    (1) The competing, in-region cable operator and affiliated systems 
offer service to less than 20% of the households passed by the open 
video system; and
    (2) The competing, in-region cable operator and affiliated systems 
provide cable service to a total of less than 17,000 subscribers within 
the open video system's service area.

    (3) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the number 
of channels that the open video system operator and its affiliates, or 
another video programming provider, may offer to provide directly to 
subscribers. Co-packaging is permissible among video programming 
providers, but may not be a condition of carriage. Video programming 
providers may freely elect whether to enter into co-packaging 
arrangements.

    Note to paragraph (c)(3): Any video programming provider on an open 
video system may co-package video programming that is selected by 
itself, an affiliated video programming provider and/or unaffiliated 
video programming providers on the system.

<R05>
Sec. 76.1504  Rates, terms and conditions for carriage on open video systems.

    (a) Reasonable rate principle. An open video system operator shall 
set rates, terms, and conditions for carriage that are just and 
reasonable, and are not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory.
    (b) Differences in rates. (1) An open video system operator may 
charge different rates to different classes of video programming 
providers, provided that the bases for such differences are not unjust 
or unreasonably discriminatory.
    (2) An open video system operator shall not impose different rates, 
terms, or conditions based on the content of the programming to be 
offered by any unaffiliated video programming provider.
    (c) Just and reasonable rate presumption. A strong presumption will 
apply that carriage rates are just and reasonable for open video system 
operators where at least one unaffiliated video programming provider, or 
unaffiliated programming providers as a group, occupy capacity equal to 
the lesser of one-third of the system capacity or that occupied by the 
open video system operator and its affiliates, and where any rate 
complained of is no higher than the average of the rates paid by 
unaffiliated programmers receiving carriage from the open video system 
operator.
    (d) Examination of rates. Complaints regarding rates shall be 
limited to video programming providers that have sought carriage on the 
open video system. If a video programming provider files a complaint 
against an open video system operator meeting the above just and 
reasonable rate presumption, the burden of proof will rest with the 
complainant. If a complaint is filed against an open video system 
operator that does not meet the just and reasonable rate presumption, 
the open video system operator will bear the burden of proof to 
demonstrate, using the principles set forth below, that the carriage 
rates subject to the complaint are just and reasonable.
    (e) Determining just and reasonable rates subject to complaints 
pursuant to the imputed rate approach or other market based approach. 
Carriage rates subject to complaint shall be found just

[[Page 645]]

and reasonable if one of the two following tests are met:
    (1) The imputed rate will reflect what the open video system 
operator, or its affiliate, ``pays'' for carriage of its own 
programming. Use of this approach is appropriate in circumstances where 
the pricing is applicable to a new market entrant (the open video system 
operator) that will face competition from an existing incumbent provider 
(the incumbent cable operator), as opposed to circumstances where the 
pricing is used to establish a rate for an essential input service that 
is charged to a competing new entrant by an incumbent provider. With 
respect to new market entrants, an efficient component pricing model 
will produce rates that encourage market entry. If the carriage rate to 
an unaffiliated program provider surpasses what an operator earns from 
carrying its own programming, the rate can be presumed to exceed a just 
and reasonable level. An open video system operator's price to its 
subscribers will be determined by several separate costs components. One 
general category are those costs related to the creative development and 
production of programming. A second category are costs associated with 
packaging various programs for the open video system operator's 
offering. A third category related to the infrastructure or engineering 
costs identified with building and maintaining the open video system. 
Contained in each is a profit allowance attributed to the economic value 
of each component. When an open video system operator provides only 
carriage through its infrastructure, however, the programming and 
packaging flows from the independent program provider, who bears the 
cost. The open video system operator avoids programming and packaging 
costs, including profits. These avoided costs should not be reflected in 
the price charged an independent program provider for carriage. The 
imputed rate also seeks to recognize the loss of subscribers to the open 
video system operator's programming package resulting from carrying 
competing programming.

    Note to paragraph (e)(1): Examples of specific ``avoided costs'' 
include:
    (1) All amounts paid to studios, syndicators, networks or others, 
including but not limited to payments for programming and all related 
rights;
    (2) Packaging, including marketing and other fees;
    (3) Talent fees; and
    (4) A reasonable overhead allowance for affiliated video service 
support.

    (2) An open video system operator can demonstrate that its carriage 
service rates are just and reasonable through other market based 
approaches.

[61 FR 28708, June 5, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 43176, Aug. 21, 1996]

    Effective Date Note: At 61 FR 43176, Aug. 21, 1996, in Sec. 76.1504, 
paragraph (e) was revised. This amendment contains information 
collection and recordkeeping requirements and will not become effective 
until approval has been given by the Office of Management and Budget.


<R05>
Sec. 76.1505  Public, educational and governmental access.

    (a) An open video system operator shall be subject to public, 
educational and governmental access requirements for every cable 
franchise area with which its system overlaps.
    (b) An open video system operator must ensure that all subscribers 
receive any public, educational and governmental access channels within 
the subscribers' franchise area.
    (c) An open video system operator may negotiate with the local cable 
franchising authority of the jurisdiction(s) which the open video system 
serves to establish the open video system operator's obligations with 
respect to public, educational and governmental access channel capacity, 
services, facilities and equipment. These negotiations may include the 
local cable operator if the local franchising authority, the open video 
system operator and the cable operator so desire.
    (d) If an open video system operator and a local franchising 
authority are unable to reach an agreement regarding the open video 
system operator's obligations with respect to public, educational and 
governmental access channel capacity, services, facilities and equipment 
within the local franchising authority's jurisdiction:

[[Page 646]]

    (1) The open video system operator must satisfy the same public, 
educational and governmental access obligations as the local cable 
operator by providing the same amount of channel capacity for public, 
educational and governmental access and by matching the local cable 
operator's annual financial contributions towards public, educational 
and governmental access services, facilities and equipment that are 
actually used for public, educational and governmental access services, 
facilities and equipment. For in-kind contributions (e.g., cameras, 
production studios), the open video system operator may satisfy its 
statutory obligation by negotiating mutually agreeable terms with the 
local cable operator, so that public, educational and governmental 
access services to the community is improved or increased. If such terms 
cannot be agreed upon, the open video system operator must pay the local 
franchising authority the monetary equivalent of the local cable 
operator's depreciated in-kind contribution, or, in the case of 
facilities, the annual amortization value. Any matching contributions 
provided by the open video system operator must be used to fund 
activities arising under Section 611 of the Communications Act.
    (2) The local franchising authority shall impose the same rules and 
procedures on an open video system operator as it imposes on the local 
cable operator with regard to the open video system operator's use of 
channel capacity designated for public, educational and governmental 
access use when such capacity is not being used for such purposes.
    (3) The local cable operator is required to permit the open video 
system operator to connect with its public, educational and governmental 
access channel feeds. The open video system operator and the cable 
operator may decide how to accomplish this connection, taking into 
consideration the exact physical and technical circumstances of the 
cable and open video systems involved. If the cable and open video 
system operator cannot agree on how to accomplish the connection, the 
local franchising authority may decide. The local franchising authority 
may require that the connection occur on government property or on 
public rights of way.
    (4) The costs of connection to the cable operator's public, 
educational and governmental access channel feed shall be borne by the 
open video system operator. Such costs shall be counted towards the open 
video system operator's matching financial contributions set forth in 
paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
    (5) The local franchising authority may not impose public, 
educational and governmental access obligations on the open video system 
operator that would exceed those imposed on the local cable operator.
    (6) Where there is no existing local cable operator, the open video 
system operator must make a reasonable amount of channel capacity 
available for public, educational and governmental use, as well as 
provide reasonable support for services, facilities and equipment 
relating to such public, educational and governmental use. If a 
franchise agreement previously existed in that franchise area, the local 
franchising authority may elect either to impose the previously existing 
public, educational and governmental access obligations or determine the 
open video system operator's public, educational and governmental access 
obligations by comparison to the franchise agreement for the nearest 
operating cable system that has a commitment to provide public, 
educational and governmental access and that serves a franchise area 
with a similar population size. The local franchising authority shall be 
permitted to make a similar election every 15 years thereafter. Absent a 
previous franchise agreement, the open video system operator shall be 
required to provide channel capacity, services, facilities and equipment 
relating to public, educational and governmental access equivalent to 
that prescribed in the franchise agreement(s) for the nearest operating 
cable system with a commitment to provide public, educational and 
governmental access and that serves a franchise area with a similar 
population size.

    Note to paragraph (d)(6): This paragraph shall apply, for example, 
if a cable operator

[[Page 647]]

converts its cable system to an open video system under Sec. 76.1501.

    (7) The open video system operator must adjust its system(s) to 
comply with new public, educational and governmental access obligations 
imposed by a cable franchise renewal; provided, however, that an open 
video system operator will not be required to displace other programmers 
using its open video system to accommodate public, educational and 
governmental access channels. The open video system operator shall 
comply with such public, educational and governmental access obligations 
whenever additional capacity is or becomes available, whether it is due 
to increased channel capacity or decreased demand for channel capacity.
    (8) The open video system operator and/or the local franchising 
authority may file a complaint with the Commission, pursuant to our 
dispute resolution procedures set forth in Sec. 76.1514, if the open 
video system operator and the local franchising authority cannot agree 
as to the application of the Commission's rules regarding the open video 
system operator's public, educational and governmental access 
obligations under paragraph (d) of this section.
    (e) If an open video system operator maintains an institutional 
network, as defined in Section 611(f) of the Communications Act, the 
local franchising authority may require that educational and 
governmental access channels be designated on that institutional network 
to the extent such channels are designated on the institutional network 
of the local cable operator.
    (f) An open video system operator shall not exercise any editorial 
control over any public, educational, or governmental use of channel 
capacity provided pursuant to this subsection, provided, however, that 
any open video system operator may prohibit the use on its system of any 
channel capacity of any public, educational, or governmental facility 
for any programming which contains nudity, obscene material, indecent 
material as defined in Sec. 76.701(g), or material soliciting or 
promoting unlawful conduct. For purposes of this section, ``material 
soliciting or promoting unlawful conduct'' shall mean material that is 
otherwise proscribed by law. An open video system operator may require 
any access user, or access manager or administrator agreeing to assume 
the responsibility of certifying, to certify that its programming does 
not contain any of the materials described above and that reasonable 
efforts will be used to ensure that live programming does not contain 
such material.

    (a) The provisions of Subpart D shall apply to open video systems in 
accordance with the provisions contained in this subpart.
    (b) For the purposes of this Subpart S, television stations are 
significantly viewed when they are viewed in households that do not 
receive television signals from multichannel video programming 
distributors as follows:
    (1) For a full or partial network station--a share of viewing hours 
of at least 3 percent (total week hours), and a net weekly circulation 
of at least 25 percent; and
    (2) For an independent station--a share of viewing hours of at least 
2 percent (total week hours), and a net weekly circulation of at least 5 
percent. See Sec. 76.1506(c).

    Note to paragraph (b): As used in this paragraph, ``share of viewing 
hours'' means the total hours that households that do not receive 
television signals from multichannel video programming distributors 
viewed the subject station during the week, expressed as a percentage of 
the total hours these households viewed all stations during the period, 
and ``net weekly circulation'' means the number of households that do 
not receive television signals from multichannel video programming 
distributors that viewed the station for 5 minutes or more during the 
entire week, expressed as a percentage of the total households that do 
not receive television signals from multichannel video programming 
distributors in the survey area.

to the appropriate video programming providers on its open video system. 
Operators may effect the deletion of signals for which they have 
received deletion notices unless they receive notice within a reasonable 
time from the appropriate programming provider that the rights claimed 
are invalid. The open video system operator shall not delete signals for 
which it has received notice from the programming provider that the 
rights claimed are invalid. An open video system operator shall be 
subject to sanctions for any violation of this subpart. An open video 
system operator may require indemnification as a condition of carriage 
for any sanctions it may incur in reliance on a programmer's claim that 
certain exclusive or non-duplication rights are invalid.
    (n) Exemption from input selector switch rules. Any provision of 
Sec. 76.70 that refers to a ``cable system'' or ``cable systems'' shall 
apply to an open video system or open video systems.
    (o) Special relief and must-carry complaint procedures. The 
procedures set forth in Sec. 76.7 shall apply to special relief and

    Before The Federal Communications Commission, Washington, D.C. 20554
    In the Matter of Complainant
    File No. (To be inserted by the Commission) v. Defendant.

[Insert Subject or Nature of Issue: Unjust or Unreasonable 
Discrimination in Rates, Terms, and Conditions; Discriminatory Denial of 
Carriage]
    Open Video System Complaint
To: The Commission.
    The complainant (here insert full name of complainant and type of 
entity of such complainant):
    1. (Here state the complainant's post office address and telephone 
number).
    2. (Here insert the name, address and telephone number of each 
defendant).
    3. (Here insert fully and clearly the specific act or thing 
complained of, together with such facts as are necessary to give full 
understanding of the matter, including relevant legal and documentary 
support).
    Wherefore, complainant asks (here state specifically the relief 
desired).
 (Date)_________________________________________________________________
 (Name of complainant)__________________________________________________
 _______________________________________________________________________
(Name, address, and telephone number of attorney, if any)

    (4) The complaint must be accompanied by appropriate evidence 
demonstrating that the required notification pursuant to paragraph (c) 
of this section has been made.
    (f) Answer. (1) Any open video system operator upon which a 
complaint is served under this section shall answer within thirty (30) 
days of service of the complaint, unless otherwise directed by the 
Commission.
    (2) The answer shall advise the parties and the Commission fully and 
completely of the nature of any and all defenses, and shall respond 
specifically to all material allegations of the complaint. Collateral or 
immaterial issues shall be avoided in answers and every effort should be 
made to narrow the issues. Any defendant failing to file and serve an 
answer within the time and in the manner prescribed by these rules may 
be deemed in default and an order may be entered against defendant in 
accordance with the allegations contained in the complaint.
    (3) The answer shall state concisely any and all defenses to each 
claim asserted and shall admit or deny the averments on which the 
adverse party relies. If the defendant is without knowledge or 
information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of an averment, 
the defendant shall so state and this has the effect of a denial. When a 
defendant intends in good faith to deny only part of an averment, the 
answer shall specify so much of it as is true and shall deny only the 
remainder. The defendant may make its denials as specific denials of 
designated averments or paragraphs, or may generally deny all the 
averments except such designated averments or paragraphs as the 
defendant expressly admits. When the defendant intends to controvert all 
averments, the defendant may do so by general denial.
    (4) Averments in a complaint are deemed to be admitted when not 
denied in the answer.
    (5) An answer to a discrimination complaint shall state the reasons 
for any differential in prices, terms or conditions between the 
complainant and its competitor, and shall specify the particular 
justification relied upon in support of the differential. Any documents 
or contracts submitted pursuant to this paragraph (f)(5) may be 
protected as proprietary pursuant to paragraph (j) of this section.
    (g) Reply. Within twenty (20) days after service of an answer, the 
complainant may file and serve a reply which shall be responsive to 
matters contained in the answer and shall not contain new matters. 
Failure to reply

[[Page 656]]

will not be deemed an admission of any allegations contained in the 
answer, except with respect to any affirmative defense set forth 
therein. Replies containing information claimed by defendant to be 
proprietary under paragraph (j) of this section shall be submitted to 
the Commission in confidence pursuant to the requirements of Sec. 0.459 
of this chapter and clearly marked ``Not for Public Inspection.'' An 
edited version removing all proprietary data shall be filed with the 
Commission for inclusion in the public file within five (5) days from 
the date the unedited reply is submitted, and shall be served on the 
defendant.
    (h) Motions. Except as provided in this section, or upon a showing 
of extraordinary circumstances, additional motions or pleadings by any 
party will not be accepted.

submit discovery proposals, together with a memorandum in support of the 
discovery requested. Such discovery requests may include answers to 
written interrogatories, document production or depositions. The 
Commission staff will then hold a status conference with the parties, 
pursuant to paragraph (l) of this section, to determine the scope of 
discovery. If the Commission staff determines that extensive discovery 
is required or that depositions are warranted, the staff will advise the 
parties that the proceeding will be referred to an administrative law 
judge in accordance with paragraph (o) of this section.
    (j) Confidentiality of proprietary information. (1) Any materials 
generated or provided by a party in connection with the pre-complaint 
notification procedure required under paragraph (c) of this section and 
in the course of adjudicating a complaint under this provision may be 
designated as proprietary by that party if the party believes in good 
faith that the materials fall within an exemption to disclosure 
contained in the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(b). Any 
party asserting confidentiality for such materials shall so indicate by 
clearly marking each page, or portion thereof, for which a proprietary 
designation is claimed. If a proprietary designation is challenged, the 
party claiming confidentiality will have the burden of demonstrating, by 
a preponderance of the evidence, that the material designated as 
proprietary falls under the standards for nondisclosure enunciated in 
the FOIA.
    (2) Materials marked as proprietary may be disclosed solely to the 
following persons, only for use in prosecuting or defending a party to 
the complaint action, and only to the extent necessary to assist in the 
prosecution or defense of the case:
    (i) Counsel of record representing the parties in the complaint 
action and any support personnel employed by such attorneys;
    (ii) Officers or employees of the opposing party who are named by 
the opposing party as being directly involved in the prosecution or

and conditions of this section.
    (3) The persons designated in paragraph (j)(2) of this section shall 
not disclose information designated as proprietary to any person who is 
not authorized under this section to receive such information, and shall 
not use the information in any activity or function other than the 
prosecution or defense in the case before the Commission. Each 
individual who is provided access to the information by the opposing 
party shall sign a notarized statement affirmatively stating, or shall 
certify under penalty of perjury, that the individual has personally 
reviewed the Commission's rules and understands the limitations they 
impose on the signing party.
    (4) No copies of materials marked proprietary may be made except 
copies to be used by persons designated in paragraph (j)(2) of this 
section. Each party shall maintain a log recording

[[Page 657]]

the number of copies made of all proprietary material and the persons to 
whom the copies have been provided.
    (5) Upon termination of the complaint proceeding, including all 
appeals and petitions, all originals and reproductions of any 
proprietary materials, along with the log recording persons who received 
copies of such materials, shall be provided to the producing party. In 
addition, upon final termination of the complaint proceeding, any notes 
or other work product derived in whole or in part from the proprietary 
materials of an opposing or third party shall be destroyed.
    (k) Other required written submissions. (1) The Commission may, in 
its discretion, require the parties to file briefs summarizing the facts 
and issues presented in the pleadings and other record evidence. These 
briefs shall contain the findings of fact and conclusions of law which 
that party is urging the Commission to adopt, with specific citations to 
the record, and supported by relevant authority and analysis.
    (2) The Commission may require the parties to submit any additional 
information it deems appropriate for a full, fair, and expeditious 
resolution of the proceeding, including copies of all contracts and 
documents reflecting arrangements and understandings alleged to violate 
the requirements set forth in the Communications Act and in this part, 
as well as affidavits and exhibits.
    (3) Any briefs submitted shall be filed concurrently by both the 
complainant and defendant at such time as is designated by the staff. 
Such briefs shall not exceed fifty (50) pages.
    (4) Reply briefs may be submitted by either party within twenty (20) 
days from the date initial briefs are due. Reply briefs shall not exceed 
thirty (30) pages.
    (5) Briefs containing information which is claimed by an opposing or 
third party to be proprietary under paragraph (j) of this section shall 
be submitted to the Commission in confidence pursuant to the 
requirements of Sec. 0.459 of this chapter, and shall be clearly marked 
``Not for Public Inspection.'' An edited version removing all 
proprietary data shall be filed with the Commission for inclusion in the 
public file within five (5) days from the date the unedited version is 
submitted and served on opposing parties.
    (l) Status conference. (1) In any complaint proceeding under this 
part, the Commission staff may in its discretion direct the attorneys 
and/or the parties to appear for a conference to consider:
    (i) Simplification or narrowing of the issues;
    (ii) The necessity for or desirability of amendments to the 
pleadings, additional pleadings, or other evidentiary submissions;
    (iii) Obtaining admissions of fact or stipulations between the 
parties as to any or all of the matters in controversy;
    (iv) Settlement of the matters in controversy by agreement of the 
parties;
    (v) The necessity for and extent of discovery, including objections 
to interrogatories or requests for written documents;

complaint.
    (2) Any party may request that a conference be held at any time 
after the complaint has been filed.
    (3) Conferences will be scheduled by the Commission at such time and 
place as it may designate, to be conducted in person or by telephone 
conference call.
    (4) The failure of any attorney or party, following reasonable 
notice, to appear at a scheduled conference will be deemed a waiver and 
will not preclude the Commission from conferring with those parties or 
counsel present.

complaint proceeding for an adjudicatory hearing before an 
administrative law judge.
    (2) Before designation for hearing, the staff shall notify, either 
orally or in writing, the parties to the proceeding of its intent to so 
designate, and the parties shall be given a period of ten (10) days to

[[Page 659]]

of interlocutory rulings until a decision on the merits has been issued 
by the staff or administrative law judge.
    (2) Rulings listed in this paragraph are reviewable as a matter of 
right. An application for review of such ruling may not be deferred and 
raised as an exception to a decision on the merits:
    (i) If the staff's ruling denies or terminates the right of any 
person to participate as a party to the proceeding, such person, as a 
matter of right, may file an application for review of that ruling:
    (ii) If the staff's ruling requires production of documents or other 
written evidence, over objection based on a claim of privilege, the 
ruling on the claim of privilege is reviewable as a matter of right; 
and/or
    (iii) If the staff's ruling denies a motion to disqualify a staff 
person from participating in the proceeding, the ruling is reviewable as 
a matter of right.
    (r) Expedited review. (1) Any party to a complaint proceeding under 
this part aggrieved by any decision on the merits issued by the staff 
pursuant to delegated authority may file an application for review by 
the Commission in accordance with Section 1.115 of this chapter.

                  Subpart B--Applications and Licenses


<R05>
Sec. 78.11  Permissible service.

    (a) CARS stations are authorized to relay TV broadcast and low power 
TV and related audio signals, the signals of AM and FM broadcast 
stations, signals of instructional TV fixed stations, and cablecasting 
intended for use by one or more cable television systems or other 
eligible systems. LDS stations are authorized to relay television 
broadcast and related audio signals, the signals of AM and FM broadcast 
stations, signals of instructional television fixed stations, 
cablecasting, and such other communications as may be authorized by the 
Commission. Relaying includes retransmission of signals by intermediate 
relay stations in the system. CARS licensees may interconnect their 
facilities with those of other CARS, common carrier, or television 
auxiliary licensees, and may also retransmit the signals of such CARS, 
common carrier, or television auxiliary stations, provided that the 
program material retransmitted meets the requirements of this paragraph.
    (b) The transmitter of a CARS station using FM transmission may be 
multiplexed to provide additional communication channels for the 
transmission of standard and FM broadcast station programs and 
operational communications directly related to the technical operation 
of the relay system (including voice communications, telemetry signals, 
alerting signals, fault reporting signals, and control signals). A CARS 
station will be authorized only where the principal use is the 
transmission of television broadcast program material or cablecasting: 
Provided, however, That this requirement shall not apply to LDS 
stations.
    (c) CARS station licenses may be issued to cable television owners 
or operators or other eligible system owners or operators, and to 
cooperative enterprises owned by cable television owners or operators or 
other eligible system owners or operators. Television translator 
licensees may be members of such cooperative enterprises.
    (d) CARS systems shall supply program material to cable television 
systems, other eligible systems, and translator stations only in the 
following circumstances.
    (1) Where the licensee of the CARS station or system is owner or 
operator of the cable television systems or other eligible systems 
supplied with program material; or
    (2) Where the licensee of the CARS station or system supplies 
program material to cable television systems, other eligible systems, or 
television translator stations either without charge or on a non-profit, 
cost-sharing basis pursuant to a written contract between the parties 
involved which provides that the CARS licensee shall have exclusive 
control over the operation of the CARS stations licensed to him and that 
contributions to capital and operating expenses are accepted

[[Page 664]]

only on a cost-sharing, nonprofit basis, prorated on an equitable basis 
among all cable television systems or other eligible systems being 
supplied with program material in whole or in part. Charges for the 
programming material are not subject to this restriction and cable 
network-entities may fully charge for their services. Records showing 
the cost of the service and its nonprofit, cost-sharing nature shall be 
maintained by the CARS licensee and held available for inspection by the 
Commission.
    (e) The license of a CARS pickup station authorizes the transmission 
of program material, and related communications necessary to the 
accomplishment of such transmission, from the scenes of events occurring 
in places other than a cable television studio or the studio of another 
eligible system, to the studio, headend, or transmitter of its 
associated cable television system or other eligible system, or to such 
other cable television or other eligible systems as are carrying the 
same program material. CARS pickup stations may be used to provide 
temporary CARS studio-to-headend links, studio-to-transmitter links, or 
CARS circuits consistent with this part without further authority of the 
Commission: Provided, however, That prior Commission authority shall be 
obtained if the transmitting antenna to be installed will increase the 
height of any natural formation or manmade structure by more than 6.1 
meters (20 feet) and will be in existence for a period of more than 2 
consecutive days: And provided, further, That if the transmitting 
equipment is to be operated for more than 1 day outside of the area to 
which the CARS station has been licensed, the Commission, the Engineer 
in charge of the district in which the station is licensed to operate, 
and the Engineer in charge of the district in which the equipment will 
be temporarily operated shall be notified at least 1 day prior to such 
operation. If the decision to continue operation for more than 1 day is 
not made until the operation has begun, notice shall be given to the 
Commission and the relevant Engineers in charge within 1 day after such 
decision. In all instances, the Commission and the relevant Engineers in 
charge shall be notified when the transmitting equipment has been 
returned to its licensed area.
    (f) A cable network-entity may use CARS stations to transmit their 
own television program materials to cable television systems, other 
eligible systems, other cable network-entities, broadcast stations, and 
broadcast network-entities: Provided, however, That the bands 1990-2110 
MHz, 6425-6526 MHz and 6875-7125 MHz may be used by cable network-
entities only for CARS pick-up stations.
    (g) The provisions of paragraph (d) of this section and Sec. 78.13 
of this part shall not apply to a licensee who has been licensed in the 
CARS service pursuant to Sec. 21.709 of this chapter, except that 
paragraph (d) of this section shall apply with respect to facilities 
added or cable television and other eligible systems first served after 
February 1, 1966.

to existing or subsequently authorized television STL, television 
intercity relay, or fixed CARS stations. Channels in the 13.150-13.200 
GHz band will be assigned exclusively to television pickup and CARS 
pickup stations on a co-equal basis. A cable television system operator 
will normally be limited in any one area to the assignment of not more 
than three channels for CARS pickup use: Provided, however, That 
additional channels may be assigned upon a satisfactory showing that 
additional channels are necessary and are available.
    (c) An application for a CARS station shall be specific with regard 
to the channel or channels requested. Channels shall be identified by 
the appropriate designations set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) For CARS Fixed stations using FM transmission with an authorized 
bandwidth per channel of 25 MHz, to conserve spectrum applicants are 
encouraged to use alternate A and B channels such that adjacent R.F. 
carriers are spaced 12.5 MHz. As example, a fixed station in the CARS, 
relaying several channels, would use A01, B01, A02, B02, A03, etc.
    (e) For CARS stations using vestigial sideband AM transmissions, 
channels from only the Groups C, D, E or F and those frequencies listed 
in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section normally will be assigned a 
station, although upon adequate showing variations in the use of 
channels in Groups C, D, E or F and those frequencies listed in 
paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section may be authorized on a case-by-case 
basis in order to avoid potential interference or to permit a more 
efficient use. In situations where the number or the arrangement of 
channels available in these groups is not adequate, or in order to avoid 
potential interference, or in order to achieve the required VHF 
channelization arrangement on the cable television system or for 
repeated operations, or for two way transmission, or upon the showing of 
other good cause, the use of channels in the Groups C, D, E or F and 
those frequencies listed in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section may be 
authorized. Applicants are encouraged to apply for adjacent channels 
within each group of channels, except that different channel 
arrangements may be authorized when required to conform to the required 
channelization arrangement at VHF on the cable television system, when 
it is necessary to transmit non-adjacent off-the-air channels or signals 
intended to fill non-adjacent slots in the spectrum, or to avoid 
potential interference, or upon other showing of good cause.
    (f) For vestigial sideband AM transmission, the assigned visual 
carrier frequency for each channel listed in Groups C, D, E or F and 
those frequencies listed in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section shall 
be 1.25 MHz above the lower channel-edge frequency. The center frequency 
for the accompanying FM aural carrier in each channel shall be 4.5 MHz 
above the corresponding visual carrier frequency.
    (g) For CARS stations using double sideband AM transmission or FM 
transmission with authorized bandwidth of no more than 12.5 MHz, Group K 
channels normally will be assigned to a station, although upon adequate 
showing variations in the use of channels in Group K may be authorized 
on a case-by-case basis in order to avoid potential interference or to 
permit a more efficient use.
    (h) For double sideband AM transmission, the assigned carrier 
frequency for each channel listed in Group K shall be 6.25 MHz above the 
lower boundary frequency for each channel, and the sideband frequencies 
corresponding to the carrier frequency of the accompanying FM aural 
signal shall be 4.5 MHz above and below the visual carrier frequency.

[[Page 673]]

    (i) All stations shall employ no more than a 12.5 MHz authorized 
bandwidth per channel except in any one or more of the following 
circumstances:
    (1) The station is a CARS pickup station;
    (2) The transmission path is more than 16.1 km (10 miles) in length;
    (3) The station was authorized or an application was on file 
therefor prior to July 26, 1973.
    (4) Other good cause has been shown that use of a bandwidth of 12.5 
MHz or less per channel would be inefficient, impractical, or otherwise 
contrary to the public interest.
    (j) Should any conflict arise among applications for stations in 
this band, priority will be based on the filing date of an application 
completed in accordance with the instructions thereon.
    (k) Applicants for Group K channels shall apply for adjacent 
channels and the requested channels shall overlap the least possible 
number of Group A channels, except that different channel arrangements 
may be authorized upon an adequate showing that the foregoing 
arrangement cannot be used or would be contrary to the public interest, 
or in order to avoid potential interference or to permit a more 
efficient use.
    (l) The band 13.15-13.20 GHz is reserved exclusively for the 
assignment of CARS Pickup and Television Pickup stations on a co-equal 
basis within a 50 km radius of each of the 100 television markets 
delineated in Sec. 76.51. Fixed Television Auxiliary stations licensed 
pursuant to applications accepted for filing before September 1, 1979, 
may continue operation on channels in the 13.15-13.20 GHz band, subject 
to periodic license renewals.

Sec. 78.19  Interference.

    (a) Applications for CARS stations shall endeavor to select an 
assignable frequency or frequencies which will be least likely to result 
in interference to other licensees in the same area since the FCC itself 
does not undertake frequency coordination.
    (b) Applicants for CARS stations shall take full advantage of all 
known techniques, such as the geometric arrangement of transmitters and 
receivers, the use of minimum power required to provide the needed 
service, and the use of highly directive transmitting and receiving 
antenna systems, to prevent interference to the reception of television 
STL, television intercity relay, and other CARS stations.
    (c) Radio Astronomy and Radio Research Installations. In order to 
minimize harmful interference at the National Radio Astronomy 
Observatory site located at Green Bank, Pocahontas County, W. Va., and 
at the Naval Radio Research Observatory at Sugar Grove, Pendleton 
County, W.Va., an applicant for authority to construct a CARS station, 
except a CARS pickup station, or for authority to make changes in the 
frequency, power, antenna height, or antenna directivity of an existing 
station within the area bounded by 39 deg.15' N. on the north, 
78 deg.30' W. on the east, 37 deg.30' N. on the south and 80 deg.30' W. 
on the west shall, at the time of filing such application with the 
Commission, simultaneously notify the Director, National Radio Astronomy 
Observatory, Post Office Box No. 2, Green Bank, WV 24944, in writing, of 
the technical particulars of the proposed station. Such notification 
shall include the geographical coordinates of the antenna, antenna 
height, antenna directivity if any, proposed frequency, type of 
emission, and power. In addition, the applicant shall indicate in his 
application to the Commission the date notification was made to the 
Observatory. After receipt of such application, the Commission will 
allow a period of 20 days for comments or objections in response to the 
notifications indicated. If an objection to the proposed operation is 
received during the 20-day period from the National Radio Astronomy 
Observatory for itself or on behalf of the Naval Radio Research 
Observatory, the Commission will consider all aspects of the problem and 
take whatever action is deemed appropriate.
    (d) Protection for Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone, Boulder 
County, Colorado: Applicants for a station authorization to operate in 
the vicinity

[[Page 674]]

of Boulder County, Colorado under this part are advised to give due 
consideration, prior to filing applications, to the need to protect the 
Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone from harmful interference. These are 
the research laboratories of the Department of Commerce, Boulder County, 
Colorado. To prevent degradation of the present ambient radio signal 
level at the site, the Department of Commerce seeks to ensure that the 
field strengths of any radiated signals (excluding reflected signals) 
received on this 1800 acre site (in the vicinity of coordinates 
40 deg.07'50''N Latitude, 105 deg.14'40''W Longitude) resulting from new 
assignments (other than mobile stations) or from the modification or 
relocation of existing facilities do not exceed the following values:

\1\ Equivalent values of power flux density are caculated assuming free 
  space characteristic impedance of 376.7=120<greek-p> ohms.            
\2\ Space stations shall conform to the power flux density limits at the
  earth's surface specified in appropriate parts of the FCC rules, but  
  in no case should exceed the above levels in any 4 kHz band for all   
  angles of arrival.                                                    

    (1) Advance consultation is recomended particularly for those 
applicants who have no reliable data which indicates whether the field 
strength or power flux density figures in the above table would be 
exceeded by their proposed radio facilities (except mobile stations). In 
such instances, the following is a suggested guide for determining 
whether coordination is recommended:
    (i) All stations within 2.4 km (1.5 statute miles);
    (ii) Stations within 4.8 km (3 statute miles) with 50 watts or more 
effective radiated power (ERP) in the primary plane of polarization in 
the azimuthal direction of the Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone;
    (iii) Stations within 16 km (10 statute miles) with 1 kW or more ERP 
in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of the 
Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone;
    (iv) Stations within 80 km (50 statute miles) with 25 kW or more ERP 
in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of the 
Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone.
    (2) Applicants concerned are urged to communicate with the Radio 
Frequency Management Coordinator, Department of Commerce, Research 
Support Services, NOAA R/E5X2, Boulder Laboratories, Boulder, CO 80303; 
telephone (303) 497-6548, in advance of filing their applications with 
the Commission.
    (3) The Commission will not screen applications to determine whether 
advance consultation has taken place. However, applicants are advised 
that such consultation can avoid objections from the Department of 
Commerce or proceedings to modify any authorization which may be granted 
which, in fact, delivers a signal at the site in excess of the field 
strength specified herein.
    (e) Protection for Federal Communications Commission monitoring 
stations:
    (1) Applicants in the vicinity of an FCC monitoring station for a 
radio station authorization to operate new transmitting facilities or 
changed transmitting facilities which would increase the field strength 
produced over the monitoring station over that previously authorized are 
advised to give consideration, prior to filing applications, to the 
possible need to protect the FCC stations from harmful interference. 
Geographical coordinates of the facilities which require protection are 
listed in Sec. 0.121(c) of the Commission's Rules. Applications for 
stations (except mobile stations) which will produce on any frequency a 
direct wave fundamental field strength of greater than 10 mV/m in the 
authorized bandwidth of service (-65.8 dBW/m<SUP>2</SUP> power flux 
density assuming a free space characteristic impedance of 120 ohms) at 
the referenced coordinates, may be examined to determine extent of 
possible interference. Depending on the theoretical field strength value 
and existing root-sum-square or other ambient radio field signal levels 
at the indicated coordinates, a clause protecting the monitoring station 
may be added to the station authorization.

[[Page 675]]

    (2) In the event that calculated value of expected field exceeds 10 
mV/m (-65.8 dBW/m<SUP>2</SUP>) at the reference coordinates, or if there 
is any question whether field strength levels might exceed the threshold 
value, advance consultation with the FCC to discuss any protection 
necessary should be considered. Prospective applicants may communicate 
with: Chief, Compliance and Information Bureau, Federal Communications 
Commission, Washington, D.C. 20554, Telephone (202) 632-6980.
    (3) Advance consultation is suggested particularly for those 
applicants who have no reliable data which indicates whether the field 
strength or power flux density figure indicated would be exceeded by 
their proposed radio facilities (except mobile stations). In such 
instances, the following is a suggested guide for determining whether an 
applicant should coordinate:
    (i) All stations within 2.4 kilometers (1.5 statute miles);
    (ii) Stations within 4.8 kilometers (3 statute miles) with 50 watts 
or more average effective radiated power (ERP) in the primary plane of 
polarization in the azimuthal direction of the Monitoring Stations.
    (iii) Stations within 16 kilometers (10 statute miles) with 1 kW or 
more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal 
direction of the Monitoring Station;
    (iv) Stations within 80 kilometers (50 statute miles) with 25 kW or 
more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal 
direction of the Monitoring Station;
    (4) Advance coordination for stations operating above 1000 MHz is 
recommended only where the proposed station is in the vicinity of a 
monitoring station designated as a satellite monitoring facility in 
section 0.121(c) of the Commission's Rules and also meets the criteria 
outlined in paragraphs (f) (2) and (3) of this section.
    (5) The Commission will not screen applications to determine whether 
advance consultation has taken place. However, applicants are advised 
that such consultation can avoid objections from the Federal 
Communications Commission or modification of any authorization which 
will cause harmful interference.

Sec. 78.20  Acceptance of applications; public notice.

    (a) Applications which are tendered for filing in Washington, DC, 
are dated upon receipt and then forwarded to the Mass Media Bureau where 
an administrative examination is made to ascertain whether the 
applications are complete. Applications found to be complete or 
substantially complete, are accepted for filing and are given a file 
number. In case of minor defects as to completeness, the applicant will 
be required to supply the missing information. Applications which are 
not substantially complete will be returned to the applicant. 
Applications requiring fees as set forth at Part 1, Subpart G of this 
chapter must be filed in accordance with Sec. 0.401(b) of the rules.
    (b) Acceptance of an application for filing means only that it has 
been the subject of a preliminary review by the Commission's 
administrative staff as to completeness. Applications which are 
determined to be clearly not in accordance with the Commission's rules 
or other requirements, unless accompanied by an appropriate request for 
waiver, will be considered defective and will not be accepted for 
filing, or if inadvertently accepted for filing, will be dismissed. 
Requests for waiver shall show the nature of the waiver or exception 
desired and shall set forth the reasons in support thereof.

Sec. 78.22  Objections to applications.

    (a) Any party in interest may file a petition to deny any 
application (whether as originally filed or as amended) no later than 
thirty (30) days after issuance of a public notice of the acceptance for 
filing of any such application or amendment thereto. Petitions to deny 
shall contain specific allegations of fact sufficient to show that the 
petitioner is a party in interest and that a grant of the application 
would be prima facie inconsistent with the public interest, convenience, 
and necessity. Such allegations of fact shall, except for those of which 
official notice may be taken, be supported by affidavit of a person or 
persons with personal knowledge thereof.
    (b) The applicant may file an opposition to any petition to deny, 
and the petitioner may file a reply to such opposition (see Sec. 1.45 of 
this chapter), in which allegations of fact or denials thereof shall be 
supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge 
thereof.
    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, 
before Commission action on any application for an instrument of 
authorization, any person may file informal objections to the grant. 
Such objections may be submitted in letter form (without extra copies) 
and shall be signed by the objector. The limitation on pleadings and 
time for filing pleadings provided for in Sec. 1.45 of this chapter 
shall not be applicable to any objections duly filed pursuant to this 
paragraph.

<R05>
Sec. 78.29  License period.

    Licenses for CARS stations will be issued for a period not to exceed 
five (5) years. On and after February 1, 1966, licenses for CARS 
stations ordinarily will be issued for a period expiring on February 1, 
1971, and, when regularly renewed, at 5-year intervals thereafter. When 
a license is granted subsequent to the last renewal date for CARS 
stations, the license will be issued only for the unexpired period of 
the current license term of such stations. The license renewal date 
applicable to CARS stations may be varied as necessary to permit the 
orderly processing of renewal applications, and individual station 
licenses may be granted or renwed for a shorter period of time than that 
generally prescribed for CARS stations, if the Commission finds that the 
public interest, convenience, and necessity would be served by such 
action.


<R05>
Sec. 78.31  Temporary extension of license.

    Where there is pending before the Commission any application, 
investigation, or proceeding which, after hearing, might lead to or make 
necessary the modification of, revocation of or the refusal to renew an 
existing cable television relay station license, the Commission will 
grant a temporary extension of such license: Provided, however, That no 
such temporary extension shall be construed as a finding by the 
Commission that the operation of any CARS station thereunder will serve 
the public interest, convenience, and necessity beyond the express terms 
of such temporary extension of license: And provided, further, That such 
temporary extension of license will in nowise affect or limit the action 
of the Commission with respect to any pending application or proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 78.33  Special temporary authority.

    (a) Notwithstanding the requirements of Secs. 78.15 and 78.20, in 
circumstances requiring immediate or temporary use of facilities, a 
request may be made for special temporary authority to install and 
operate new equipment or to operate licensed equipment in a manner 
different from that authorized in a station license. Any such request 
may be in letter form, and shall be submitted in duplicate: Provided, 
however, That in cases of emergency involving danger to life or property 
or due to damage to equipment, such request may be made by telephone or 
telegraph with the understanding that a written request shall be 
submitted within ten (10) days thereafter.
    (b) Special temporary authority may also be requested to conduct a 
field survey to determine necessary data in connection with the 
preparation of a formal application for installation of a radio system 
under this part. Such authority may be granted to equipment suppliers 
and others who are not operators of cable television systems or other 
eligible systems, as well as to cable operators or other eligible system 
operators, to conduct equipment, program, service, and path tests.
    (c) Any request for special temporary authority shall be clear and 
complete within itself as to the authority requested. In addition, such 
requests shall contain the following information:
    (1) Name, address, and citizenship of applicant;
    (2) Grounds for special action, including a description of any 
emergency or damage to equipment;
    (3) Type of operation to be conducted;
    (4) Purpose of operation;
    (5) Time and date of proposed operation;
    (6) Class of station and nature of service;
    (7) Location of station;
    (8) Equipment to be used, specifying manufacturer, model number, and 
number of units;
    (9) Frequency or frequencies desired, consistent with Sec. 78.18: 
Provided, however, That in the case of events of widespread interest and 
importance that cannot be transmitted successfully on these frequencies, 
frequencies assigned

[[Page 678]]

to other services may be requested on a showing that operation thereon 
will not cause interference to established stations: And provided, 
further, That in no case will a cable television relay service operation 
be authorized on frequencies employed for the safety of life and 
property;
    (10) Plate power input to final radio frequency stage;
    (11) Type of emission;
    (12) Description of antenna to be used, including height. In the 
event that the proposed antenna installations will increase the height 
of any natural formation, or existing manmade structure, by more than 
6.1 meters (20 feet), a vertical plan sketch showing the height of the 
structures proposed to be erected, the height above ground of any 
existing structure, the elevation of the site above mean sea level, and 
the geographic coordinates of the proposed sites shall be submitted with 
the application.
    (d) Except in emergencies involving safety of life or property or 
due to damage to equipment, a request for special temporary authority 
shall be filed at least ten (10) days prior to the date of proposed 
operation, or shall be accompanied by a statement of reasons for the 
delay in submitting such request.
    (e) If the Commission finds that special temporary authority is in 
the public interest, it may grant such authority for a period not 
exceeding ninety (90) days, and, on a like finding, may extend such 
authority for one additional period not to exceed ninety (90) days.

Sec. 78.35  Assignment or transfer of control.

    (a) No assignment of the license of a cable television relay station 
or transfer of control of a CARS licensee shall occur without prior FCC 
authorization.
    (b) If an assignment or transfer of control does not involve a 
substantial change of interests, the provisions of Secs. 78.20(c) and 
78.22, concerning public notice and objections, shall be waived.
    (c) Licensees of CARS stations are not required to submit 
applications for assignment or transfer of control or otherwise notify 
the FCC in cases where the change in ownership does not affect the 
identity or controlling interest of the licensee.

Sec. 78.36  Frequency coordination.

    (a) 12.7-13.25 GHz. Coordination of fixed and mobile assignments 
will be in accordance with the procedures set forth below.
    (1) Before filing an application for new or modified facilities 
under this part the applicant must perform a frequency engineering 
analysis to ensure that the proposed facilities will not cause 
interference to existing or previously applied for stations in this band 
of a magnitude greater than that specified below.
    (2) The general criteria for determining allowable adjacent or co-
channel interference protection to be afforded, regardless of system 
length or type of modulation, multiplexing or frequency band shall be 
such that the interfering signal shall not produce more than 1.0 dB 
degradation of the practical threshold of the protected receiver. The 
degradation is determined by calculating the ratio in dB between the 
desired carrier signal and undesired interfering signal (C/I ratio) 
appearing at the input to the receiver under investigation (the victim 
receiver). The development of the C/I ratios from the criteria for 
maximum allowable interference level per exposure and the methods used 
to perform path calculations shall follow generally acceptable good 
engineering practices. Procedures as may be developed by the Electronics 
Industries Association (EIA), the Institute of Electrical and 
Electronics Engineers, Inc. (IEEE), the American National Standards 
Institute (ANSI) or any other recognized authority will be acceptable to 
the Commission.
    (3) Where the development of the carrier to interference ratio (C/I) 
is not covered by generally acceptable procedures or where the applicant 
does not wish to develop the carrier to interference ratio, the 
applicant shall employ the following C/I protection ratios:

[[Page 679]]

    (i) Co-channel interference: For both sideband and carrier-beat, 
(applicable to all bands) the previously authorized system shall be 
afforded a carrier to interfering signal protection ratio of at least 90 
dB.
    (ii) Adjacent channel interference: The existing or previously 
authorized system shall be afforded a carrier to interfering signal 
protection ratio of at least 56 dB.
    (b) 6425-6525 MHz and 17.7-19.7 GHz. Coordination of fixed and 
mobile assignments will be in accordances with the procedure established 
in Sec. 21.100(d), except that the prior coordination process for mobile 
(temporary fixed) assignments may be completed orally and the period 
allowed for response to a coordination notification may be less than 30 
days if the parties agree.

    (5) Pickup stations are not subject to the performance standards 
herein stated. The provisions of this paragraph are effective for all 
new applications accepted for filing after October 1, 1981.
    (b) Any fixed station licensed pursuant to an application accepted 
for filing prior to October 1, 1981, may continue to use its existing 
antenna system, subject to periodic renewal until April 1, 1992, After 
April 1, 1992, all licensees are to use antenna systems in conformance 
with the standards of this section. TV auxiliary broadcast stations are 
considered to be located in an area subject to frequency congestion and 
must employ a Category A antenna when:
    (1) A showing by an applicant of a new CAR service or TV auxiliary 
broadcast, which shares the 12.7-13.20 GHz band with CARS, indicates 
that use of a category B antenna limits a proposed project because of 
interference, and
    (2) That use of a category A antenna will remedy the interference 
thus allowing the project to be realized.
    (c) As an exception to the provisions of this section, the FCC may 
approve requests for use of periscope antenna systems where a persuasive 
showing is made that no frequency conflicts exist in the area of 
proposed use. Such approvals shall be conditioned to require conversion 
to a standard antenna as required in paragraph (a) of this section when 
an applicant of a new TV auxiliary broadcast or Cable Television Relay 
station indicates that the use of the existing antenna system will cause 
interference and the use of a category A or B antenna will remedy the 
interference.
    (d) As a further exception to the provision of paragraph (a) of this 
section the Commission may approve antenna

    These limitations are necessary to minimize the probability of 
harmful interference to reception in the bands 2655-2690 MHz, 5850-7075 
MHz, and 12.7-13.25 GHz on board geostationary space stations in the 
fixed-satellite service (part 25). Facilities authorized prior to July 
1, 1978 which exceed the power levels in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section are permitted to operate indefinitely, provided that the 
operation of such facilities does not result in harmful interference to 
reception in these band on board geostationary space stations.
    (a) 2655 to 2690 MHz and 5850 to 7075 MHz. No directional 
transmitting antenna utilized by a fixed station operating in these 
bands shall be aimed within 2 degrees of the geostationary-satellite 
orbit, taking into account atmospheric refraction. However, exception 
may be made in unusual circumstances upon a showing that there is no 
reasonable alternative to the transmission path proposed. If there is no 
evidence that such exception would cause possible harmful interference 
to an authorized satellite system, said transmission path may be 
authorized on waiver basis where the maximum value of the equivalent 
isotropically radiated power (EIRP) does not exceed:
    (1) +47 dBW for any antenna beam directed within 0.5 degrees of the 
stationary satellite orbit or
    (2) +47 to +55 dBW, on a linear decibel scale (8 dB per degree) for 
any antenna beam directed between 0.5 degrees and 1.5 degrees of the 
stationary orbit.
    (b) 12.7-13.25 GHz. No directional transmitting antenna utilized by 
a fixed station operating in this band shall be aimed within 1.5 degrees 
of the geostationary-satellite orbit, taking into account atmospheric 
refraction. However, exception may be made in unusual circumstances upon 
a showing that there is no reasonable alternative to the transmission 
path proposed. If there is no evidence that such exception would cause 
possible harmful interference to an authorized satellite system, said 
transmission path may be authorized on waiver basis where the maximum 
value of the equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) does not 
exceed +45 dBW for any antenna beam directed within 1.5 degrees of the 
stationary satellite orbit.

designed to be used exclusively with fixed

[[Page 687]]

stations shall be approved under notification (see Sec. 2.904(d) of this 
chapter). Transmitters designed for use in the 31.0 to 31.3 GHz band 
shall be authorized under the notification procedure.
    (1) All transmitters first licensed or marketed shall comply with 
technical standards of this subpart. This paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section is effective October 1, 1981.
    (2) Neither type acceptance nor notification is required for the 
following transmitters:
    (i) Those which have an output power not greater than 250 mW and 
which are used in a CARS pickup station operating in the 12.7-13.2 GHz 
band; and
    (ii) Those used under a developmental authorization.
    (c) Cable television relay station transmitting equipment authorized 
to be used pursuant to an application accepted for filing prior to 
October 1, 1981, may continue to be used, provided, that if operation of 
such equipment causes harmful interference due to its failure to comply 
with the technical standards set forth in this subpart the Commission 
may, at its discretion, require the licensee to take such corrective 
action as is necessary to eliminate the interference.
    (d) The installation of a CARS station shall be made by or under the 
immediate supervision of a qualified engineer. Any tests or adjustments 
requiring the radiation of signals and which could result in improper 
operation shall be conducted by or under the immediate supervision of a 
person with required knowledge and skill to perform such tasks.
    (e) Simple repairs such as the replacement of tubes, fuses, or other 
plug-in components which require no particular skill may be made by an 
unskilled person. Repairs requiring replacement of attached components 
or the adjustment of critical circuits or corroborative measurements 
shall be made only by a person with required knowledge and skill to 
perform such tasks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) For paths shorter than those specified in the Table, the EIRP 
shall not exceed the value derived from the following equation.

EIRP=30-20 log [A/B], dBW

Where:

EIRP=equivalent isotropic radiated power in dBW.
A=Minimum path length from the Table for the frequency band in 
          kilometers.
B=The actual path length in kilometers.

    (c) Upon an appropriate technical showing, applicants and licensees 
unable to meet the minimum path length requirement may be granted an 
exception to these requirements.

    Note: Links authorized prior to April 1, 1987, are excluded from 
this requirement, except that, effective April 1, 1992, the Commission 
will require compliance with the criteria where an existing link would 
otherwise preclude establishment of a new link.

Sec. 78.113  Frequency monitors and measurements.

    (a) The licensee of each CARS station shall employ a suitable 
procedure to determine that the carrier frequency of each transmitter is 
maintained within the tolerance prescribed in Sec. 78.111 at all times. 
The determination shall be made, and the results thereof entered in the 
station records: when a transmitter is initially installed; when any 
change is made in a transmitter which may affect the carrier frequency 
or the stability thereof; or in any case at intervals not exceeding one 
year.
    (b) The choice of apparatus to measure the operating frequency is 
left to the discretion of the licensee. However, failure of the 
apparatus to detect departures of the operating frequency in excess of 
the prescribed tolerance will not be deemed an acceptable excuse for the 
violation.

Sec. 79.1  Closed captioning of video programming.

    (a) Definitions. For purposes of this section the following 
definitions shall apply:
    (1) Video programming. Programming provided by, or generally 
considered comparable to programming provided by, a television broadcast 
station that is distributed and exhibited for residential use. Video 
programming includes advertisements of more than five minutes in 
duration but does not include advertisements of five minutes' duration 
or less.
    (2) Video programming distributor. Any television broadcast station 
licensed by the Commission and any multichannel video programming 
distributor as defined in Sec. 76.1000(e) of this chapter, and any other 
distributor of video programming for residential reception that delivers 
such programming directly to the home and is subject to the

[[Page 690]]

jurisdiction of the Commission. An entity contracting for program 
distribution over a video programming distributor that is itself exempt 
from captioning that programming pursuant to paragraph (e)(9) of this 
section shall itself be treated as a video programming distributor for 
purposes of this section To the extent such video programming is not 
otherwise exempt from captioning, the entity that contracts for its 
distribution shall be required to comply with the closed captioning 
requirements of this section.
    (3) Video programming provider. Any video programming distributor 
and any other entity that provides video programming that is intended 
for distribution to residential households including, but not limited to 
broadcast or nonbroadcast television network and the owners of such 
programming.
    (4) Closed captioning. The visual display of the audio portion of 
video programming contained in line 21 of the vertical blanking interval 
(VBI) pursuant to the technical specifications set forth in Sec. 15.119 
of this chapter or the equivalent thereof.
    (5) New programming. Video programming that is first published or 
exhibited on or after January 1, 1998.
    (6) Pre-rule programming. (i) Video programming that was first 
published or exhibited before January 1, 1998.
    (ii) Video programming first published or exhibited for display on 
television receivers equipped for display of digital transmissions or 
formatted for such transmission and exhibition prior to the date on 
which such television receivers must, by Commission rule, be equipped 
with built-in decoder circuitry designed to display closed-captioned 
digital television transmissions.
    (7) Nonexempt programming. Video programming that is not exempt 
under paragraph (d) of this section and, accordingly, is subject to 
closed captioning requirements set forth in this section.
    (b) Requirements for closed captioning of video programming--(1) 
Requirements for new programming. Video programming distributors must 
provide closed captioning for nonexempt video programming that is being 
distributed and exhibited on each channel during each calendar quarter 
in accordance with the following requirements:
    (i) Between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2001, video 
programming distributors shall provide at least 450 hours of captioned 
video programming, or if the video programming distributor provides less 
than 450 hours of new nonexempt video programming, then 95 percent of 
its new nonexempt video programming must be provided with captions;
    (ii) Between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2003, video 
programming distributors shall provide at least 900 hours of captioned 
video programming, or if the video programming distributor provides less 
than 900 hours of new nonexempt video programming, then 95 percent of 
its new nonexempt video programming must be provided with captions;
    (iii) Between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2005, video 
programming distributors shall provide at least an average of 1350 hours 
of captioned video programming, or if the video programming distributor 
provides less than 1350 hours of new nonexempt video programming, then 
95 percent of its new nonexempt video programming must be provided with 
captions; and
    (iv) As of January 1, 2006, and thereafter, 95 percent of the 
programming distributor's new nonexempt video programming must be 
provided with captions.
    (2) Requirements for pre-rule programming. As of January 1, 2008, 
and thereafter, 75 percent of the programming distributor's pre-rule 
nonexempt video programming being distributed and exhibited on each 
channel during each calendar quarter must be provided with closed 
captioning.
    (3) Video programming distributors shall continue to provide 
captioned video programming at substantially the same level as the 
average level of captioning that they provided during the first 6 months 
of 1997 even if that amount of captioning exceeds the requirements 
otherwise set forth in this section.
    (c) Obligation to pass through captions of already captioned 
programs. All video programming distributors shall deliver all 
programming received from the video programming owner or other

[[Page 691]]

origination source containing closed captioning to receiving television 
households with the original closed captioning data intact in a format 
that can be recovered and displayed by decoders meeting the standards of 
Sec. 15.119 of this chapter unless such programming is recaptioned or 
the captions are reformatted by the programming distributor.
    (d) Exempt programs and providers. For purposes of determining 
compliance with this section, any video programming or video programming 
provider that meets one or more of the following criteria shall be 
exempt to the extent specified in this paragraph.
    (1) Programming subject to contractual captioning restrictions. 
Video programming that is subject to a contract in effect on or before 
February 8, 1996, but not any extension or renewal of such contract, for 
which an obligation to provide closed captioning would constitute a 
breach of contract.
    (2) Video programming or video programming provider for which the 
captioning requirement has been waived. Any video programming or video 
programming provider for which the Commission has determined that a 
requirement for closed captioning imposes an undue burden on the basis 
of a petition for exemption filed in accordance with the procedures 
specified in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (3) Non-english language programming. All programming for which the 
audio is in a language other than English, except that scripted 
programming that can be captioned using the ``electronic news room'' 
technique is not exempt.
    (4) Primarily textual programming. Video programming or portions of 
video programming for which the content of the soundtrack is displayed 
visually through text or graphics (e.g., program schedule channels or 
community bulletin boards).
    (5) Programming distributed in the late night hours. Programming 
that is being distributed to residential households between 2 a.m. and 6 
a.m. local time. Video programming distributors providing a channel that 
consists of a service that is distributed and exhibited for viewing in 
more than a single time zone shall be exempt from closed captioning that 
service for any continuous 4 hour time period they may select, 
commencing not earlier than 12 a.m. local time and ending not later than 
7 a.m. local time in any location where that service is intended for 
viewing. This exemption is to be determined based on the primary 
reception locations and remains applicable even if the transmission is 
accessible and distributed or exhibited in other time zones on a 
secondary basis. Video programming distributors providing service 
outside of the 48 contiguous states may treat as exempt programming that 
is exempt under this paragraph when distributed in the contiguous 
states.
    (6) Interstitials, promotional announcements and public service 
announcements. Interstitial material, promotional announcements, and 
public service announcements that are 10 minutes or less in duration.
    (7) ITFS programming. Video programming produced for the 
instructional television fixed service (ITFS).
    (8) Locally produced and distributed non-news programming with 
limited repeat value. Programming that is locally produced by the video 
programming distributor, has no repeat value, is of local public 
interest, is not news programming, and for which the ``electronic news 
room'' technique of captioning is unavailable.
    (9) Programming on new networks. Programming on a video programming 
network for the first four years after it begins operation.
    (10) Primarily non-vocal musical programming. Programming that 
consists primarily of non-vocal music.
    (11) Captioning expense in excess of 2 percent of gross revenues. No 
video programming provider shall be required to expend any money to 
caption any video programming if such expenditure would exceed 2 percent 
of the gross revenues received from that channel during the previous 
calendar year.
    (12) Channels producing revenues of under $3,000,000. No video 
programming provider shall be required to expend any money to caption 
any channel of video programming producing annual gross revenues of less 
than $3,000,000 during the previous calendar year other than the 
obligation to pass through video programming already

[[Page 692]]

captioned when received pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.
    (e) Responsibility for and determination of compliance. (1) 
Compliance shall be calculated on a per channel, calendar quarter basis;
    (2) Open captioning or subtitles in the language of the target 
audience may be used in lieu of closed captioning;
    (3) Live programming or repeats of programming originally 
transmitted live that are captioned using the so-called ``electronic 
news room'' technique will be considered captioned. The live portions of 
noncommercial broadcasters' fundraising activities that use automated 
software to create a continuous captioned message will be considered 
captioned;
    (4) Compliance will be required with respect to the type of video 
programming generally distributed to residential households. Programming 
produced solely for closed circuit or private distribution is not 
covered by these rules;
    (5) Video programming that is exempt pursuant to paragraph (d) of 
this section that contains captions, except video programming exempt 
pursuant to paragraph (d)(5) of this section (late night hours 
exemption), can count towards the compliance with the requirements for 
new programming prior to January 1, 2006. Video programming that is 
exempt pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section that contains captions, 
except that video programming exempt pursuant to paragraph (d)(5) of 
this section (late night hours exemption), can count towards compliance 
with the requirements for pre-rule programming.
    (6) For purposes of paragraph (d)(11) of this section, captioning 
expenses include direct expenditures for captioning as well as allowable 
costs specifically allocated by a programming supplier through the price 
of the video programming to that video programming provider. To be an 
allowable allocated cost, a programming supplier may not allocate more 
than 100 percent of the costs of captioning to individual video 
programming providers. A programming supplier may allocate the 
captioning costs only once and may use any commercially reasonable 
allocation method;
    (7) For purposes of paragraphs (d)(11) and (d)(12) of this section, 
annual gross revenues shall be calculated for each channel individually 
based on revenues received in the preceding calendar year from all 
sources related to the programming on that channel. Revenue for channels 
shared between network and local programming shall be separately 
calculated for network and for non-network programming, with neither the 
network nor the local video programming provider being required to spend 
more than 2 percent of its revenues for captioning. Thus, for example, 
compliance with respect to a network service distributed by a 
multichannel video service distributor, such as a cable operator, would 
be calculated based on the revenues received by the network itself (as 
would the related captioning expenditure). For local service providers 
such as broadcasters, advertising revenues from station-controlled 
inventory would be included. For cable operators providing local 
origination programming, the annual gross revenues received for each 
channel will be used to determine compliance. Evidence of compliance 
could include certification from the network supplier that the 
requirements of the test had been met. Multichannel video programming 
distributors, in calculating non-network revenues for a channel offered 
to subscribers as part of a multichannel package or tier, will not 
include a pro rata share of subscriber revenues, but will include all 
other revenues from the channel, including advertising and ancillary 
revenues. Revenues for channels supported by direct sales of products 
will include only the revenues from the product sales activity (e.g., 
sales commissions) and not the revenues from the actual products offered 
to subscribers. Evidence of compliance could include certification from 
the network supplier that the requirements of this test have been met.
    (8) If two or more networks (or sources of programming) share a 
single channel, that channel shall be considered to be in compliance if 
each of the sources of video programming are in compliance where they 
are carried on a full time basis;

[[Page 693]]

    (9) Video programming distributors shall not be required to provide 
closed captioning for video programming that is by law not subject to 
their editorial control, including but not limited to the signals of 
television broadcast stations distributed pursuant to sections 614 and 
615 of the Communications Act or pursuant to the compulsory copyright 
licensing provisions of sections 111 and 119 of the Copyright Act (Title 
17 U.S.C. 111 and 119); programming involving candidates for public 
office covered by sections 315 and 312 of the Communications Act and 
associated policies; commercial leased access, public access, 
governmental and educational access programming carried pursuant to 
sections 611 and 612 of the Communications Act; video programming 
distributed by direct broadcast satellite (DBS) services in compliance 
with the noncommercial programming requirement pursuant to section 
335(b)(3) of the Communications Act to the extent such video programming 
is exempt from the editorial control of the video programming provider; 
and video programming distributed by a common carrier or that is 
distributed on an open video system pursuant to section 653 of the 
Communications Act by an entity other than the open video system 
operator. To the extent such video programming is not otherwise exempt 
from captioning, the entity that contracts for its distribution shall be 
required to comply with the closed captioning requirements of this 
section.
    (f) Procedures for exemptions based on undue burden. (1) A video 
programming provider, video programming producer or video programming 
owner may petition the Commission for a full or partial exemption from 
the closed captioning requirements. Exemptions may be granted, in whole 
or in part, for a channel of video programming, a category or type of 
video programming, an individual video service, a specific video program 
or a video programming provider upon a finding that the closed 
captioning requirements will result in an undue burden.
    (2) A petition for an exemption must be supported by sufficient 
evidence to demonstrate that compliance with the requirements to closed 
caption video programming would cause an undue burden. The term ``undue 
burden'' means significant difficulty or expense. Factors to be 
considered when determining whether the requirements for closed 
captioning impose an undue burden include:
    (i) The nature and cost of the closed captions for the programming;
    (ii) The impact on the operation of the provider or program owner;
    (iii) The financial resources of the provider or program owner; and
    (iv) The type of operations of the provider or program owner.
    (3) In addition to these factors, the petition shall describe any 
other factors the petitioner deems relevant to the Commission's final 
determination and any available alternatives that might constitute a 
reasonable substitute for the closed captioning requirements including, 
but not limited to, text or graphic display of the content of the audio 
portion of the programming. Undue burden shall be evaluated with regard 
to the individual outlet.
    (4) An original and two (2) copies of a petition requesting an 
exemption based on the undue burden standard, and all subsequent 
pleadings, shall be filed in accordance with Sec. 0.401(a) of this 
chapter.
    (5) The Commission will place the petition on public notice.
    (6) Any interested person may file comments or oppositions to the 
petition within 30 days of the public notice of the petition. Within 20 
days of the close of the comment period, the petitioner may reply to any 
comments or oppositions filed.
    (7) Comments or oppositions to the petition shall be served on the 
petitioner and shall include a certification that the petitioner was 
served with a copy. Replies to comments or oppositions shall be served 
on the commenting or opposing party and shall include a certification 
that the commenter was served with a copy.
    (8) Upon a showing of good cause, the Commission may lengthen or 
shorten any comment period and waive or establish other procedural 
requirements.
    (9) All petitions and responsive pleadings shall contain a detailed, 
full showing, supported by affidavit, of any facts or considerations 
relied on.

[[Page 694]]

    (10) The Commission may deny or approve, in whole or in part, a 
petition for an undue burden exemption from the closed captioning 
requirements.
    (11) During the pendency of an undue burden determination, the video 
programming subject to the request for exemption shall be considered 
exempt from the closed captioning requirements.
    (g) Complaint procedures. (1) No complaint concerning an alleged 
violation of the closed captioning requirements of this section shall be 
filed with the Commission unless such complaint is first sent to the 
video programming distributor responsible for delivery and exhibition of 
the video programming. A complaint must be in writing, must state with 
specificity the alleged Commission rule violated and must include some 
evidence of the alleged rule violation. In the case of an alleged 
violation by a television broadcast station or other programming for 
which the video programming distributor is exempt from closed captioning 
responsibility pursuant to paragraph (e)(9) of this section, the 
complaint shall be sent directly to the station or owner of the 
programming. A video programming distributor receiving a complaint 
regarding such programming must forward the complaint within seven days 
of receipt to the programmer or send written instructions to the 
complainant on how to refile with the programmer.
    (2) A complaint will not be considered if it is filed with the video 
programming distributor later than the end of the calendar quarter 
following the calendar quarter in which the alleged violation has 
occurred.
    (3) The video programming distributor must respond in writing to a 
complaint no later than 45 days after the end of the calendar quarter in 
which the violation is alleged to have occurred or 45 days after receipt 
of a written complaint, whichever is later.
    (4) If a video programming distributor fails to respond to a 
complaint or a dispute remains following the initial complaint 
resolution procedures, a complaint may be filed with the Commission 
within 30 days after the time allotted for the video programming 
distributor to respond has ended. An original and two (2) copies of the 
complaint, and all subsequent pleadings shall be filed in accordance 
with Sec. 0.401(a) of this chapter. The complaint shall include evidence 
that demonstrates the alleged violation of the closed captioning 
requirements of this section and shall certify that a copy of the 
complaint and the supporting evidence was first directed to the video 
programming distributor. A copy of the complaint and any supporting 
documentation must be served on the video programming distributor.
    (5) The video programming distributor shall have 15 days to respond 
to the complaint. In response to a complaint, a video programming 
distributor is obligated to provide the Commission with sufficient 
records and documentation to demonstrate that it is in compliance with 
the Commission's rules. The response to the complaint shall be served on 
the complainant.
    (6) Certifications from programming suppliers, including programming 
producers, programming owners, networks, syndicators and other 
distributors, may be relied on to demonstrate compliance. Distributors 
will not be held responsible for situations where a program source 
falsely certifies that programming delivered to the distributor meets 
our captioning requirements if the distributor is unaware that the 
certification is false. Video programming providers may rely on the 
accuracy of certifications. Appropriate action may be taken with respect 
to deliberate falsifications.
    (7) The Commission will review the complaint, including all 
supporting evidence, and determine whether a violation has occurred. The 
Commission shall, as needed, request additional information from the 
video programming provider.
    (8) If the Commission finds that a violation has occurred, penalties 
may be imposed, including a requirement that the video programming 
distributor deliver video programming containing closed captioning in an 
amount exceeding that specified in paragraph (b) of this section in a 
future time period.
    (h) Private rights of action prohibited. Nothing in this section 
shall be construed to authorize any private right of action to enforce 
any requirement of

[[Page 695]]

this section. The Commission shall have exclusive jurisdiction with 
respect to any complaint under this section.
