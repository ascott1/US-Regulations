              under the Federal Register Act. Under the provisions of 44 
              U.S.C. 1507, the contents of the CFR, a special edition of the 
              Federal Register, shall be judicially noticed. The CFR is 
              prima facie evidence of the original documents published in 
              the Federal Register (44 U.S.C. 1510).

          It is prohibited to use NARA's official seal and the stylized Code 
              of Federal Regulations logo on any republication of this 
              material without the express, written permission of the 
              Archivist of the United States or the Archivist's designee. 
              Any person using NARA's official seals and logos in a manner 
              inconsistent with the provisions of 36 CFR part 1200 is 
              subject to the penalties specified in 18 U.S.C. 506, 701, and

                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2010), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in eleven separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as 
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after 
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please 
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, Washington DC 20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities 
and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an 
alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in 
this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

Sec. 301.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) Under section 436 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7756), a 
State or political subdivision of a State may not impose prohibitions or 
restrictions upon the movement in interstate commerce of articles, means 
of conveyance, plants, plant products, biological control organisms, 
plant pests, or noxious weeds if the Secretary has issued a regulation 
or order to prevent the dissemination of the biological control 
organism, plant pest, or noxious weed within the United States. The only 
exceptions to this are:
    (1) If the prohibitions or restrictions issued by the State or 
political subdivision of a State are consistent with and do not exceed 
the regulations or orders issued by the Secretary, or
    (2) If the State or political subdivision of a State demonstrates to 
the Secretary and the Secretary finds that there is a special need for 
additional prohibitions or restrictions based on sound scientific data 
or a thorough risk assessment.
    (b) The regulations in this subpart provide for the submission and 
consideration of special need requests when a State or a political 
subdivision of a State seeks to impose prohibitions or restrictions on 
the movement in interstate commerce of articles, means of conveyance, 
plants, plant products, biological control organisms, plant pests, or 
noxious weeds that are in addition to the prohibitions or restrictions 
imposed by this part or by a Federal Order.

Sec. 301.1-2  Criteria for special need requests.

    (a) A special need request, as described in Sec. 301.1, may be 
generated by a State or a political subdivision of a State. If the 
request is generated by a political subdivision of a State, the request 
must be submitted to APHIS through the State. States may also 
collaborate with other States to submit multi-State special need 
requests. However, if submitted, the multi-State special need request 
must include information in sufficient detail to allow APHIS to analyze 
the impacts on each State on an individual basis. All special need 
requests must be signed by the executive official or officials or by a 
plant protection official or officials of the State(s) making the 
request and must contain the following:
    (1) Data drawn from a scientifically sound detection survey, showing 
that the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest of 
concern does

[[Page 13]]

not exist in the State or political subdivision or, if already present 
in the State or political subdivision, the distribution of the 
biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest of concern;
    (2) If the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest 
is not present in the State or political subdivision, a risk analysis or 
other scientific data showing that the biological control organism, 
noxious weed, or plant pest could enter the State or political 
subdivision and become established;
    (3) Specific information showing that, if introduced into or allowed 
to spread within the State or political subdivision, the biological 
control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest would harm or injure the 
environment or agricultural resources in the State or political 
subdivision. The request should contain detailed information, including 
quantitative estimates, if available, about what harm or injury would 
result from the introduction or dissemination of the biological control 
organism, noxious weed, or plant pest in the State or political 
subdivision;
    (4) Specific information showing that the State or political 
subdivision has characteristics that make it particularly vulnerable to 
the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest, such as 
unique plants, diversity of flora, historical concerns, or any other 
special basis for the request for additional restrictions or 
prohibitions; and
    (5) Information detailing the proposed additional prohibitions or 
restrictions and scientific data demonstrating that the proposed 
additional prohibitions or restrictions are necessary and adequate, and 
that there is no less drastic action that is feasible and that would be 
adequate, to prevent the introduction or spread of the biological 
control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest in the State or political 
subdivision.
    (b) All special need requests must be submitted to the Deputy 
Administrator for Plant Protection and Quarantine, APHIS, USDA, Jamie L. 
Whitten Federal Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue, SW., Room 
301-E, Washington, DC 20250.


<R05>
Sec. 301.1-3  Action on special need requests.

    (a) Upon receipt of a complete special need request submitted in 
accordance with Sec. 301.1-2, APHIS will publish a notice in the 
Federal Register to inform the public of the special need request and to 
make the request and its supporting information available for review and 
comment for at least 60 days.
    (b) Following the close of the comment period, APHIS will publish 
another notice announcing the Administrator's decision to either grant 
or deny the special need request. The Administrator's determination will 
be based upon the evaluation of the information submitted by the State 
or political subdivision of a State in support of its request and would 
take into account any comments received.
    (1) If the Administrator grants the special need request, the State 
or political subdivision of a State will be authorized to impose only 
the specific prohibitions or restrictions identified in the request and 
approved by APHIS. APHIS will coordinate with the State, or with the 
State on behalf of the political subdivision of the State, to ensure 
that the additional prohibitions or restrictions are in accord with the 
special need exception granted by the Administrator.
    (2) If the Administrator denies the special need request, the State 
or political subdivision of a State will be notified in writing of the 
reason for the denial and may submit any additional information the 
State or political subdivision of a State may have in order to request a 
reconsideration.
    (c) If granted, a special need exception will be applicable for 2 
years, at the end of which the State or political subdivision of a State 
must submit a request for renewal of the exception. A special need 
renewal request must address the same criteria as the initial request 
submitted under Sec. 301.1-2 and must show that a special need still 
exists that warrants the continuation of the special need exception. The 
renewal must be submitted no sooner than 6 months and no later than 3 
months prior to the end of the 2-year applicability period for the 
initial exception. Once a special need renewal

[[Page 14]]

request has been received, APHIS will follow the same notice and comment 
process outlined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. If, by the 
end of the 2-year applicability period, the State or political 
subdivision of a State does not submit a special need renewal request, 
the State's or political subdivision's special need exception will lapse 
and the State or political subdivision of a State will have to reapply 
for the special need exception.
    (d) If the Administrator determines that there is a need for the 
withdrawal of a special need exception before the renewal date of the 
special need exception, the reasons for the withdrawal would be 
communicated to the State or to the political subdivision of the State 
and APHIS will publish a notice in the Federal Register to inform the 
public of the withdrawal of the special need exception and to make the 
information supporting the withdrawal available for review and comment 
for at least 60 days. Reasons for withdrawal of approval of a special 
need exception may include, but are not limited to, the availability of

Sec. 301.32-3  Quarantined areas.

    (a) Designation of quarantined areas. In accordance with the 
criteria listed in paragraph (c) of this section, the Administrator will 
designate as a quarantined area each State, or each portion of a State, 
in which a fruit fly population subject to the regulations in

[[Page 20]]

this subpart has been found by an inspector, or in which the 
Administrator has reason to believe that a fruit fly population is 
present, or that the Administrator considers necessary to quarantine 
because of its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from 
localities in which a fruit fly population has been found. The 
Administrator will publish the description of the quarantined area on 
the Plant Protection and Quarantine Web site, http://www.aphis.usda.gov/
plant--health/plant--pest--info/fruit--flies/index.shtml. The 
description of the quarantined area will include the date the 
description was last updated and a description of the changes that have 
been made to the quarantined area. The description of the quarantined 
area may also be obtained by request from any local office of PPQ; local 
offices are listed in telephone directories. After a change is made to 
the quarantined area, we will publish a notice in the Federal Register 
informing the public that the change has occurred and describing the 
change to the quarantined area.
    (b) Designation of an area less than an entire State as a 
quarantined area. Less than an entire State will be designated as a 
quarantined area only if the Administrator determines that:
    (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the 
intrastate movement of the regulated articles that are equivalent to 
those imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of regulated 
articles; and
    (2) The designation of less than the entire State as a quarantined 
area will prevent the interstate spread of the fruit fly.
    (c) Criteria for designation of a State, or a portion of a State, as 
a quarantined area. A State, or a portion of a State, will be designated 
as a quarantined area when a fruit fly population has been found in that 
area by an inspector, when the Administrator has reason to believe that 
the fruit fly is present in that area, or when the Administrator 
considers it necessary to quarantine that area because of its 
inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from localities in 
which the fruit fly has been found.
    (d) Removal of a State, or a portion of a State, from quarantine. A 
State, or a portion of a State, will be removed from quarantine when the 
Administrator determines that sufficient time has passed without finding 
additional flies or other evidence of infestation in the area to 
conclude that the fruit fly no longer exists in that area.


<R05>
Sec. 301.32-4  Conditions governing the interstate movement of regulated
articles from quarantined areas.

    Any regulated article may be moved interstate from a quarantined 
area \2\ only if moved under the following conditions:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Requirements under all other applicable Federal domestic plant 
quarantines and regulations must also be met.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (a) With a certificate or limited permit issued and attached in 
accordance with Sec. Sec. 301.32-5 and 301.32-8;
    (b) Without a certificate or limited permit if:
    (1) The regulated article originated outside the quarantined area 
and is either moved in an enclosed vehicle or is completely enclosed by 
a covering adequate to prevent access by fruit flies (such as canvas, 
plastic, or other closely woven cloth) while moving through the 
quarantined area; and
    (2) The point of origin of the regulated article is indicated on the 
waybill, and the enclosed vehicle or the enclosure that contains the 
regulated article is not opened, unpacked, or unloaded in the 
quarantined area; and
    (3) The regulated article is moved through the quarantined area 
without stopping except for refueling or for traffic conditions, such as 
traffic lights or stop signs.
    (c) Without a certificate or limited permit if the regulated article 
is moved:
    (1) By the United States Department of Agriculture for experimental 
or scientific purposes;
    (2) Pursuant to a permit issued by the Administrator for the 
regulated article;
    (3) Under conditions specified on the permit and found by the

    (4) With a tag or label bearing the number of the permit issued for 
the

[[Page 21]]

regulated article attached to the outside of the container of the 
regulated article or attached to the regulated article itself if not in 
a container.
    (d) Hass avocados that are grown or packed in an area quarantined 
for Mexican or sapote fruit fly and that are moving interstate from such 
an area are subject to the following additional requirements:
    (1) Orchard sanitation and safeguarding requirements. (i) Hass 
avocado fruit that has fallen from the trees may not be included in 
field boxes of fruit to be packed for shipping.
    (ii) Harvested Hass avocados must be placed in field boxes or 
containers of field boxes that are marked to show the location of the 
orchard. The avocados must be moved from the orchard to the packinghouse 
within 3 hours of harvest or they must be protected from fruit fly 
infestation until moved.
    (iii) Hass avocados must be protected from fruit fly infestations 
during their movement from the orchard to the packinghouse and must be 
accompanied by a field record indicating the location of the orchard 
where the avocados originated.
    (2) Packinghouse requirements for Hass avocados packed within a 
quarantined area. (i) All openings to the outside of the packinghouse 
must be covered by screening with openings of not more than 1.6 mm or by 
some other barrier that prevents insects from entering the packinghouse.
    (ii) The packinghouse must have double doors at the entrance to the 
facility and at the interior entrance to the area where the avocados are 
packed.
    (iii) If the Hass avocados were grown in an orchard within the 
quarantined area, the identity of the avocados must be maintained from 
field boxes or containers to the shipping boxes in the packinghouse so 
that the avocados can be traced back to the orchard in which they were 
grown. The avocados must be packed in boxes or crates that are clearly 
marked with the identity of the grower and the packinghouse.
    (iv) Any boxes of Hass avocados packed in the quarantined area must 
be placed in a refrigerated truck or refrigerated container and remain 
in that truck or container while in transit through the quarantined 
area. Prior to leaving the packinghouse, the truck or container must be 
secured with a seal that will be broken when the truck or container is 
opened. Once sealed, the refrigerated truck or refrigerated container 
must remain unopened until it is outside the quarantined area.
    (v) Any avocados that have not been packed or loaded into a 
refrigerated truck or refrigerated container by the end of the workday 
must be kept inside the screened packinghouse.
    (3) Packinghouse requirements for Hass avocados packed outside a 
quarantined area but grown within a quarantined area. Hass avocados 
grown in an orchard within a quarantined area but packed in a 
packinghouse outside the quarantined area must meet the requirements of 
paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section.

Sec. 301.32-5  Issuance and cancellation of certificates and limited permits.

    (a) A certificate may be issued by an inspector \3\ for the 
interstate movement of a regulated article if the inspector determines 
that:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Services of an inspector may be requested by contacting local 
PPQ offices, which are listed in telephone directories.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1)(i) The regulated article has been treated under the direction of 
an inspector in accordance with Sec. 301.32-10; or
    (ii) Based on inspection of the premises of origin, the premises are 
free from fruit flies; or
    (iii) Based on inspection of the regulated article, the regulated 
article is free of fruit flies; or
    (iv) The regulated articles are Hass variety avocados that have been 
harvested, safeguarded, and packed in accordance with the conditions in

    (2) The regulated article will be moved through the quarantined area 
in an enclosed vehicle or will be completely enclosed by a covering 
adequate to prevent access by fruit flies; and

[[Page 22]]

    (3) The regulated article is to be moved in compliance with any 
additional emergency conditions the Administrator may impose under 
section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) to prevent the 
spread of fruit flies; and
    (4) The regulated article is eligible for unrestricted movement 
under all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations 
applicable to the regulated article.
    (b) An inspector \4\ will issue a limited permit for the interstate 
movement of a regulated article if the inspector determines that:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See footnote 3.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) The regulated article is to be moved interstate to a specified 
destination for specified handling, processing, or utilization (the 
destination and other conditions to be listed in the limited permit), 
and this interstate movement will not result in the spread of fruit 
flies because life stages of the fruit flies will be destroyed by the 
specified handling, processing, or utilization;
    (2) The regulated article is to be moved in compliance with any 
additional emergency conditions the Administrator may impose under 
section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) to prevent the 
spread of fruit flies; and
    (3) The regulated article is eligible for interstate movement under 
all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable

agreement may issue a certificate for the interstate movement of a 
regulated article if an inspector has determined that the regulated 
article is eligible for a certificate in accordance with paragraph (a) 
of this section. A person operating under a compliance agreement may 
issue a limited permit for interstate movement of a regulated article 
when an inspector has determined that the regulated article is eligible 
for a limited permit in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) Any certificate or limited permit that has been issued may be 
withdrawn, either orally or in writing, by an inspector if he or she 
determines that the holder of the certificate or limited permit has not 
complied with all conditions in this subpart for the use of the 
certificate or limited permit. If the withdrawal is oral, the withdrawal 
and the reasons for the withdrawal will be confirmed in writing as 
promptly as circumstances allow. Any person whose certificate or limited 
permit has been withdrawn may appeal the decision in writing to the 
Administrator within 10 days after receiving the written notification of 
the withdrawal. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons upon 
which the person relies to show that the certificate or limited permit 
was wrongfully withdrawn. As promptly as circumstances allow, the 
Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the 
reasons for the decision. A hearing will be held to resolve any conflict 
as to any material fact. Rules of practice concerning a hearing will be 
adopted by the Administrator.

Sec. 301.32-10  Treatments.

    Treatment schedules listed in part 305 of this chapter to destroy 
fruit flies are authorized for use on regulated articles. The following 
treatments also may be used for the regulated articles indicated:
    (a) Soil within the dripline of plants that are producing or have 
produced regulated articles listed Sec. 301.32(a) or (b). The following 
soil treatments may be used: Apply diazinon at the rate of 5 pounds 
active ingredient per acre to the soil within the dripline with 
sufficient water to wet the soil to at least a depth of 0.5 inch. Both 
immersion and pour-on treatment procedures are also acceptable.
    (b) Premises. Fields, groves, or areas that are located within a 
quarantined area but outside the infested core area and that produce 
regulated articles may receive regular treatments with either malathion 
or spinosad bait spray as an alternative to treating fruits and 
vegetables as provided in part 305 of this chapter. These treatments 
must take place at 6- to 10-day intervals, starting a sufficient time 
before harvest (but not less than 30 days before harvest) to allow for 
development of fruit fly egg and larvae. Determination

[[Page 24]]

of the time period must be based on the day degrees model for the 
specific fruit fly. Once treatment has begun, it must continue through 
the harvest period. The malathion bait spray treatment must be applied 
by aircraft or ground equipment at a rate of 2.4 oz of technical grade 
malathion and 9.6 oz of protein hydrolysate per acre. The spinosad bait 
spray treatment must be applied by aircraft or ground equipment at a 
rate of 0.01 oz of a USDA-approved spinosad formulation and 48 oz of 
protein hydrolysate per acre. For ground applications, the mixture may 
be diluted with water to improve coverage.

Sec. 301.38-3  Protected areas.

    (a) The Administrator may designate as a protected area in paragraph 
(d) of this section any State that has eradicated rust-susceptible 
plants of the genera Berberis, Mahoberberis, and Mahonia under the 
cooperative Federal-State eradication program. In addition, the State 
must employ personnel with responsibility for the issuance and 
withdrawal of certificates in accordance with Sec. 301.38-5, and 
maintain and enforce an inspection program under which every plant 
nursery within the State is inspected at least once each year to ensure 
that they are free of rust-susceptible plants. During the requisite 
nursery inspections, all nursery stock shall be examined to determine 
that it consists only of rust-resistant varieties of the genera 
Berberis, Mahoberberis, and Mahonia, and that the plants are true to 
type. Plants that do not meet this criteria must be destroyed.
    (b) The Administrator may designate as a protected area any county 
within a State, rather than the entire State, if areas within the State 
have eradicated rust-susceptible plants of the genera Berberis, 
Mahoberberis, and Mahonia under the cooperative Federal-State program, 
and;
    (1) The State employs personnel with responsibility for the issuance 
and withdrawal of certificates in accordance with Sec. 301.38-5;
    (2) The State is enforcing restrictions on the intrastate movement 
of the regulated articles that are equivalent to those imposed by this 
subpart on the interstate movement of regulated articles, as determined 
by the Administrator; and
    (3) The State maintains and enforces an inspection program under 
which every plant nursery within the county is inspected at least once 
each year to ensure that plant nurseries within that area are free of 
rust-susceptible plants of the genera Berberis, Mahoberberis,

[[Page 28]]

and Mahonia. During the requisite nursery inspections, all nursery stock 
shall be examined to determine that it consists only of rust-resistant 
varieties of the genera Berberis, Mahoberberis, and Mahonia, and that 
the plants are true to type. Plants that do not meet this criteria must 
be destroyed.
    (c) All seed used to propagate plants of the genera Berberis, 
Mahoberberis, and Mahonia in protected areas, and all seed used to 
propagate plants of the genera Berberis, Mahoberberis, and Mahonia that 
are certified as rust-resistant for interstate movement into protected 
areas, must be produced at properties where a State inspector has 
verified that no wild or domesticated rust-susceptible plants are 
growing at or within one-half mile of the property. \4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Persons performing the inspections must be able to recognize 
rust-susceptible varieties of Berberis, Mahoberberis, and Mahonia. 
Inspectors must work side by side, 10 to 20 feet apart, and walk outward 
away from the property a distance of one-half mile measured from the 
edge of the property, and observe all plants growing in the half-mile 
band. The distance between the inspectors may vary within this range, 
depending upon the visibility of the plant growth. In areas with low 
brush and flat terrain, the inspectors may be the maximum distance of 20 
feet apart if they can observe all plants growing within 10 feet of 
them. In areas of high plant growth or hilly terrain, the inspectors 
must be closer together due to limited or obstructed visibility. 
Inspectors must observe all plants growing between themselves and the 
mid-point of the distance between themselves and the next inspector. 
This process must be repeated so that the entire band, measured from the 
border of the property to the circumference of an imaginary circle 
having the property as its mid-point, is visually inspected in this 
manner.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) The following are designated as protected areas:
    (1) The States of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, 
Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, South Dakota, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.
    (2) The following counties in the State of Washington: Adams, 
Asotin, Benton, Chelan, Columbia, Douglas, Ferry, Franklin, Garfield, 
Grant, Kittitas, Klickitat, Lincoln, Okanogan, Pend Oreille, Spokane, 
Stevens, Walla Walla, Whitman, Yakima.
    (e) Each State that is a protected area or that encompasses a 
protected area must submit annually to the Administrator a written 
statement, signed by an inspector, assuring APHIS that all nursery 
inspections have been performed in accordance with this section. The 
statement must be submitted by January 1st of each year, and must 
include a list of the nurseries inspected and found free of rust-
susceptible plants.
    (f) The Administrator may remove a protected area from the list of 
designated protected areas in paragraph (d) of this section if he or she 
determines that it no longer meets the criteria of paragraph (a) or 
(b)(1) through (3) of this section. A hearing will be held to resolve 
any conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice for the hearing 
shall be adopted by the Administrator.

Sec. 301.38-4  Interstate movement of regulated articles.

    (a) Non-protected areas. Interstate movement of regulated articles 
into or through any State or area that is not designated as a protected 
area under Sec. 301.38-3(d) is allowed without restriction under this 
subpart.
    (b) Protected areas. (1) Prohibited movement. The following 
regulated articles are prohibited from moving interstate into or through 
any protected area:
    (i) All rust-susceptible Berberis, Mahoberberis, and Mahonia plants, 
seeds, fruits, and other plant parts capable of propagation, except 
Mahonia cuttings for decorative purposes.
    (ii) All seed-propagated plants of the Berberis species and 
varieties designated as rust-resistant in Sec. 301.38-2(a)(1) of this 
subpart that are of less than 2 years' growth, and any seeds, fruits, 
and other plant parts capable of propagation from such plants.
    (2) Restricted movement. The following regulated articles may be 
moved interstate into or through a protected area with a certificate 
issued and attached in accordance with Sec. Sec. 301.38-5 and 301.38-7 
of this subpart:

[[Page 29]]

    (i) Seed-propagated plants of at least 2 years' growth, clonally 
propagated plants of any age, seeds, fruits, and other plant parts 
capable of propagation of the Berberis species and varieties designated 
as rust-resistant in Sec. 301.38-2(a)(1) of this subpart;
    (ii) Plants, seeds, fruits, and other plant parts capable of 
propagation of the Mahoberberis and Mahonia species and varieties 
designated as rust-resistant in Sec. 301.38-2(a)(2) of this subpart.
    (c) An inspector may issue a limited permit to allow a regulated 
article not eligible for certification under Sec. 301.38-4(b)(2) to 
move interstate into or through a protected area to a specified 
destination that is stated in the permit and is outside the protected 
area, if the requirements of all other applicable Federal domestic plant 
quarantines are met. A regulated article moved interstate under a 
limited permit must be placed in a closed sealed container that prevents 
unauthorized removal of the regulated article, and that remains sealed 
until the regulated article reaches the final destination stated in the 
permit. At the final destination, the sealed container must be opened 
only in the presence of an inspector or with the authorization of an 
inspector obtained expressly for that shipment.
    (d) The United States Department of Agriculture may move any 
regulated article interstate into or through a protected area in 
accordance with the conditions determined necessary to prevent the 
introduction or spread of black stem rust in protected areas, as 
specified in a Departmental permit issued for this purpose.

Sec. 301.38-5  Assembly and inspection of regulated articles: issuance
and cancellation of certificates.

    (a) Any person, other than a person authorized to issue certificates 
under paragraph (c) of this section, who desires to move interstate a 
regulated article that must be accompanied by a certificate under Sec. 
301.38-4(b), shall, as far in advance of the desired interstate movement 
as possible (and no less than 48 hours before the desired interstate 
movement), request an inspector \5\ to issue a certificate. To expedite 
the issuance of a certificate, an inspector may direct that the 
regulated articles be assembled in a manner that facilitates inspection.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Services of an inspector may be requested by contacting a local 
APHIS office (listed in telephone directories under Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine). The 
addresses and telephone numbers of local offices may also be obtained by 
writing to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant 
Protection and Quarantine, Domestic and Emergency Operations, 4700 River 
Road Unit 134, Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1236.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) An inspector may issue a certificate for the interstate movement 
of a regulated article if he or she:
    (1) Determines, upon examination, that the regulated article may be 
moved interstate in accordance with this subpart; and
    (2) Determines that the regulated article may be moved interstate in 
accordance with all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and 
regulations applicable to the regulated article.
    (c) Certificates for interstate movement of regulated articles may 
be issued by an inspector to a person operating under a compliance 
agreement for use with subsequent shipments of regulated articles to 
facilitate their movement. A person operating under a compliance 
agreement must make the determinations set forth in paragraph (b) of 
this section before shipping any regulated articles.
    (d) Any certificate that has been issued may be withdrawn by an 
inspector, orally or in writing, if he or she determines that the holder 
of the certificate has not complied with the conditions of this subpart 
for the use of the certificate. If the withdrawal is oral, the inspector 
will confirm the withdrawal and the reasons for the withdrawal, in 
writing, within 20 days of oral notification of the withdrawal. Any 
person whose certificate has been withdrawn may appeal the decision, in 
writing within 10 days after receiving written notification of the 
withdrawal. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons upon 
which the person relies to show that the certificate was wrongfully 
withdrawn. A hearing will

[[Page 30]]

be held to resolve any conflict as to any material fact. An appeal shall 
be granted or denied, in writing, as promptly as circumstances allow,

Sec. 301.38-6  Compliance agreements and cancellation.

    (a) Any State may enter into a written compliance agreement with any 
person who grows or handles regulated articles in a protected area, or 
moves interstate regulated articles from a protected area, under which 
that person agrees to comply with this subpart, to provide inspectors 
with information concerning the source of any regulated articles 
acquired each year, and to prevent the unauthorized use of certificates 
issued for future use under the compliance agreement. \6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ In non-protected areas, compliance agreements may be arranged by 
contacting a local office of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine, or by writing to the 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and 
Quarantine, Domestic and Emergency Operations, 4700 River Road Unit 134, 
Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1236.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) A compliance agreement may be cancelled by an inspector, orally 
or in writing, whenever he or she determines that the person who has 
entered into the compliance agreement has failed to comply with the 
agreement or this subpart. If the cancellation is oral, the cancellation 
and the reasons for the cancellation will be confirmed, in writing, 
within 20 days of oral notification of the cancellation. Any person 
whose compliance agreement has been cancelled may appeal the decision, 
in writing, within 10 days after receiving written notification of the 
cancellation. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons upon 
which the person relies to show that the compliance agreement was 
wrongfully cancelled. A hearing will be held to resolve any conflict as 
to any material fact. An appeal shall be granted or denied, in writing, 
as promptly as circumstances allow, and the reasons for the decision 
shall be stated. In a non-protected area, appeal shall be made to the 
Administrator. The Administrator shall adopt rules of practice for the 
hearing. The compliance agreement will remain cancelled pending decision 
of the appeal.

Sec. 301.45-2  Authorization to designate and terminate designation
of generally infested areas.

    (a) Generally infested areas. The Administrator shall list as 
generally infested areas in Sec. 301.45-3 each State or each portion 
thereof in which a gypsy moth general infestation has been found by an 
inspector, or each portion of a State which the Administrator deems 
necessary to regulate because of its proximity to infestation or its 
inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from infested 
localities; Except that, an area shall not be listed as a generally 
infested area if the Administrator has determined that:
    (1) The area is subject to a gypsy moth eradication program 
conducted by the Federal government or a State government in accordance 
with the Eradication, Suppression, and Slow the Spread alternative of 
the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) on Gypsy Moth 
Suppression and Eradication Projects that was filed with the United 
States Environmental Protection Agency on January 16, 1996; and,
    (2) State or Federal delimiting trapping surveys conducted in 
accordance with Section II, ``Survey Procedures--Gypsy Moth'' of the 
Gypsy Moth Treatment Manual show that the average number of gypsy moths 
caught per trap is less than 10 and that the trapping surveys show that 
the eradication program is effectively diminishing the gypsy moth 
population of the area.
    (b) Less than an entire State will be designated as a generally 
infested area only if the Administrator has determined that:
    (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine or 
regulation which imposes restrictions on the intrastate movement of the 
regulated articles which are substantially the same as those which are 
imposed with respect to the interstate movement of such articles under 
this subpart; and,
    (2) The designation of less than the entire State as a generally 
infested area will be adequate to prevent the artificial interstate 
spread of infestations of the gypsy moth.
    (c) Temporary designation of areas as generally infested areas. The 
Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any area in any 
State as a generally infested area in accordance with the criteria 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section. An inspector will give 
written notice of the designation to the owner or person in possession 
of the area and thereafter, the interstate movement of any regulated 
article from such areas is subject to the applicable provisions of this 
subpart. As soon as practicable, each generally infested area will be 
added to the list in Sec. 301.45-3 or the designation will be 
terminated by the Administrator or an authorized inspector, and notice 
thereof shall be given to the owner or person in possession of the 
areas.
    (d) Termination of designation as a generally infested area. The 
Administrator shall terminate the designation of any area as a generally 
infested area whenever the Administrator determines that the area no 
longer requires designation under the criteria specified in paragraph 
(a) of this section.

Sec. 301.45-4  Conditions governing the interstate movement of regulated
articles and outdoor household articles from generally infested areas.

    (a) Regulated articles and outdoor household articles from generally 
infested areas. (1) A regulated article, except for an article moved in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, shall not be moved 
interstate from any generally infested area into or through any area 
that is not generally infested unless a certificate or permit has been 
issued and attached to such regulated article in accordance with 
Sec. Sec. 301.45-5 and 301.45-8. \3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Requirements under all other applicable Federal domestic plant 
quarantines must also be met.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) An outdoor household article shall not be moved interstate from 
any generally infested area into or through any area that is not 
generally infested unless a certificate or OHA document has been issued 
and attached to such outdoor household article in accordance with 
Sec. Sec. 301.45-5 and 301.45-8.
    (b) A regulated article originating outside of any generally 
infested area may be moved interstate directly through any generally 
infested area without a certificate or permit if the point of origin of 
the article is clearly indicated by shipping documents, its identity has 
been maintained, and it has been safeguarded against infestation while 
in any generally infested area during the months of April through 
August. The articles must be safeguarded by a covering adequate to 
prevent access by any gypsy moth life stages.
    (c) A regulated article originating in a generally infested area may 
be moved interstate from a generally infested area without a certificate 
if it complies with (1) or (2) of this paragraph:
    (1) The article is moved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for 
experimental or scientific purposes, and:
    (i) Is moved pursuant to a permit issued for each article by the 
Administrator;
    (ii) Is moved in accordance with conditions specified on the permit 
and found by the Administrator to be adequate to prevent the 
dissemination of the gypsy moth, i.e., conditions of treatment, 
processing, shipment, and disposal; and
    (iii) Is moved with a tag or label securely attached to the outside 
of the container containing the article or securely attached to the 
article itself if not in a container, and with such tag or label bearing 
a permit number corresponding to the number of the permit issued for 
such article.
    (2) The article is logs, pulpwood, or bark and bark products, and 
the person moving the article has attached a signed accurate statement 
to the waybill or other shipping documents accompanying the article 
stating that he or she has inspected the article in accordance with the 
Gypsy Moth Program Manual no more than 5 days prior to the date of 
movement and has found no life stages of gypsy moth on the article.

Sec. 301.45-5  Issuance and cancellation of certificates, limited
permits, and outdoor household article documents.

    (a) A certificate may be issued by an inspector for the movement of 
a regulated article or an outdoor household article (OHA) if the 
inspector determines that it is eligible for certification for movement 
to any destination under all Federal domestic plant quarantines 
applicable to such article and:
    (1) It has originated in noninfested premises in a generally 
infested area and has not been exposed to the gypsy moth while within 
the generally infested area; or
    (2) The inspector inspects the article no more than 5 days prior to 
the date of movement during the months of April through August (14 days 
prior to the date of movement from September through March) and finds it 
to be free of the gypsy moth; or
    (3) It has been treated under the direction of an inspector to 
destroy the gypsy moth in accordance with the treatment manual and part 
305 of this chapter; or
    (4) It has been grown, produced, manufactured, stored, or handled in 
such a manner that no infestation would be transmitted thereby as 
determined by an inspector.
    (b) Limited permits may be issued by an inspector to allow 
interstate movement of any regulated article under this subpart to 
specified destinations for specified handling, utilization, processing, 
or treatment in accordance with the treatment manual, when, upon 
evaluation of all of the circumstances involved in each case, the 
Administrator determines that such movement will not result in the 
spread of the gypsy moth because life stages of the moths will be 
destroyed by such specified handling, utilization, processing or 
treatment, or the pest will not survive in areas to which shipped, and 
the requirements of all other applicable Federal domestic plant 
quarantines have been met.
    (c) Certificate and limited permit forms may be issued by an 
inspector to any person for use for subsequent shipments of regulated 
articles provided the person is operating under a compliance agreement. 
Any person operating under a compliance agreement may reproduce the 
forms as needed to attach them to regulated articles moved under a 
compliance agreement. Any person operating under a compliance agreement 
may execute and issue the certificate forms or reproduction of such 
forms, for the interstate movement of regulated articles from the 
premises of such person identified in the compliance agreement, if the 
person has treated such regulated articles as specified in the 
compliance agreement, and if the regulated articles are eligible for 
certification for movement to any destination under all applicable 
Federal domestic plant quarantines. Any person operating under a 
compliance agreement may execute and issue the limited permit forms, or 
reproductions of such forms, for the interstate movement of regulated 
articles to specified destinations when an inspector has made the 
determinations specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) A certificate may be issued by a qualified certified applicator 
for the interstate movement of any outdoor household article or mobile 
home if such qualified certified applicator determines the following:
    (1) That the article has been inspected by the qualified certified 
applicator and found to be free of any life stage of the gypsy moth; or
    (2) That the article has been treated by, or treated under the 
direct supervision of, the qualified certified applicator to destroy any 
life stage of the gypsy moth in accordance with methods and procedures 
prescribed in section III of the Gypsy Moth Program Manual.
    (e) An OHA document may be issued by the owner of an outdoor 
household article for the interstate movement of the article if such 
person has inspected the outdoor household article and has found it to 
be free of any life stage of gypsy moth.
    (f) Any certificate or permit which has been issued or authorized 
may be withdrawn by an inspector if he determines that the holder 
thereof has not complied with any condition for the use of such 
document. The reasons for the withdrawal shall be confirmed in writing 
as promptly as circumstances

[[Page 39]]

permit. Any person whose certificate or permit has been withdrawn may 
appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within ten (10) days 
after receiving the written notification of the withdrawal. The appeal 
shall state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to 
show that the certificate or permit was wrongfully withdrawn. The 
Administrator shall grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the 
reasons for his decision as promptly as circumstances permit. If there 
is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing shall be held to 
resolve such conflict. Rules of practice concerning such a hearing will 
be adopted by the Administrator.

Sec. 301.45-6  Compliance agreement and cancellation thereof.

    (a) Any person engaged in the business of growing, handling, or 
moving regulated articles may enter into a compliance agreement to 
facilitate the movement of such articles under this subpart. Qualified 
certified applicators must enter into compliance agreements, in 
accordance with the definition of qualified certified applicator in 
Sec. 301.45-1. A compliance agreement shall specify safeguards 
necessary to prevent spread of the gypsy moth, such as disinfestation 
practices or application of chemical materials in accordance with the 
treatment manual and part 305 of this chapter. Compliance agreement 
forms may be obtained from the Administrator or an inspector.
    (b) Any compliance agreement may be canceled by the inspector who is 
supervising its enforcement, orally or in writing, whenever the 
inspector finds that such person has failed to comply with the 
conditions of the agreement. If the cancellation is oral, the decision 
and the reasons therefore shall be confirmed in writing, as promptly as 
circumstances permit. Any person whose compliance agreement has been 
canceled may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within 
ten (10) days after receiving written notification of the cancellation. 
The appeal shall state all of the facts and reasons upon which the 
person relies to show that the compliance agreement was wrongfully 
canceled. The Administrator shall grant or deny the appeal, in writing, 
stating the reasons for such decision, as promptly as circumstances 
permit. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing shall 
be held to resolve such conflict. Rules of practice concerning such a 
hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.

<R05>
Sec. 301.48-4  Conditions governing the interstate movement of
regulated articles from quarantined States.

    A regulated article may be moved interstate from a regulated airport 
to any State \1\ designated in Sec. 301.48(b) only if:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Requirements under all other applicable Federal domestic plant 
quarantines must be met.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (a) An inspector, upon visual inspection of the airport and/or the 
aircraft, determines that the regulated article does not present a 
threat to spread the Japanese beetle because adult beetle populations 
are not present; or
    (b) The aircraft is opened and loaded only while it is enclosed 
inside a hangar that an inspector has determined to be free of and 
safeguarded against Japanese beetle; or
    (c) The aircraft is loaded during the hours of 8:00 p.m. to 7:00 
a.m. only or lands and departs during those hours and, in either 
situation, is kept completely closed while on the ground during the 
hours of 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.; or
    (d) If opened and loaded between the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 
p.m., the aircraft is inspected, treated, and safeguarded. Inspection, 
treatment, and safeguarding must be done either under a compliance 
agreement in accordance with Sec. 301.48-8 or under the direct 
supervision of an inspector. On a case-by-case basis, inspectors will 
determine which of the following conditions, and any supplemental 
conditions deemed necessary by the Administrator to prevent the spread 
of Japanese beetle, are required:
    (1) All openings of the aircraft must be closed or safeguarded 
during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. by exclusionary devices or by 
other means approved by the Administrator.
    (2) All cargo containers that have not been safeguarded in a 
protected area must be inspected immediately prior to and during the 
loading process. All personnel must check their clothing immediately 
prior to entering the aircraft. All Japanese beetles found must be 
removed and destroyed.
    (3) All areas around doors and hatches or other openings in the 
aircraft must be inspected prior to removing the exclusionary devices. 
All Japanese beetles found must be removed and destroyed. All doors and 
hatches must be closed immediately after the exclusionary devices are 
moved away from the aircraft.
    (4) Aircraft must be treated in accordance with part 305 of this 
chapter no more than 1 hour before loading. Particular attention should 
be paid to the ball mat area and the holes around

[[Page 43]]

the main entrance. The aircraft must then be aerated under safeguard 
conditions as required by part 305 of this chapter.
    (5) Aircraft treatment records must be maintained by the applicator 
completing or supervising the treatment for a period of 2 years. These 
records must be provided upon request for review by an inspector. 
Treatment records shall include the pesticide used, the date of 
application, the location where the pesticide was applied (airport and 
aircraft), the amount of pesticide applied, and the name of the 
applicator.
    (6) When a designated aircraft is replaced with an alternate one 
just prior to departure (the procedure known as ``tail swapping''), the 
alternate aircraft must be inspected and all Japanese beetles must be 
removed. The aircraft must be safeguarded by closing all openings and 
hatches or by equipping the aircraft with exclusionary devices until the 
aircraft is ready for use. During loading, all treatment and safeguard 
requirements applicable to regularly scheduled aircraft must be 
implemented.
    (7) Aircraft may be retreated in the noninfested State if live 
Japanese beetles are found.
    (8) Notification of unscheduled commercial flights and of all 
military flights must be given at least 1 hour before departure to the 
appropriate person in the destination airport of any of the States 
listed in Sec. 301.48(b). Notification of arriving military flights 
should also be given to base commanders to facilitate the entrance of 
Federal and/or State inspectors onto the base if necessary.

Sec. 301.48-8  Compliance agreements and cancellation.

    (a) Any person engaged in the business of moving regulated articles 
may enter into a compliance agreement to facilitate the movement of such 
articles under this subpart. Any person who enters into a compliance 
agreement, and employees or agents of that person, must allow an 
inspector access to all records regarding treatment of aircraft and to 
all areas where loading, unloading, and treatment of aircraft occurs.
    (b) A compliance agreement may be canceled by an inspector, orally 
or in writing, whenever he or she determines that the person who has 
entered into the compliance agreement has failed to comply with the 
agreement or this subpart. If the cancellation is oral, the cancellation 
and the reasons for the cancellation will be confirmed in writing within 
20 days of oral notification. Any person whose compliance agreement has 
been canceled may appeal the decision, in writing, to the Administrator 
within 10 days after receiving written notification of the cancellation. 
The appeal must state all of the

[[Page 44]]

facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the 
compliance agreement was wrongfully canceled. A hearing will be held to 
resolve any conflict as to any material fact. The Administrator shall 
adopt rules of practice for the hearing. An appeal shall be granted or 
denied, in writing, as promptly as circumstances allow, and the reasons 
for the decision shall be stated. The compliance agreement will remain 
canceled pending the decision on the appeal.

Sec. 301.50-3  Quarantined areas.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, 
the Administrator will list as a quarantined area, in paragraph (c) of 
this section, each State, or each portion of a State, in which the pine 
shoot beetle has been found by an inspector, in which the Administrator 
has reason to believe that the pine shoot beetle is present, or that the 
Administrator considers necessary to regulate because of its 
inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from localities in 
which the pine shoot beetle has been found. Less than an entire State 
will be designated as a quarantined area only if the Administrator 
determines that:
    (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine and 
regulations that impose restrictions on the intrastate movement of the 
regulated articles that are equivalent to those imposed by this subpart 
on the interstate movement of these articles; and
    (2) The designation of less than the entire State as a regulated 
area will otherwise be adequate to prevent the artificial interstate 
spread of the pine shoot beetle.
    (b) The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any 
nonquarantined area in a State as a quarantined area in accordance with 
the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The 
Administrator will give a copy of this regulation along with a written 
notice of this temporary designation to the owner or person in 
possession of the nonquarantined area; thereafter, the interstate 
movement of any regulated article from an area temporarily designated as 
a quarantined area is subject to this subpart. As soon as practicable, 
this area will be added to the list in paragraph (c) of this section, or 
the designation will be terminated by the Administrator or an inspector. 
The owner or person in possession of an area for which designation is 
terminated will be given notice of the termination as soon as 
practicable.
    (c) The areas described below are designated as quarantined areas:

an inspector in accordance with Sec. 301.50-10 of this subpart, or, if 
pine bark products, produced according to the requirements of the 
management method in Sec. 301.50-10(d) of this subpart; or
    (ii) Based on inspection of the premises of origin, if the regulated 
article is a greenhouse-grown pine (such as bonsai), that the greenhouse 
is free from the pine shoot beetle and is screened to prevent entry of 
the pine shoot beetle; or
    (iii) Based on inspection of the regulated article, if the regulated 
article is a pine seedling or a pine transplant and is no greater than 
36 inches high with a bole diameter at soil level of 1 inch or less, 
that it is free from the pine shoot beetle; or
    (iv) Based on inspection by an inspector (branch tip-by-branch tip) 
of pine nursery stock, that it is free from the pine shoot beetle; or
    (v) If the regulated article is a pine log with bark attached or 
pine lumber with bark attached or a pine stump, that its source tree has 
been felled during the period of July 1 through October 31 or if the

area during the period of January through September, if the ambient air 
temperature is 10 [deg]C (50 [deg]F) or higher, in an enclosed vehicle 
or completely enclosed by a covering adequate to prevent access by the 
pine shoot beetle; or
    (iii) The pine log with pine bark attached, pine lumber with bark 
attached, or pine stump from a tree felled during the period of July 1 
through October 31, or the pine bark products produced from a tree 
felled and debarked during the period of July 1 through October 31, will 
be shipped interstate from the quarantined area during the period of 
July 1 through October 31 of the same year in which the source tree was 
felled; and
    (3) The regulated article is to be moved in compliance with any 
additional conditions deemed necessary under section 414 of the Plant 
Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) \4\ to prevent the spread of the pine 
shoot beetle; and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ An inspector may hold, seize, quarantine, treat, apply other 
remedial measures to, destroy, or otherwise dispose of plants, plant 
pests, or other articles in accordance with sections 414, 421, and 434 
of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714, 7731, and 7754).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (4) The regulated article is eligible for unrestricted movement 
under all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations 
applicable to the regulated articles.
    (b) An inspector \5\ will issue a limited permit for the interstate 
movement of a regulated article if the inspector determines that:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See footnote 3 to Sec. 301.50-5(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1)(i) The regulated article is to be moved interstate to a 
specified destination for specified handling, processing, or utilization 
(the destination and other conditions to be listed in the limited 
permit), and this interstate movement will not result in the spread of 
the pine shoot beetle. If the regulated article is part of a shipment of 
pine Christmas trees, the inspector will make a pest-risk determination 
on the basis of an inspection conducted in accordance with Sec. 301.50-
5(c) of this paragraph; or

[[Page 49]]

    (ii) The regulated article is to be moved interstate from a 
quarantined area to a quarantined area and will transit any non-
quarantined area in an enclosed vehicle or completely enclosed by a 
covering adequate to prevent access by the pine shoot beetle; and
    (2) The regulated article is to be moved in compliance with any 
additional conditions deemed necessary under section 414 of the Plant 
Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) to prevent the spread of the pine shoot 
beetle; and
    (3) The regulated article is eligible for interstate movement under 
all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable 
to the regulated article.
    (c) The number of pine Christmas trees randomly selected for 
inspection is determined by the size and type of shipment, in accordance 
with the following tables. If a shipment mixes painted and natural 
trees, the inspection procedure for painted trees will apply.

procedures are authorized for use with pine bark products derived from 
white pine (Pinus strobus), Scotch pine (P. sylvestris), red pine (P. 
resinosa), and jack pine (P. banksiana) trees. Pine bark products will 
only be considered to have been produced in accordance with this 
management method if the following procedures are followed:
    (1) For pine bark products produced from trees felled during the 
period November 1 through March 31:
    (i) The trees must be harvested at a height of 4 inches or more 
above the duff line; and
    (ii) The trees must have been mechanically debarked with a ring 
debarker or a Rosser head debarker; and
    (iii) For Scotch pine, red pine, and jack pine, the bark must either 
be ground into pieces of 1 inch or less in diameter or composted in 
accordance with the procedure in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
    (2) For pine bark products produced from trees felled during the 
period April 1 through June 30:
    (i) The trees must have been mechanically debarked with a ring 
debarker or a Rosser head debarker; and
    (ii) The bark must either be ground into pieces of 1 inch or less in 
size or composted in accordance with the procedure in paragraph (d)(3) 
of this section.
    (3) Composting for pine bark products for the management method in 
this paragraph (d) must be performed as follows:
    (i) The pile of pine bark to be composted must be at least 200 cubic 
yards in size; and
    (ii) The compost pile must remain undisturbed until the interior 
temperature of the pile reaches 120 [deg]F (49 [deg]C) and remains at or 
over that temperature for 4 consecutive days; and
    (iii) After the 4-day period is completed, the outer layer of the 
compost pile must be removed to a depth of 3 feet; and
    (iv) A second compost pile must be started using the cover material 
previously removed as a core. Core material must be removed from the 
first pile and used to cover the second compost pile to a depth of 3 
feet; and

[[Page 52]]

    (v) The second compost pile must remain undisturbed until the 
interior temperature of the pile reaches 120 [deg]F (49 [deg]C) and 
remains at or over that temperature for 4 consecutive days. After this 
4-day period, the composting procedure is complete.
    (vi) Previously composted material generated using this procedure 
may be used as cover material for subsequent compost piles. A compost 
pile that uses previously composted material must remain undisturbed 
until the interior temperature of the pile reaches 120 [deg]F (49 
[deg]C) and remains at or over that temperature for 4 consecutive days. 
After this 4-day period, the composting procedure is complete.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, 
the Administrator will list as a quarantined area in paragraph (c) of 
this section, each State or each portion of a State in which the Asian 
longhorned beetle has been found by an inspector, in which the 
Administrator has reason to believe that the Asian longhorned beetle is 
present, or that the Administrator considers necessary to regulate 
because of its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from 
localities where Asian longhorned beetle has been found. Less than an 
entire State will be designated as a quarantined area only if the 
Administrator determines that:
    (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the 
intrastate movement of regulated articles that are equivalent to those 
imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of regulated 
articles; and
    (2) The designation of less than an entire State as a quarantined 
area will be adequate to prevent the artificial interstate spread of the 
Asian longhorned beetle.
    (b) The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any 
nonquarantined area as a quarantined area in accordance with the 
criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The Administrator 
will give written notice of this designation to the owner or person in 
possession of the nonquarantined area, or, in the case of publicly owned 
land, to the person responsible for the management of the nonquarantined 
area. Thereafter, the interstate movement of any regulated article from 
an area temporarily designated as a quarantined area is subject to this 
subpart. As soon as practicable, this area either will be added to the 
list of designated quarantined areas in paragraph (c) of this section, 
or the Administrator will terminate the designation. The owner or person 
in possession of, or, in the case of publicly owned land, the person 
responsible for the management of, an area for which the designation is 
terminated will be given written notice of the termination as soon as 
practicable.
    (c) The following areas are designated as quarantined areas:

Sec. 301.51-5  Issuance and cancellation of certificates and limited permits.

    (a) An inspector \1\ or person operating under a compliance 
agreement will issue a certificate for the interstate movement of a 
regulated article if he or she determines that the regulated article:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Inspectors are assigned to local offices of APHIS, which are 
listed in local telephone directories. Information concerning such local 
offices may also be obtained from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Domestic and Emergency 
Operations, 4700 River Road Unit 134, Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1236.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1)(i) Is apparently free of Asian longhorned beetle in any stage of 
development, based on inspection of the regulated article; or
    (ii) Has been grown, produced, manufactured, stored, or handled in 
such a manner that, in the judgment of the inspector, the regulated 
article does not present a risk of spreading Asian longhorned beetle; 
and
    (2) Is to be moved in compliance with any additional conditions 
deemed necessary under section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 
7714) \2\ to prevent the artificial spread of the Asian longhorned 
beetle; and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ An inspector may hold, seize, quarantine, treat, apply other 
remedial measures to, destory, or otherwise dispose of plants, plant 
pests, or other articles in accordance with sections 414, 421, and 434 
of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714, 7731, and 7754).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Is eligible for unrestricted movement under all other Federal 
domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to the regulated 
articles.

[[Page 56]]

    (b) An inspector or a person operating under a compliance agreement 
will issue a limited permit for the interstate movement of a regulated 
article not eligible for a certificate if he or she determines that the 
regulated article:
    (1) Is to be moved interstate to a specified destination for 
specific processing, handling, or utilization (the destination and other 
conditions to be listed on the limited permit), and this interstate 
movement will not result in the spread of Asian longhorned beetle 
because Asian longhorned beetle will be destroyed by the specific 
processing, handling, or utilization; and
    (2) It is to be moved in compliance with any additional conditions 
that the Administrator may impose under section 414 of the Plant 
Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) in order to prevent the spread of the 
Asian longhorned beetle; and
    (3) Is eligible for unrestricted movement under all other Federal 
domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to the regulated 
article.
    (c) An inspector shall issue blank certificates and limited permits 
to a person operating under a compliance agreement in accordance with 
Sec. 301.51-6 or authorize reproduction of the certificates or limited 
permits on shipping containers, or both, as requested by the person 
operating under the compliance agreement. These certificates and limited 
permits may then be completed and used, as needed, for the interstate 
movement of regulated articles that have met all of the requirements of 
paragraph (a) or (b), respectively, of this section.
    (d) Any certificate or limited permit may be canceled orally or in 
writing by an inspector whenever the inspector determines that the 
holder of the certificate or limited permit has not complied with this 
subpart or any conditions imposed under this subpart. If the 
cancellation is oral, the cancellation will become effective 
immediately, and the cancellation and the reasons for the cancellation 
will be confirmed in writing as soon as circumstances permit. Any person 
whose certificate or limited permit has been cancelled may appeal the 
decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after receiving 
the written cancellation notice. The appeal must state all of the facts 
and reasons that the person wants the Administrator to consider in 
deciding the appeal. A hearing may be held to resolve a conflict as to 
any material fact. Rules of practice for the hearing will be adopted by 
the Administrator. As soon as practicable, the Administrator will grant 
or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision.

Sec. 301.53-3  Quarantined areas.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, 
the Administrator will list as a quarantined area in paragraph (c) of 
this section each State or each portion of a State in which the emerald 
ash borer has been found by an inspector, in which the Administrator has 
reason to believe that the emerald ash borer is present, or that the 
Administrator considers necessary to regulate because of its 
inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from localities where 
emerald ash borer has been found. Less than an entire State will be 
designated as a quarantined area only if the Administrator determines 
that:
    (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the 
intrastate movement of regulated articles that are equivalent to those 
imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of regulated 
articles; and
    (2) The designation of less than an entire State as a quarantined 
area will be adequate to prevent the artificial interstate spread of the 
emerald ash borer.
    (b) The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any 
nonquarantined area as a quarantined area in accordance with the 
criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The Administrator 
will give written notice of this designation to the owner or person in 
possession of the nonquarantined area, or, in the case of publicly owned 
land, to the person responsible for the management of the nonquarantined 
area. Thereafter, the interstate movement of any regulated article from 
an area temporarily designated as a quarantined area is subject to this 
subpart. As soon as practicable, this area either will be added to the 
list of designated quarantined areas in paragraph (c) of this section, 
or the Administrator will terminate the designation. The owner or person 
in possession of, or, in the case of publicly owned land, the person 
responsible for the management of, an area for which the designation is 
terminated will be given written notice of the termination as soon as 
practicable.

Sec. 301.53-4  Conditions governing the interstate movement of 
regulated articles from quarantined areas.

    Regulated articles may be moved interstate from a quarantined area 
only if moved under the following conditions:
    (a) With a certificate or limited permit issued and attached in 
accordance with Sec. Sec. 301.53-5 and 301.53-8;
    (b) Without a certificate or limited permit if:
    (1) The regulated article is moved by the United States Department 
of Agriculture for experimental or scientific purposes; or
    (2) The regulated article originates outside the quarantined area 
and is moved interstate through the quarantined area under the following 
conditions:
    (i) The points of origin and destination are indicated on a waybill 
accompanying the regulated article; and
    (ii) The regulated article, if moved through the quarantined area 
during the period of May 1 through August 31 or when the ambient air 
temperature is 40 [deg]F or higher, is moved in an enclosed vehicle or 
is completely covered to prevent access by the EAB; and
    (iii) The regulated article is moved directly through the 
quarantined area without stopping (except for refueling or for traffic 
conditions, such as traffic lights or stop signs), or has been stored, 
packed, or handled at locations approved by an inspector as not posing a 
risk of infestation by emerald ash borer; and
    (iv) The article has not been combined or commingled with other 
articles so as to lose its individual identity.


<R05>
Sec. 301.53-5  Issuance and cancellation of certificates and 
limited permits.

    (a) An inspector \1\ or person operating under a compliance 
agreement will issue a certificate for the interstate movement of a 
regulated article if he or she determines that the regulated article:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Inspectors are assigned to local offices of APHIS, which are 
listed in the local telephone directories. Information concerning such 
local offices may also be obtained from the Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Domestic and 
Emergency Operations, 4700 River Road Unit 134, Riverdale, Maryland 
20737-1236.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1)(i) Is apparently free of EAB, based on inspection; or the 
article or
    (ii) Has been grown, produced, manufactured, stored, or handled in a 
manner that, in the judgment of the inspector, prevents the regulated 
article from

[[Page 65]]

presenting a risk of spreading EAB; and
    (2) Is to be moved in compliance with any additional emergency 
conditions that the Administrator may impose under section 414 of the 
Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) \2\ in order to prevent the 
artificial spread of emerald ash borer; and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ An inspector may hold, seize, quarantine, treat, apply other 
remedial measures to, destroy, or otherwise dispose of plants, plant 
pests, or other articles in accordance with sections 414, 421, and 423 
of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714, 7731, and 7754).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Is eligible for unrestricted movement under all other Federal 
domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to the regulated 
articles.
    (b) An inspector or a person operating under a compliance agreement 
will issue a limited permit for the interstate movement of a regulated 
article not eligible for a certificate if he or she determines that the 
regulated article:
    (1) Is to be moved interstate to a specified destination for 
specific processing, handling, or utilization (the destination and other 
conditions to be listed on the limited permit), and this interstate 
movement will not result in the spread of emerald ash borer because 
emerald ash borer will be destroyed by the specific processing, 
handling, or utilization; and
    (2) Is to be moved in compliance with any additional emergency 
conditions that the Administrator may impose under section 414 of the 
Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) in order to prevent the spread of 
emerald ash borer; and
    (3) Is eligible for unrestricted movement under all other Federal 
domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to the regulated 
article.
    (c) An inspector shall issue blank certificates and limited permits 
to a person operating under a compliance agreement in accordance with 
Sec. 301.53-6 or authorize reproduction of the certificates or limited 
permits on shipping containers, or both, as requested by the person 
operating under the compliance agreement. These certificates and limited 
permits may then be completed and used, as needed, for the interstate 
movement of regulated articles that have met all of the requirements of 
paragraph (a) or (b), respectively, of this section.
    (d) Any certificate or limited permit may be canceled orally or in 
writing by an inspector whenever the inspector determines that the 
holder of the certificate or limited permit has not complied with this 
subpart or any conditions imposed under this subpart. If the 
cancellation is oral, the cancellation will become effective 
immediately, and the cancellation and the reasons for the cancellation 
will be confirmed in writing as soon as circumstances permit. Any person 
whose certificate or limited permit has been canceled may appeal the 
decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after receiving 
the written cancellation notice. The appeal must state all of the facts 
and reasons that the person wants the Administrator to consider in 
deciding the appeal. A hearing may be held to resolve a conflict as to 
any material fact. Rules of practice for the hearing will be adopted by 
the Administrator. As soon as practicable, the Administrator will grant 
or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision.

    (3) The regulated article to be moved and all other regulated 
articles on the premises have been placed on a 21-day insecticide spray 
cycle and have been sprayed with Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki, 
carbaryl, spinosad, or imidaploprid if maintained in the nursery for 
longer than 21 days;
    (4) The regulated article to be moved has been sprayed with Bacillus 
thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki, carbaryl, spinosad, or imidaploprid 3 to 
5 days prior to shipment and inspected and found free of cactus moth egg 
sticks and larval damage; and
    (5) If the regulated article was moved into the premises from 
another premises in a quarantined area listed in Sec. 301.55-3, it was 
immediately placed inside the shadehouse or greenhouse and sprayed with 
Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki, carbaryl, spinosad, or 
imidaploprid within 24 hours.
    (b) An inspector will issue a limited permit for the interstate 
movement of a regulated article if the inspector determines that:
    (1) The regulated article is to be moved interstate to a specified 
destination for specified handling, processing, or utilization (the 
destination and other conditions to be listed in the limited permit), 
and this interstate movement will not result in the spread of the South 
American cactus moth because life stages of the South American cactus 
moth will be destroyed by the specified handling, processing, or 
utilization;
    (2) It is to be moved in compliance with any additional conditions 
that the Administrator may impose under section 414 of the Plant 
Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) in order to prevent the spread of the 
South American cactus moth; and
    (3) It is eligible for unrestricted movement under all other Federal 
domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to the regulated 
article.
    (c) Certificates and limited permits for the interstate movement of 
regulated articles may be issued by an inspector or person operating 
under a compliance agreement. A person operating under a compliance 
agreement may issue a certificate or limited permit for interstate 
movement of a regulated article after an inspector has determined that 
the regulated article is eligible for a certificate or limited permit in 
accordance with paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section.
    (d) Any certificate or limited permit that has been issued may be 
canceled, either orally or in writing, by an inspector whenever the 
inspector determines that the holder of the limited permit has not 
complied with this subpart or any conditions imposed under this subpart. 
If the cancellation is oral, the cancellation will become effective 
immediately, and the cancellation and the reasons for the cancellation 
will be confirmed in writing as soon as circumstances permit. Any person 
whose certificate or limited permit has been canceled may appeal the 
decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after receiving 
the written cancellation notice. The appeal must state all of the facts 
and reasons that the person wants the Administrator to consider in 
deciding the appeal. A hearing may be held to resolve a conflict as to 
any material fact. Rules of practice for the hearing will be adopted by 
the Administrator. As soon as practicable, the Administrator will grant 
or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision.

follows:
    (i) First year crop. The net revenue loss for trees that were 
expected to be sold in the year during which the emergency action 
notification was issued (i.e., the first year crop) will be calculated 
as (expected number of trees to be sold) x (average price per tree) - 
(digging, grading, and storage costs) = net revenue lost for first year 
crop, where:
    (A) The expected number of trees to be sold equals the number of 
trees in

[[Page 75]]

the field minus 2 percent culls minus 3 percent unsold trees; and
    (B) The average price per tree is $4.65; and
    (C) Digging, grading and storage costs are $0.10 per tree.
    (ii) Second year crop. The net revenue loss for trees that would be 
expected to be sold in the year following the year during which the 
emergency action notification was issued (i.e., the second year crop) 
will be calculated as (expected number of trees to be sold) x (average 
price per tree) = net revenue lost for second year crop, where:
    (A) The expected number of trees to be sold equals the number of 
budded trees in the field minus 20 percent death loss minus 2 percent 
culls; and
    (B) The average price per tree is $4.65 for plum and apricot trees 
and $3.30 for peach and nectarine trees.
    (c) How to apply. The form necessary to submit a claim for 
compensation may be obtained from the Plum Pox Cooperative Eradication 
Program, USDA, APHIS, PPQ, 401 East Louther Street, Suite 102, Carlisle, 
PA 17013-2625. The completed claim form must be sent to the same

effective date of this rule. Claims for trees or nursery stock destroyed 
after the effective date of this rule must be received within 60 days 
after the destruction of the trees or nursery stock. Claims must be 
submitted as follows:
    (1) Claims by owners of stone fruit orchards who are direct 
marketers. The completed application must be accompanied by:
    (i) A copy of the emergency action notification ordering the 
destruction of the trees and its accompanying inventory that describes 
the acreage and ages of trees removed;
    (ii) Documentation verifying that the destruction of trees has been 
completed and the date of that destruction; and

direct marketers. The completed application must be accompanied by a 
copy of the emergency action notification ordering the destruction of 
the trees, its accompanying inventory that describes the acreage and 
ages of trees removed, and documentation verifying that the destruction 
of trees has been completed and the date of that destruction.
    (3) Claims by owners of fruit tree nurseries. The completed 
application must be accompanied by a copy of the order prohibiting the 
sale or movement of the nursery stock, its accompanying inventory that 
describes the total number of trees and the age and variety, and 
documentation describing the final disposition of the nursery stock.
    (d) Replanting. Trees of susceptible Prunus species (i.e., Prunus 
species identified as regulated articles) may not be replanted on 
premises within a contiguous quarantined area until 3 years from the 
date the last trees within that area were destroyed because of plum pox

<R05>
Sec. 301.80-2  Authorization to designate, and terminate designation
of, regulated areas and suppressive or generally infested areas; and 

to exempt articles from certification, permit, or other requirements.

    (a) Regulated areas and suppressive or generally infested areas. The 
Deputy Administrator shall designate as regulated areas, in a 
supplemental regulation designated as Sec. 301.80-2a, each quarantined 
State, or each portion thereof in which witchweed has been found or in 
which there is reason to believe that witchweed is present or which it 
is deemed necessary to regulate because of its proximity to infestation 
or its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from infested 
localities. The Deputy Administrator, in the supplemental regulation, 
may designate any regulated area or portion thereof, as a suppressive 
area or a generally infested area in accordance with the definitions 
thereof in Sec. 301.80-1. Less than an entire quarantined State will be 
designated as a regulated area only if the Deputy Administrator is of 
the opinion that:
    (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine or 
regulation which imposes restrictions on the intrastate movement of the 
regulated articles which are substantially the same as those which are 
imposed with respect to the interstate movement of such articles under 
this subpart; and
    (2) The designation of less than the entire State as a regulated 
area will otherwise be adequate to prevent the interstate spread of 
witchweed.
    (b) Temporary designation of regulated areas and suppressive or 
generally infested areas. The Deputy Administrator or an authorized 
inspector may temporarily designate any other premises in a quarantined 
State as a regulated area and may designate the regulated area or 
portions thereof as a suppressive or generally infested area, in 
accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section 
for designating such area, by serving written notice thereof on the 
owner or person in possession of such premises, and thereafter the 
interstate movement of regulated articles from such premises by any 
person having notice of the designation shall be subject to the 
applicable provisions of this subpart. As soon as practicable, such 
premises shall be added to the list in Sec. 301.80-2a if a basis then 
exists for their designation.
    (c) Termination of designation as a regulated area and a suppressive 
or generally infested area. The Deputy Administrator shall terminate the 
designation provided for under paragraph (a) of this section of any area 
designated as a regulated area or a suppressive or a generally infested 
area when he determines that such designation is no longer required 
under the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

[[Page 89]]

The Deputy Administrator or an inspector shall terminate the designation 
provided for under paragraph (b) of this section of any premises 
designated as a regulated area or a suppressive or a generally infested 
area when he determines that such designation is no longer required 
under the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section, and 
notice thereof shall be given to the owner or person in possession of 
the premises.
    (d) Exemption of articles from certification, permit, or other 
requirements. The Deputy Administrator may, in a supplemental regulation 
designated as Sec. 301.80-2b, list regulated articles or movements of 
regulated articles which shall be exempt from the certification, permit, 
or other requirements of this subpart under such conditions as he may 
prescribe, if he finds that facts exist as to the pest risk involved in 
the movement of such regulated articles which make it safe to so relieve 
such requirements.

Sec. 301.80-4  Issuance and cancellation of certificates and permits.

    (a) Certificates may be issued for any regulated articles (except 
soil samples for processing, testing, or analysis) by an inspector if he 
determines that they are eligible for certification for movement to any 
destination under all Federal domestic plant quarantines applicable to 
such articles and:
    (1) Have originated in noninfested premises in a regulated area and 
have not been exposed to infestation while within the regulated areas; 
or
    (2) Have been treated to destroy infestation in accordance with the 
treatment manual; or
    (3) Have been grown, produced, manufactured, stored, or handled in 
such a manner that no infestation would be transmitted thereby.
    (b) Limited permits may be issued by an inspector to allow 
interstate movement of regulated articles (except soil samples for 
processing, testing, or analysis) not eligible for certification under 
this subpart, to specified destinations for limited handling, 
utilization, or processing, or for treatment in accordance with the 
treatment manual, when upon evaluation of the circumstances involved in 
each specific case he determines that such movement will not result in 
the spread of witchweed and requirements of other applicable Federal 
domestic plant quarantines have been met.
    (c) Restricted destination permits may be issued by an inspector to 
allow the interstate movement (for other than scientific purposes) of 
regulated articles (except soil samples for processing, testing, or 
analysis) to any destination permitted under all applicable Federal 
domestic plant quarantines if such articles are not eligible for 
certification under all such quarantines but would otherwise qualify for 
certification under this subpart.

[[Page 93]]

    (d) Scientific permits to allow the interstate movement of regulated 
articles, and certificates or permits to allow the movement of soil 
samples for processing, testing, or analysis in emergency situations, 
may be issued by the Deputy Administrator under such conditions as may 
be prescribed in each specific case by the Deputy Administrator to 
prevent the spread of witchweed.
    (e) Certificate, limited permit, and restricted destination permit 
forms may be issued by an inspector to any person for use by the latter 
for subsequent shipments of regulated articles (except soil samples for 
processing, testing, or analysis) provided such person is operating 
under a compliance agreement; and any such person may be authorized by 
an inspector to reproduce such forms on shipping containers or 
otherwise. Any such person may execute and issue the certificate forms, 
or reproductions of such forms, for the interstate movement of regulated 
articles from the premises of such person identified in the compliance 
agreement if such person has treated such regulated articles to destroy 
infestation in accordance with the treatment manual, and if such 
regulated articles are eligible for certification for movement to any 
destination under all Federal domestic plant quarantines applicable to 
such articles. Any such person may execute and issue the limited permit 
forms, or reproductions of such forms, for interstate movement of 
regulated articles to specified destinations when the inspector has made 
the determinations specified in paragraph (b) of this section. Any such 
person may execute and issue the restricted destination permit forms, or 
reproductions of such forms, for the interstate movement of regulated 
articles not eligible for certification under all Federal domestic plant 
quarantines applicable to such articles, under the conditions specified 
in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (f) Any certificate or permit which has been issued or authorized 
may be withdrawn by the inspector or the Deputy Administrator if he 
determines that the holder thereof has not complied with any condition 
for the use of such document imposed by this subpart. As soon as 
possible after such withdrawal, the holder of the certificate or permit 
shall be notified in writing by the Deputy Administrator or an inspector 
of the reason therefor and afforded reasonable opportunity to present 
his views thereon, and if there is a conflict as to any material fact, a 
hearing shall be held to resolve such conflict.

agreement forms may be obtained from the Deputy Administrator or an 
inspector.
    (b) Any compliance agreement may be canceled by the inspector who is 
supervising its enforcement whenever he finds that such other party has 
failed to comply with the conditions of the agreement. As soon as 
possible after such cancellation, such party shall be notified in 
writing by the Deputy Administrator or an inspector of the reason 
therefor and afforded reasonable opportunity to present views thereon, 
and if there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing shall be 
held to resolve such conflict.

quarantined area due to its proximity to an infestation or 
inseparability from the infested locality for quarantine purposes, as 
determined by:
    (1) Projections of spread of imported fire ant around the periphery 
of the infestation, as determined by previous years' surveys;
    (2) Availability of natural habitats and host materials, within the 
uninfested acreage, suitable for establishment and survival of imported

    (3)(i) Is free of an imported fire ant infestation, based on his or 
her visual examination of the article;
    (ii) Has been grown, produced, manufactured, stored, or handled in a 
manner that would prevent infestation or destroy all life stages of the 
imported fire ant; or
    (iii) Has been treated in accordance with methods and procedures 
prescribed in the Appendix to this subpart (``III. Regulatory 
Procedures'').
    (b) An inspector will issue a limited permit for the interstate 
movement of a regulated article not eligible for a certificate if the 
inspector determines that the regulated article:
    (1) Is to be moved interstate to a specified destination for 
specified handling, utilization, or processing (the destination and 
other conditions to be listed in the limited permit), and this 
interstate movement will not result in the spread of the imported fire 
ant because the imported fire ant will be destroyed by the specified 
handling, utilization, or processing;
    (2) Is to be moved interstate in compliance with any conditions that 
the Administrator may impose under section 414 of the Plant Protection 
Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) to prevent the spread of the imported fire ant; and
    (3) Is eligible for interstate movement under all other Federal 
domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to the regulated 
article.

               Sec. Appendix to Subpart--Imported Fire Ant

                       III. Regulatory Procedures

    A. Instructions to Inspectors. Inspectors must know and follow 
instructions in the PPQ Treatment Manual, the pesticide label, and 
exemptions (Section 18 or 24 (c) of FIFRA) for the treatment or other 
procedures used to authorize the movement of regulated articles. These 
will serve as a basis for explaining such procedures to persons 
interested in moving articles affected by the quarantine. Inspectors 
shall furnish completed information to anyone interested in moving 
regulated articles.
    If there are questions concerning a particular treatment, contact 
your supervisor.
    B. Authorized Chemicals. The following chemicals are authorized for 
the treatment of regulated articles under the IFA quarantine:

                              Insecticides

Bifenthrin (Talstar <SUP>[reg]</SUP>)
Chlorpyrifos (Dursban <SUP>[reg]</SUP>)
Diazinon
Fenoxycarb (AWARD <SUP>[reg]</SUP>)
Fipronil (Chipco <SUP>[reg]</SUP>)
Hydramethylnon (AMDRO <SUP>[reg]</SUP>)
Methoprene (Extinguish <SUP>[reg]</SUP>)
Pyriproxyfen (Distance <SUP>[reg]</SUP>)
Tefluthrin (FIREBAN <SUP>[reg]</SUP>)

    C. Approved Treatments.

                     1. Equipment--Used Soil-Moving

    Methods: Used soil-moving equipment is eligible for movement when an 
inspector determines that one of the following procedures has been done:
    a. It has been brushed free of noncompacted soil;
    b. It has been washed free of noncompacted soil; or
    c. Noncompacted soil has been removed with air pressure equipment 
using compressors designed specifically for this purpose. Such 
compressors must provide free air delivery of no less than 30 cubic feet 
per minute at 200 pounds per square inch.
    Certification Period: As long as kept free of noncompacted soil.
    Limitations: Regardless of the type of cleaning equipment used, all 
debris and noncompacted soil must be removed unless it is steam-heated 
by a ``steam jenny'' to disinfest the articles. Used soil-moving 
equipment, such as bulldozers, dirt pans, motor graders, and draglines, 
are difficult to clean sufficiently to eliminate pest risk.
    Precaution: Steam may remove loose paint and usually is not 
recommended for use on equipment with conveyor belts and rubber parts.

                            2. Hay and Straw

    Baled hay and straw stored in direct contact with the ground is

    e. General requirements for emulsifiable chlorpyrifos, bifenthrin, 
tefluthrin, or fipronil.
    Conditions and Type of Soil: Any friable soil may be treated.

                           Method A--Immersion

                                Equipment

    1. A watertight container for mixing the treating solutions.
    2. Open-top, watertight container sufficiently large to accommodate 
the treating solution and plants.
    Procedure: Locate immersion tank in well-ventilated place. Do not 
remove burlap wrap or plastic containers with drain holes prior to 
immersion Immerse soil balls and containers, singly or in groups, so 
that soil is completely covered by solution. Plants must remain in 
solution until bubbling ceases. Plant balls should have space between 
them when grouped in trays, baskets, or other dipping containers. After 
removal from dip, plants may be set on drainboard until adequately 
drained.
    Thorough saturation of the plant balls or containers with the 
insecticide solution is essential.
    As treating progresses, freshly prepared treating mixture should be 
added to maintain liquid at immersion depth. Dispose of tank contents 8 
hours after mixing. Clean tank before recharging. Disposal must comply 
with State and local regulations.
    Precautions: Runoff of the solution from the treatment area should 
not be permitted. Excess solution (and used solution) must be disposed 
of in accordance with State and local regulations.

                            Method B--Drench

                                Equipment

    1. A large-capacity bulk mixing tank, either pressurized or gravity-
flow for mixing and holding the insecticide solution.
    2. Properly equipped hoses and watering nozzles that can be attached 
to the mixing tank and used to thoroughly saturate the plant balls with 
the insecticide solution.

                                Procedure

    1. Plants Balled with Burlap--Apply the chlorpyrifos solution as a 
substitute for plain water to the plants during the routine watering 
activities. Do not remove burlap wrap from plants prior to treatment. 
Treat plants singly or in groups with the chlorpyrifos solution to the 
point of runoff on a twice daily schedule for 3 consectutive days.
    The above treatment should be carried out in a well-ventilated place 
normally used to maintain plants prior to shipment. The treatment will 
be enhanced by adding any agricultural wetting agent such as Ortho-77 
<SUP>[reg]</SUP>, Tronic <SUP>[reg]</SUP>, Tecowet <SUP>[reg]</SUP>, 
etc., to the chlorpyrifos solution at the labeled rate (usually \1/2\ 
pint per 100 gallons of water).
    2. Containerized Plants--Apply the bifenthrin or chlorpyrifos 
solution to the point of saturation one time only. The volume of the 
treating solution must be at least \1/5\ (20%) of the volume of the 
container.
    Precautions: Thorough saturation of the plant balls or containers 
with the insecticide solution is essential. Runoff of the solution from 
the treatment area should not be permitted. Excess solution (and used 
solution) must be disposed of in accordance with State and local 
regulations.

[[Page 107]]

                      Method C--Topical Application

    Apply bifenthrin according to the label instructions for topical 
application. The method may be used only with nursery stock in 3- and 4-
quart containers. Penetration of the pesticide in larger containers does 
not provide sufficient residual activity.
    Irrigate all treated containers with 1.5 inches of water following 
application.
    Precautions: Runoff of the solution from the treatment area should 
not be permitted. Excess solution (and used solution) must be disposed 
of in accordance with State and local regulations.
    Manufacture of the 10WP (wettable powder) formulation was 
discontinued in 1998; however, the EPA will allow this product to be 
utilized until supplies are exhausted.

              Method D--Granular Incorporation (Bifenthrin)

    Apply bifenthrin according to the label instructions for granular 
incorporation. Mix thoroughly to distribute product evenly throughout 
the soil or potting media. After potting, containers must be watered to 
the point of saturation.
    Precautions: Saturation of the soil or potting media with the 
granular bifenthrin is essential. Water that drains from the treatment 
area, which may contain bifenthrin, must be disposed of in accordance 
with State and local laws.

              Method E--Granular Incorporation (Tefluthrin)

    Apply tefluthrin according to the label directions for granular 
incorporation. Mix thoroughly to distribute the granular tefluthrin 
evenly throughout the soil or potting media. After potting, containers 
must be watered to the point of saturation.
    Precautions: Saturation of the soil or potting media with the 
tefluthrin is essential. Water that drains from the treatment area, 
which may contain tefluthrin, must be disposed of in accordance with 
State and local laws.

               Method F--Granular Incorporation (Fipronil)

    Apply fipronil according to the label instructions for granular 
incorporation. Mix thoroughly to distribute product evenly throughout 
the soil or potting media. After potting, containers must be watered to 
the point of saturation.
    Precautions: Saturation of the soil or potting media with the 
granular fipronil is essential. Water that drains from the treatment 
area, which may contain fipronil, must be disposed of in accordance with 
State and local laws.

      4. Imported-Fire-Ant-Free Nursery--Containerized Plants Only

    This detection, control, exclusion, and enforcement program is 
designed to keep nurseries free of the imported fire ant and provides a 
basis to certify containerized nursery stock for interstate movement.
    Participating regulated establishments must be operating under a 
compliance agreement. Such compliance agreements shall state the 
specific requirements that a shipper agrees to follow to move plants in 
accordance with the requirements of the program. Certificates and a 
nursery identification number may be issued to the nursery for use on 
shipments of regulated articles.

                                Detection

    A successful treatment program depends upon early detection of 
imported fire ant colonies. Nursery owners are required to survey 
visually their entire premises twice monthly for the presence of 
imported fire ants.
    Nurseries participating in this program will be inspected by Federal 
or State inspectors at least twice per year. More frequent inspections 
may be necessary depending upon imported fire ant infestation levels 
immediately surrounding the nursery, the thoroughness of nursery 
management in maintaining imported-fire-ant-free premises, and the 
number of previous detections of imported fire ants in or near 
containerized plants. Inspections by Federal and State inspectors should 
be more frequent just before and during the peak shipping season. Any 
nurseries determined during nursery inspections to have imported fire 
ant colonies must be immediately treated to the extent necessary to 
eliminate the colonies.

                                 Control

    Nursery plants that are shipped under this program must originate in 
a nursery free of imported fire ant. Nursery owners must implement a 
treatment program with registered bait and contact insecticides. The 
premises, including growing and holding areas, must be maintained free 
of the imported fire ant. As part of this treatment program, all exposed 
soil surfaces (including sod and mulched areas) on property where plants 
are grown, potted, stored, handled, loaded, unloaded, or sold must be 
treated with a broadcast application of hydramethylnon (AMDRO 
<SUP>[reg]</SUP>), fenoxycarb (AWARD <SUP>[reg]</SUP>), pyriproxyfen 
(Distance <SUP>[reg]</SUP>), or methoprene (Extinguish <SUP>[reg]</SUP>) 
baits at least once every six months. The first application is more 
effective when applied early in the spring. An early spring bait 
application provides control before alate queens are produced or have 
time to establish new colonies. Follow label directions for use.

[[Page 108]]

    When properly used, baits are between 80 percent and 90 percent 
effective. Follow-up treatments with a contact insecticide must be 
applied to eliminate all remaining colonies. Mound drench treatments 
with a registered formulation of chlorpyrifos or diazinon are approved. 
Follow label directions for use.

                                Exclusion

Bifenthrin
    For plants grown on the premises: Treatment of potting media with 
granular, flowable, or wettable powder formulation of bifenthrin prior 
to planting is required. This treatment reduces the risk of infestation 
of containers by alate queens flying in from adjacent or nearby infested 
premises. The dosage rate for granular bifenthrin is variable and is 
determined by the certification period selected; for flowable bifenthrin 
it is 25 ppm; for wettable powder it is 25 ppm.
    Apply this treatment according to the label instructions.
    Mixing must be adequate to blend the required dosage of pesticide 
throughout the entire potting soil mixture.
    For plants received from outside sources: To prevent the spread into 
a nursery free of the imported fire ant by newly introduced, infested 
nursery plants, all plants must be:
    (a) Obtained from nurseries free of imported fire ant that are 
certified under a compliance agreement; or
    (b) Treated with bifenthrin drench upon delivery in accordance with 
this appendix (III.C.3.b), and within 180 days be either:
    (1) Repotted in treated potting soil media,
    (2) Retreated with bifenthrin drench, immersion, or topical 
application (III.C.3.b) at 180-day intervals, or
    (3) Shipped.
Tefluthrin
    For plants grown on the premises: Treatment of soil or potting media 
with granular, flowable, tefluthrin prior to planting is permitted as an 
alternative to treatment with granular or wettable powder formulation of 
bifenthrin. This treatment reduces the risk of infestation of containers 
by alate queens flying in from adjacent or nearby infested premises. The 
dosage rate is variable, determined by the selected certification 
period, for the granular tefluthrin.
    Apply this treatment according to the label directions.
    Mixing must be adequate to blend the required dosage of granular 
tefluthrin throughout the entire soil or potting media.
Fipronil
    For plants grown on the premises: Treatment of soil or potting media 
with granular fipronil prior to planting is permitted as an alternative 
to treatment with granular formulations of bifenthrin or tefluthrin. 
This treatment reduces the risk of infestation of containers by alate 
queens flying in from adjacent or nearby infested premises. The dosage 
rate is variable, determined by the selected certification period, for 
the granular fipronil.
    Apply this treatment according to the label directions.
    Mixing must be adequate to blend the required dosage of granular 
fipronil throughout the entire soil or potting media.

                               Enforcement

    The nursery owner shall maintain records of the nursery's surveys 
and treatments for the imported fire ant. These records shall be made 
available to State and Federal inspectors upon request.
    If imported fire ants are detected in nursery stock during an 
inspection by a Federal or State inspector, issuance of certificates for 
movement shall be suspended until necessary treatments are applied and 
the plants and nursery premises are determined to be free of the 
imported fire ant. A Federal or State inspector may declare a nursery to 
be free of the imported fire ant upon reinspection of the premises. This 
inspection must be conducted no sooner than 30 days after treatment to 
ensure its effectiveness. During this period, certification may be based 
upon the drench or immersion treatment provided in paragraph III.C.3. of 
this appendix, titled ``Plants--Balled or in Containers.''
    Upon notification by the department of agriculture in any State of 
destination that a confirmed imported fire ant infestation was found on 
a shipment from a nursery considered free of the imported fire ant, the 
department of agriculture in the State of origin shall cease its 
certification of shipments from that nursery. An investigation by 
Federal or State inspectors will commence immediately to determine the 
probable source of the problem and to ensure that the problem is 
resolved. If the problem is an infestation, issuance of certification 
for movement on the basis of imported-fire-ant-free premises will be 
suspended until treatment and elimination of the infestation is 
completed. Reinstatement into the program will be granted upon 
determination that the nursery premises are free of the imported fire 
ant, and that all other provisions of this subpart are being followed.
    In cases where the issuance of certificates is suspended through 
oral notification, the suspension and the reasons for the suspension 
will be confirmed in writing within 20 days of the oral notification of 
the suspension. Any person whose issuance of certificates has been 
suspended may appeal the decision, in writing, within 10 days after 
receiving the written suspension notice. The appeal must state all of 
the facts and reasons that the person wants the Administrator to 
consider in deciding the appeal. A hearing may be held to resolve any 
conflict as to any

[[Page 109]]

material fact. Rules of practice for the hearing will be adopted by the 
Administrator. As soon as practicable, the Administrator will grant or 
deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision.
    Violations of the quarantine shall be investigated by Federal or 
State inspectors and appropriate penalties will be assessed to 
discourage further violations.
    This imported-fire-ant-free nursery program is not mandatory for 
movement of regulated articles. Plants, balled or in containers, may 
otherwise be certified for movement using the chlorpyrifos, bifenthrin, 
tefluthrin, or fipronil treatments described in paragraph III.C.3 of 
this appendix, titled ``Plants, Balled or in Containers.'' However, 
certification for movement under the imported-fire-ant-free nursery 
program will be granted only if all of the provisions of this subpart 
are followed.
    Certification Period: Continuous as long as all provisions of the 
imported-fire-ant-free nursery program are followed.

bait/acre. Chlorpyrifos at 6.0 lb (2.7 kg) a.i./acre.
    Method: Apply fenoxycarb (AWARD <SUP>[reg]</SUP>), hydramethylnon 
(AMDRO <SUP>[reg]</SUP>), pyriproxyfen (Distance <SUP>[reg]</SUP>), or 
methoprene (Extinguish <SUP>[reg]</SUP>) only when ants are actively 
foraging (follow EPA-approved label directions for use). Broadcast 
application with any type of equipment that can be calibrated to deliver 
1.0-1.5 lb (0.45-0.68 kg) of bait per acre. Three to five days after the 
fenoxycarb (AWARD <SUP>[reg]</SUP>), hydramethylnon (AMDRO 
<SUP>[reg]</SUP>), or pyriproxyfen (Distance <SUP>[reg]</SUP>) 
application, apply chlorpyrifos broadcast at 6.0 lb (2.7 kg) a.i. per 
acre. Treatment area must extend at least 10 feet beyond the base of all 
plants that are to be certified.
    Exposure Period: 30 days. Plants can be certified 30 days after 
treatment.
    Certification Period: 12 weeks.
    Special Information: This in-field treatment is based on a 
sequential application of fenoxycarb (AWARD <SUP>[reg]</SUP>), 
hydramethylnon (AMDRO <SUP>[reg]</SUP>), pyriproxyfen (Distance 
<SUP>[reg]</SUP>), or methoprene (Extinguish <SUP>[reg]</SUP>) followed 
by chlorpyrifos. The combination treatment is necessary since broadcast 
application of chlorpyrifos (or other short-term residual insecticides) 
usually does not eliminate large, mature IFA colonies, and no bait, 
including fenoxycarb (AWARD <SUP>[reg]</SUP>) hydramethylnon (AMDRO 
<SUP>[reg]</SUP>), pyriproxyfen (Distance <SUP>[reg]</SUP>), or 
methoprene (Extinguish <SUP>[reg]</SUP>), is capable of providing a 
residual barrier against reinfestation by new queens. Therefore, the 
fenoxycarb (AWARD <SUP>[reg]</SUP>) hydramethylnon (AMDRO 
<SUP>[reg]</SUP>), pyriproxyfen (Distance <SUP>[reg]</SUP>), or 
methoprene (Extinguish <SUP>[reg]</SUP>) application will drastically 
reduce the IFA population while chlorpyrifos, applied approximately 5 
days later, will destroy any remaining weakened colonies and also leave 
a residual barrier against reinfestation by new queens for at least 12 
weeks.

          6. Blueberries and Other Fruit and Nut Nursery Stocks

    Certain States have special local need labeling in accordance with 
section 24(c) of FIFRA for D-z-n <SUP>[reg]</SUP> Diazinon AG-500 and D-
z-n <SUP>[reg]</SUP> Diazinon 50W, which APHIS will recognize as a 
regulatory treatment for containerized nonbearing blueberries and fruit 
and nut plants. Follow label directions for use.

                       7. Plants--Greenhouse Grown

    Greenhouse grown plants are certifiable without treatment if the 
inspector determines that the greenhouse is constructed of fiberglass, 
glass, or plastic in such a way that IFA is physically excluded and 
cannot become established within the enclosure. No other treatment of 
the plants will be necessary if they are not exposed to infestation.

                              8. Grass--Sod

    D. Mitigative Measures. The following measures are required to 
minimize impact on the environment and human health. Any person 
requesting certification to authorize the movement of regulated articles 
must adhere to these measures where applicable.
    1. All applicable Federal, State, and local environmental laws and 
regulations must be followed.
    2. Safety equipment and clothing, as specified by the label 
instructions, must be used and worn during treatments and during 
inspections.
    3. Safety practices shall be communicated, and regulated 
establishment managers must require that on-the-job safety practices be 
followed.
    4. All pesticides must be applied, handled, stored, and used in 
accordance with label instructions.
    5. Empty pesticide containers must be disposed of in accordance with 
Federal and State regulations.
    6. Pesticide remaining in containers after completion of an 
application must be retained and disposed of in accordance with label 
instructions and Federal and State regulations.
    7. Oral or written warning must be provided to workers and the 
general public, indicating pesticide application areas during 
application and appropriate reentry periods.
    8. Owners/managers of regulated properties must take precautions to 
limit access by the public, livestock, and wildlife to treated areas.
    9. Accidental spill or water runoff of liquid or granular pesticides 
leading to potential contamination of ground and surface waters must be 
minimized by appropriate operating procedures. Catchment facilities 
(temporary or permanent) adequate to prevent contamination of ground and 
surface water are necessary in loading areas where liquid drenches and 
immersions are applied.
    10. An environmental monitoring plan, including monitoring 
procedures, must be implemented by APHIS. Monitoring must be conducted 
to determine if additional mitigative measures are necessary.

<R05>
Sec. 301.85-2  Authorization to designate, and terminate designation of, 
regulated areas and suppressive or generally infested areas; and to

exempt articles  from certification, permit, or other requirements.

    (a) Regulated areas and suppressive or generally infested areas. The 
Deputy Administrator shall list as regulated areas, in a supplemental 
regulation designated as Sec. 301.85-2a, each quarantined State; or 
each portion thereof in which golden nematode has been found or in which 
there is reason to believe that golden nematode is present, or which it 
is deemed necessary to regulate because of their proximity to 
infestation or their inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes 
from infested localities. The Deputy Administrator, in the supplemental 
regulation, may divide any regulated area into a suppressive area or a 
generally infested area in accordance with the definitions thereof in 
Sec. 301.85-1. Less than an entire quarantined State will be designated 
as a regulated area only if the Deputy Administrator is of the opinion 
that:
    (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine or 
regulation which imposes restrictions on the intrastate movement of the 
regulated articles which are substantially the same as those which are 
imposed with respect to the interstate movement of such articles under 
this subpart; and
    (2) The designation of less than the entire State as a regulated 
area will otherwise be adequate to prevent the interstate spread of the 
golden nematode.
    (b) Temporary designation of regulated areas and suppressive or 
generally infested areas. The Deputy Administrator or an authorized 
inspector may temporarily designate any other premises in a quarantined 
State as a regulated area and a suppressive or generally infested area, 
in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section for listing such area, by serving written notice thereof on the 
owner or

[[Page 114]]

person in possession of such premises, and thereafter the interstate 
movement of regulated articles from such premises by any person having 
notice of the designation shall be subject to the applicable provisions 
of this subpart. As soon as practicable, such premises shall be added to 
the list in Sec. 301.85-2a if a basis then exists for their 
designation; otherwise the designation shall be terminated by the Deputy 
Administrator or an authorized inspector and notice thereof shall be 
given to the owner or person in possession of the premises.
    (c) Termination of designation as a regulated area and a suppressive 
or generally infested area. The Deputy Administrator shall terminate the 
designation provided for under paragraph (a) of this section of any area 
listed as a regulated area and suppressive or generally infested area 
when he determines that such designation is no longer required under the 
criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) Exemption of articles from certification, permit, or other 
requirements. The Deputy Administrator may, in a supplemental regulation 
designated as Sec. 301.85-2b, list regulated articles or movements of 
regulated articles which shall be exempt from the certification, permit, 
or other requirements of this subpart under such conditions as he or she 
may prescribe, if he or she finds that facts exist as to the pest risk 
involved in the movement of such regulated articles which make it safe 
to so relieve such requirements.

Sec. 301.85-4  Issuance and cancellation of certificates and permits.

    (a) Certificates may be issued for any regulated articles (except 
soil samples for processing, testing, or analysis) by an inspector if 
the inspector determines that they are eligible for certification for 
movement to any destination under all Federal domestic plant quarantines 
applicable to such articles and:
    (1) Have originated in noninfested premises in a regulated area and 
have not been exposed to infestation while within the regulated areas; 
or
    (2) Have been treated to destroy infestation in accordance with part 
305 of this chapter; or
    (3) Have been grown, produced, manufactured, stored, or handled in 
such a manner that no infestation would be transmitted thereby.

Sec. 301.86-3  Quarantined areas.

    (a) Designation of quarantined areas. In accordance with the 
criteria listed in paragraph (c) of this section, the Administrator will 
designate as a quarantined area each field that has been found to be 
infested with pale cyst nematode, each field that has been found to be 
associated with an infested field, and any area that the Administrator 
considers necessary to quarantine because of its inseparability for 
quarantine enforcement purposes from infested or associated fields. The 
Administrator will publish the description of the quarantined area on 
the Plant Protection and Quarantine Web site, http://www.aphis.usda.gov/

[[Page 120]]

plant--health/plant--pest--info/potato/pcn.shtml. The description of the 
quarantined area will include the date the description was last updated 
and a description of the changes that have been made to the quarantined 
area. The description of the quarantined area may also be obtained by 
request from any local office of PPQ; local offices are listed in 
telephone directories. After a change is made to the quarantined area, 
we will publish a notice in the Federal Register informing the public 
that the change has occurred and describing the change to the 
quarantined area.
    (b) Designation of an area less than an entire State as a 
quarantined area. Less than an entire State will be designated as a 
quarantined area only if the Administrator determines that:
    (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the 
intrastate movement of the regulated articles that are equivalent to 
those imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of regulated 
articles; and
    (2) The designation of less than the entire State as a quarantined 
area will prevent the interstate spread of the pale cyst nematode.
    (c) Criteria for designation of fields as infested fields and 
associated fields. (1) Infested fields. The Administrator will designate 
a field as an infested field when a pale cyst nematode is found in the 
field.
    (2) Associated fields. The Administrator will designate a field as 
an associated field when pale cyst nematode host crops, as listed in 
Sec. 301.86-2(b), have been grown in the field in the last 10 years and
    (i) The field shares a border with an infested field; or
    (ii) The field came into contact with a regulated article listed in 
Sec. 301.86-2 from an infested field within the last 10 years; or
    (iii) Within the last 10 years, the field shared ownership, tenancy, 
seed, drainage or runoff, farm machinery, or other elements of shared 
cultural practices with an infested field that could allow spread of the 
pale cyst nematode, as determined by the Administrator.
    (d) Removal of fields from quarantine--(1) Infested fields. An 
infested field will be removed from quarantine when a protocol approved 
by the Administrator as sufficient to support removal of infested fields 
from quarantine has been completed and the field has been found to be 
free of pale cyst nematode.
    (2) Associated fields. An associated field will be removed from 
quarantine when the field has been found to be free of pale cyst 
nematode according to a protocol approved by the Administrator as 
sufficient to support removal of associated fields from quarantine.
    (3) Removal of other areas from quarantine. If the Administrator has 
quarantined any area other than infested or associated fields because of 
its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from infested or 
associated fields, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, that 
area will be removed from quarantine when the relevant infested or 
associated fields are removed from quarantine.

Sec. 301.86-4  Conditions governing the interstate movement of 
regulated articles from quarantined areas.

    (a) Any regulated article may be moved interstate from a quarantined 
area only if moved under the following conditions:
    (1) With a certificate or limited permit issued and attached in 
accordance with Sec. Sec. 301.86-5 and 301.86-8;
    (2) Without a certificate or limited permit if:
    (i) The regulated article is moved by the United States Department 
of Agriculture for experimental or scientific purposes; or
    (ii) The regulated article originates outside the quarantined area 
and is moved interstate through the quarantined area under the following 
conditions:
    (A) The points of origin and destination are indicated on a waybill 
accompanying the regulated article; and
    (B) The regulated article is moved through the quarantined area 
without stopping (except for refueling and for traffic conditions such 
as traffic lights and stop signs); and
    (C) The regulated article is not unpacked or unloaded in the 
quarantined area; and

[[Page 121]]

    (D) The article has not been combined or commingled with other 
articles so as to lose its individual identity.
    (b) When an inspector has probable cause to believe a person or 
means of conveyance is moving a regulated article interstate, the 
inspector is authorized to stop the person or means of conveyance to 
determine whether a regulated article is present and to inspect the 
regulated article. Articles found to be infested by an inspector, and 
articles not in compliance with the regulations in this subpart, may be 
seized, quarantined, treated, subjected to other remedial measures, 
destroyed, or otherwise disposed of.


<R05>
Sec. 301.86-5  Issuance and cancellation of certificates and limited permits.

    (a) Certificates. An inspector \3\ or person operating under a 
compliance agreement may issue a certificate for the interstate movement 
of a regulated article if the inspector determines that the regulated 
article satisfies the general requirements for a certificate in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section and any requirements that may apply to 
the regulated article under paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(7) of this 
section.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Inspectors are assigned to local offices of APHIS, which are 
listed in local telephone directories. Information concerning such local 
offices may also be obtained from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Domestic and Emergency 
Operations, 4700 River Road Unit 134, Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1236.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) Certification requirements for all regulated articles. The 
regulated article must be moved in compliance with any additional 
emergency conditions the Administrator may impose under section 414 of 
the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) \4\ to prevent the spread of 
the pale cyst nematode. In addition, the regulated article must be 
eligible for unrestricted movement under all other Federal domestic 
plant quarantines and regulations applicable to the regulated article.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) provides 
that the Secretary of Agriculture may, under certain conditions, hold, 
seize, quarantine, treat, apply other remedial measures to destroy or 
otherwise dispose of any plant, plant pest, plant product, article, or 
means of conveyance that is moving, or has moved into or through the 
United States or interstate if the Secretary has reason to believe the 
article is a plant pest or is infested with a plant pest at the time of 
movement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Certification requirements for nursery stock--(i) Potatoes. 
Potatoes intended for use as nursery stock (i.e., seed potatoes) are 
prohibited from being moved interstate from the quarantined area.
    (ii) Nursery stock of other host crops. An inspector may issue a 
certificate for the interstate movement of nursery stock of pale cyst 
nematode host crops other than potatoes, as listed in Sec. 301.86-2(b), 
if the nursery stock was grown in a field that meets the following 
requirements:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See footnote 3 to Sec. 301.86-5(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) The regulated article is to be moved interstate to a specified 
destination for specified handling, processing, or utilization (the 
destination and other conditions to be listed in the limited permit), 
and this interstate movement will not result in the spread of the potato 
cyst nematode because life stages of the pale cyst nematode will be 
destroyed by the specified handling, processing, or utilization;
    (ii) The regulated article is to be moved in compliance with any 
additional emergency conditions the Administrator may impose under 
section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) to prevent the 
spread of the potato cyst nematode; and
    (iii) The regulated article is eligible for interstate movement 
under all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations 
applicable to the regulated article.
    (2) Specific conditions for potatoes for consumption. An inspector 
may issue a limited permit to allow the interstate movement of potatoes 
from the quarantined area for processing or packing only if:
    (i) The potatoes are transported in a manner that prevents the 
potatoes and soil attached to the potatoes from coming into contact with 
agricultural premises outside the quarantined area; and

potatoes, waste, and waste water in a manner approved by APHIS to 
prevent the spread of potato cyst nematode.
    (c) Certificates and limited permits for the interstate movement of 
regulated articles may be issued by an inspector or person operating 
under a compliance agreement. A person operating under a compliance 
agreement may issue a certificate for the interstate movement of a 
regulated article

[[Page 123]]

after an inspector has determined that the regulated article is eligible 
for a certificate in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. A 
person operating under a compliance agreement may issue a limited permit 
for interstate movement of a regulated article after an inspector has 
determined that the regulated article is eligible for a limited permit 
in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) Any certificate or limited permit that has been issued may be 
withdrawn, either orally or in writing, by an inspector if he or she 
determines that the holder of the certificate or limited permit has not 
complied with all provisions in this subpart for the use of the 
certificate or limited permit or has not complied with all the 
conditions contained in the certificate or limited permit. If the 
withdrawal is oral, the withdrawal and the reasons for the withdrawal 
will be confirmed in writing as promptly as circumstances allow. Any 
person whose certificate or limited permit has been withdrawn may appeal 
the decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after 
receiving the written notification of the withdrawal. The appeal must 
state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show 
that the certificate or limited permit was wrongfully withdrawn. As 
promptly as circumstances allow, the Administrator will grant or deny 
the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision. A hearing 
will be held to resolve any conflict as to any material fact. Rules of 
practice concerning a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.

<R05>
Sec. 301.89-3  Regulated areas.

    (a) The Administrator will regulate each State or each portion of a 
State that is infected.
    (b) Less than an entire State will be listed as a regulated area 
only if the Administrator:
    (1)(i) Determines that the State has adopted and is enforcing 
restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles listed 
in Sec. 301.89-2 that are equivalent to the movement restrictions 
imposed by this subpart; and
    (ii) Determines that designating less than the entire State as a 
regulated area will prevent the spread of Karnal bunt; or
    (2) Exercises his or her extraordinary emergency authority under 7 
U.S.C. 150dd.
    (c) The Administrator may include noninfected acreage within a 
regulated area due to its proximity to an infestation or inseparability 
from the infected locality for regulatory purposes, as determined by:
    (1) Projections of the spread of Karnal bunt along the periphery of 
the infestation;
    (2) The availability of natural habitats and host materials within 
the noninfected acreage that are suitable for

[[Page 131]]

establishment and survival of Karnal bunt; and
    (3) The necessity of including uninfected acreage within the 
regulated area in order to establish readily identifiable boundaries.
    (d) The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any 
nonregulated area as a regulated area in accordance with the criteria 
specified in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section. The 
Administrator will give written notice of this designation to the owner 
or person in possession of the nonregulated area, or, in the case of 
publicly owned land, to the person responsible for the management of the 
nonregulated area. Thereafter, the movement of any regulated article 
from an area temporarily designated as a regulated area is subject to 
this subpart. As soon as practicable, this area either will be added to 
the list of designated regulated areas in paragraph (g) of this section, 
or the Administrator will terminate the designation. The owner or person 
in possession of, or, in the case of publicly owned land, the person 
responsible for the management of, an area for which the designation is 
terminated will be given written notice of the termination as soon as 
practicable.
    (e) The Administrator will classify a field or area as a regulated 
area when:
    (1) It is a field planted with seed from a lot found to contain a 
bunted wheat kernel; or
    (2) It is a distinct definable area that contains at least one field 
that was found during survey to contain a bunted wheat kernel (the 
distinct definable area may include an area where Karnal bunt is not 
known to exist but where intensive surveys are required because of the 
area's proximity to a field found during survey to contain a bunted 
kernel); or
    (3) It is a distinct definable area that contains at least one field 
that has been determined to be associated with grain at a handling 
facility containing a bunted kernel of a host crop (the distinct 
definable area may include an area where Karnal bunt is not known to 
exist but where intensive surveys are required because of the area's 
proximity to the field associated with the bunted kernel at the handling 
facility).
    (f) A field known to have been infected with Karnal bunt, as well as 
any non-infected acreage surrounding the field, will be released from 
regulation if:
    (1) The field has been permanently removed from crop production; or
    (2) The field is tilled at least once per year for a total of 5 
years (the years need not be consecutive). After tilling, the field may 
be planted with a crop or left fallow. If the field is planted with a 
host crop, the crop must test negative, through the absence of bunted 
kernels, for Karnal bunt.
    (g) The following areas or fields are designated as regulated areas 
(maps of the regulated areas may be obtained by contacting the Animal 
and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, 
4700 River Road Unit 98, Riverdale, MD 20737-1236):

<R05>
Sec. 301.89-15  Compensation for growers, handlers, and seed 
companies in the 1999-2000 and subsequent crop seasons.

    Growers, handlers, and seed companies are eligible to receive 
compensation from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for 
the 1999-2000 and subsequent crop seasons to mitigate losses or expenses 
incurred because of the Karnal bunt regulations and emergency actions, 
as follows:
    (a) Growers, handlers, and seed companies in areas under first 
regulated crop season. Growers, handlers, and seed companies are 
eligible to receive compensation for the loss in value of their wheat in 
accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section if: The 
wheat was grown in a State where the Secretary has declared an 
extraordinary emergency; and the wheat was grown in an area of that 
State that became regulated for Karnal bunt after the crop was planted, 
or for which an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ Form 523) was issued 
after the crop was planted; and the wheat was grown in an area that 
remained regulated or under Emergency Action Notification at the time 
the wheat was sold. Growers and handlers of wheat grown in Oklahoma 
during the 2000-2001 growing season are eligible to receive compensation 
if the wheat was commingled in storage with wheat that meets the above 
requirements of this paragraph. Growers, handlers, and seed companies in 
areas under the first regulated crop season are eligible for 
compensation for 1999-2000 or subsequent crop season wheat and for wheat 
inventories in their possession that were unsold at the time the area 
became regulated. The compensation provided in this paragraph is for 
wheat grain, certified wheat seed, wheat held back from harvest by a 
grower in the 2000-2001 growing season for use as seed in the next 
growing season, and wheat grown with the intention of producing 
certified wheat seed.
    (1) Growers. Growers of wheat in an area under the first regulated 
crop season, who sell wheat that was tested by APHIS and found positive 
for Karnal bunt prior to sale, or that was tested by APHIS and found 
positive for Karnal bunt after sale and the price received by the grower 
is contingent on the test results, are eligible to receive compensation 
as described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) of this section. 
However, compensation for positive-testing wheat will not exceed $1.80 
per bushel under any circumstances.
    (i) If the wheat was grown under contract and a price was determined 
in the contract before the area where the wheat was grown became 
regulated, compensation will equal the contract price minus the actual 
price received by the grower.
    (ii) If the wheat was not grown under contract or a price was 
determined in the contract after the area where the wheat was grown 
became regulated, compensation will equal the estimated market price for 
the relevant class of wheat (meaning type of wheat, such as durum or 
hard red winter) minus the actual price received by the grower. The 
estimated market price will be calculated by APHIS for each class of

[[Page 139]]

wheat, taking into account the prices offered by relevant terminal 
markets (animal feed, milling, or export) during the harvest months for 
the area, with adjustments for transportation and other handling costs. 
Separate estimated market prices will be calculated for certified wheat 
seed and wheat grown with the intention of producing certified wheat 
seed, and wheat grain.
    (2) Handlers and seed companies. Handlers and seed companies who 
sell wheat grown in an area under the first regulated crop season are 
eligible to receive compensation only if the wheat was not tested by 
APHIS prior to purchase by the handler or seed company, but was tested 
by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt after purchase by the 
handler or seed company, as long as the price to be paid is not 
contingent on the test results. Compensation will equal the estimated 
market price for the relevant class of wheat (meaning type of wheat, 
such as durum or hard red winter) minus the actual price received by the 
handler or seed company. The estimated market price will be calculated 
by APHIS for each class of wheat, taking into account the prices offered 
by relevant terminal markets (animal feed, milling, or export) during 
the harvest months for the area, with adjustments for transportation and 
other handling costs. Separate estimated market prices will be 
calculated for certified wheat seed and wheat grown with the intention 
of producing certified wheat seed, and wheat grain. However, 
compensation will not exceed $1.80 per bushel under any circumstances.
    (b) Growers, handlers, and seed companies in previously regulated 
areas. For the 1999-2000 crop season and the 2000-2001 crop season only, 
growers, handlers, and seed companies are eligible to receive 
compensation for the loss in value of their wheat in accordance with 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section if: The wheat was grown in 
a State where the Secretary has declared an extraordinary emergency; and 
the wheat was grown in an area of that State that became regulated for 
Karnal bunt before the crop was planted, or for which an Emergency 
Action Notification (PPQ Form 523) was issued before the crop was 
planted; and the wheat was grown in an area that remained regulated or 
under Emergency Action Notification at the time the wheat was sold. 
Growers, handlers, and seed companies in previously regulated areas will 
not be eligible for compensation for wheat from the 2001-2002 and 
subsequent crop seasons; except that, for growers or handlers of wheat 
harvested in any field in the Texas counties of Archer, Baylor, 
Throckmorton, and Young during the 2000-2001 crop season that has not 
been found to contain a bunted wheat kernel, this requirement applies to 
compensation for wheat from the 2002-2003 and subsequent crop seasons. 
The compensation provided in this paragraph is for wheat grain, 
certified wheat seed, and wheat grown with the intention of producing 
certified wheat seed.
    (1) Growers. Growers of wheat in a previously regulated area who 
sell wheat that was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt 
prior to sale, or that was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal 
bunt after sale and the price received by the grower is contingent on 
the test results, are eligible to receive compensation at the rate of 
$.60 per bushel of positive testing wheat.
    (2) Handlers and seed companies. Handlers and seed companies who 
sell wheat grown in a previously regulated area are eligible to receive 
compensation only if the wheat was not tested by APHIS prior to purchase 
by the handler, but was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal 
bunt after purchase by the handler or seed company, as long as the price 
to be paid by the handler or seed company is not contingent on the test 
results. Compensation will be at the rate of $.60 per bushel of positive 
testing wheat.
    (c) To claim compensation. Compensation payments to growers, 
handlers, and seed companies under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section will be issued by the Farm Service Agency (FSA). Claims for 
compensation for the 1999-2000 crop season must be received by FSA on or 
before December 4, 2001. Claims for compensation for subsequent crop 
seasons must be received by FSA on or before March 1 of the year 
following that crop season. The Administrator may extend the deadline, 
upon

[[Page 140]]

request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen circumstances 
occur that prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting compensation on 
or before these dates. To claim compensation, a grower, handler, or seed 
company must complete and submit to the local FSA county office the 
following documents:
    (1) Growers, handlers, and seed companies. A grower, handler, or 
seed company must submit a Karnal Bunt Compensation Claim form, provided 
by FSA. If the wheat was grown in an area that is not a regulated area, 
but for which an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ Form 523) (EAN) has 
been issued, the grower, handler, or seed company must submit a copy of 
the EAN. Growers, handlers, and seed companies must also submit a copy 
of the Karnal bunt certificate issued by APHIS that shows the Karnal 
bunt test results, and verification as to the actual (not estimated) 
weight of the wheat that tested positive (such as a copy of a facility 
weigh ticket, or other verification). For compensation claims for wheat 
seed, a grower or seed company must submit documentation showing that 
the wheat is either certified seed or was grown with the intention of 
producing certified seed (this documentation may include one or more of 
the following types of documents: an application to the State seed 
certification agency for field inspection; a bulk sale certificate; 
certification tags or labels issued by the State seed certification 
agency; or a document issued by the State seed certification agency 
verifying that the wheat is certified seed);
    (2) Growers. In addition to the documents required in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section, growers must submit a copy of the receipt for 
the final sale of the wheat, showing the total bushels sold and the 
total price received by the grower. Growers compensated under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section (previously regulated areas) whose wheat was not 
tested prior to sale must submit documentation showing that the price 
paid to the grower was contingent on test results (such as a copy of the 
receipt for the final sale of the wheat or a copy of the contract the 
grower has for the wheat, if this information appears on those 
documents).
    (3) Handlers and seed companies. In addition to the documents 
required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, handlers and seed 
companies must submit a copy of the receipt for the final sale of the 
wheat, showing the total bushels sold and the total price received by 
the handler or seed company. The handler or seed company must also 
submit documentation showing that the price paid or to be paid to the 
grower is not contingent on the test results (such as a copy of the 
receipt for the purchase of the wheat or a copy of the contract the 
handler or seed company has with the grower, if this information appears 
on those documents).
    (d) Special allowance for negative wheat grown in Archer, Baylor, 
Throckmorton, and Young Counties, TX, in the 2000-2001 growing season. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, wheat that was 
harvested from fields in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young 
Counties, TX, in the 2000-2001 growing season, and that tested negative 
for Karnal bunt after harvest, is eligible for compensation in 
accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
    (e) Special allowance for disposal costs for treated uncertified 
wheat seed in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, and Young Counties, TX, in 
the 2000-2001 growing season. Notwithstanding any other provision of 
this section, growers in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young 
Counties, TX, who own treated uncertified wheat seed that tested 
positive for Karnal bunt spores during the 2000-2001 growing season are 
eligible for compensation in accordance with this paragraph. The grower 
is eligible for compensation for the costs of disposing of such wheat 
seed, by burial on the grower's premises, by burial at a landfill, or 
through another means approved by APHIS. The compensation for disposing 
of wheat seed by burial on the grower's premises is $1.00 per bushel. 
The compensation for disposing of wheat seed by burial at a landfill, or 
through another means approved by APHIS, is the actual cost of disposal, 
up to $1.20 per bushel, as verified by receipts for disposal costs. To 
apply for this compensation, the grower must submit a Karnal Bunt 
Compensation Claim form, provided by FSA, and

[[Page 141]]

must also submit a copy of the Karnal bunt certificate issued by APHIS 
that shows the Karnal bunt test results, and verification as to the 
actual (not estimated) weight of the uncertified wheat seed that tested 
positive for spores (such as a copy of a facility weigh ticket, or other 
verification). For seed disposed of by burial at a landfill the grower 
must also submit one or more receipts for the disposal costs of the 
uncertified wheat seed, showing the total bushels destroyed and the 
total disposal costs (landfill fees, transportation costs, etc.).

Sec. 301.89-16  Compensation for grain storage facilities, flour 
millers, National Survey participants, and certain custom harvesters 

and equipment owners or lessees for the 1999-2000
and subsequent crop seasons.

    Owners of grain storage facilities, flour millers, and participants 
in the National Karnal Bunt Survey are eligible to receive compensation 
from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the 1999-
2000and subsequent crop seasons to mitigate losses or expenses incurred 
because of the Karnal bunt regulations and emergency actions, as 
follows:
    (a) Decontamination of grain storage facilities. Owners of grain 
storage facilities that are in States where the Secretary has declared 
an extraordinary emergency, and who have decontaminated their grain 
storage facilities pursuant to either an Emergency Action Notification 
(PPQ Form 523) issued by an inspector or a letter issued by an inspector 
ordering decontamination of the facilities, are eligible to be 
compensated, on a one time only basis for each facility for each covered 
crop year wheat, for up to 50 percent of the direct cost of 
decontamination. However, compensation will not exceed $20,000 per grain 
storage facility (as defined in Sec. 301.89-1). General clean-up, 
repair, and refurbishment costs are excluded from compensation. 
Compensation payments will be issued by APHIS. To claim compensation, 
the owner of the grain storage facility must submit to an inspector 
records demonstrating that decontamination was performed on all 
structures, conveyances, or materials ordered by APHIS to be 
decontaminated. The records must include a copy of the Emergency Action 
Notification or the letter from an inspector ordering decontamination, 
contracts with individuals or companies hired to perform the 
decontamination, receipts for equipment and materials purchased to 
perform the decontamination, time sheets for employees of the grain 
storage facility who performed activities connected to the 
decontamination, and any other documentation that helps show the cost to 
the owner and that decontamination has been completed. Claims for 
compensation for the 1999-2000 crop season must be received by APHIS on 
or before December 4, 2001. Claims for compensation for the 2000-2001 
crop season and beyond must be received by March 1 of the year following 
that crop season. The Administrator may extend these deadlines upon 
written request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen 
circumstances occur that prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting 
compensation on or before these dates.
    (b) Flour millers. Flour millers who, in accordance with a 
compliance agreement with APHIS, heat treat millfeed that is required by 
APHIS to be heat treated are eligible to be compensated at the rate of 
$35.00 per short ton of millfeed. The amount of millfeed compensated 
will be calculated by multiplying the weight of wheat from the regulated 
area received by the miller by 25 percent (the average percent of 
millfeed derived from a short ton of grain). Compensation payments will 
be issued by APHIS. To claim compensation, the miller must submit to an 
inspector verification as to the actual (not estimated) weight of the 
wheat (such as a copy of a facility weigh ticket or a copy of the bill 
of lading for the wheat, if the actual weight appears on those 
documents, or other verification). Flour millers must also submit 
verification that the millfeed was heat treated (such as a copy of the 
limited permit under which the wheat was moved to a treatment facility 
and a copy of the bill of lading accompanying that movement; or a copy 
of

[[Page 142]]

PPQ Form 700 (which includes certification of processing) signed by the 
inspector who monitors the mill). Claims for compensation for the 1999-
2000 crop season must be received by APHIS on or before December 4, 
2001. Claims for compensation for the 2000-2001 crop season and beyond 
must be received by March 1 of the year following that crop season. The 
Administrator may extend these deadlines upon written request in 
specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur that 
prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting compensation on or before 
these dates.
    (c) National Karnal Bunt Survey participants. If a grain storage 
facility participating in the National Karnal Bunt Survey tests positive 
for Karnal bunt, the facility will be regulated, and may be ordered 
decontaminated, pursuant to either an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ 
Form 523) issued by an inspector or a letter issued by an inspector 
ordering decontamination of the facility. If the Secretary has declared 
an extraordinary emergency in the State in which the grain storage 
facility is located, the owner will be eligible for compensation as 
follows:
    (1) Loss in value of positive wheat. The owner of the grain storage 
facility will be compensated for the loss in value of positive wheat. 
Compensation will equal the estimated market price for the relevant 
class of wheat minus the actual price received for the wheat. The 
estimated market price will be calculated by APHIS for each class of 
wheat, taking into account the prices offered by relevant terminal 
markets (animal feed, milling, or export) during the relevant time 
period for that facility, with adjustments for transportation and other 
handling costs. However, compensation will not exceed $1.80 per bushel 
under any circumstances. Compensation payments for loss in value of 
wheat will be issued by the Farm Service Agency (FSA). To claim 
compensation, the owner of the facility must submit to the local FSA 
office a Karnal Bunt Compensation Claim form, provided by FSA. The owner 
of the facility must also submit to FSA a copy of the Emergency Action 
Notification or letter from an inspector under which the facility is or 
was quarantined; verification as to the actual (not estimated) weight of 
the wheat (such as a copy of a facility weigh ticket or a copy of the 
bill of lading for the wheat, if the actual weight appears on those 
documents, or other verification); and a copy of the receipt for the 
final sale of the wheat, showing the total bushels sold and the total 
price received by the owner of the grain storage facility. Claims for 
compensation for the 1999-2000 crop season must be received by APHIS on 
or before December 4, 2001. Claims for compensation for the 2000-2001 
crop season and beyond must be received by March 1 of the year following 
that crop season. The Administrator may extend these deadlines upon 
written request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen 
circumstances occur that prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting 
compensation on or before these dates.
    (2) Decontamination of grain storage facilities. The owner of the 
facility will be compensated on a one time only basis for each grain 
storage facility for each covered crop year wheat for the direct costs 
of decontamination of the facility at the same rate described under 
paragraph (a) of this section (up to 50 per cent of the direct costs of 
decontamination, not to exceed $20,000 per grain storage facility). 
Compensation payments for decontamination of grain storage facilities 
will be issued by APHIS, and claims for compensation must be submitted 
in accordance with the provisions in paragraph (a) of this section. 
Claims for compensation for the 1999-2000 crop season must be received 
by APHIS on or before December 4, 2001. Claims for compensation for the 
2000-2001 crop season and beyond must be received by March 1 of the year 
following that crop season. The Administrator may extend these deadlines 
upon written request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen 
circumstances occur that prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting 
compensation on or before these dates.
    (d) Special allowances for custom harvesters and equipment owners or 
lessees for costs related to cleaning and disinfection of mechanized 
harvesting and other equipment in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, and 
Young Counties, TX,

[[Page 143]]

in the 2000-2001 crop season. All claims for compensation under this 
paragraph Sec. 301.89-16(d) must be received by APHIS on or before 
September 6, 2005. The Administrator may extend this deadline upon 
written request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen 
circumstances occur that prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting 
compensation on or before this date. All compensation payments made 
under this paragraph Sec. 301.89-16(d) will be issued by APHIS. Claims 
for compensation should be sent to Plant Protection and Quarantine, 
APHIS, USDA, 304 West Main Street, Olney, TX 76374.
    (1) Custom harvesters. (i) Cleaning and disinfection of mechanized 
harvesting equipment. Custom harvesters who harvested host crops that an 
inspector determined to be infected with Karnal bunt and that were grown 
in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young Counties, TX, during the 2000-
2001 crop season are eligible to receive compensation for the cost of 
cleaning and disinfecting their mechanized harvesting equipment as 
required by Sec. 301.89-12(a). Compensation for the cost of cleaning 
and disinfection mechanized harvesting equipment used to harvest Karnal 
bunt-infected host crops will be either the actual cost or $750 per 
cleaned machine, whichever is less. To claim compensation, a custom 
harvester must provide copies of a contract or other signed agreement 
for harvesting in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young County during 
the 2000-2001 crop season, signed on a date prior to the designation of 
the county as a regulated area for Karnal bunt, or an affidavit stating 
that the custom harvester entered into an agreement to harvest in 
Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young County during the 2000-2001 crop 
season prior to the designation of the county as a regulated area for 
Karnal bunt, signed by the customer with whom the custom harvester 
entered into the agreement; a copy of the PPQ-540 certificate issued to 
allow the movement of mechanized harvesting equipment from a regulated 
area after it had been used to harvest host crops that an inspector 
determined to be infected with Karnal bunt and had been subsequently 
cleaned and disinfected; and a receipt showing the cost of the cleaning 
and disinfection.
    (ii) Contracts lost due to cleaning and disinfection. Custom 
harvesters who harvested host crops that an inspector determined to be 
infected with Karnal bunt and that were grown in Archer, Baylor, 
Throckmorton, or Young Counties, TX, during the 2000-2001 crop season 
are also eligible to be compensated for the revenue lost if they lost 
one contract due to downtime necessitated by cleaning and disinfection, 
if the contract to harvest Karnal bunt-infected host crops in a 
previously nonregulated area was signed before the area was declared a 
regulated area for Karnal bunt. Compensation will only be provided for 
one contract lost due to cleaning and disinfection. Compensation for any 
contract that was lost due to cleaning and disinfection will be either 
the full value of the contract or $23.48 for each acre that was to have 
been harvested under the contract, whichever is less. To claim 
compensation, a custom harvester must provide copies of a contract or 
other signed agreement for harvesting in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, 
or Young County during the 2000-2001 crop season, signed on a date prior 
to the designation of the county as a regulated area for Karnal bunt, or 
an affidavit stating that the custom harvester entered into an agreement 
to harvest in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young County during the

custom harvester entered into the agreement; a copy of the PPQ-540 
certificate issued to allow the movement of mechanized harvesting 
equipment from a regulated area after it has been used to harvest host 
crops that an inspector determined to be infected with Karnal bunt and 
had been subsequently cleaned and disinfected; and the contract for 
harvesting in an area not regulated for Karnal bunt that had been lost 
due to time lost to cleaning and disinfecting harvesting equipment, 
signed on a date prior to the designation of the relevant county as a 
regulated area for Karnal bunt, for which the custom harvester will 
receive compensation, or an affidavit stating that

[[Page 144]]

the custom harvester entered into an agreement to harvest in an area not 
regulated for Karnal bunt prior to the designation of the county as a 
regulated area for Karnal bunt and stating the number of acres that were 
to have been harvested and the amount the custom harvester was to have 
been paid under the agreement, signed by the customer with whom the 
custom harvester entered into the agreement.
    (iii) Fixed costs incurred during cleaning and disinfection. Custom 
harvesters who harvested host crops that an inspector determined to be 
infected with Karnal bunt and that were grown in Archer, Baylor, 
Throckmorton, or Young Counties, TX, during the 2000-2001 crop season 
who do not apply for compensation for a contract lost due to cleaning 
and disinfection as described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section 
are eligible for compensation for fixed costs incurred during cleaning 
and disinfection. Compensation for fixed costs incurred during cleaning 
and disinfection will be $2,000. To claim compensation, a custom 
harvester must provide copies of a contract or other signed agreement

to allow the movement of mechanized harvesting equipment from a 
regulated area after it has been used to harvest host crops that an 
inspector determined to be infected with Karnal bunt and has been 
subsequently cleaned and disinfected.
    (2) Other equipment; cleaning and disinfection. Owners or lessees of 
equipment other than mechanized harvesting equipment and seed 
conditioning equipment that came into contact with host crops that an 
inspector determined to be infected with Karnal bunt in Archer, Baylor, 
Throckmorton, or Young Counties, TX, during the 2000-2001 crop season 
and that was required by an inspector to be cleaned and disinfected are 
eligible for compensation for the cost of cleaning and disinfection. 
Compensation for the cleaning and disinfection of such equipment will be 
$100. To receive this compensation, owners or lessees must submit a copy 
of the PPQ-540 certificate issued to allow the movement of the equipment

Sec. 301.91-3  Regulated areas.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, 
the Deputy Administrator shall list as a regulated area in paragraph (c) 
of this section, the State, or any portion thereof, in which European 
larch canker has been found by an inspector or in which the Deputy 
Administrator has reason to believe that European larch canker is 
present, or any portion of a quarantined State which the Deputy 
Administrator deems necessary to regulate because of its proximity to a 
European larch canker infestation or its inseparability for quarantine 
enforcement purpose from localities in which European larch canker 
occurs. Less than an entire quarantined State will be designated as a 
regulated area only if the Deputy Administrator determines that:
    (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine or 
regulation which imposes restrictions on the intrastate movement of the 
regulated articles which are substantially the same as those which are 
imposed with respect to the interstate movement of such articles under 
this subpart; and
    (2) The designation of less than the entire State as a regulated 
area will otherwise be adequate to prevent the artifical interstate 
spread of European larch canker.
    (b) The Deputy Administrator or an inspector may temporarily 
designate any nonregulated area in a quarantined State as a regulated 
area in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section for listing such area. Written notice of such designation shall 
be given to the owner or person in possession of such nonregulated area, 
and, thereafter, the interstate movement of any regulated article from 
such area shall be subject to the applicable provisions of this subpart. 
As soon as practicable, such area shall be added to the list in 
paragraph (c) of this section or such designation shall be terminated by 
the Deputy Administrator or an inspector, and notice thereof shall be 
given to the owner or person in possession of the area.
    (c) The areas described below are designated as regulated areas:

                                  Maine

quarantines must also be met.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Any regulated article may be moved interstate from any regulated 
area in a quarantined State only if moved under the following 
conditions:
    (a) With a certificate or limited permit issued and attached in 
accordance with Sec. Sec. 301.91-5 and 301.91-8 of this subpart; or
    (b) Without a certificate or limited permit;
    (1) If moved to a contiguous regulated area; or
    (2)(i) If moved directly through (moved without stopping except 
under normal traffic conditions such as traffic lights or stop signs) 
any regulated area in an enclosed vehicle or in an enclosed container on 
a vehicle to prevent the introduction of European larch canker;

[[Page 147]]

    (ii) If the article originated outside of any regulated area; and
    (iii) If the point of origin of any article is clearly indicated by 
shipping documents and its identity has been maintained.

    (a) A certificate shall be issued by an inspector, except as 
provided in paragraph (c) of this section, for the movement of a 
regulated article if such inspector:
    (1)(i) Determines based on inspection of the premises of origin that 
the premises are free from European larch canker; or
    (ii) Determines that it has been grown, processed, stored, or 
handled in such a manner that the regulated article is free of European 
larch canker; and
    (2) Determines that it is to be moved in compliance with any 
additional conditions deemed necessary under section 414 of the Plant 
Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) \3\ to prevent the spread of European 
larch canker; and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ An inspector may hold, seize, quarantine, treat, apply other 
remedial measures to, destroy, or otherwise dispose of plants, plant 
pests, or other articles in accordance with sections 414, 421, and 434 
of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714, 7731, and 7754).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Determines that it is eligible for unrestricted movement under 
all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable 
to such article.
    (b) A limited permit shall be issued by an inspector, except as 
provided in paragraph (c) of this section, for the movement of a 
regulated article if such inspector:
    (1) Determines, in consultation with the Deputy Administrator, that 
it is to be moved to a specified destination for specified handling, 
utilization, or processing (such destination and other conditions to be 
specified on the limited permit), when, upon evaluation of all of the 
circumstances involved in each case, it is determined that such movement 
will not result in the spread of European larch canker because the 
disease will be destroyed by such specified handling, utilization, or 
processing;
    (2) Determines that it is to be moved in compliance with any 
additional conditions deemed necessary under section 414 of the Plant 
Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) \3\ to prevent the spread of European 
larch canker; and
    (3) Determines that it is eligible for such movement under all other 
Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to such 
article.
    (c) Certificates and limited permits may be issued by any person 
engaged in the business of growing, handling, or moving regulated 
articles provided such person has entered into and is operating under a 
compliance agreement. Any such person may execute and issue a 
certificate or limited permit for the interstate movement of a regulated 
article if an inspector has previously made the determination that the 
article is eligible for a certificate in accordance with Sec. 301.91-
5(a) or is eligible for a limited permit in accordance with Sec. 
301.91-5(b).
    (d) Any certificate or limited permit which has been issued or 
authorized may be withdrawn by an inspector if such inspector determines 
that the holder thereof has not complied with any conditions under the 
regulations for the use of such document. The reasons for the withdrawal 
shall be confirmed in writing as promptly as circumstances permit. Any 
person whose certificate or limited permit has been withdrawn may appeal 
the decision in writing to the Deputy Administrator within ten (10) days 
after receiving the written notification of the withdrawal. The appeal 
shall state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to 
show that the certificate or limited permit was wrongfully withdrawn. 
The Deputy Administrator shall grant or deny the appeal, in witing, 
stating the reasons for such decision, as promptly as circmstances 
permit. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing shall 
be held to resolve such conflict. Rules of Practice concerning such a 
hearing will be adopted by the Deputy Administrator.

Sec. 301.92-3  Quarantined and regulated areas.

    (a) Quarantined areas. (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, the Administrator will list as a quarantined 
area in paragraph (a)(3) of this section each State, or each portion of 
a State, in which Phytophthora ramorum has been confirmed by an 
inspector to be established in the natural environment, in which the 
Administrator has reason to believe that Phytophthora ramorum is present 
in the natural environment, or that the Administrator considers 
necessary to quarantine because of its inseparability for quarantine 
enforcement purposes from localities in which Phytophthora ramorum has 
been found in the natural environment. Less than an entire State will be 
designated as a quarantined area only if the Administrator determines 
that:
    (i) The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the 
intrastate movement of the regulated, restricted, and associated 
articles that are substantially the same as those imposed by this 
subpart on the interstate movement of regulated, restricted, and 
associated articles; and
    (ii) The designation of less than the entire State as a quarantined 
area will prevent the interstate spread of Phytophthora ramorum.
    (2) The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any 
nonquarantined area in a State as a quarantined area in accordance with 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The Administrator will give a copy of 
this regulation along with a written notice for the temporary 
designation to the owner or person in possession of the nonquarantined 
area. Thereafter, the interstate movement of any regulated, restricted, 
or associated article from an area temporarily designated as a 
quarantined area will be subject to this subpart. As soon as 
practicable, this area will be added to the list in paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section or the designation will be terminated by the Administrator 
or an inspector. The owner or person in possession of an area for which 
designation is terminated will be given notice of the termination as 
soon as practicable.
    (3) The following areas are designated as quarantined areas:

requirements of Sec. 301.92-5(a)(1)(iv), nurseries located in 
quarantined areas and that move regulated articles of nursery stock, 
decorative trees without roots, wreaths, garlands, or greenery, 
associated articles, or non-host nursery stock interstate must meet the 
requirements in this section. Nurseries in quarantined areas that do not 
meet the requirements of this section are prohibited from moving 
regulated articles and associated articles interstate. Nurseries in 
quarantined areas that do not meet the requirements of this section or 
paragraph (b) of this section are prohibited from moving non-host 
nursery stock interstate.

[[Page 158]]

    (1) Annual inspection, sampling, and testing--(i) Inspection. The 
nursery must be inspected annually for symptoms of Phytophthora ramorum 
by an inspector. \17\ Inspectors will visually inspect for symptomatic 
plants throughout the nursery, and inspection will focus on, but not be 
limited to, regulated articles and associated articles.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ Persons operating under compliance agreements are eligible to 
issue certificates for the interstate movement of regulated and 
associated articles, but only inspectors are authorized to conduct 
nursery inspections required under the regulations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) Sampling. A minimum of 40 plant samples must be tested per 
nursery location. Samples must be taken from all symptomatic plants if 
symptomatic plants are present. If fewer than 40 symptomatic plants are 
present, each symptomatic plant must be sampled and the remainder of the 
40 sample minimum must be taken from asymptomatic plants. If no 
symptomatic plants are present, 40 asymptomatic plants must be sampled; 
biased toward proven hosts. Each sample may contain more than one leaf, 
and may come from more than one plant, but all plants in the sample must 
be from the same lot. Asymptomatic samples, if collected, must be taken 
from regulated and associated articles and nearby plants. Inspectors 
must conduct inspections at times when the best expression of symptoms 
is anticipated and must take nursery fungicide programs into 
consideration. Nursery owners must keep records of fungicide 
applications for 2 years and must make them available to inspectors upon 
request.
    (iii) Testing. Samples must be labeled and sent for testing to a 
laboratory approved by APHIS and must be tested using a test method 
approved by APHIS, in accordance with Sec. 301.92-12.
    (iv) Annual certification. If all plant samples tested in accordance 
with this section and Sec. 301.92-12 return negative results for 
Phytophthora ramorum, an inspector may certify that the nursery is free 
of evidence of Phytophthora ramorum infestation at the time of 
inspection, and the nursery will be eligible to enter into a compliance 
agreement in accordance with Sec. 301.92-6. \18\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ See footnote 14 of this subpart.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Pre-shipment inspection, sampling, and testing--(i) Inspection. 
During the 30 days prior to interstate movement from a nursery in a 
quarantined area, regulated articles or associated articles intended for 
interstate movement must be inspected for symptoms of Phytophthora 
ramorum by an inspector. \19\ Inspection will focus on, but not be 
limited to, regulated articles and associated articles. No inspections 
of shipments will be conducted unless the nursery from which the 
shipment originates has a current and valid annual certification in 
accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \19\ See footnote 7 of this subpart.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (A) If no symptomatic plants are found upon inspection, the shipment 
may be considered free of evidence of Phytophthora ramorum infection and 
is eligible for interstate movement, provided that the nursery is 
operating under a compliance agreement with APHIS in accordance with 
Sec. 301.92-6.
    (B) If symptomatic plants are found upon inspection, the inspector 
will collect at least one sample per symptomatic plant, and one sample 
per regulated article or associated article that is in close proximity 
to, or that has had physical contact with, a symptomatic plant.
    (ii) Testing and withholding from interstate movement. Samples taken 
in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) of this section must be 
labeled and sent for testing to a laboratory approved by APHIS and must 
be tested using a test method approved by APHIS, in accordance with 
Sec. 301.92-12. The interstate movement of plants in the shipment is 
prohibited until the plants in the shipment are determined to be free of 
evidence of Phytophthora ramorum infection in accordance with Sec. 
301.92-12.
    (b) Nurseries in quarantined areas shipping non-host nursery stock 
interstate. Nurseries located in quarantined areas and that move non-
host nursery stock interstate must meet the requirements of this 
paragraph or the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. \20\ If 
such nurseries contain any regulated

[[Page 159]]

or associated articles, the nursery must meet the requirements of 
paragraph (a). This paragraph (b) only applies if there are no regulated 
or associated articles of nursery stock in the nursery. Nurseries that 
do not meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section 
are prohibited from moving non-host nursery stock interstate.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ In addition, to be eligible for interstate movement, non-host 
nursery stock that is rooted in soil or growing media requires 
certification that the soil or growing media meets the requirements of 
Sec. 301.92-5(a)(1)(iii).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) Annual visual inspection. The nursery must be visually inspected 
annually for symptoms of Phytophthora ramorum. Inspections and 
determinations of freedom from evidence of Phytophthora ramorum 
infestation must occur at the time when the best expression of symptoms 
is anticipated.
    (2) Sampling. All plants showing symptoms of infection with 
Phytophthora ramorum upon inspection will be sampled and tested in 
accordance with Sec. 301.92-12. If symptomatic plants are found upon 
inspection, the following plants must be withheld from interstate 
shipment until testing is completed and the nursery is found free of 
evidence of Phytophthora ramorum in accordance with this paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section and Sec. 301.92-12: All symptomatic plants, any 
plants located in the same lot as the suspect plant, and any plants 
located within 2 meters of this lot of plants.
    (3) Certification. If all plant samples tested in accordance with 
this section and Sec. 301.92-12 return negative results for 
Phytophthora ramorum, or if an inspector determines that plants in a 
nursery exhibit no signs of infection with Phytophthora ramorum, the 
inspector may certify that the nursery is free of evidence of 
Phytophthora ramorum infestation at the time of inspection. 
Certification is valid for 1 year and must be renewed each year to 
continue shipping plants interstate.
    (c) Nurseries in regulated areas shipping regulated articles of 
nursery stock or associated articles interstate. To meet the conditions 
of Sec. 301.92-5(b), any nursery that is located in a regulated area 
and contains regulated articles of nursery stock or associated articles, 
and ships any nursery stock interstate must meet the following 
requirements:
    (1) Annual inspection. The nursery must be inspected annually for 
symptoms of Phytophthora ramorum by an inspector. \21\ Inspection will 
focus on, but not be limited to, regulated articles of nursery stock and 
associated articles.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \21\ See footnote 7 of this subpart.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Sampling. Samples must be taken from all symptomatic plants. If 
fewer than 40 symptomatic plants are present, each symptomatic plant 
must be sampled and additional samples must be taken from asymptomatic 
plants so that the minimum number of plants sampled is 40. If no 
symptomatic plants are present, 40 asymptomatic plants must be sampled. 
Each sample may contain more than one leaf, and may come from more than 
one plant, but all plants in the sample must be from the same lot. If 
samples are collected from asymptomatic plants, the samples must be 
taken from regulated and associated articles and nearby plants. 
Inspectors must conduct inspections at times when the best expression of 
symptoms is anticipated and must take nursery fungicide programs into 
consideration. Nursery owners must keep records of fungicide 
applications for 2 years and must make them available to inspectors upon 
request.
    (3) Annual certification. If all plant samples tested in accordance 
with this section and Sec. 301.92-12 return negative results for 
Phytophthora ramorum, the inspector may certify that the nursery is free 
of evidence of Phytophthora ramorum infestation at the time of 
inspection. Nurseries in a regulated area must have current and valid 
certification to ship regulated articles of nursery stock and associated 
articles interstate. If annual certification expires prior to 
reinspection, all plants in the nursery are prohibited interstate 
movement until the nursery is inspected, tested, and re-certified in 
accordance with this section and Sec. 301.92-12.
    (d) Nurseries in regulated areas shipping non-host nursery stock 
interstate. Nurseries located in regulated areas and that move non-host 
nursery stock interstate must meet the requirements in this paragraph or 
the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. If such nurseries 
contain any regulated or associated articles, the nursery must meet the 
requirements of paragraph (c). This paragraph (d) only applies if

[[Page 160]]

there are no regulated or associated articles in the nursery. Nurseries 
that do not meet the requirements of paragraphs (c) or (d) of this 
section are prohibited from moving non-host nursery stock interstate.
    (1) Annual visual inspection. The nursery must be visually inspected 
annually for symptoms of Phytophthora ramorum. Inspections and 
determinations of apparent pest freedom for such nurseries must occur at 
the time when the best expression of symptoms is anticipated.
    (2) Sampling. All plants showing symptoms infection with 
Phytophthora ramorum upon inspection will be sampled and tested in 
accordance with Sec. 301.92-12. If symptomatic plants are found upon 
inspection, the following plants must be withheld from interstate 
shipment until testing is completed and the nursery is found free of 
evidence of Phytophthora ramorum in accordance with Sec. 301.92-12: All 
symptomatic plants, any plants located in the same lot as the 
symptomatic plant, and any plants located within 2 meters of that lot of 
plants.
    (3) Certification. If all plant samples tested in accordance with 
this section and Sec. 301.92-12 return negative results for 
Phytophthora ramorum, or if an inspector determines that plants in the 
nursery exhibit no signs of infection with Phytophthora ramorum, the 
inspector may certify that the nursery is free of evidence of 
Phytophthora ramorum infestation at the time of inspection. 
Certification is valid for 1 year and must be renewed each year to 
continue shipping plants interstate.
    (e) Additions to the lists of proven hosts and associated plants. In 
the event that APHIS informs a nursery owner that additional proven 
hosts or associated plants exist, but those taxa are not yet listed in 
this subpart, the following provisions apply:
    (1) Nurseries operating under a compliance agreement in accordance 
with Sec. 301.92-6 may continue to ship plants interstate in accordance 
with this subpart.
    (2) Nurseries that had not previously contained any regulated or 
associated articles, and that had been inspected in accordance with 
Sec. 301.92-11(b)(3) and allowed to ship plants interstate without 
certificate, but that contain a newly identified proven host or 
associated plant must cease interstate shipments of regulated articles 
and associated hosts until the nursery is reinspected and found free of 
evidence of Phytophthora ramorum in accordance with Sec. 301.92-11. 
Nurseries that come under regulation during winter dormancy periods and 
that are not able to be inspected in accordance with Sec. 301.92-11 
prior to desired shipments of non-host nursery stock may be allowed to 
ship non-host nursery stock interstate at the discretion of an 
inspector.

Sec. 301.92-12  Testing protocols.

    Samples must be analyzed using a methodology approved by APHIS at a 
laboratory approved by APHIS. The following methodology is approved by 
APHIS.
    (a) Optional ELISA Prescreening. An APHIS-approved ELISA may be used 
to prescreen plant samples to determine the presence of Phytophthora 
spp.
    (1) Negative prescreening results. If all samples from a single 
nursery are found to be negative through APHIS-approved ELISA 
prescreening, no further testing is required. The nursery may be 
considered free of evidence of Phytophthora ramorum, and plants in the 
nursery are eligible for interstate movement under certificate in 
accordance with Sec. 301.92-5.
    (2) Positive prescreening results. If ELISA prescreening reveals the 
presence of Phytophthora spp. in any plants, each sample that returns 
positive ELISA results must be tested as provided in paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (b) Mandatory testing procedures. If ELISA prescreening is not 
performed, or if results of ELISA prescreening are positive for 
Phytophthora spp. in any sample, the sample must be analyzed using an 
APHIS-approved test. Samples will be considered positive for 
Phytophthora ramorum based on positive results of any approved test. 
Positive PCR or other molecular tests do not require confirmatory 
culture tests, nor do positive culture tests require confirmatory PCR or 
other molecular tests; however, if culture tests return other than 
positive results, an APHIS-

[[Page 161]]

approved PCR or other molecular test must be conducted, as provided in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (1) PCR or other molecular tests--(i) Negative results. If the 
results of PCR or other molecular tests are negative for all samples in 
a nursery, no further testing is required. The nursery may be considered 
free of evidence of Phytophthora ramorum and plants in the nursery are 
eligible for interstate movement under certificate in accordance with 
Sec. 301.92-5.
    (ii) Positive results. If any samples tested using PCR or other 
molecular tests return positive results for Phytophthora ramorum, the 
nursery from which they originate is prohibited from moving plants 
interstate. The nursery will be eligible to ship certain plants 
interstate when an inspector determines that those plants are free of 
evidence of Phytophthora ramorum.
    (2) Culture Test--(i) Negative results. If the results of culture 
tests are other than positive for any samples taken from a single 
nursery, plants in the nursery must continue to be withheld from 
shipment in accordance with Sec. 301.92-11 and each plant sample must 
be tested again using a PCR or other molecular test, as described in 
this section.
    (ii) Positive results. If any culture tests return positive results 
for Phytophthora ramorum, the nursery from which they originate is 
prohibited from moving plants interstate as directed by an inspector. 
The nursery will be eligible to ship certain plants interstate when an 
inspector determines that those plants are free of evidence of 
Phytophthora ramorum.
    (c) Other test methods. Other test methods may be acceptable if 
approved by APHIS.

phytosanitary certificate must be provided to an inspector when the 
commodity is offered for entry into the United States. During the entire 
interval between treatment and export, the consignment must be stored 
and handled in a manner that prevents any infestation by pests and 
noxious weeds.

Sec. 305.5  Treatment requirements.

    (a) Certified facility. The fumigation treatment facility must be 
certified by APHIS. Facilities are required to be inspected and 
recertified annually, or as often as APHIS directs, depending upon 
treatments performed, commodities handled, and operations conducted at 
the facility. In order to be certified, a fumigation facility must:
    (1) Be capable of administering the required dosage range for the 
required duration and at the appropriate temperature.
    (2) Be adequate to contain the fumigant and be constructed from 
material that is not reactive to the fumigant.
    (3) For vacuum fumigation facilities, be constructed to withstand 
required negative pressure.
    (b) Monitoring. Treatment must be monitored by an official 
authorized by APHIS to ensure proper administration of the treatment, 
including that the correct amount of gas reaches the target organism and 
that an adequate number and placement of blowers, fans, sampling tubes, 
or monitoring lines are used in the treatment enclosure. An official 
authorized by APHIS approves, adjusts, or rejects the treatment.
    (c) Treatment procedures. (1) To kill the pest, all chemical 
applications must be administered in accordance with an Environmental 
Protection

[[Page 195]]

Agency (EPA) approved pesticide label and the APHIS-approved treatment 
schedule prescribed in this part. If EPA cancels approval for the use of 
a pesticide on a commodity, then the treatment schedule prescribed in 
this part is no longer authorized for that commodity. If the commodity 
is not listed on the pesticide label and/or a Federal quarantine or 
crisis exemption in accordance with FIFRA section 18, then no chemical 
treatment is available.
    (2) Temperature/concentration readings must be taken for items known 
to be sorptive or whose sorptive properties are unknown when treatment 
is administered in chambers at normal atmospheric pressure.
    (3) The volume of the commodity stacked inside the treatment 
enclosure must not exceed \2/3\ of the volume of the enclosure. Stacking 
must be approved by an official authorized by APHIS before treatment 
begins. All commodities undergoing treatment must be listed on the 
label.
    (4) Recording and measuring equipment must be adequate to accurately 
monitor the gas concentration, to ensure the correct amount of gas 
reaches the pests, and to detect any leaks in the enclosure. At least 
three sampling tubes or monitoring lines must be used in the treatment 
enclosure.
    (5) An adequate number of blowers or fans must be used inside of the 
treatment enclosure to uniformly distribute gas throughout the 
enclosure. The circulation system must be able to recirculate the entire 
volume of gas in the enclosure in 3 minutes or less.
    (6) The exposure period begins after all gas has been introduced.
    (7) For vacuum fumigation: The vacuum pump must be able to reduce 
pressure in the treatment enclosure to 1-2 inches of mercury in 15 
minutes or less.

    (b) MBSFF, fumigation with methyl bromide for sapote fruit fly. 
Regulated citrus fruits originating inside an area quarantined for 
sapote fruit fly that are to be moved outside the quarantined area may 
be treated with methyl bromide fumigation in APHIS-approved chambers. 
Exposure period for this treatment is 2 hours. To enhance equal 
concentrations of methyl bromide throughout the chamber, a fan should be 
placed near the point of gas introduction, and allowed to run for at 
least 15 minutes. Fruit pulp temperature must be between 21.1 [deg]C and 
29.4 [deg]C (70 [deg]F and 85 [deg]F). This temperature requirement 
refers to fruit pulp only and not to air temperature within the chamber. 
Fruit taken from a cooling room may have to be prewarmed before 
fumigation is attempted. To determine fruit pulp temperature, stab 
several fruit to the center with a suitable thermometer that reads at 
least in whole degrees (F or C). The lowest temperature should be used, 
not the average. The methyl bromide dosage is set at a rate of 2.5 
pounds of 100 percent pure, type ``Q'' (for quarantine use only) methyl 
bromide per 1,000 cubic feet of chamber space. Dosage is based upon 
chamber volume, not the volume of the fruit being treated. Fruit should 
be in cartons approved for fumigation. Cartons must be placed on 
pallets. There should be an air space of at least 1 foot between 
adjacent pallet loads; at least 1 foot between chamber walls and the 
nearest carton of fruit; and at least 2 feet between the height of the 
stack and the ceiling of the chamber. The compressed liquid methyl 
bromide inside the cylinder must be put through a volatilizer prior to 
injection into the chamber. Water temperature in the volatilizer must 
never fall below 65.6 [deg]C (150 [deg]F) at any time during gas 
injection. However, if, prior to treatment, representative sampling 
reveals a level of infestation greater than 0.5 percent for the lot, 
then the fruit is ineligible for treatment.

<R04>
                         Subpart_Cold Treatments


<R05>
Sec. 305.15  Treatment requirements.

    (a) Approval of treatment facilities. All facilities or locations 
used for refrigerating fruits or vegetables in accordance with Sec. 
305.16 must be approved by APHIS. Re-approval of the facility or carrier 
is required annually, or as often as APHIS directs, depending on 
treatments performed, commodities handled, and operations conducted at 
the facility. In order to be approved, facilities and carriers must:
    (1) Be capable of keeping treated and untreated fruits, vegetables, 
or other articles separate so as to prevent reinfestation of articles 
and spread of pests;
    (2) Have equipment that is adequate to effectively perform cold 
treatment.
    (b) Places of treatment; ports of entry. Precooling and 
refrigeration may be performed prior to, or upon arrival of fruits and 
vegetables in the United States, provided treatments are performed in 
accordance with applicable requirements of this section. Fruits and 
vegetables that are not treated prior to arrival in the United States 
must be treated after arrival only in cold storage warehouses approved 
by the Administrator and located in the area north of 39[deg] longitude 
and east of 104[deg] latitude or at one of the following ports: The 
maritime ports of Wilmington, NC; Seattle, WA; Corpus Christi, TX; and 
Gulfport, MS; Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Seattle, WA; and 
Hartsfield-Atlanta International Airport, Atlanta, GA.
    (c) Cold treatment enclosures. All enclosures in which cold 
treatment is performed, including refrigerated containers, must:
    (1) Be capable of maintaining the treatment temperature before the 
treatment begins and holding fruit at or below the treatment temperature 
during the treatment.
    (2) Maintain fruit pulp temperatures according to treatment 
schedules with no more than a 0.39 [deg]C (0.7 [deg]F) variation in 
temperature.
    (3) Be structurally sound and adequate to maintain required 
temperatures.
    (d) Treatment procedures. (1) All material, labor, and equipment for 
cold treatment performed on vessels must be provided by the vessel or 
vessel agent. An official authorized by APHIS monitors, manages, and 
advises in order to ensure that the treatment procedures are followed.
    (2) Refrigeration must be completed in the container, compartment, 
or room in which it is begun.
    (3) Fruit that may be cold treated must be safeguarded to prevent 
cross-contamination or mixing with other infested fruit.
    (4) Fruit intended for in-transit cold treatment must be precooled 
to the temperature at which the fruit will be treated prior to beginning 
treatment. The in-transit treatment enclosure may not be used for 
precooling unless

[[Page 211]]

an official authorized by APHIS approves the loading of the fruit in the 
treatment enclosure as adequate to allow for fruit pulp temperatures to 
be taken prior to beginning treatment. If the fruit is precooled outside 
the treatment enclosure, an official authorized by APHIS will take pulp 
temperatures manually from a sample of the fruit as the fruit is loaded 
for in-transit cold treatment to verify that precooling was completed. 
If the pulp temperatures for the sample are 0.28 C (0.5 F) or more above 
the temperature at which the fruit will be treated, the pallet from 
which the sample was taken will be rejected and returned for additional 
precooling until the fruit reaches the treatment temperature. If fruit 
is precooled in the treatment enclosure, or if treatment is conducted at 
a cold treatment facility in the United States, the fruit must be 
precooled to the temperature at which it will be treated, as verified by 
an official authorized by APHIS, prior to beginning treatment.
    (5) Breaks, damage, etc., in the treatment enclosure that preclude 
maintaining correct temperatures must be repaired before the enclosure 
is used. An official authorized by APHIS must approve loading of 
compartment, number and placement of temperature probes or sensors, and 
initial fruit temperature readings before beginning the treatment. 
Hanging decks and hatch coamings within vessels may not be used as 
enclosures for in-transit cold treatment without prior written approval 
from APHIS. Double-stacking of pallets is not allowed.
    (6) Only the same type of fruit in the same type of package may be 
treated together in a container; no mixture of fruits in containers may 
be treated. A numbered seal must be placed on the doors of the loaded 
container and may be removed only at the port of destination by an 
official authorized by APHIS.
    (7) Temperature recording devices used during treatment must be 
password-protected and tamperproof. The devices must be able to record 
the date, time, and sensor number and automatic and continuous records 
of the temperature during all calibrations and during treatment. 
Recording devises must be capable of generating temperature charts for 
verification by an inspector. If records of calibrations or treatments 
are found to have been manipulated, the vessel or container in which the 
treatment is performed may be suspended from conducting cold treatments 
until proper equipment is installed and an official authorized by APHIS 
has recertified it. APHIS' decision to recertify a vessel or container 
will take into account the severity of the infraction that led to 
suspension.
    (8) A minimum of four temperature probes or sensors is required for 
vessel holds used as treatment enclosures. A minimum of three 
temperature probes or sensors is required for other treatment 
enclosures. An official authorized by APHIS will have the option to 
require that additional temperature probes or sensors be used, depending 
on the size of the treatment enclosure.
    (9) Fruit pulp temperatures must be maintained at the temperature 
specified in the treatment schedule with no more than a 0.39 C (0.7 
[deg]F) variation in temperature between two consecutive hourly 
readings. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in 
invalidation of the treatment unless an official authorized by APHIS can 
verify that the pulp temperature was maintained at or below the 
treatment temperature for the duration of the treatment.
    (10) The time required to complete the treatment begins when all 
temperature probes reach the prescribed cold treatment schedule 
temperature. Refrigeration continues until the vessel arrives at the 
port of destination and the fruit is released for unloading by an 
inspector even though this may prolong the period required for the cold 
treatment.
    (11) Temperatures must be recorded at intervals no longer than 1 
hour apart. Gaps of longer than 1 hour will invalidate the treatment or 
indicate treatment failure unless an official authorized by APHIS can 
verify that the pulp temperature was maintained at or below the 
treatment temperature for the duration of the treatment.
    (12) Cold treatment is not completed until so declared by an 
official authorized by APHIS or the certifying official of the foreign 
country; consignments of

[[Page 212]]

treated commodities may not be discharged until APHIS clearance has been 
fully completed, including review and approval of treatment record 
charts.
    (13) Cold treatment of fruits in break bulk vessels or containers 
must be initiated by an official authorized by APHIS if there is not a 
treatment technician who has been trained to initiate cold treatments 
for either break bulk vessels or containers.
    (14) An official authorized by APHIS may perform audits to ensure 
that the treatment procedures comply with the regulations in this 
subpart. The official authorized by APHIS must be given the appropriate 
materials and access to the facility, container, or vessel necessary to 
perform the audits.
    (15) Inspection of fruits after cold treatment for Mediterranean 
fruit fly. An inspector will sample and cut fruit from each consignment 
cold treated for Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly) to monitor treatment 
effectiveness. If a single live Medfly in any stage of development is 
found, the consignment will be held until an investigation is completed 
and appropriate remedial actions have been implemented. If APHIS 
determines at any time that the safeguards contained in this section do 
not appear to be effective against the Medfly, APHIS may suspend the 
importation of fruits from the originating country and conduct an 
investigation into the cause of the deficiency.
    (16) Caution and disclaimer. The cold treatments required for the 
entry of fruit are considered necessary for the elimination of plant 
pests, and no liability shall attach to the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture or to any officer or representative of that Department in 
the event injury results to fruit offered for entry in accordance with 
these instructions. In prescribing cold treatments of certain fruits, it 
should be emphasized that inexactness and carelessness in applying the 
treatments may result in injury to the fruit or its rejection for entry.
    (e) Monitoring. Treatment must be monitored by an inspector to 
ensure proper administration of the treatment. An inspector must also 
approve the recording devices and sensors used to monitor temperatures 
and conduct an operational check of the equipment before each use and 
ensure sensors are calibrated. An inspector may approve, adjust, or 
reject the treatment.
    (f) Compliance agreements. Facilities located in the United States 
must operate under a compliance agreement with APHIS. The compliance 
agreement must be signed by a representative of the cold treatment 
facility and APHIS. The compliance agreement must contain requirements 
for equipment, temperature, circulation, and other operational 
requirements for performing cold treatment to ensure that treatments are 
administered properly. Compliance agreements must allow officials of 
APHIS to inspect the facility to monitor compliance with the 
regulations.
    (g) Work plans. Facilities located outside the United States may 
operate in accordance with a bilateral work plan. The work plan, if and 
when required, must be signed by a representative of the cold treatment 
facility, the national plant protection organization (NPPO) of the 
country of origin, and APHIS. The work plans must contain requirements 
for equipment, temperature, circulation, and other operational 
requirements for performing cold treatment to ensure that cold 
treatments are administered properly. Work plans for facilities outside 
the United States may also include trust fund agreement information 
regarding payment of the salaries and expenses of APHIS employees on 
site. Work plans must allow officials of the NPPO and APHIS to inspect 
the facility to monitor compliance with APHIS regulations.
    (h) Additional requirements for treatments performed after arrival 
in the United States--(1) Maritime port of Wilmington, NC. Consignments 
of fruit arriving at the maritime port of Wilmington, NC, for cold

Sec. 305.20  Treatment requirements.

    (a) Certified facility. The treatment facility must be certified by 
APHIS. Recertification is required annually, or as often as APHIS 
directs, depending upon treatments performed, commodities handled, and 
operations conducted at the facility. In order to be certified, a heat 
treatment facility must:
    (1) Have equipment that is capable of adequately circulating air or 
water (as relevant to the treatment), changing

[[Page 216]]

the temperature, and maintaining the changed temperature sufficient to 
meet the treatment schedule parameters.
    (2) Have equipment used to record, monitor, or sense temperature, 
maintained in proper working order.
    (3) Keep treated and untreated fruits, vegetables, or articles 
separate so as to prevent reinfestation and spread of pests.
    (b) Monitoring. Treatment must be monitored by an official 
authorized by APHIS to ensure proper administration of the treatment. An 
official authorized by APHIS approves, adjusts, or rejects the 
treatment.
    (c) Compliance agreements. Facilities located in the United States 
must operate under a compliance agreement with APHIS. The compliance 
agreement must be signed by a representative of the heat treatment 
facilities located in the United States and APHIS. The compliance 
agreement must contain requirements for equipment, temperature, water 
quality, circulation, and other measures for performing heat treatments 
to ensure that treatments are administered properly. Compliance 
agreements must allow officials of APHIS to inspect the facility to 
monitor compliance with the regulations.
    (d) Work plans. Facilities located outside the United States must 
operate in accordance with a work plan. The work plan must be signed by 
a representative of the heat treatment facilities located outside the 
United States the national plant protection organization of the country 
of origin (NPPO), and APHIS. The work plan must contain requirements for 
equipment, temperature, water quality, circulation, and other measures 
to ensure that heat treatments are administered properly. Work plans for 
facilities outside the United States must include trust fund agreement 
information regarding payment of the salaries and expenses of APHIS 
employees on site. Work plans must allow officials of the NPPO and APHIS 
to inspect the facility to monitor compliance with APHIS regulations.
    (e) Treatment procedures. (1) Before each treatment can begin, an 
official authorized by APHIS must approve the loading of the commodity 
in the treatment container.
    (2) Sensor equipment must be adequate to monitor the treatment, its 
type and placement must be approved by an official authorized by APHIS, 
and the equipment must be tested by an official authorized by APHIS 
prior to beginning the treatment. Sensor equipment must be locked before 
each treatment to prevent tampering.
    (3) Fruits, vegetables, or articles of substantially different sizes 
must be treated separately; oversized fruit may be rejected by an 
official authorized by APHIS.
    (4) The treatment period begins when the temperature specified by 
the treatment schedule has been reached. An official authorized by APHIS 
may abort the treatment if the facility requires an unreasonably long 
time to achieve the required temperature.

be increased using saturated water vapor at 112 [deg]F until the 
approximate center of the fruit reaches 112 [deg]F. The fruit 
temperature must be held at 112 [deg]F for 8.75 hours; then immediately 
cooled.
    (d) T106-c (Quick run-up). (1) The temperature of the article must 
be increased until the approximate center of fruit reaches 117 [deg]F in 
a time period of at least 4 hours.
    (2) During the last hour of treatment, the relative humidity in the 
chamber must be maintained at 90 percent or greater.
    (e) T106-d. (1) The fruit must be sized before treatment. 
Temperature probes must be placed in the center of the largest fruits. 
The temperature of the fruit must be increased using saturated water 
vapor at 117.5 [deg]F until the pulp temperature near the seed reaches 
115.7 [deg]F. The pulp temperature must be held at 115.7 [deg]F or above 
for 30 minutes; then immediately cooled.
    (f) T106-d-1. (1) The fruit must be sized before the treatment. 
Temperature probes must be placed in the center of the largest fruits.
    (2) The temperature of the fruit must be increased using saturated 
water vapor at 117.5 [deg]F until the center of the fruit reaches 114.8 
[deg]F in a minimum of 4 hours.
    (3) The fruit temperature must be maintained at 114.8 [deg]F for 10 
minutes.
    (g) T106-e. (1) Raise temperature of the fruit using saturated water 
vapor at 116.6 [deg]F until the approximate center of the fruit reaches 
114.8 [deg]F within a minimum time period of 4 hours.
    (2) Hold fruit temperature at 114.8 [deg]F or above for 20 minutes. 
If post-treatment cooling is conducted, wait 30 minutes after the 
treatment to start the forced cooling process.
    (h) T106-f. (1) The temperature probes must be placed in the 
approximate center of the largest fruits at the seed's surface.
    (2) The temperature of the fruit must be increased to 117 [deg]F. 
The total runup time for all sensors must take at least 60 minutes.
    (3) The fruit temperature must be held at 117 [deg]F or above for 20 
minutes. During the treatment, the relative humidity must be maintained 
at 90 percent or greater.
    (4) The fruit must be hydrocooled under a cool water spray until the 
fruit sensors reach ambient temperature.
    (5) Inspectors will examine the fruit for live quarantine pests. If 
pests are found, the inspector will reject the treatment.
    (i) T106-g. (1) The internal temperature of the fruit must be 
increased using saturated water vapor until the approximate center of 
fruit reaches 117 [deg]F in a minimum time of 1 hour or longer.
    (2) The fruit temperature must be held at 117 [deg]F or above for 20 
minutes. During the treatment, the relative humidity must be maintained 
at 90 percent or greater.
    (j) T412-b-2. The commodity must be heated to 212 [deg]F for 15 
minutes.
    (k) Vapor heat treatment for sweetpotatoes moved interstate from 
Hawaii. (1) Temperature probes must be placed in the approximate center 
of the largest individual sweetpotato roots.
    (2) The air surrounding the sweetpotato roots must be heated. After 
the temperature of the air surrounding the sweetpotato roots reaches 
87.8 [deg]F (31 [deg]C), its temperature must be incrementally raised 
from 87.8 [deg]F (31 [deg]C) to 111.2 [deg]F (44 [deg]C) over a period 
of 240 minutes.
    (3) Using saturated water vapor at 118.4 [deg]F (48 [deg]C), the 
core temperature of the individual sweetpotato roots must be raised to 
116.6 [deg]F (47 [deg]C).
    (4) After the core temperature of the sweetpotato roots reaches 
116.6 [deg]F (47 [deg]C), the core temperature must then be held at 
116.6 [deg]F (47 [deg]C) or higher for 190 minutes.

\1\ A minimum of two temperature probes must be placed in the heat treating equipment in order to determine that
  all niger seed being treated reaches the target temperature. The treatment temperature must be recorded
  accurately, precisely, and regularly during treatment. The monitoring equipment must be locked before each
  treatment begins to prevent tampering. Seed processing equipment must have the capability to divert for
  retreatment any nontreated seeds or treated seeds that do not meet treatment standards.


<R05>
Sec. 305.26  Khapra beetle treatment schedule for feeds and milled products.

    Feeds and milled products may be treated for khapra beetle using 
schedule T307-a. The temperature must be 180 [deg]F in any part of the 
products, or the temperature must be at 150 [deg]F for a total of 7 
minutes. All parts of the commodity being moved through or manipulated 
in the heated area must meet the time and temperature requirements. This 
treatment must be specifically authorized in each case by the Director 
of Plant Health Programs, PPQ, APHIS.


<R05>
Sec. 305.27  Forced hot air treatment schedules.

    (a) T103-a-1. (1) The temperature probes must be placed into the 
center of the largest fruit in the load. The number and placement of 
temperature probes must be approved by APHIS' Center for Plant Health 
Science and Technology (CPHST) before APHIS can authorize treatment. 
CPHST grants approval of treatment equipment and facilities through a 
chamber certification procedure.
    (2) APHIS may reject the treatment if the size of an individual 
fruit exceeds the maximum size authorized by APHIS.
    (3) Fruit can be sized before or after the heat treatment. The 
largest fruit in a load can be identified by either sizing all fruit 
prior to heating and selecting the largest size class in the load or 
acquiring fruit of the largest permitted maximum commercial size class.
    (4) The fruit containing the temperature probes must be placed 
inside the hot air chamber at chamber locations specified by APHIS 
during the chamber certification.
    (5) Fruit temperature must be increased within specifications:
    (i) The fruit center temperature must be increased to 111.2 [deg]F 
within 90 minutes or more (minimum approach time is 90 minutes) for all 
temperature probes.
    (ii) The fruit center temperature must be kept at 111.2 [deg]F or 
hotter for 100 minutes.
    (iii) The temperature of the fruit center must be recorded every 2 
minutes for the duration of the treatment.
    (iv) The total treatment time will vary with the time required to 
reach 111.2 [deg]F.
    (v) Fruit must be cooled after the treatment is completed.
    (b) T103-b-1, T103-d-1, and T103-d-2. (1)Temperature sensors must be 
inserted into the centers of the largest fruits. The number of sensors 
must be approved in advance by APHIS. Sensors must be physically placed 
in various parts of the load so that high, middle, and low areas are all 
represented.
    (2) Fruit (placed in open trays, bulk bins, or ventilated boxes) 
must be loaded into the treatment chamber, and sensors must be attached 
to the recorder monitor.

[[Page 221]]

    (3) The monitor must be set to record temperatures from all sensors 
at least once every 5 minutes.
    (4) The fruit in the chamber must be heated using forced hot air, 
until the fruit center temperature (all sensors) reaches at least 117 
[deg]F. Treatment time may vary, but in every case, it must be at least 
4 hours in duration, which includes the lead-up time. The total time 
required for the fruit to reach 117 [deg]F is counted as part of the 4-
hour minimum treatment time.
    (5) The temperature of the forced air used to heat the fruit in the 
chamber may be constant or increased in a series of two or more steps or 
ramped over the treatment duration.
    (6) The fruit may be cooled by forced air or hydrocooling. Cooling 
can be initiated immediately after all sensors reach at least 117 
[deg]F.
    (c) T103-c-1. (1) Size and weight of fruit: Standard fruit size 8-
14; must not exceed 1\1/2\ pounds.
    (2) At least three of the largest mangoes must be probed at the 
seed's surface. Sensors must be inserted into the thickest portion of 
the fruit's pulp.
    (3) The temperature must be recorded at least once every 2 minutes 
until the treatment is concluded.
    (4) Air heated to 122 [deg]F must be introduced in the chamber.
    (5) The treatment must be concluded once the temperature at the 
seed's surface reaches 118 [deg]F.
    (d) T103-e. (1) The temperature of the fruit must be raised using 
forced hot air until the fruit center temperature (all sensors) reaches 
at least 117 [deg]F in a minimum time of 1 hour. Heat the fruit in the 
chamber.
    (2) The fruit temperature must be held at 117 [deg]F or above for 20 
minutes. During the treatment, the relative humidity must be maintained 
at 90 percent or greater.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ There is a possibility that some cut flowers could be damaged by
  such irradiation. See paragraph (n) of this section.

    (b) Location of facilities. Where certified irradiation facilities 
are available, an approved irradiation treatment may be conducted for 
any articles either prior to shipment to the United States or in the 
United States. Irradiation facilities certified under this section may 
be located in any State on the mainland United States except Alabama, 
Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, \1\ Kentucky, Louisiana, 
Mississippi, \1\ Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, \1\ South Carolina, 
Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. Prior to treatment, the articles to be 
irradiated may not move into or through any of the States listed in this 
paragraph, except that movement is allowed through Dallas/Fort Worth, 
Texas, as an authorized stop for air cargo, or as a transloading 
location for shipments that arrive by air but that are subsequently 
transloaded into trucks for overland movement from Dallas/Fort Worth 
into an authorized State by the shortest route.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Irradiation facilities may be located at the maritime ports of 
Gulfport, MS, or Wilmington, NC, or the airport of Atlanta, GA, if the 
following special conditions are met: The articles to be irradiated must 
be imported packaged in accordance with paragraph (g)(2)(i)(A) of this 
section; the irradiation facility and APHIS must agree in advance on the 
route by which shipments are allowed to move between the vessel on which 
they arrive and the irradiation facility; untreated articles may not be 
removed from their packaging prior to treatment under any circumstances; 
blacklight or sticky paper must be used within the irradiation facility, 
and other trapping methods, including Jackson/methyl eugenol and McPhail 
traps, must be used within the 4 square miles surrounding the facility; 
and the facility must have contingency plans, approved by APHIS, for 
safely destroying or disposing of fruit.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Compliance agreement with importers and facility operators for 
irradiation in the United States. If irradiation is conducted in the 
United States, both the importer and the operator of the irradiation 
facility must sign compliance agreements with the Administrator. In the 
facility compliance agreement, the facility operator must agree to 
comply with any additional requirements found necessary by the 
Administrator to prevent the escape, prior to irradiation, of any fruit 
flies that may be associated with the articles to be irradiated. In the 
importer compliance agreement, the importer must agree to comply with 
any additional requirements found necessary by the Administrator to 
ensure the shipment is not diverted to a destination other than an 
approved treatment facility and to prevent escape of plant pests from 
the articles to be irradiated during their transit from the port of

[[Page 223]]

first arrival to the irradiation facility in the United States.
    (d) Compliance agreement with irradiation facilities outside the 
United States. If irradiation is conducted outside the United States, 
the operator of the irradiation facility must sign a compliance 
agreement with the Administrator and the plant protection service of the 
country in which the facility is located. In this agreement, the 
facility operator must agree to comply with the requirements of this 
section, and the plant protection service of the country in which the 
facility is located must agree to monitor that compliance and to inform 
the Administrator of any noncompliance.
    (e) Certified facility. The irradiation treatment facility must be 
certified by the Administrator. Recertification is required in the event 
of an increase or decrease in the amount of radioisotope, a major 
modification to equipment that affects the delivered dose, or a change 
in the owner or managing entity of the facility. Recertification also 
may be required in cases where a significant variance in dose delivery 
has been measured by the dosimetry system. In order to be certified, a 
facility must:
    (1) Be capable of administering the minimum absorbed ionizing 
radiation doses specified in paragraph (a) of this section to the 
articles; \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ The maximum absorbed ionizing radiation dose and the irradiation 
of food is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration under 21 CFR 
part 179.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Be constructed so as to provide physically separate locations 
for treated and untreated articles, except that articles traveling by 
conveyor directly into the irradiation chamber may pass through an area 
that would otherwise be separated. The locations must be separated by a 
permanent physical barrier such as a wall or chain link fence 6 or more 
feet high to prevent transfer of cartons, or some other means approved 
during certification to prevent reinfestation of articles and spread of 
pests;
    (3) If the facility is located in the United States, the facility 
will only be certified if the Administrator determines that regulated 
articles will be safely transported to the facility from the port of 
arrival without significant risk that plant pests will escape in transit 
or while the regulated articles are at the facility.
    (f) Monitoring and interagency agreements. Treatment must be 
monitored by an inspector. This monitoring will include inspection of 
treatment records and unannounced inspections of the facility by an 
inspector, and may include inspection of articles prior to or after 
irradiation. Facilities that carry out irradiation operations must 
notify the Director of Preclearance, PPQ, APHIS, 4700 River Road Unit 
140, Riverdale, MD 20737-1236, of scheduled operations at least 30 days 
before operations commence, except where otherwise provided in the 
facility preclearance work plan. To ensure the appropriate level of 
monitoring, before articles may be imported in accordance with this 
section, the following agreements must be signed:
    (1) Irradiation treatment framework equivalency work plan. The plant 
protection service of a country from which articles are to be imported 
into the United States in accordance with this section must sign a 
framework equivalency work plan with APHIS. In this plan, both the 
foreign plant protection service and APHIS will specify the following 
items for their respective countries:
    (i) Citations for any requirements that apply to the importation of 
irradiated articles;
    (ii) The type and amount of inspection, monitoring, or other 
activities that will be required in connection with allowing the 
importation of irradiated articles into that country; and
    (iii) Any other conditions that must be met to allow the importation 
of irradiated articles into that country.
    (2) Facility preclearance work plan. Prior to commencing importation 
into the United States of articles treated at a foreign irradiation 
facility, APHIS and the plant protection service of the country from 
which articles are to be imported must jointly develop a preclearance 
work-plan that details the activities that APHIS and the foreign plant 
protection service will carry out in connection with each irradiation

[[Page 224]]

facility to verify the facility's compliance with the requirements of 
this section. Typical activities to be described in this work plan may 
include frequency of visits to the facility by APHIS and foreign plant 
protection inspectors, methods for reviewing facility records, and 
methods for verifying that facilities are in compliance with the 
requirements for separation of articles, packaging, labeling, and other 
requirements of this section. This facility preclearance work plan will 
be reviewed and renewed by APHIS and the foreign plant protection 
service on an annual basis.
    (3) Trust fund agreement. Irradiated articles may be imported into 
the United States in accordance with this section only if the plant 
protection service of the country in which the irradiation facility is 
located has entered into a trust fund agreement with APHIS. That 
agreement requires the plant protection service to pay, in advance of 
each shipping season, all costs that APHIS estimates it will incur in 
providing inspection and treatment monitoring services at the 
irradiation facility during that shipping season. Those costs include 
administrative expenses and all salaries (including overtime and the 
Federal share of employee benefits), travel expenses (including per diem 
expenses), and other incidental expenses incurred by APHIS in performing 
these services. The agreement will describe the general nature and scope 
of APHIS services provided at irradiation facilities covered by the 
agreement, such as whether APHIS inspectors will monitor operations 
continuously or intermittently, and will generally describe the extent 
of inspections APHIS will perform on articles prior to and after 
irradiation. The agreement requires the plant protection service to 
deposit a certified or cashier's check with APHIS for the amount of 
those costs, as estimated by APHIS. If the deposit is not sufficient to 
meet all costs incurred by APHIS, the agreement further requires the 
plant protection service to deposit with APHIS a certified or cashier's 
check for the amount of the remaining costs, as determined by APHIS, 
before any more articles irradiated in that country may be imported into 
the United States. After a final audit at the conclusion of each 
shipping season, any overpayment of funds would be returned to the plant 
protection service or held on account until needed, at the option of the 
plant protection service.
    (g) Packaging. Articles that are irradiated in accordance with this 
section must be packaged in cartons in the following manner:
    (1) All articles treated with irradiation must be shipped in the 
same cartons in which they are treated. Irradiated articles may not be 
packaged for shipment in a carton with nonirradiated articles.
    (2) For all articles to be irradiated upon arrival in the United 
States, the articles must be packed in cartons that have no openings 
that will allow the entry of fruit flies and that are sealed with seals 
that will visually indicate if the cartons have been opened. They may be 
constructed of any material that prevents the entry of fruit flies and 
prevents oviposition by fruit flies into the fruit in the carton.
    (3) For all articles irradiated prior to arrival in the United 
States:
    (i) The articles to be irradiated must be packaged either:
    (A) In insect-proof cartons that have no openings that will allow 
the entry of fruit flies. The cartons must be sealed with seals that 
will visually indicate if the cartons have been opened. The cartons may 
be constructed of any material that prevents the entry of fruit flies 
and prevents oviposition by fruit flies into the articles in the carton 
\3\; or
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ If there is a question as to the adequacy of a carton, send a 
request for approval of the carton, together with a sample carton, to 
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and 
Quarantine, Center for Plant Health Science and Technology, 1730 Varsity 
Drive, Suite 400, Raleigh, NC 27606.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (B) In noninsect-proof cartons that are stored immediately after 
irradiation in a room completely enclosed by walls or screening that 
completely precludes access by fruit flies. If stored in noninsect-proof 
cartons in a room that precludes access by fruit flies, prior to leaving 
the room each pallet of cartons must be completely enclosed in 
polyethylene, shrink-wrap, or another solid

[[Page 225]]

or netting covering that completely precludes access to the cartons by 
fruit flies.
    (ii) To preserve the identity of treated lots, each pallet-load of 
cartons containing the articles must be wrapped before leaving the 
irradiation facility in one of the following ways:
    (A) With polyethylene shrink wrap;
    (B) With net wrapping; or
    (C) With strapping so that each carton on an outside row of the 
pallet load is constrained by a metal or plastic strap.
    (iii) Packaging must be labeled with treatment lot numbers, packing 
and treatment facility identification and location, and dates of packing 
and treatment. Pallets that remain intact as one unit until entry into 
the United States may have one such label per pallet. Pallets that are 
broken apart into smaller units prior to or during entry into the United 
States must have the required label information on each individual 
carton.
    (h) Containers or vans. Containers or vans that will transport 
treated commodities must be free of pests prior to loading the treated 
commodities.
    (i) Phytosanitary certificate. For each shipment treated in an 
irradiation facility outside the United States, a phytosanitary 
certificate, with the treatment section completed and issued by the 
national plant protection organization, must accompany the shipment.
    (j) Dosimetry systems at the irradiation facility. (1) Dosimetry 
mapping must indicate the doses needed to ensure that all the commodity 
will receive the minimum dose prescribed.
    (2) Absorbed dose must be measured using an accurate dosimetry 
system that ensures that the absorbed dose meets or exceeds the absorbed 
dose required by paragraph (a) of this section (150, 210, 225, 250, or 
300 gray, depending on the target species of fruit fly or seed weevil).
    (3) When designing the facility's dosimetry system and procedures 
for its operation, the facility operator must address guidance and 
principles from American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)

    (k) Records. An irradiation processor must maintain records of each 
treated lot for 1 year following the treatment date and must make these 
records available for inspection by an inspector during normal business 
hours (8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays). 
These records must include the lot identification, scheduled process, 
evidence of compliance with the scheduled process, ionizing energy 
source, source calibration, dosimetry, dose distribution in the product, 
and the date of irradiation.
    (l) Request for certification and inspection of facility. Persons 
requesting certification of an irradiation treatment facility must 
submit the request for approval in writing to the Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Center for 
Plant Health Science and Technology, 1730 Varsity Drive, Suite 400, 
Raleigh, NC 27606. The initial request must identify the owner, 
location, and radiation source of the facility, and the applicant must 
supply additional information about the facility construction, treatment 
protocols, and operations upon request by APHIS if APHIS requires 
additional information to evaluate the request. Before the Administrator 
determines whether an irradiation facility is eligible for 
certification, an inspector will make a personal inspection of the 
facility to determine whether it complies with the standards of this 
section.
    (m) Denial and withdrawal of certification. (1) The Administrator 
will withdraw the certification of any irradiation treatment facility 
upon written request from the irradiation processor.
    (2) The Administrator will deny or withdraw certification of an 
irradiation treatment facility when any provision of this section is not 
met. Before withdrawing or denying certification,

[[Page 226]]

the Administrator will inform the irradiation processor in writing of 
the reasons for the proposed action and provide the irradiation 
processor with an opportunity to respond. The Administrator will give 
the irradiation processor an opportunity for a hearing regarding any 
dispute of a material fact, in accordance with rules of practice that 
will be adopted for the proceeding. However, the Administrator will 
suspend certification pending final determination in the proceeding if 
he or she determines that suspension is necessary to prevent the spread 
of any dangerous insect. The suspension will be effective upon oral or 
written notification, whichever is earlier, to the irradiation 
processor. In the event of oral notification, written confirmation will 
be given to the irradiation processor within 10 days of the oral 
notification. The suspension will continue in effect pending completion 
of the proceeding and any judicial review of the proceeding.
    (n) Department not responsible for damage. This treatment is 
approved to assure quarantine security against the listed plant pests. 
From the literature available, the articles authorized for treatment 
under this section are believed tolerant to the treatment; however, the 
facility operator and shipper are responsible for determination of 
tolerance. The Department of Agriculture and its inspectors assume no 
responsibility for any loss or damage resulting from any treatment 
prescribed or monitored. Additionally, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
is responsible for ensuring that irradiation facilities are constructed 
and operated in a safe manner. Further, the Food and Drug Administration 
is responsible for ensuring that irradiated foods are safe and wholesome 
for human consumption.

Sec. 305.32  Irradiation treatment of regulated fruit to be moved 
interstate from areas quarantined for fruit flies.

    Irradiation, carried out in accordance with the provisions of this 
paragraph, is approved as a treatment for any berry, fruit, nut, or 
vegetable listed as a regulated article in Sec. 301.32-2(a) of this 
chapter.
    (a) Approved facility. The irradiation treatment facility and 
treatment protocol must be approved by the Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service. In order to be approved, a facility must:
    (1) Be capable of administering the approved dose for the fruit fly 
of concern listed in Sec. 305.31(a) to the regulated articles;\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See footnote 2 of this subpart.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Be constructed so as to provide physically separate locations 
for treated and untreated regulated articles, except that articles 
traveling by conveyor directly into the irradiation chamber may pass 
through an area that would otherwise be separated. The locations must be 
separated by a permanent physical barrier such as a wall or chain link 
fence 6 or more feet high to prevent transfer of cartons;
    (3) Complete a compliance agreement with the Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service as provided in Sec. 301.32-6 of this chapter; and
    (4) Be certified by Plant Protection and Quarantine for initial use 
and annually for subsequent use. Recertification is required in the 
event that an increase or decrease in radioisotope or a major 
modification to equipment that affects the delivered dose. 
Recertification may be required in cases where a significant variance in 
dose delivery is indicated.
    (b) Treatment monitoring. Treatment must be carried out under the 
monitoring of an inspector. This monitoring must include inspection of 
treatment records and unannounced inspection visits to the facility by 
an inspector. Facilities that carry out continual irradiation operations 
must notify an inspector at least 24 hours before the date of 
operations. Facilities that carry out periodic irradiation operations 
must notify an inspector of

[[Page 227]]

scheduled operations at least 24 hours before scheduled operations. \6\

    (c) Request for approval and inspection of facility. Persons 
requesting approval of an irradiation treatment facility and treatment 
protocol must submit the request for approval in writing to the Animal 
and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, 
Center for Plant Health Science and Technology, 1730 Varsity Drive, 
Suite 400, Raleigh, NC 27606. Before the Administrator determines 
whether an irradiation facility is eligible for approval, an inspector 
will make a personal inspection of the facility to determine whether it 
complies with the standards of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (d) Denial and withdrawal of approval. (1) The Administrator will 
withdraw the approval of any irradiation treatment facility when the 
irradiation processor requests in writing the withdrawal of approval.
    (2) The Administrator will deny or withdraw approval of an 
irradiation treatment facility when any provision of this section is not 
met. Before withdrawing or denying approval, the Administrator will 
inform the irradiation processor in writing of the reasons for the 
proposed action and provide the irradiation processor with an 
opportunity to respond. The Administrator will give the irradiation 
processor an opportunity for a hearing regarding any dispute of a 
material fact, in accordance with rules of practice that will be adopted 
for the proceeding. However, the Administrator will suspend approval 
pending final determination in the proceeding, if he or she determines 
that suspension is necessary to prevent the spread of any dangerous 
insect infestation. The suspension will be effective upon oral or 
written notification, whichever is earlier, to the irradiation 
processor. In the event of oral notification, written confirmation will 
be given to the irradiation processor within 10 days of the oral 
notification. The suspension will continue in effect pending completion 
of the proceeding and any judicial review of the proceeding.
    (e) Department not responsible for damage. This treatment is 
approved to assure quarantine security against the Trifly complex and 
other plant pests. From the literature available, the articles 
authorized for treatment under this section are believed tolerant to the 
treatment; however, the facility operator and shipper are responsible

[[Page 233]]

for determination of tolerance. The Department of Agriculture and its 
inspectors assume no responsibility for any loss or damage resulting 
from any treatment prescribed or supervised. Additionally, the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission is responsible for ensuring that irradiation 
facilities are constructed and operated in a safe manner. Further, the 
Food and Drug Administration is responsible for ensuring that irradiated 
foods are safe and wholesome for human consumption.

Sec. 318.13-3  General requirements for all regulated articles.

    All regulated articles that are allowed movement under this subpart 
must be moved in accordance with the following requirements, except as 
specifically provided otherwise in this subpart.
    (a) Freedom from plant debris. All regulated articles moved under 
this subpart must be free from plant debris.
    (b) Certification. Certification may be issued for the movement of 
regulated articles under the following conditions:
    (1) Certification on basis of inspection or nature of lot involved. 
Regulated articles may be certified when they have been inspected by an 
inspector and found apparently free from infestation and infection, or 
without such inspection when the inspector determines that the lot for 
consignment is of such a nature that no danger of infestation or 
infection is involved.
    (i) Persons intending to move any articles that may be certified 
must contact the local Plant Protection and Quarantine office as far as 
possible in advance of the contemplated date of shipment in order to 
request an inspection.
    (ii) Persons intending to move any articles that may be certified 
must prepare, handle, and safeguard such articles from infestation or 
reinfestation, and assemble them at such points as the inspector may 
designate, placing them so that inspection may be readily made.
    (2) Certification on basis of treatment. (i) Regulated articles for 
which treatments are approved in part 305 of this chapter may be 
certified if such treatments have been applied in accordance with part 
305 of this chapter and if the articles were handled after such 
treatment in accordance with a compliance agreement executed by the 
applicant for certification or under the supervision of an inspector.
    (ii) Regulated articles certified after treatment in accordance with 
part 305 of this chapter that are taken aboard any ship, vessel, other 
surface craft, or aircraft must be segregated and protected in a manner 
as required by the inspector.
    (c) Limited permits. (1) Limited permits \1\ may be issued by an 
inspector for the movement of certain noncertified regulated articles to 
restricted destinations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Limited permits can be obtained from each State or territory's 
local Plant Protection and Quarantine office.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Limited permits may be issued by an inspector for the movement 
of regulated articles that would otherwise be prohibited movement under 
this subpart, if the articles are to be moved in accordance with Sec. 
318.13-6.
    (3) Except when the regulations specify that an inspector must issue 
the limited permit, limited permits may be issued by a person operating 
under a compliance agreement.
    (d) Compliance agreements. As a condition for the movement of 
regulated articles for which a compliance agreement is required, the 
person entering the compliance agreement must agree to the following:
    (1) That he or she will use any permit or certification issued to 
him or her in accordance with the provisions in the permit, the 
requirements in this subpart, and the compliance agreement;
    (2) That he or she will maintain at his or her establishment such 
safeguards against the establishment and spread of infestation and 
infection and comply with such conditions as to the maintenance of 
identity, handling (including post-treatment handling), and interstate 
movement of regulated articles and the cleaning and treatment of means 
of conveyance and containers used in such movement of the articles, as 
may be required by the inspector in each specific case to prevent the 
spread of infestation or infection; and
    (3) That he or she will allow inspectors to inspect the 
establishment and its operations.
    (e) Attachment of limited permit or verification of certification. 
Except as otherwise provided for certain air cargo and containerized 
cargo on ships moved in accordance with Sec. 318.13-10, each box, bale, 
crate, or other container of regulated articles moved under 
certification or limited permit

[[Page 238]]

shall have the limited permit attached to the outside of the container 
or bear a U.S. Department of Agriculture stamp or inspection sticker 
verifying that the consignment has been certified in accordance with 
paragraph (b) of this section: Provided, That if a limited permit or 
certification is issued for a consignment of more than one container or 
for bulk products, certification shall be stamped on or the limited 
permit shall be attached to the accompanying waybill, manifest, or bill 
of lading.
    (f) Withdrawal of certification, transit permits, limited permits, 
or compliance agreements. Any certification, transit permit, limited 
permit, or compliance agreement which has been issued or authorized may 
be withdrawn by an inspector orally or in writing, if such inspector 
determines that the holder thereof has not complied with all conditions 
under the regulations for the use of such document. If the cancellation 
is oral, the decision and the reasons for the withdrawal shall be 
confirmed in writing as promptly as circumstances allow. Any person 
whose certification, transit permit, limited permit, or compliance 
agreement has been withdrawn may appeal the decision in writing to the 
Administrator within 10 days after receiving the written notification of 
the withdrawal. The appeal shall state all of the facts and reasons upon 
which the person relies to show that the certification, transit permit, 
limited permit, or compliance agreement was wrongfully withdrawn. The 
Administrator shall grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the 
reasons for such decision, as promptly as circumstances allow. If there 
is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing shall be held to 
resolve such conflict. Rules of practice concerning such a hearing will 
be adopted by the Administrator.
    (g) Container marking and identity. Except as provided in Sec. 
318.13-6(c), consignments of regulated articles moved in accordance with 
this subpart must have the following information clearly marked on each 
container or on the waybill, manifest, or bill of lading accompanying 
the articles: Nature and quantity of contents; name and address of 
shipper, owner, or person shipping or forwarding the articles; name and 
address of consignee; shipper's identifying mark and number; and the 
certification stamp or number of the limited permit authorizing 
movement, if one was issued.
    (h) Refusal of movement. An inspector may refuse to allow the 
interstate movement of a regulated article if the inspector finds that 
the regulated article is prohibited, is not accompanied by required 
documentation, is so infested with a plant pest or noxious weed that, in 
the judgment of the inspector, it cannot be cleaned or treated, or 
contains soil or other prohibited contaminants.
    (i) Costs and charges. Services of the inspector during regularly 
assigned hours of duty at the usual places of duty shall be furnished 
without cost to the one requesting such services. APHIS will not assume 
responsibility for any costs or charges, other than those indicated in 
this section, in connection with the inspection, treatment, 
conditioning, storage, forwarding, or any other operation of any 
character incidental to the physical movement of regulated articles or 
plant pests.
    (j) APHIS not responsible for damage. APHIS assumes no 
responsibility for any damage to regulated articles that results from 
the application of treatment or other measures required under this 
subpart (or under part 305 of this chapter) to protect against the 
dissemination of plant pests within the United States.

<R05>
Sec. 318.13-4  Approval of certain fruits and vegetables for 
interstate movement.

    (a) Determination by the Administrator. The Administrator has 
determined that the application of one or more of the designated 
phytosanitary measures cited in paragraph (b) of this section to certain 
fruits and vegetables mitigates the risk posed by those commodities, and 
that such articles may be moved interstate subject to one or more of 
those measures, as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. 
The name and origin of all fruits and vegetables authorized movement 
under this

[[Page 239]]

section, as well as the applicable requirements for their movement, may 
be found on the Internet at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/import--export/
plants/manuals/ports/downloads/hawaii.pdf or http://www.aphis.usda.gov/
import--export/plants/manuals/ports/downloads/puerto--rico.pdf. Fruits 
or vegetables that require phytosanitary measures other than one or more 
of the designated phytosanitary measures cited in paragraph (b) of this 
section may only be moved in accordance with applicable requirements in 
Sec. 318.13-3 and regulated article-specific requirements contained 
elsewhere in this subpart.
    (b) Designated phytosanitary measures. (1) The fruits and vegetables 
are inspected in the State of origin or in the first State of arrival.
    (2) The fruits and vegetables originated from a pest-free area in 
the State of origin and the grower from which the fruit or vegetable 
originated has entered into a compliance agreement with the 
Administrator.
    (3) The fruits and vegetables are treated in accordance with part 
305 of this chapter and the treatment is certified by an inspector.
    (4) The fruits and vegetables articles are inspected and certified 
in the State of origin by an inspector and have been found free of one 
or more specific quarantine pests identified by risk analysis as likely 
to follow the pathway.
    (5) The fruits and vegetables are moved as commercial consignments 
only.
    (6) The fruits and vegetables may be distributed only within a 
defined area and the boxes or containers in which the fruit or 
vegetables are distributed must be marked to indicate the applicable 
distribution restrictions.
    (c) Fruits and vegetables authorized for interstate movement under 
this section--(1) Previously approved fruits and vegetables. Fruits and 
vegetables that were authorized movement under this subpart either 
administratively or by specific regulation as of February 17, 2009 and 
that were subject only to one or more of the designated phytosanitary 
measures cited in paragraph (b) of this section and the general 
requirements of Sec. 318.13-3 may continue to be moved interstate under 
the same requirements that applied before February 17, 2009, except as 
provided in paragraph (d) of this section. The interstate movement 
conditions for those fruits and vegetables that were authorized movement 
under this subpart subject to additional measures beyond the designated 
measures in paragraph (b) of this section can be found in Sec. 318.13-
16 or one of the commodity-specific sections in this subpart.

movement under this section as follows:
    (i) Pest risk analysis. The risk posed by the particular article 
from a specified State has been evaluated and publicly communicated as 
follows:
    (A) Availability of pest risk analysis. APHIS published in the 
Federal Register, for a public comment period of 60 days, a notice 
announcing the availability of a pest risk analysis that evaluated the 
risks associated with the movement of the particular fruit or vegetable.
    (B) Determination of risk; factors considered. The Administrator 
determined, and announced in the notice referred to in the previous 
paragraph, that, based on the information available, the application of 
one or more of the designated phytosanitary measures described in 
paragraph (b) of this section is sufficient to mitigate the risk that 
plant pests or noxious weeds could be introduced into or disseminated 
elsewhere within the United States by the fruit or vegetable. In order 
for the Administrator to make the determination described in this 
paragraph, he or she must conclude based on the information presented in 
the risk analysis for the fruit or vegetable that the risk posed by each 
quarantine pest associated with the fruit or vegetable in the State of 
origin is mitigated by one or more of the following factors:
    (1) Inspection. A quarantine pest is associated with the fruit or 
vegetable in the State of origin, but the pest can be easily detected 
via inspection in the State of origin or in the State of first arrival;
    (2) Pest freedom. No quarantine pests are known to be associated 
with the

[[Page 240]]

fruit or vegetable in the State of origin, or a quarantine pest is 
associated with the fruit or vegetable in the State of origin but the 
fruit or vegetable originates from an area that meets the requirements 
of Sec. 318.13-5 for pest freedom;
    (3) Effectiveness of treatment. A quarantine pest is associated with 
the fruit or vegetable in the State of origin, but the risk posed by the 
pest can be reduced by applying an approved post-harvest treatment to 
the fruit or vegetable;
    (4) Predeparture inspection. A quarantine pest is associated with 
the fruit or vegetable in the State of origin, but the fruit or 
vegetable is subject to predeparture inspection;
    (5) Commercial consignments. A quarantine pest is associated with 
the fruit or vegetable in the State of origin, but the risk posed by the 
pest can be reduced by commercial practices.
    (6) Limited distribution. A quarantine pest is associated with the 
fruit or vegetable in the State of origin, but the risk posed by the 
pest can be reduced by limiting distribution of the fruit or vegetable 
and labeling boxes containing the fruit or vegetable with those 
distribution instructions.
    (ii) Administrator's decision. The Administrator will announce his 
or her decision in a subsequent Federal Register notice. If appropriate, 
APHIS would begin allowing the interstate movement of the fruits or 
vegetables subject to requirements specified in the notice because:
    (A) No comments were received on the pest risk analysis;
    (B) The comments on the pest risk analysis revealed that no changes 
to the pest risk analysis were necessary; or
    (C) Changes to the pest risk analysis were made in response to 
public comments, but the changes did not affect the overall conclusions 
of the analysis and the Administrator's determination of risk.
    (d) Amendment of interstate movement requirements. If, after 
February 17, 2009, the Administrator determines that one or more of the 
designated phytosanitary measures is not sufficient to mitigate the risk 
posed by any fruit or vegetable authorized interstate movement under 
this section, APHIS will prohibit or further restrict the interstate 
movement of the fruit or vegetable pending resolution of the situation. 
If APHIS concludes that a permanent change to the interstate movement 
requirements of a particular fruit or vegetable is necessary, APHIS will 
also publish a notice in the Federal Register advising the public of its 
finding. The notice will specify the amended interstate movement 
requirements, provide an effective date for the change, and invite 
public comment on the subject.

Sec. 318.13-5  Pest-free areas.

    Certain fruits or vegetables may be moved interstate provided that 
the fruits or vegetables originate from an area that is free of a 
specific pest or pests. In some cases, fruits or vegetables may only be 
moved interstate if the area of origin is free of all plant pests that 
attack the fruits or vegetables. In other cases, fruits or vegetables 
may be moved interstate if the area of origin is free of one or more 
plant pests that attack the fruit or vegetable and the risk posed by the 
remaining plant pests that attack the fruit or vegetable is mitigated by 
other specific phytosanitary measures contained in the regulations in 
this subpart.
    (a) Application of standards for pest-free areas. APHIS will make a 
determination of an area's pest-free status based on information 
provided by the State. The information used to make this determination 
will include trapping and surveillance data, survey protocols, and 
protocols for actions to be performed upon detection of a pest.
    (b) Survey protocols. APHIS must approve the survey protocol used to 
determine and maintain pest-free status, as well as protocols for 
actions to be performed upon detection of a pest. Pest-free areas are 
subject to audit by APHIS to verify their status.
    (c) Determination of pest freedom. (1) For an area to be considered 
free of a specified pest for the purposes of this subpart, the 
Administrator must determine, and announce in a notice published in the 
Federal Register for a

[[Page 241]]

public comment period of 60 days, that the area meets the criteria of 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (2) The Administrator will announce his or her decision in a 
subsequent Federal Register notice. If appropriate, APHIS will allow 
movement of the regulated article from a pest-free area because:
    (i) No comments were received on the notice or
    (ii) The comments on the notice did not affect the overall 
conclusions of the notice and the Administrator's determination of risk.
    (d) Decertification of pest-free areas; reinstatement. If a pest is 
detected in an area that is designated as free of that pest, APHIS will 
publish in the Federal Register a notice announcing that the pest-free 
status of the area in question has been withdrawn and that interstate 
movement of host crops for the pest in question is subject to 
application of an approved treatment for the pest. If a treatment for 
the pest is not available, interstate movement of the host crops would 
be prohibited. In order for a decertified pest-free area to be 
reinstated, it would have to meet the criteria of paragraphs (a) through 
(c) of this section.
    (e) General requirements for the interstate movement of regulated 
articles from pest-free areas--(1) Labeling. Each box of fruits or 
vegetables that is moved interstate from a pest-free area under this 
subpart must be clearly labeled with:
    (i) The name of the orchard or grove of origin, or the name of the 
grower; and
    (ii) The name of the municipality and State or territory in which 
the fruits or vegetables were produced; and
    (iii) The type and amount of fruits or vegetables the box contains.
    (2) Compliance agreement. Persons wishing to move fruits or 
vegetables from a pest-free area in Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the U.S. Virgin Islands 
must enter into a compliance agreement with APHIS in accordance with 
Sec. 318.13-3(d).
    (3) Safeguarding. If fruits or vegetables are moved from a pest-free 
area into or through an area that is not free of that pest, the fruits 
or vegetables must be safeguarded during the time they are present in a 
non-pest-free area by being covered with insect-proof mesh screens or 
plastic tarpaulins, including while in transit to the packinghouse and 
while awaiting packaging. If fruits or vegetables are moved through an 
area that is not free of that pest during transit to a port, they must 
be packed in insect-proof cartons or containers or be covered by insect-
proof mesh or plastic tarpaulins during transit to the port and 
subsequent movement into or through the United States. These safeguards 
described in this section must remain intact until the fruits or 
vegetables reach their final destination.

    (b) Limited permit. Fruits or vegetables shipped from Hawaii, Puerto 
Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the 
U.S. Virgin Islands through the continental United States under this 
section must be accompanied by a limited permit, a copy of which must be 
presented to an inspector at the port of arrival and the port of export 
in the continental United States, and at any other location in the 
continental United States where an air consignment is authorized to stop 
or where overland consignments change means of conveyance. An inspector 
will issue a limited permit if the following conditions are met:
    (1) The inspector determines that the specific type and quantity of 
the fruits or vegetables being shipped are accurately described by 
accompanying documentation, such as the accompanying manifest, waybill, 
and bill of lading. (Only scientific or English common names are

in accordance with this section may not be commingled in the

[[Page 243]]

same sealed container with fruits or vegetables that are intended for 
entry and distribution in the United States. The fruits or vegetables 
must be kept in sealed containers from the time the limited permit 
required by paragraph (b) of this section is issued, until the fruits or 
vegetables exit the United States, except as otherwise provided in the 
regulations in this section. Transloading must be carried out in 
accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (a), (h), and (i) of this 
section.
    (e) Area of movement. The port of arrival, the port of export, ports 
for air stops, and overland movement within the continental United 
States of fruits or vegetables shipped under this section is limited to 
a corridor that includes all States of the continental United States 
except Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, 
Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, South 
Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia, except that movement is 
allowed through Dallas/Fort Worth, TX, as an authorized stop for air 
cargo, or as a transloading location for consignments that arrive by air 
but that are subsequently transloaded into trucks for overland movement 
from Dallas/Fort Worth, TX, into the designated corridor by the shortest 
route. Movement through the United States must begin and end at 
locations staffed by APHIS inspectors.
    (f) Movement of regulated articles. Transportation through the 
continental United States shall be by the most direct route to the final 
destination of the consignment in the country to which it is exported, 
as determined by APHIS based on commercial shipping routes and 
timetables and set forth in the transit permit. No change in the 
quantity of the original consignment from that described in the limited 
permit is allowed. No remarking is allowed. No diversion or delay of the 
consignment from the itinerary described in the transit permit and 
limited permit is allowed unless authorized by an APHIS inspector upon 
determination by the inspector that the change will not significantly 
increase the risk of plant pests or diseases in the United States, and 
unless each port to which the consignment is diverted is staffed by 
APHIS inspectors.
    (g) Notification in case of emergency. In the case of an emergency 
such as an accident, a mechanical breakdown of the means of conveyance, 
or an unavoidable deviation from the prescribed route, the person in 
charge of the means of conveyance must, as soon as practicable, notify 
the APHIS office at the port where the cargo arrived in the United 
States.
    (h) Consignments by sea. Except as authorized by this paragraph, 
consignments arriving in the United States by sea from Hawaii, Puerto 
Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the 
U.S. Virgin Islands may be transloaded once from a ship to another ship 
or, alternatively, once to a truck or railcar at the port of arrival and 
once from a truck or railcar to a ship at the port of export, and must 
remain in the original sealed container, except under extenuating 
circumstances and when authorized by an inspector upon determination by 
the inspector that the transloading would not significantly increase the 
risk of the introduction of plant pests or diseases into the United 
States, and provided that APHIS inspectors are available to provide 
supervision. No other transloading of the consignment is allowed, except 
under extenuating circumstances (e.g. , equipment breakdown) and when 
authorized by an inspector upon determination by the inspector that the 
transloading would not significantly increase the risk of the 
introduction of plant pests or diseases into the continental United 
States, and provided that APHIS inspectors are available to provide 
supervision.
    (i) Consignments by air. (1) Consignments arriving in the United 
States by air from Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of the 
Northern Mariana Islands, or the U.S. Virgin Islands may be transloaded 
only once in the United States. Transloading of air consignments must be 
carried out in the presence of an APHIS inspector. Consignments arriving 
by air that are transloaded may be transloaded either into another 
aircraft or into a truck trailer for export by the most direct route to 
the final destination of the

[[Page 244]]

consignment through the designated corridor set forth in paragraph (e) 
of this section. This may be done at either the port of arrival in the 
United States or at the second air stop within the designated corridor, 
as authorized in the transit permit and as provided in paragraph (i)(2) 
of this section. No other transloading of the consignment is allowed, 
except under extenuating circumstances (e.g., equipment breakdown) and 
when authorized by an APHIS inspector upon determination by the 
inspector that the transloading would not significantly increase the 
risk of the introduction of plant pests or diseases into the United 
States, and provided that APHIS inspectors are available to provide 
supervision. Transloading of air consignments will be authorized only if 
the following conditions are met:
    (i) The transloading is done into sealable containers;
    (ii) The transloading is carried out within the secure area of the 
airport (i.e., that area of the airport that is open only to personnel 
authorized by the airport security authorities);
    (iii) The area used for any storage is within the secure area of the 
airport; and
    (iv) APHIS inspectors are available to provide the supervision 
required by paragraph (i)(1) of this section.
    (2) Except as authorized by paragraph (f) of this section, 
consignments that continue by air from the port of arrival in the 
continental United States may be authorized by APHIS for only one 
additional stop in the continental United States, provided the second 
stop is within the designated corridor set forth in paragraph (e) of 
this section and is staffed by APHIS inspectors. As an alternative to 
transloading a consignment arriving in the United States into another 
aircraft, consignments that arrive by air may be transloaded into a 
truck trailer for export by the most direct route to the final 
destination of the consignment through the designated corridor set forth 
in paragraph (e) of this section. This may be done at either the port of 
arrival in the United States or at the second authorized air stop within 
the designated corridor. No other transloading of the consignment is 
allowed, except under extenuating circumstances (e.g., equipment 
breakdown) and when authorized by an APHIS inspector upon determination 
by the inspector that the transloading would not significantly increase 
the risk of the introduction of plant pests or diseases into the United 
States, and provided that APHIS inspectors are available to provide 
supervision.
    (j) Duration and location of storage. Any storage in the United 
States of fruits or vegetables shipped under this section must be for a 
duration and in a location authorized in the transit permit required by 
paragraph (a) of this section. Areas where such fruits or vegetables are 
stored must be either locked or guarded at all times the fruits and 
vegetables are present. Cargo shipped under this section must be kept in 
a sealed container while stored in the continental United States.
    (k) Temperature requirement. Except for time spent on aircraft and 
except during storage and transloading of air consignments, the 
temperature in the sealed containers containing fruits and vegetables 
moved under this section must be 60 [deg]F or lower from the time the 
regulated articles leave Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of 
the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or any other 
territory or possession of the United States until they exit the United 
States.
    (l) Prohibited materials. (1) The person in charge of or in 
possession of a sealed container used for movement into or through the 
United States under this section must ensure that the sealed container 
is carrying only those fruits or vegetables authorized by the transit 
permit required under paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (2) The person in charge of or in possession of any means of 
conveyance or container returned to the United States without being 
reloaded after being used to export fruits or vegetables from the United 
States under this section must ensure that the means of conveyance or 
container is free of materials prohibited importation into the United 
States under this chapter.
    (m) Authorization by APHIS of the movement of fruits or vegetables

[[Page 245]]

through the United States under this section does not imply that such 
fruits or vegetables are enterable into the destination country. 
Consignments returned to the United States from the destination country 
shall be subject to all applicable regulations, including ``Subpart--
Fruits and Vegetables'' of part 319 and ``Plant Quarantine Safeguard 
Regulations'' of part 352 of this chapter.
    (n) Any restrictions and requirements with respect to the arrival, 
temporary stay, unloading, transloading, transiting, exportation, or 
other movement or possession in the United States of any fruits or 
vegetables under this section shall apply to any person who brings into, 
maintains, unloads, transloads, transports, exports, or otherwise moves 
or possesses in the United States such fruits or vegetables, whether or 
not that person is the one who was required to have a transit permit or 
limited permit for the fruits or vegetables or is a subsequent custodian 
of the fruits or vegetables. Failure to comply with all applicable 
restrictions and requirements under this section by such a person shall 
be deemed to be a violation of this section.

     Subpart_Territorial Cotton, Cottonseed, and Cottonseed Products

                               Quarantine


<R05>
Sec. 318.47  Notice of quarantine.

    (a) The Secretary of Agriculture having previously quarantined 
Hawaii and Puerto Rico on account of the pink bollworm of cotton 
(Pectinophora gossypiella Saunders) and the cotton blister mite 
(Eriophyes gossypii Banks), insect pests new to and not widely prevalent 
or distributed within and throughout the United States, now determines 
that it is necessary to extend the quarantine to prevent the spread of 
these insects from the Virgin Islands of the United States, where they 
are known to occur.

[[Page 254]]

    (b) Under the authority of sections 411, 412, 414, and 434 of the 
Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7711, 7712, 7714, and 7754), Hawaii, 
Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States are quarantined 
to prevent the spread of the aforementioned insect pests.
    (c) All parts and products of plants of the genus Gossypium, such as 
seeds including seed cotton; cottonseed; cotton lint, linters, and other 
forms of cotton fiber; cottonseed hulls, cake, meal, and other 
cottonseed products, except oil; cotton waste; and all other 
unmanufactured parts of cotton plants; and all second-hand burlap and 
other fabric which have been used, or are of the kinds ordinarily used, 
for wrapping or containing cotton, are hereby prohibited movement from 
the Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States 
into or through any other State, Territory or District of the United 
States, in manner or method or under conditions other than those 
prescribed in the regulations hereinafter made or amendments thereto: 
Provided, That whenever the Deputy Administrator of the Plant Protection 
and Quarantine Programs shall find that existing conditions as to the 
pest risk involved in the movement of the articles to which the 
regulations supplemental hereto apply, make it safe to modify, by making 
less stringent, the restrictions contained in any such regulations, he 
shall set forth and publish such findings in administrative 
instructions, specifying the manner in which the regulations should be 
made less stringent, whereupon such modification shall become effective.
    (d) As used in this subpart, unless the context otherwise requires, 
the term State, Territory, or District of the United States means State, 
the District of Columbia, Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, or the 
Virgin Islands of the United States.

Subpart_Sand, Soil, or Earth, with Plants from Territories and Districts


<R05>
Sec. 318.60  Notice of quarantine.

    (a) The Secretary of Agriculture, having previously quarantined 
Hawaii and Puerto Rico to prevent the spread to other parts of the 
United States, by means of sand, soil, or earth about the roots of 
plants, of immature stages of certain dangerous insects, including 
Phyllophaga spp. (White grubs), Phytalus sp., and Adoretus sp., and of 
several species of termites or white ants, new to and not heretofore

Department of Agriculture that such sand, soil, or earth has been so 
processed or is of such nature that no pest risk is involved, or that 
the plants with sand, soil, or earth around them are maintained on board 
under such safeguards as will preclude pest escape: And provided 
further, That such prohibitions shall not prohibit the movement of plant 
cuttings or plants that have been (1) freed from sand, soil, and earth, 
(2) subsequently potted and established in sphagnum moss or other 
packing material approved under Sec. 319.37-16 that had been stored

                Subpart_Requests To Amend The Regulations


<R05>
Sec. 319.5  Requirements for submitting requests to change the 
regulations in 7 CFR part 319.

    (a) Definitions.
    Commodity. A plant, plant product, or other agricultural product 
being moved for trade or other purpose.
    (b) Procedures for submitting requests and supporting information. 
Persons who request changes to the import regulations contained in this 
part and who wish to import plants, plant parts, or plant products that 
are not allowed importation under the conditions of this part must file 
a request with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) in 
order for APHIS to consider whether the new commodity can be safely 
imported into the United States. The initial request can be formal 
(e.g., a letter) or informal (e.g., made during a bilateral discussion 
between the United States and another country), and can be made by any 
person. Upon APHIS confirmation that granting a person's request would 
require amendments to the regulations in this part, the national plant 
protection organization of the country from which the commodity would be 
exported must provide APHIS with the information listed in paragraph (d) 
of this section before APHIS can proceed with its consideration of the 
request; requests that are not supported with this information in a 
timely manner will be considered incomplete and APHIS may not take 
further action on such requests until all required information is 
submitted.
    (c) Addresses. The national plant protection organization of the 
country from which commodities would be exported must submit the 
information

[[Page 260]]

listed in paragraph (d) of this section to: Commodity Import Analysis 
and Operations, PPQ, APHIS, 4700 River Road Unit 140, Riverdale, MD 
20737.

    \1\ When a change is being sought to the conditions governing the 
importation of a commodity that is already authorized for importation 
into the United States, an update to or confirmation of previously 
submitted pest and disease information, rather than a new, complete 
submission of that information, may be appropriate. Persons seeking such 
a change may contact APHIS for a determination as to whether an update 
will be appropriate in a particular case.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) Plant part attacked by each pest, pest life stages associated 
with each plant part attacked, and location of pest (in, on, or with 
commodity); and

Sec. 319.8  Notice of quarantine.

    (a) Pursuant to sections 411-414 and 434 of the Plant Protection Act 
(7 U.S.C. 7711-7714 and 7754), and after the public hearing required 
thereunder, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant

[[Page 262]]

Health Inspection Service hereby determines that the unrestricted 
importation into the United States from all foreign countries and 
localities of (1) any parts or products of plants of the genus 
Gossypium, including seed cotton; cottonseed; cotton lint, linters, and 
other forms of cotton fiber (not including yarn, thread, and cloth); 
cottonseed hulls, cake, meal, and other cottonseed products, except oil; 
cotton waste, including gin waste and thread waste; and any other 
unmanufactured parts of cotton plants; and (2) second-hand burlap and 
other fabrics, shredded or otherwise, which have been used or are of the 
kinds ordinarily used, for containing cotton, grains (including grain 
products), field seeds, agricultural roots, rhizomes, tubers, or other 
underground crops, may result in the entry into the United States of the 
pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella (Saund.)), the golden nematode 
of potatoes Heterodera rostochiensis Wr.), the flag smut disease 
(Urocystis tritici Koern.), and other injurious plant diseases and 
insect pests, and said Administrator hereby further determines, that, in 
order to prevent the introduction into the United States of said plant 
diseases and insect pests, which are new to or not heretofore widely 
prevalent or distributed within and throughout the United States, it is 
necessary to forbid the importation into the United States of the plants 
and products, including fabrics, specified above, except as permitted in 
the regulations supplemental hereto. Hereafter the plants and products 
specified above shall not be imported or offered for entry into the 
United States from any foreign country or locality except as permitted 
by said regulations, and the plants and products permitted by the 
regulations to be imported or offered for entry shall be subject to 
sections 411-414 and 434 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7711-7714 
and 7754). Provided, That whenever the Deputy Administrator of the Plant 
Protection and Quarantine Programs shall find the existing conditions as 
to pest risk involved in the importation of the articles to which the 
regulations supplemental hereto apply, make it safe to modify, by making 
less stringent the restrictions contained in any of such regulations, he 
or she shall publish such findings in the administrative instructions, 
specifying the manner in which the restrictions shall be made less 
stringent, whereupon such modification shall become effective; or he or 
she may, upon request in specific cases, when the public interests will 
permit, authorize such importation under conditions specified in the 
permit to carry out the purposes of this part that are less stringent 
than those contained in the regulations.
    (b) As used in this section the term ``United States'' shall have 
the meaning ascribed to it in the regulations supplemental hereto.

        Conditions of Importation and Entry of Cotton and Covers


<R05>
Sec. 319.8-2  Permit procedure.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided for in Sec. Sec. 319.8-10 and 
319.8-18, permits shall be obtained for importations into the United 
States of all cotton and covers. Permits will be issued only for cotton 
and covers authorized entry under Sec. Sec. 319.8-6 through 319.8-20. 
Persons desiring to import cotton or covers under Sec. Sec. 319.8-6 
through 319.8-20 shall, in advance of departure of such material from a 
foreign port, submit to the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs an 
application \2\ stating the name and address of the importer, the 
country from which such material is to be imported, and the kind of 
cotton or covers it is desired to import. Applications to import 
cottonseed shall state the approximate quantity and the proposed United 
States port of entry. Applications to import lint, linters, or waste 
shall state whether such materials are compressed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Applications for permits should be made to Plant Importations 
Branch, Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs, 209 River Street, 
Hoboken, N.J. 07030.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 265]]

    (b) Applications to import lint, linters, or waste at a port \3\ 
other than one in the North, in California, or on the Mexican Border 
shall also specify whether the commodity is compressed to high density.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Including ports in Guam, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin 
Islands of the United States.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Applications for permits may be made orally or on forms provided 
for the purpose by the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs, or may 
be made by a letter or telegram containing all the information required 
by this section.
    (d) Upon receipt and approval of such application by the Plant 
Protection and Quarantine Programs, an individual or continuing permit 
will be issued authorizing the importation and specifying the port of 
entry and the conditions of entry. A copy of the permit will be supplied 
to the importer.
    (e) Upon receipt of an application to import lint, linters, waste, 
or covers, without treatment, for utilization under agreement as defined 
in Sec. 319.8-8(a)(2), an investigation will be made by an inspector to 
determine that the receiving mill or plant is satisfactorily located 
geographically, is equipped with all necessary safeguards, and is 
apparently in a position to fulfill all precautionary conditions to 
which it may agree. Upon determination by the inspector that these 
qualifications are fulfilled, the owner or operator of the mill or plant 
may sign an agreement specifying that the required precautionary 
conditions will be maintained. Such signed agreement will be a necessary 
requisite to the release at the port of entry of any imported lint, 
linters, waste, or covers for forwarding to and utilization at such mill 
or plant in lieu of vacuum fumigation or other treatment otherwise 
required by this subpart. Permits for the importation of such materials 
will be issued in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
    (f) Permits for importation of any cotton or covers are conditioned 
upon compliance with all requirements set forth therein and such 
additional requirements in this subpart as are in terms applicable 
thereto. Failure to comply with any such requirement will be deemed to 
invalidate the permit. Permits may also be cancelled or may be refused 
as provided in Sec. 319.8-3, or entry denied as provided in Sec. Sec. 
319.8-11, 319.8-12, and Sec. 319.8-13.
    (g) If through no fault of the importer a shipment of cotton or 
covers arrives at a United States port in advance of the issuance of a 
permit, it may be held, under suitable safeguards prescribed by the 
inspector at the port, in Customs custody at the risk of the importer, 
pending issuance of a permit, for a period not exceeding 20 days.
    (h) Pending development of adequate treating facilities in Guam, any 
cotton or covers that are subject to treatment as a condition of entry 
therein must first be entered and treated in accordance with the 
requirements of this subpart at a U.S. port of arrival where such 
treating facilities are available.

    (a) Permits for entry from the West Coast of Mexico, as authorized 
in Sec. 319.8-12 of lint, linters, waste, cottonseed, and cottonseed 
hulls may be refused and existing permits cancelled by the Deputy 
Administrator if he or she has determined that the pink bollworm is 
present in the West Coast of Mexico or in Northwest Mexico, or that 
other conditions exist therein that would increase the hazard of pest 
introduction into the United States.
    (b) Permits for entry from Northwest Mexico as authorized in Sec. 
319.8-13 of lint, linters, waste, cottonseed, cottonseed hulls, and 
covers that have been used for cotton, may be refused and existing

Sec. 319.8-6  Cottonseed cake and cottonseed meal.

    Entry of cottonseed cake and cottonseed meal will be authorized 
through any port at which the services of an inspector are available, 
subject to examination by an inspector for freedom from contamination. 
If found to be free of contamination, importations of such cottonseed 
cake and cottonseed meal will be released from further plant quarantine 
entry restrictions. If found to be contaminated such importations will 
be refused entry or subjected as a condition of entry to such safeguards 
as the inspector may prescribe, according to a method selected by the 
inspector from administratively authorized procedures known to be 
effective under the conditions under which the safeguards are applied.

Sec. 319.8-10  Covers.

    (a) Entry of covers (including bags, slit bags, and parts of bags) 
which have been used as containers for cotton grown or processed in 
countries other than the United States may be authorized either (1) 
through a Mexican border port named in the permit for vacuum fumigation 
by an approved method in that part of the United States within the 
generally infested pink bollworm regulated area; or (2) through a 
northern port or a port in the State of California subject to vacuum 
fumigation by an approved method or without vacuum fumigation when the 
covers are to be moved to an approved mill or plant for utilization. 
When such covers are forwarded from a northern port to a mill or plant 
in California for utilization, or from a California port to another 
California or northern port for vacuum fumigation thereat or for 
movement to a mill or plant for utilization such movement shall be made 
by an all-water route unless the bales are compressed to a density of 20 
pounds or more per cubic foot in which case the bales may be moved 
overland in van-type trucks or box cars if all-water transportation is 
not available. Such overland movement may be made only after approved 
surface treatment or under such other conditions as may be deemed 
necessary and are prescribed by the inspector. When such covers arrive 
at a port other than a northern, California, or Mexican border port they 
will be required to be transported therefrom immediately in bond by an 
all-water route to a northern or California port where approved vacuum 
fumigation facilities are available for vacuum fumigation thereat by an 
approved method or for forwarding therefrom to an approved mill or plant 
for utilization.
    (b) American cotton bagging, commonly known as coarse gunny, which 
has been used to cover only cotton grown or processed in the United 
States, may be authorized entry at any port under permit and upon 
compliance with Sec. Sec. 319.8-4 and 319.8-5, without fumigation or 
other treatment. Marking patches of the finer burlaps or other fabrics 
when attached to bales of such bagging may be disregarded if, in the 
judgment of the inspector, they do not present a risk of carrying live 
pink bollworms, golden nematode cysts or flag smut spores.
    (c) Bags, slit bags, parts of bags, and other covers which have been 
used as containers for root crops or are of a kind ordinarily used as 
containers for root crops may be authorized entry subject to immediate 
treatment in such manner and according to such method as the inspector 
may select from administratively authorized procedures known to be 
effective under the conditions under which the treatment is applied, and 
subject to any additional safeguard measures that may be prescribed by 
the inspector pursuant to Sec. 319.8-24, or that he may prescribe in 
regard to the manner of discharge from the carrier and conveyance to the 
place of treatment: Provided, That such covers may be authorized entry 
from Canada without treatment as prescribed in this paragraph unless the 
covers are found to be contaminated.
    (d) Bags, slit bags, parts of bags, and other covers that have been 
used as containers for wheat or wheat products that have not been so 
processed as to have destroyed all flag smut disease spores, or that 
have been used as containers for field seeds separated from wheat during 
the process of screening,

[[Page 269]]

and which arrive from a country named in Sec. 319.59-2(a)(2) of this 
part, if intended for reuse in this country as grain containers may be 
authorized entry, subject to immediate treatment at the port of arrival. 
If such covers are not intended to be reused in this country as grain 
containers their entry may be authorized subject to movement for 
utilization to an approved mill or plant the owner or operator of which 
has executed an appropriate agreement with the Plant Protection and 
Quarantine Programs similar to that described in Sec. 319.8-8(a)(2). 
Covers coming within this paragraph only, may be entered without permit 
other than the authorization provided in this paragraph and without 
other restriction under this subpart upon presentation to an inspector 
of satisfactory evidence that they have been used only for grains 
exported from the United States and are being returned empty without use 
abroad and that while abroad they have been handled in a manner to 
prevent their contamination.
    (e) When upon arrival at a port of entry any shipment of bags, slit 
bags, parts of bags, or other covers, is found to include one or more 
bales containing material the importation of which is regulated by 
paragraph (a), (c), or (d) of this section, the entire shipment, or any 
portion thereof, may be required by the inspector to be treated as 
specified in the applicable paragraph.
    (f) If upon their arrival at a port of entry covers are classified 
by the inspector as coming within more than one paragraph of this 
section, they will be authorized entry only upon compliance with such 
requirements of the applicable paragraphs as the inspector may deem 
necessary to prevent the introduction of plant diseases and insect 
pests.
    (g) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other paragraph of this 
section the entry from any country of bags, slit bags, parts of bags, 
and other covers will be authorized without treatment but upon 
compliance with other applicable sections of this subpart if the 
inspector finds that they have obviously not been used in a manner that 
would contaminate them or when in the inspector's opinion there is 
otherwise no plant pest risk associated with their entry.

Sec. 319.8-26  Material refused entry.

    Any material refused entry for noncompliance with the requirements 
of this subpart shall be promptly removed from the United States or 
abandoned by the importer for destruction, and pending such action shall 
be subject to the immediate application of such safeguards against 
escape of plant pests as the inspector may prescribe. If such material 
is not promptly safeguarded by the importer, removed from the United 
States, or abandoned for destruction to the satisfaction of the 
inspector it may be seized, destroyed, or otherwise disposed of in 
accordance with sections 414 and 421 of the Plant Protection Act (7 
U.S.C. 7714 and 7731). Neither the Department of Agriculture nor the 
inspector will be responsible for any costs accruing for demurrage,

Sec. 319.37-4  Inspection, treatment, and phytosanitary certificates
of inspection.

    (a) Phytosanitary certificates of inspection. Any restricted article 
offered for importation into the United States must be accompanied by a 
phytosanitary certificate of inspection. The phytosanitary certificate 
must identify the genus of the article it accompanies. When the 
regulations in this subpart place restrictions on individual species or 
cultivars within a genus, the phytosanitary certificate must also 
identify the species or cultivar of the article it accompanies. 
Otherwise, identification of the species is strongly preferred, but not 
required. Intergeneric and interspecific hybrids must be designated by 
placing the multiplication sign ``x'' between the names of the parent 
taxa. If the hybrid is named, the multiplication sign may instead be 
placed before the name of an intergeneric hybrid or before the epithet 
in the name of an interspecific hybrid. Phytosanitary certificates are 
not required for the following restricted articles:
    (1) Greenhouse-grown plants from Canada imported in accordance with 
paragraph (c) of this section. These plants must be accompanied by a 
certificate of inspection in the form of a label in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section attached to each carton of the 
articles and to an airway bill, bill of lading, or delivery ticket 
accompanying the articles.

[[Page 293]]

    (2) Small lots of seed imported in accordance with paragraph (d) of 
this section.
    (3) Seeds from Canada imported in accordance with paragraph (e) of 
this section. Each carton of seed must be labeled as required by 
paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. Each shipment of seed must be 
accompanied by the documents in paragraphs (e)(2)(iii)(A) and 
(e)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, as necessary.
    (4) Bulbs from the Netherlands accompanied by a special certificate 
that lists a serial number, the scientific name of the bulb, the country 
of its origin, and a date on which the special certificate expires. The 
serial number must refer to a phytosanitary certificate issued, held, 
and retrievable upon request by the national plant protection 
organization of the Netherlands. The expiration date must be 6 weeks 
after the issuance of the phytosanitary certificate held by the national 
plant protection organization of the Netherlands. Shipments of bulbs 
from the Netherlands accompanied by this certificate may be imported 
into the United States without preclearance by APHIS.
    (b) Inspection and treatment. Any restricted article may be sampled 
and inspected by an inspector at the port of first arrival and/or under 
preclearance inspection arrangements in the country in which the article 
was grown, and must undergo any treatment contained in part 305 of this 
chapter that is ordered by the inspector. Any restricted article found 
upon inspection to contain or be contaminated with plant pests, that 
cannot be eliminated by treatment, shall be denied entry at the first 
United States port of arrival.
    (c) Greenhouse-grown plants from Canada. With the exception of 
Fraxinus spp. (ash) plants, a greenhouse-grown restricted plant may be 
imported from Canada if the Plant Health and Production Division of the 
Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) signs a written agreement with 
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service allowing such 
importation, and provided that the following conditions are met:
    (1) The Plant Health and Production Division of CFIA shall:
    (i) Eliminate individual inspections and phytosanitary certification 
of each shipment of articles exported in accordance with this section;
    (ii) Enter into written agreements with, and assign a unique 
identification number to, each greenhouse grower participating in the 
greenhouse program;
    (iii) Inspect greenhouses and the plants being grown in them using 
inspection methods and schedules approved by Plant Protection and 
Quarantine to ensure that the criteria of this subsection are met;
    (iv) Issue labels to each grower participating in the program. The 
labels issued to each grower shall bear a unique number identifying that 
grower, and shall bear the following statement: ``This shipment of 
greenhouse-grown plants meets the import requirements of the United 
States, and is believed to be free from injurious plant pests. Issued by 
Plant Health and Production Division, Canadian Food Inspection Agency.'' 
The Plant Health and Production Division, CFIA, shall also ensure that 
the label is placed on the airway bill, bill of lading, or delivery 
ticket accompanying each shipment of articles; and
    (v) Ensure that only plants that are not excluded shipment by the 
criteria of this subsection are shipped.
    (2) Each greenhouse grower participating in the program shall enter 
into an agreement with the Plant Health and Production Division of CFIA 
in which the grower agrees to:
    (i) Maintain records of the kinds and quantities of plants grown in 
their greenhouses, including the date of receipt and place of origin of 
the plants; keep the records for at least 1 year after the plants are 
shipped to the United States; and make the records available for review 
and copying upon request by either the Plant Health and Production 
Division of CFIA or an authorized representative of the Secretary of 
Agriculture;
    (ii) Apply to an airway bill, bill of lading, or delivery ticket for 
plants to be shipped to the United States a label issued by CFIA that 
includes the identification number assigned to the grower by the Plant 
Health and Production

[[Page 294]]

Division, CFIA, and the following certification statement: ``This 
shipment of greenhouse grown plants meets the import requirements of the 
United States and is believed to be free from injurious plant pests. 
Issued by Plant Health and Production Division, Canadian Food inspection 
Agency.''; and
    (iii) Use pest control practices approved by Plant Protection and 
Quarantine and the Plant Health and Production Division of CFIA to 
exclude pests from the greenhouses.
    (d) Small lots of seed. Lots of seed may be imported without a 
phytosanitary certificate required by paragraph (a) of this section 
under the following conditions:
    (1) The importation of the seed is authorized by a written permit 
issued in accordance with Sec. 319.37-3.
    (2) The seed is not of any prohibited genera listed in Sec. 319.37-

by Sec. 319.37-4 must contain an additional declaration that states 
``This article is from an area that has been established as free of 
Ralstonia solanacearum race 3 biovar 2.''
    (3) Any article of Pelargonium spp. or Solanum spp. that is from a 
country or area where Ralstonia solanacearum race 3 biovar 2 is known to 
occur must meet the following requirements:
    (i) The national plant protection organization of the country in 
which the articles are produced (the NPPO) must have entered into a 
bilateral workplan with APHIS. This bilateral workplan must set out 
conditions for monitoring the production of articles of Pelargonium spp. 
and Solanum spp., for enforcement of the requirements of this paragraph 
(r)(3), and for the establishment of a trust fund as provided for in 
paragraph (r)(3)(xv) of this section.
    (ii) The production site where the articles of Pelargonium spp. and 
Solanum spp. intended for export to the United States are produced must 
be registered with and certified by both APHIS and the NPPO. As part of 
the certification process, production sites must be initially approved 
and thereafter visited at least once a year by APHIS and the NPPO to 
verify compliance with the requirements of this paragraph (r)(3).
    (iii) The production site must conduct ongoing testing for R. 
solanacearum race 3 biovar 2. Only articles of Pelargonium spp. and 
Solanum spp. from a group of articles that has been tested according to 
an APHIS-approved testing protocol with negative results for the 
presence of R. solanacearum race 3 biovar 2 may be used in production 
and export. Records of the testing must be kept for two growing seasons 
and made available to representatives of APHIS and of the NPPO. All 
testing procedures must be approved by APHIS.
    (iv) Each greenhouse on the production site must be constructed in a 
manner that ensures that runoff water from areas surrounding the 
greenhouses cannot enter the greenhouses. The greenhouses must be 
surrounded by a 1-meter buffer that is sloped so that water drains away 
from the greenhouses.
    (v) Dicotyledonous weeds must be controlled both within each 
greenhouse on the production site and around it. The greenhouses on the 
production site and the 1-meter buffer surrounding them must be free of 
dicotyledonous weeds.
    (vi) All equipment that comes in contact with articles of 
Pelargonium spp. or Solanum spp. within the production site must be 
adequately sanitized so that R. solanacearum race 3 biovar 2 cannot be 
transmitted between plants or enter from outside the production site via 
the equipment.
    (vii) Production site personnel must adequately sanitize their 
clothing and shoes and wash their hands before entering the production 
site to prevent the entry of R. solanacearum race 3 biovar 2 into the 
production site.
    (viii) Growing media for articles of Pelargonium spp. and Solanum 
spp. must be free of R. solanacearum race 3 biovar 2. Growing media and 
containers for articles of Pelargonium spp. and Solanum spp. must not 
come in contact with growing media that could transmit R. solanacearum 
race 3 biovar 2 and must be grown in an APHIS-approved growing medium.
    (ix) Water used in maintenance of the plants at the production site 
must be free of R. solanacearum race 3 biovar 2. The production site 
must either derive the water from an APHIS-approved source or treat the 
water with an APHIS-approved treatment before use.
    (x) Growing media at the production site must not come in direct 
contact

[[Page 301]]

with any water source, such as an emitter or a hose end. If a drip 
irrigation system is used, backflow devices must be installed to prevent 
any R. solanacearum race 3 biovar 2 that may be present from spreading 
to the rest of the production site through the irrigation system. Ebb 
and flow irrigation may not be used.
    (xi) Production site personnel must be educated regarding the 
various pathways through which R. solanacearum race 3 biovar 2 can be 
introduced into a production site and must be trained to recognize 
symptoms of R. solanacearum race 3 biovar 2 infection in articles of 
Pelargonium spp. or Solanum spp. in the production site.
    (xii) Articles of Pelargonium spp. or Solanum spp. produced for 
export within an approved production site must be handled and packed in 
a manner adequate to prevent the introduction of R. solanacearum race 3 
biovar 2. The articles must be labeled with information indicating the 
production site from which the articles originated.
    (xiii) If R. solanacearum race 3 biovar 2 is found in the production 
site or in consignments from the production site, the production site 
will be ineligible to export articles of Pelargonium spp. or Solanum 
spp. to the United States. A production site may be reinstated if a 
reinspection reveals that the production site is free of R. solanacearum 
race 3 biovar 2 and all problems in the production site have been 
addressed and corrected to the satisfaction of APHIS.
    (xiv) The phytosanitary certificate of inspection required by Sec. 
319.37-4 that accompanies these articles must contain an additional 
declaration that states ``These articles have been produced in 
accordance with the requirements in 7 CFR 319.37-5(r)(3).''
    (xv) The government of the country in which the articles are 
produced must enter into a trust fund agreement with APHIS before each 
growing season. The government of the country in which the articles are 
produced or its designated representative is required to pay in advance 
all estimated costs that APHIS expects to incur through its involvement 
in overseeing the execution of paragraph (r)(3) of this section. These 
costs will include administrative expenses incurred in conducting the 
services enumerated in paragraph (r)(3) of this section and all salaries 
(including overtime and the Federal share of employee benefits), travel 
expenses (including per diem expenses), and other incidental expenses 
incurred by the inspectors in performing these services. The government 
of the country in which the articles are produced or its designated 
representative is required to deposit a certified or cashier's check 
with APHIS for the amount of the costs estimated by APHIS. If the 
deposit is not sufficient to meet all costs incurred by APHIS, the 
agreement further requires the government of the country in which the 
articles are produced or its designated representative to deposit with 
APHIS a certified or cashier's check for the amount of the remaining 
costs, as determined by APHIS, before the services will be completed. 
After a final audit at the conclusion of each shipping season, any 
overpayment of funds would be returned to the government of the country 
in which the articles are produced or its designated representative or 
held on account until needed.
    (s) Any restricted article (except seeds) of Pinus spp. from Canada 
may be imported into the United States only if it meets the following 
requirements, as well as all other applicable requirements of this 
subpart, to prevent the introduction of pine shoot beetle (Tomicus 
piniperda):
    (1) From noninfested Canadian Provinces to all areas of the United 
States. Restricted articles that originated in and were moved only

imported if destined for postentry quarantine growing in a State which 
has entered into a written agreement with the Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service, signed by the Administrator or his or her designee 
and by the State Plant Regulatory Official. In accordance with the laws 
of individual States, inspection and other postentry quarantine services 
provided by a State may be subject to charges imposed by the State.
    (i) The following States have entered into a postentry quarantine 
agreement in accordance with this paragraph: All U.S. States and 
Territories, except the District of Columbia, Guam, Hawaii, Kansas, and 
the Northern Mariana Islands.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (2) In any such written agreement, the State shall agree to:
    (i) Establish State regulations and requirements prior to the 
effective date of the agreement and enforce such regulations and 
requirements necessary to inspect sites and plants growing in postentry 
quarantine and to monitor and enforce compliance with postentry 
quarantine growing in accordance with this section;
    (ii) Review pending permit applications for articles to be grown 
under postentry quarantine conditions in the State, upon request of 
Plant Protection and Quarantine, and report to the Postentry Quarantine 
Unit of Plant Protection and Quarantine whether the State would be able 
to provide inspection and monitoring services for the proposed postentry 
quarantine;
    (iii) Provide the services of State inspectors to: inspect sites to 
be used for postentry quarantine; report to the Postentry Quarantine 
Unit of Plant Protection and Quarantine whether the site is of adequate 
size to contain the number of plants proposed for importation, including 
potential increase if increase is allowed; inspect plants for evidence 
of exotic pests at least once during the first year and once during the 
second year for plants required to be grown in postentry quarantine for 
2 years, and at least once for plants required to be grown in quarantine 
for less than 2 years; and monitor and enforce compliance with the 
requirements of this section during the use of the sites for postentry 
quarantine;
    (iv) Report to the Postentry Quarantine Unit of Plant Protection and 
Quarantine any evidence of plant pests that are not known to exist in 
the United States and that are found at a postentry quarantine site by 
State inspectors; recommend to Plant Protection and Quarantine 
safeguards or mitigation measures to control the pests; and supervise 
the application of safeguards or mitigation measures approved by Plant 
Protection and Quarantine; and
    (v) Report to the Postentry Quarantine Unit of Plant Protection and 
Quarantine any propagation or increase in the number of plants that 
occurs during postentry quarantine.

[[Page 311]]

    (3) In any such written agreement, the Administrator shall agree to:
    (i) Seek State review of permit applications for postentry 
quarantine material in that State, and issue permits only after 
determining that State services are available to monitor the postentry 
quarantine;
    (ii) Upon request of the State, provide training, technical advice, 
and pest identification services to State officials involved in 
providing postentry quarantine services in accordance with this section;
    (iii) Notify State officials, in writing and within ten days of the 
arrival, when plant material destined for postentry quarantine in their 
State arrives in the United States, and notify State officials in 
writing when materials in postentry quarantine may be released from 
quarantine in their State.
    (4) Termination of State postentry quarantine agreement. A State 
postentry quarantine agreement may be terminated by either the 
Administrator or the State Plant Regulatory Official by giving written 
notice of termination to the other party. The effective date of the 
termination will be 60 days after the date of actual receipt of notice, 
with regard to future importation to that State of articles requiring 
postentry quarantine in accordance with this section. When a postentry 
quarantine agreement is terminated by either the State Plant Regulatory 
Official or the Administrator, APHIS and the affected State shall 
continue to provide postentry quarantine services in accordance with the 
postentry quarantine agreement, until the time the plant material is 
eligible to be released from quarantine, for all postentry quarantine 
material already in the State, and for all postentry quarantine material 
that arrives in the State prior to the effective date of termination.
    (d) Postentry quarantine growing agreements. Any restricted article 
required to be grown under postentry quarantine conditions, as well as 
any increase therefrom, shall be grown in accordance with a postentry 
quarantine growing agreement signed by the person (the importer)

importation of the article and submitted to Plant Protection and 
Quarantine. On each postentry quarantine growing agreement, APHIS shall 
also obtain the signature of the State Plant Regulatory Official for the 
State in which regulated articles covered by the agreement will be 
grown. The postentry quarantine growing agreement shall specify the 
kind, number, and origin of plants to be imported, and shall certify to

possession of the site on which the article is being grown. The person 
named in the form 523 must, within the time specified in form 523, sign 
a postentry quarantine growing agreement, destroy, ship to a point 
outside the United States, move to an authorized postentry quarantine 
site, and/or apply treatments or other safeguards to the article, the 
increase therefrom, or any portion of the article or the increase 
therefrom, as prescribed by an inspector to prevent the introduction of 
plant pests into the United States. In choosing which action to order 
and in setting the time limit for the action, the inspector shall 
consider the degree of pest risk presented by the plant pest(s) 
associated with the kind of article (including increase therefrom), the 
types of other host materials for the pest in or near the growing site, 
the climate and season at the site in relation to the pest's survival, 
and the availability of treatment facilities.
    (2) Growing at authorized sites. If an inspector determines that any 
article, or any increase therefrom, grown at a site specified in an 
authorized postentry quarantine growing agreement is being grown 
contrary to the provisions of this section, including in numbers greater 
than the number approved by the postentry quarantine growing agreement, 
or in a manner that otherwise presents a risk of introducing plant pests 
into the United States, the inspector shall issue an emergency action 
notification (PPQ form 523) to the person who signed the postentry 
quarantine growing agreement. That person shall be responsible for 
carrying out all actions specified in the emergency action notification. 
The emergency action notification may extend the time for which the 
articles and the increase therefrom must be grown under the postentry 
quarantine conditions specified in the authorized postentry quarantine 
growing agreement, or may require that the person

[[Page 313]]

named in the notification must destroy, ship to a point outside the 
United States, or apply treatments or other safeguards to the article, 
the increase therefrom, or any portion of the article or the increase 
therefrom, within the time specified in the emergency action 
notification. In choosing which action to order and in setting the time 
limit for the action, the inspector shall consider the degree of pest 
risk presented by the plant pest(s) associated with the kind of article 
(including increase therefrom), the types of other host materials for 
the pest in or near the growing site, the climate and season at the site 
in relation to the pest's survival, and the availability of treatment 
facilities.
    (3) Costs and charges. All costs pursuant to any action ordered by 
an inspector in accordance with this section shall be borne by the 
person who signed the postentry quarantine growing agreement covering 
the site where the articles were grown, or if no such agreement was 
signed, by the owner of the articles at the growing site.
    (4) Civil and criminal liabilities. Any person who moves an article 
subject to postentry quarantine growing requirements from the site 
specified for that article in an authorized postentry quarantine growing 
agreement, or who otherwise handles such an article contrary to the 
requirements of this section, shall be subject to such civil penalties 
and such criminal liabilities as are provided by 18 U.S.C. 1001, 7 
U.S.C. 7734, or other applicable Federal statutes.

<R05>
Sec. 319.40-2  General prohibitions and restrictions; relation
to other regulations.

    (a) Permit required. Except for regulated articles exempted from 
this requirement by paragraph (c) of this section or Sec. 319.40-3, no 
regulated article may be imported unless a specific permit has been 
issued for importation of the regulated article in accordance with Sec. 
319.40-4, and unless the regulated article meets all other applicable 
requirements of this subpart and any requirements specified by APHIS in 
the specific permit.
    (b) Importer document; documentation of type, quantity, and origin 
of regulated articles. Except for regulated articles exempted from this 
requirement by paragraph (c) of this section or Sec. 319.40-3, no 
regulated article may be imported unless it is accompanied by an 
importer document stating the following information. A certificate that 
contains this information may be used in lieu of an importer document at 
the option of the importer:
    (1) The genus and species of the tree from which the regulated 
article was derived;
    (2) The country, and locality if known, where the tree from which 
the regulated article was derived was harvested;
    (3) The quantity of the regulated article to be imported;
    (4) The use for which the regulated article is imported; and
    (5) Any treatments or handling of the regulated article required by 
this subpart that were performed prior to arrival at the port of first 
arrival.
    (c) Regulation of articles imported for propagation or human 
consumption. The requirements of this subpart do not apply to regulated 
articles that are allowed importation in accordance with Sec. 319.19, 
``Subpart--Citrus Canker and Other Citrus Diseases'', or Sec. Sec. 
319.37 through 319.37-14, ``Subpart--Nursery Stock, Plants, Roots, 
Bulbs, Seeds, and Other Plant Products''; or to regulated articles 
imported for human consumption that are allowed importation in 
accordance with ``Subpart--Fruits and Vegetables.''
    (d) Regulated articles imported for experimental, scientific or 
educational purposes. Any regulated article may be imported without 
further restriction under this subpart if:
    (1) Imported by the United States Department of Agriculture for 
experimental, scientific, or educational purposes;
    (2) Imported pursuant to a Departmental permit issued by APHIS for 
the regulated article prior to its importation and kept on file at the 
port of first arrival; and
    (3) Imported under conditions specified on the Departmental permit 
and found by the Administrator to be adequate to prevent the 
introduction into the United States of plant pests.
    (e) Designation of additional regulated articles. An inspector may 
designate any article as a regulated article by giving written notice of 
the designation to the owner or person in possession or control of the 
article. APHIS will implement rulemaking to add articles designated as 
regulated articles to the definition of regulated article in Sec. 
319.40-1 if importation of the article appears to present a recurring 
significant risk of introducing plant pests. Inspectors may designate an 
article as a regulated article after determining that:
    (1) The article was imported in the same container or hold as a 
regulated article;
    (2) Other articles of the same type imported from the same country 
have been found to carry plant pests; or
    (3) The article appears to be contaminated with regulated articles 
or soil.
    (f) In addition to meeting the requirements of this subpart, bark 
and bark products and logs and pulpwood

[[Page 322]]

with bark attached, as well as cut trees (e.g., Christmas trees), 
imported from Canada are subject to the inspection and certification 
requirements for gypsy moth in Sec. 319.77-4 of this part.

and the minimum exposure time should be 24 hours.
    (2) Marking. The wood packaging material must be marked in a visible 
location on each article, preferably on at least two opposite sides of 
the article, with a legible and permanent mark that indicates that the 
article meets the requirements of this paragraph. The mark must be 
approved by the International Plant Protection Convention in its 
International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures to certify that wood 
packaging material has been subjected to an approved measure, and must 
include a unique graphic symbol, the ISO two-letter country code for the 
country that produced the wood packaging material, a unique number 
assigned by the national plant protection agency of that country to the 
producer of the wood packaging material, and an abbreviation disclosing 
the type of treatment (e.g., HT for heat treatment or MB for methyl 
bromide fumigation). The currently approved format for the mark is as 
follows, where XX would be replaced by the country code, 000 by the 
producer number, and YY by the treatment type (HT or MB):

Sec. 319.40-4  Application for a permit to import regulated articles;
issuance and withdrawal of permits.

    (a) Application procedure. A written application for a permit \1\ 
must be submitted to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, 
Plant Protection and Quarantine, Port Operations Permit Unit, 4700 River 
Road Unit 136, Riverdale, MD 20737-1236. The completed application must 
include the following information:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Application forms for permits are available without charge from 
the Administrator, c/o the Permit Unit, Plant Protection and Quarantine, 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, 4700 River Road, Riverdale, MD 20737, or local offices of 
Plant Protection and Quarantine, which are listed in telephone 
directories.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) The specific type of regulated article to be imported, including 
the genus and species name of the tree from which the regulated article 
was derived;
    (2) Country, and locality if known, where the tree from which the 
regulated article was derived was harvested;
    (3) The quantity of the regulated article to be imported;
    (4) A description of any processing, treatment or handling of the 
regulated article to be performed prior to importation, including the 
location where any processing or treatment was or will be performed and 
the names and dosage of any chemicals employed in treatments;
    (5) A description of any processing, treatment, or handling of the 
regulated article intended to be performed following importation, 
including the location where any processing or treatment will be 
performed and the names and dosage of any chemicals employed in 
treatments;
    (6) Whether the regulated article will or will not be imported in a 
sealed container or in a hold;
    (7) The means of conveyance to be used to import the regulated 
article;
    (8) The intended port of first arrival in the United States of the 
regulated article, and any subsequent ports in the United States at 
which regulated articles may be unloaded;
    (9) The destination and general intended use of the regulated 
article;
    (10) The name and address of the applicant and, if the applicant's 
address is not within the United States, the name and address of an 
agent in the United States whom the applicant names for acceptance of 
service of process; and
    (11) A statement certifying the applicant as the importer of record.
    (b) Review of application and issuance of permit. After receipt and 
review of the application, APHIS shall determine whether it appears that 
the regulated article at the time of importation will meet either the 
specific importation requirements in Sec. 319.40-5 or the universal 
importation requirements in Sec. 319.40-6.
    (1) If it appears that the regulated article proposed for 
importation will meet the requirements of either Sec. 319.40-5 or Sec. 
319.40-6, a permit stating the applicable conditions for importation 
under this subpart shall be issued for the importation of the regulated 
article identified in the application.
    (2) If it appears that the regulated article proposed for 
importation will not meet the requirements of either Sec. 319.40-5 or 
Sec. 319.40-6 because these sections do not address the particular 
regulated article identified in the application, APHIS shall review the 
application by applying the plant pest risk assessment standards 
specified in Sec. 319.40-11.
    (i) If this review reveals that importation of the regulated article 
under a permit and subject to the inspection and other requirements in 
Sec. 319.40-9, but without any further conditions,

[[Page 325]]

will not result in the introduction of plant pests into the United 
States, a permit for importation of the regulated article shall be 
issued. The permit may only be issued in unique and unforeseen 
circumstances when the importation of the regulated article is not 
expected to recur.
    (ii) If this review reveals that the regulated article may be 
imported under conditions that would reduce the plant pest risk to an 
insignificant level, APHIS may implement rulemaking to add the 
additional conditions to this subpart, and after the regulations are 
effective, may issue a permit for importation of the regulated article.
    (3) No permit will be issued to an applicant who has had a permit 
withdrawn under paragraph (d) of this section during the 12 months prior 
to receipt of the permit application by APHIS, unless the withdrawn 
permit has been reinstated upon appeal.
    (c) Permit does not guarantee eligibility for import. Even if a 
permit has been issued for the importation of a regulated article, the 
regulated article may be imported only if all applicable requirements of 
this subpart are met and only if an inspector at the port of first 
arrival determines that no remedial measures are necessary pursuant to 
the Plant Protection Act with respect to the regulated article. \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ An inspector may hold, seize, quarantine, treat, apply other 
remedial measures to, destroy, or otherwise dispose of plants, plant 
pests, or other articles in accordance with sections 414, 421, and 434 
of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714, 7731, and 7754).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) Denial and withdrawal of permits. Any permit which has been 
issued may be withdrawn by an inspector or the Administrator if he or 
she determines that the person to whom the permit was issued has 
violated any requirement of this subpart. If the withdrawal is oral, the 
decision to withdraw the permit and the reasons for the withdrawal of 
the permit shall be confirmed in writing as promptly as circumstances 
permit. Any person whose permit has been denied or withdrawn may appeal 
the decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after 
receiving the written notification of the withdrawal. The appeal shall 
state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show 
that the permit was wrongfully denied or withdrawn. The Administrator 
shall grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for 
granting or denying the appeal as promptly as circumstances permit. If 
there is a conflict as to any material fact and the person from whom the 
permit is withdrawn requests a hearing, a hearing shall be held to 
resolve the conflict. Rules of practice concerning the hearing shall be 
adopted by the Administrator.

Sec. 319.40-7  Treatments and safeguards.

    (a) Certification of treatments or safeguards. If APHIS determines 
that a document required for the importation of regulated articles is 
inaccurate, the regulated articles which are the subject of the 
certificate or other document shall be refused entry into the United 
States. In addition, APHIS may determine not to accept any further 
certificates for the importation of regulated articles in accordance 
with this subpart from a country in which an inaccurate certificate is 
issued, and APHIS may determine not to allow the importation of any or 
all regulated articles from any such country, until corrective action 
acceptable to APHIS establishes that certificates issued in that country 
will be accurate.
    (b) Debarking. Except for raw lumber, no more than 2 percent of the 
surface of all regulated articles in a lot may retain bark, with no 
single regulated article retaining bark on more than 5 percent of its 
surface. For raw lumber, debarking must remove 100 percent of the bark.
    (c) Heat treatment. Heat treatment must be performed only at a 
facility where APHIS or an inspector authorized by the Administrator and 
the national government of the country in which the facility is located 
has inspected the facility and determined that its operation complies 
with the standards of this paragraph. Heat treatment procedures may 
employ steam, hot water, kilns, exposure to microwave energy, or any 
other method (e.g., the hot water and steam techniques used in veneer 
production) that raises the temperature of the center of each treated 
regulated article to at least 71.1 [deg]C and maintains the regulated 
article at that center temperature for at least 75 minutes. For 
regulated articles heat treated prior to arrival in the United States, 
during the entire interval between treatment and export the regulated 
article must be stored, handled, or safeguarded in a manner which 
excludes any infestation of the regulated article by plant pests.
    (d) Heat treatment with moisture reduction. (1) Heat treatment with 
moisture reduction may employ:
    (i) Kiln drying conducted in accordance with the schedules 
prescribed for the regulated article in the Dry Kiln Operator's Manual, 
Agriculture Handbook 188, which is incorporated by reference at Sec. 
300.2 of this chapter; or,
    (ii) Dry heat, exposure to microwave energy, or any other method 
that raises the temperature of the center of each treated regulated 
article to at least 71.1 [deg]C, maintains the regulated articles at 
that center temperature for at least 75 minutes, and reduces the 
moisture content of the regulated article to 20 percent or less as 
measured by an electrical conductivity meter.
    (2) For regulated articles heat treated with moisture reduction 
prior to arrival in the United States, during the entire interval 
between treatment and export the regulated article must be stored, 
handled, or safeguarded in a manner which excludes any infestation of 
the regulated article by plant pests.
    (e) Surface pesticide treatments. All United States Environmental 
Protection Agency registered surface pesticide treatments are authorized 
for regulated articles imported in accordance with this subpart, except 
that Pinus radiata wood chips from Chile and wood chips from South 
America derived from temperate species of Eucalyptus must be treated in 
accordance with Sec. 319.40-7(e)(2). Surface pesticide treatments must 
be conducted in accordance with label directions approved by the United 
States Environmental Protection Agency. Under the following 
circumstances, surface pesticide treatments must also be conducted as 
follows:
    (1) Heat treated logs. When used on heat treated logs, a surface 
pesticide treatment must be first applied within 48 hours following heat 
treatment. The surface pesticide treatment must be repeated at least 
every 30 days during storage of the regulated article, with the final 
treatment occurring no more than 30 days prior to departure of the

[[Page 336]]

means of conveyance that carries the regulated articles to the United 
States.
    (2) Pinus radiata wood chips from Chile and Eucalyptus (temperate 
species) wood chips from South America. When used on Pinus radiata wood 
chips from Chile or on wood chips from South America derived from 
temperate species of Eucalyptus, a surface pesticide consisting of the 
following must be used: A mixture of a fungicide containing 64.8percent 
of the active ingredient didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride and 7.6 
percent of the active ingredient 3-iodo-2-propynl butylcarbamate and an 
insecticide containing 44.9percent of the active ingredient chlorpyrifos 
phosphorothioate. The wood chips must be sprayed with the pesticide so 
that all the chips are exposed to the chemical on all sides. During the 
entire interval between treatment and export, the wood chips must be 
stored, handled, or safeguarded in a manner that prevents any 
infestation of the wood chips by plant pests.
    (f) Methyl bromide fumigation. The following minimum standards for 
methyl bromide fumigation treatment are authorized for the regulated 
articles listed in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section. Any 
method of fumigation that meets or exceeds the specified temperature/
time/concentration products is acceptable. Following fumigation, 
fumigated products must be aerated to reduce the concentration of 
fumigant below hazardous levels, in accordance with the Treatment Manual 
and label instructions approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency.
    (1) Logs--(i) T-312 schedule. The entire log and the ambient air 
must be at a temperature of 5 [deg]C or above throughout fumigation. The 
fumigation must be conducted using schedule T-312 contained in part 305 
of this chapter. In lieu of the schedule T-312 methyl bromide 
concentration, fumigation may be conducted with an initial methyl 
bromide concentration of at least 240 g/m\3\ with exposure and 
concentration levels adequate to provide a concentration-time product of 
at least 17,280 gram-hours calculated on the initial methyl bromide 
concentration.
    (ii) T-404 schedule. The entire log and the ambient air must be at a 
temperature of 5 [deg]C or more above throughout fumigation. The 
fumigation must be conducted using schedule T-404 contained in part 305 
of this chapter.
    (2) Lumber. The lumber and the ambient air must be at a temperature 
of 5 [deg]C or more above throughout fumigation. The fumigation must be 
conducted using schedule T-404 contained in part 305 of this chapter.
    (3) Regulated articles other than logs or lumber. (i) If the ambient 
air and the regulated articles other than logs or lumber are at a 
temperature of 21 [deg]C or above throughout fumigation, the fumigation 
must be conducted using schedule T-404 contained in part 305 of this 
chapter. In lieu of the schedule T-404 methyl bromide concentration, 
fumigation may be conducted with an initial methyl bromide concentration 
of at least 48 g/m\3\ with exposure and concentration levels adequate to 
provide a concentration-time product of at least 760 gram-hours 
calculated on the initial methyl bromide concentration.
    (ii) If the ambient air and the regulated articles other than logs 
or lumber are at a temperature of 4.5-20.5 [deg]C throughout fumigation,

    (a) Any person who operates a facility in which imported regulated 
articles are processed may enter into a compliance agreement to 
facilitate the importation of regulated articles under

[[Page 337]]

this subpart. The compliance agreement shall specify the requirements 
necessary to prevent spread of plant pests from the facility, 
requirements to ensure the processing method effectively destroys plant 
pests, and the requirements for the application of chemical materials in 
accordance with part 305 of this chapter. The compliance agreement shall 
also state that inspectors must be allowed access to the facility to 
monitor compliance with the requirements of the compliance agreement and 
of this subpart. Compliance agreement forms may be obtained from the 
Administrator or an inspector.
    (b) Any compliance agreement may be canceled by the inspector who is 
supervising its enforcement, orally or in writing, whenever the 
inspector finds that the person who entered into the compliance 
agreement has failed to comply with the conditions of the compliance 
agreement. If the cancellation is oral, the decision to cancel the 
compliance agreement and the reasons for cancellation of the compliance 
agreement shall be confirmed in writing, as promptly as circumstances 
permit. Any person whose compliance agreement has been canceled may 
appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after 
receiving written notification of the cancellation. The appeal shall 
state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show 
that the compliance agreement was wrongfully canceled. The Administrator 
shall grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for 
granting or denying the appeal, as promptly as circumstances permit. If 
there is a conflict as to any material fact and the person whose 
compliance agreement has been canceled requests a hearing, a hearing 
shall be held to resolve the conflict. Rules of practice concerning the 
hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.

Sec. 319.40-9  Inspection and other requirements at port of first arrival.

    (a) Procedures for all regulated articles. (1) All imported 
regulated articles shall be inspected at the port of first arrival. If 
the inspector finds signs of plant pests on or in the regulated article, 
or finds that the regulated article may have been associated with other 
articles infested with plant pests, the regulated article shall be 
cleaned or treated as required by an inspector, and the regulated 
article and any products of the regulated article shall also be subject 
to reinspection, cleaning, and treatment at the option of an inspector 
at any time and place before all applicable requirements of this subpart 
have been accomplished.
    (2) Regulated articles shall be assembled for inspection at the port 
of first arrival, or at any other place prescribed by an inspector, at a 
place and time and in a manner designated by an inspector.
    (3) If an inspector finds that an imported regulated article is so 
infested with a plant pest that, in the judgment of the inspector, the 
regulated article cannot be cleaned or treated, or contains soil or 
other prohibited contaminants, the entire lot may be refused entry into 
the United States.
    (4) No person shall move any imported regulated article from the 
port of first arrival unless and until an inspector notifies the person, 
in writing or through an electronic database, that the regulated 
article:
    (i) Is in compliance with all applicable regulations and has been 
inspected and found to be apparently free of plant pests; \4\ or,
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Certain regulated articles may also be subject to ``Subpart--
Fruits and Vegetables,'' or to the noxious weed regulations under part 
360 of this chapter, or to Endangered Species Act regulations under 
parts 355 and 356 of this chapter and 50 CFR parts 17 and 23.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) Has been inspected and the inspector requires reinspection, 
cleaning, or treatment of the regulated article at a place other than 
the port of first arrival.

[[Page 338]]

    (b) Notice of arrival; visual examination of regulated articles at 
port of first arrival. (1) At least 7 days prior to the expected date of 
arrival in the United States of a shipment of regulated articles 
imported in accordance with this subpart, the permittee or his or her 
agent must notify the APHIS Officer in Charge at the port of arrival of 
the date of expected arrival. The address and telephone number of the 
APHIS Officer in Charge will be specified in any specific permit issued 
by APHIS \5\. This notice may be in writing or by telephone. The notice 
must include the number of any specific permit issued for the regulated 
articles; the name, if any, of the means of conveyance carrying the 
regulated articles; the type and quantity of the regulated articles; the 
expected date of arrival; the country of origin of the regulated 
articles; the name and the number, if any, of the dock or area where the 
regulated articles are to be unloaded; and the name of the importer or 
broker at the port of arrival.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ A list of APHIS Officers in Charge may be obtained from the 
Administrator, c/o Port Operations, Plant Protection and Quarantine, 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, 4700 River Road, Riverdale, 
MD 20737.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Imported regulated articles which have been debarked in 
accordance with Sec. 319.40-7(b) and can be safely and practically 
inspected will be visually examined for plant pests by an inspector at 
the port of first arrival. If plant pests are found on or in the 
regulated articles or if the regulated article cannot be safely and 
practically inspected, the regulated articles must be treated in 
accordance with part 305 of this chapter.
    (c) Marking and identity of regulated articles. Any regulated 
article, at the time of importation shall bear on the outer container 
(if in a container), on the regulated article (if not in a container), 
or on a document accompanying the regulated article the following 
information:
    (1) General nature and quantity of the regulated articles;
    (2) Country and locality, if known, where the tree from which the 
regulated article was derived was harvested;
    (3) Name and address of the person importing the regulated article;
    (4) Name and address of consignee of the regulated article;
    (5) Identifying shipper's mark and number; and
    (6) Number of the permit (if one was issued) authorizing the 
importation of the regulated article into the United States.
    (d) Sampling for plant pests at port of first arrival. Any imported 
regulated article may be sampled for plant pests at the port of first 
arrival. If an inspector finds it necessary to order treatment of a 
regulated article at the port of first arrival, any sampling will be 
done prior to treatment.

<R05>
Sec. 319.40-11  Plant pest risk assessment standards.

    When evaluating a request to import a regulated article not allowed 
importation under this subpart, or a request to import a regulated 
article under conditions other than those prescribed by this subpart, 
APHIS will conduct the following analysis to determine the

[[Page 339]]

plant pest risks associated with each requested importation in order to 
determine whether or not to issue a permit under this subpart or to 
propose regulations establishing conditions for the importation into the 
United States of the regulated article.
    (a) Collecting commodity information. (1) APHIS will evaluate the 
application for information describing the regulated article and the 
origin, processing, treatment, and handling of the regulated article; 
and
    (2) APHIS will evaluate history of past plant pest interceptions or 
introductions (including data from foreign countries) associated with 
the regulated article.
    (b) Cataloging quarantine pests. For the regulated article specified 
in an application, APHIS will determine what plant pests or potential 
plant pests are associated with the type of tree from which the 
regulated article was derived, in the country and locality from which 
the regulated article is to be exported. A plant pest that meets one of 
the following criteria is a quarantine pest and will be further 
evaluated in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section:
    (1) Non-indigenous plant pest not present in the United States;
    (2) Non-indigenous plant pest, present in the United States and 
capable of further dissemination in the United States;
    (3) Non-indigenous plant pest that is present in the United States 
and has reached probable limits of its ecological range, but differs 
genetically from the plant pest in the United States in a way that 
demonstrates a potential for greater damage potential in the United 
States;
    (4) Native species of the United States that has reached probable 
limits of its ecological range, but differs genetically from the plant 
pest in the United States in a way that demonstrates a potential for 
greater damage potential in the United States; or
    (5) Non-indigenous or native plant pest that may be able to vector 
another plant pest that meets one of the criteria in paragraphs (b)(1) 
through (4) of this section.
    (c) Determining which quarantine pests to assess. (1) APHIS will 
divide quarantine pests identified in paragraph (b) of this section into 
groups depending upon where the plant pest is most likely to be found. 
The plant pests would be grouped as follows:
    (i) Plant pests found on the bark;
    (ii) Plant pests found under the bark; and
    (iii) Plant pests found in the wood.
    (2) APHIS will subdivide each of the groups in paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section into associated taxa.
    (3) APHIS will rank the plant pests in each group in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section according to plant pest risk, based on the 
available biological information and demonstrated plant pest importance.
    (4) APHIS will identify any plant pests ranked in paragraph (c)(3) 
of this section for which plant pest risk assessments have previously 
been performed in accordance with this section. APHIS will conduct 
individual plant pest risk assessments for the remaining plant pests, 
starting with the highest ranked plant pest(s) in each group.
    (5) The number of plant pests in each group to be evaluated through 
individual plant pest risk assessment will be based on biological 
similarities of members of the group as they relate to measures taken in 
connection with the importation of the regulated article to mitigate the 
plant pest risk associated with the regulated article. For example, if 
the plant pest risk assessment for the highest ranked plant pest 
indicates a need for a mitigation measure that would result in the same 
reduction of risk for other plant pests ranked in the group, the other 
members need not be subjected to individual plant pest risk assessment.
    (d) Conducting individual plant pest risk assessments. APHIS will 
evaluate each of the plant pests identified in paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section by:
    (1) Estimation of the probability of the plant pest being on, with, 
or in the regulated article at the time of importation;
    (2) Estimation of the probability of the plant pest surviving in 
transit on the regulated article and entering the United States 
undetected;
    (3) Estimation of the probability of the plant pest colonizing once 
it has entered into the United States;

[[Page 340]]

    (4) Estimation of the probability of the plant pest spreading beyond 
any colonized area; and
    (5) Estimation of the damage to plants that could be expected upon 
introduction and dissemination within the United States of the plant 
pest.
    (e) Estimating unmitigated overall plant pest risk. APHIS will 
develop an estimation of the overall plant pest risk associated with 
importing the regulated article based on compilation of individual plant 
pest risk assessments performed in accordance with paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (f) Evaluating available requirements to determine whether they 
would allow safe importation of the regulated article. The requirements 
of this subpart, and any other requirements relevant to the regulated 
article and plant pests involved, will be compared with the individual 
plant pest risk assessments in order to determine whether particular 
conditions on the importation of the regulated article would reduce the 
plant pest risk to an insignificant level. If APHIS determines that the 
imposition of particular conditions on the importation of the regulated 
article could reduce the plant pest risk to an insignificant level, and 
determines that sufficient APHIS resources are available to implement or 
ensure implementation of the conditions, APHIS will implement rulemaking 
to allow importation of the requested regulated article under the 
conditions identified by the plant pest risk assessment process.

<R05>
Sec. 319.41  Notice of quarantine.

    (a) The fact has been determined by the Secretary of Agriculture, 
and notice given, that dangerous plant pests, including the so-called 
European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis Hubn.), and also other dangerous 
insects, as well as plant diseases not heretofore widely prevalent or 
distributed within and throughout the United States, exist, as to one or 
more of such pests, in Europe, Asia, Africa, Dominion of Canada, Mexico, 
Central and South America, and other foreign countries and localities, 
and may be introduced into this country through importations of the 
stalks or other parts of Indian corn or maize, broomcorn, and related 
plants.
    (b) To prevent the introduction of these plant pests, the following 
articles may not be imported into the United States except in accordance 
with this subpart: The raw or unmanufactured stalk and all other parts 
of Indian corn or maize (Zea mays L.), broomcorn (Andropogon sorghum 
var. technicus), sweet sorghums (Andropogon sorghum), grain sorghums 
(Andropogon sorghum), Sudan grass (Andropogon sorghum sudanensis), 
Johnson grass (Andropogon halepensis), sugarcane (Saccharum 
officinarum), including Japanese varieties, pearl millet (Pennisetum 
glaucum), napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum), teosinte (Euchlaena 
luxurians), and jobs-tears (Coix lachryma-Jobi).
    (c) When the public interests will permit, the Deputy Administrator 
of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs may, upon request in 
specific cases, authorize such importations into Guam under conditions 
specified in the permit that are less stringent than those contained in 
this subpart.
    (d) As used in this subpart, unless the context otherwise requires, 
the term ``United States'' means the States, the District of Columbia, 
Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States.

Sec. 319.41-5  Condition of entry.

    (a) The entry of the articles covered by Sec. 319.41-1 is 
conditioned on their freedom from the European corn borer and other 
injurious insects and plant diseases, and upon their freedom from 
contamination with plant materials prohibited entry under other 
quarantines. All shipments of these articles shall be subject to 
inspection at the port of arrival by an inspector of the Plant 
Protection and Quarantine Programs, in order to determine their freedom 
from such insects and diseases and from contaminating materials, and to 
such sterilization, grinding, or other necessary treatment as the 
inspector may prescribe. Should an importation be found on inspection to 
be so infested or infected or contaminated that, in the judgment of the 
inspector, it can not be made safe by sterilization or other treatment, 
the entire shipment may be refused entry.
    (b) When entry under sterilization or other treatment is permitted, 
the importation will be released to the permittee for such treatment, 
upon the filing with the appropriate customs official of a bond in the 
amount of $5,000, or in an amount equal to the invoice value, if such 
value be less than $5,000, with approved sureties, and conditioned that 
the importation shall be sterilized or otherwise treated under the 
supervision of the inspector; that no bale or container shall be broken, 
opened, or removed from the port of arrival unless and until a written 
notice is given to said customs official by an inspector that the 
importation has been properly sterilized or treated; and that the 
importation shall be redelivered to said customs official within 30 days 
after its arrival.
    (c) Should a shipment requiring sterilization or other treatment 
under the provisions of the regulation in this subpart arrive at a port 
where facilities for such sterilization or other treatment are not 
maintained, such shipment shall either be promptly shipped under 
safeguards and by routing prescribed by the inspector to an approved 
port where facilities for sterilization or other treatment are 
available, or it shall be refused entry.
    (d) Other conditions of entry as applying to the certain classes of 
articles enumerated in Sec. 319.41-1 are:
    (1) Broomcorn. All importations of broomcorn shall be so baled as to 
prevent breakage and scattering in connection with the necessary 
handling and sterilization; if in the judgment of the inspector they are 
not so baled, entry may be refused. All importations of broomcorn shall 
be subject to such sterilization or other treatment as the inspector may 
require.
    (2) Articles made of broomcorn. Brooms or similar articles made of 
broomcorn shall be subject to sterilization unless their manufacture 
involves the substantial elimination of stems or such treatment of the 
included stems as in the judgment of the inspector shall preclude such 
articles from being the means of carriage of the European corn borer and 
of other injurious insects and plant diseases.
    (3) Shelled corn and other seeds. If shipments of shelled corn and 
seeds of the other plants from countries other than those named in Sec. 
319.41-1 (b)(2) are found upon inspection at the port of arrival to be 
appreciably fouled with cobs or other portions of the plants the 
inspector may require sterilization or other treatment or may refuse 
entry.

Sec. 319.55  Notice of quarantine.

    (a) The fact has been determined by the Secretary of Agriculture, 
and notice is hereby given, (1) that injurious fungous diseases of rice, 
including downy, mildew (Sclerospora macrospora), leaf smut (Entyloma 
oryzae), blight (Oospora oryzetorum), and glume blotch (Melanomma 
glumarum), as well as dangerous insect pests, new to and not heretofore 
widely prevalent or distributed within and throughout the United States, 
exist, as to one or more of such diseases and pests, in Europe, Asia, 
Africa, Central America, South America, and other foreign countries and 
localities, and may be introduced into this country through importations 
of seed or paddy rice, rice straw, and rice hulls, and (2) that the 
unrestricted importation of seed or paddy rice from the Republic of 
Mexico and of rice straw and rice hulls from all foreign countries and 
localities may result in the entry into the United States of the 
injurious plant diseases heretofore enumerated, as well as insect pests.
    (b) To prevent the introduction into the United States of the plant 
pests and diseases indicated above, the Secretary has determined that it 
is necessary to prohibit the importation into the United States of seed 
or paddy rice from all foreign locations except the Republic of Mexico 
and to restrict the importation of seed or paddy rice, rice straw, and 
rice hulls from the Republic

[[Page 345]]

of Mexico and all other foreign locations, except as otherwise provided 
in this subpart.
    (c) When the public interests will permit, the Deputy Administrator 
of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs may, upon request in 
specific cases, authorize such importations into Guam under conditions 
specified in the permit that are less stringent than those contained in 
this subpart.
    (d) As used in this subpart, unless the context otherwise requires, 
the term ``United States'' means the States, the District of Columbia, 
Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States.

the collector of customs by the inspector, demand will be made by the 
collector for redelivery of the shipment into customs custody under the 
terms of the entry bond, and, if such redelivery is not made, the 
shipment shall be removed from the country or destroyed.

prevent scattering or wastage. If, in the judgment of the inspector, a 
shipment is not so bagged, baled, or wrapped, it shall be reconditioned 
at the expense of the permittee or entry may be refused.

specific ports if so required by this subpart or by part 305 of this 
chapter, or if so required by a permit issued under paragraph (b) of 
this section for the importation of the particular fruit or vegetable. 
If a permit issued for the importation of fruits or vegetables names 
specific port(s) where the fruits or vegetables must be imported, the 
fruits and vegetables may only be imported into the port(s) named in the 
permit. If a permit issued for the importation of fruits or vegetables 
does not name specific port(s) where the fruits or vegetables must be 
imported, the fruits and vegetables may be imported into any port 
referenced in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (2) Fruits and vegetables imported under this subpart may be 
imported into any port listed in 19 CFR 101.3(b)(1), except as otherwise

fruits or vegetables are subject to inspection, are subject to such 
disinfection at the port of first arrival as may be required by an 
inspector, and are subject to reinspection at other locations at the 
option of an inspector. If an inspector finds plants or portions of 
plants, or a plant pest or noxious weed, or evidence of a plant pest or 
noxious weed on or in any fruit or vegetable or its container, or finds 
that the fruit or vegetable may have been associated with other articles 
infested with plant pests or noxious weeds, the owner or agent of the 
owner of the fruit or vegetable must clean or treat the fruit or 
vegetable and its container as required by an inspector, and the fruit 
or vegetable is also subject to reinspection, cleaning, and treatment at 
the option of an inspector at any time and place until all applicable 
requirements of this subpart have been accomplished.
    (1) Notice of arrival; assembly for inspection. Any person importing 
fruits and vegetables into the United States must offer those 
agricultural products for inspection and entry at the port of first 
arrival. The owner or agent must assemble the fruits and vegetables for 
inspection at the port of first arrival, or at any other place 
designated by an inspector, and in a manner designated by the inspector. 
All fruits and vegetables must be accurately disclosed and made 
available to an inspector for examination. The owner or the agent must 
provide an inspector with the name and address of the consignee and must 
make full disclosure of the type, quantity, and country and locality of 
origin of all fruits and vegetables in the consignment, either orally 
for noncommercial consignments or on an invoice or similar document for 
commercial consignments.
    (2) Refusal of entry. If an inspector finds that an imported fruit 
or vegetable is prohibited, or is not accompanied by required 
documentation, or is so infested with a plant pest or noxious weed that, 
in the judgment of the inspector, it cannot be cleaned or treated, or 
contains soil or other prohibited contaminants, the entire lot or 
consignment may be refused entry into the United States.
    (3) Release for movement. No person may move a fruit or vegetable 
from the port of first arrival unless an inspector has either:
    (i) Released it;
    (ii) Ordered treatment at the port of first arrival and, after 
treatment, released the fruit or vegetable;

[[Page 351]]

    (iii) Authorized movement of the fruit or vegetable to another 
location for treatment, further inspection, or destruction; or
    (iv) Ordered the fruit or vegetable to be reexported.
    (4) Notice to owner of actions ordered by inspector. If an inspector 
orders any disinfection, cleaning, treatment, reexportation, recall, 
destruction, or other action with regard to imported fruits or 
vegetables while the consignment is in foreign commerce, the inspector 
will issue an emergency action notification (PPQ Form 523) to the owner 
of the fruits or vegetables or to the owner's agent. The owner must, 
within the time and in the manner specified in the PPQ Form 523, destroy 
the fruits and vegetables, ship them to a point outside the United 
States, move them to an authorized site, and/or apply treatments or 
other safeguards to the fruits and vegetables as prescribed to prevent 
the introduction of plant pests or noxious weeds into the United States.
    (e) Costs and charges. APHIS will be responsible only for the costs 
of providing the services of an inspector during regularly assigned 
hours of duty and at the usual places of duty. \1\ The owner of imported 
fruits or vegetables is responsible for all additional costs of 
inspection, treatment, movement, storage, destruction, or other measures 
ordered by an inspector under this subpart, including any labor, 
chemicals, packing materials, or other supplies required. APHIS will not 
be responsible for any costs or charges, other than those identified in 
this section.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Provisions relating to costs for other services of an inspector 
are contained in part 354 of this chapter.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (f) APHIS not responsible for damage. APHIS assumes no 
responsibility for any damage to fruits or vegetables that results from 
the application of treatments or other measures required under this 
subpart (or under part 305 of this chapter) to protect against the 
introduction of plant pests into the United States.

Sec. 319.56-4  Approval of certain fruits and vegetables for importation.

    (a) Determination by the Administrator. The Administrator has 
determined that the application of one or more of the designated 
phytosanitary measures cited in paragraph (b) of this section to certain 
imported fruits and vegetables mitigates the risk posed by those 
commodities, and that such fruits and vegetables may be imported into 
the United States subject to one or more of those measures, as provided 
in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. The name and origin of all 
fruits and vegetables authorized importation under this section, as well 
as the applicable requirements for their importation, may be found on 
the Internet at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/import--export/plants/manuals/
ports/downloads/fv.pdf. Commodities that require phytosanitary measures 
other than one or more of the designated phytosanitary measures cited in 
paragraph (b) of this section may only be imported in accordance with 
applicable requirements in Sec. 319.56-3 and commodity-specific 
requirements contained elsewhere in this subpart.
    (b) Designated phytosanitary measures. (1) Fruits or vegetables are 
subject to inspection upon arrival in the United States and comply with 
all applicable provisions of Sec. 319.56-3.
    (2) The fruits or vegetables are imported from a pest-free area in 
the country of origin and are accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate 
stating that the fruits or vegetables originated in a pest-free area in 
the country of origin.
    (3) The fruits or vegetables are treated in accordance with part 305 
of this chapter.
    (4) The fruits or vegetables are inspected in the country of origin 
by an inspector or an official of the national plant protection 
organization of the exporting country, and have been found free of one 
or more specific quarantine pests identified by risk analysis as likely 
to follow the import pathway.
    (5) The fruits or vegetables are imported as commercial consignments 
only.
    (c) Fruits and vegetables authorized importation under this section. 
(1) Previously approved fruits and vegetables.

[[Page 352]]

Fruits and vegetables that were authorized importation under this 
subpart either directly by permit or by specific regulation as of August 
17, 2007 and that were subject only to one or more of the designated 
phytosanitary measures cited in paragraph (b) of this section and the 
general requirements of Sec. 319.56-3, may continue to be imported into 
the United States under the same requirements that applied before August 
17, 2007, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) Other fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables that do not 
meet the criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this section may be authorized 
importation under this section as follows:
    (i) Pest risk analysis. The risk posed by the particular fruit or 
vegetable from a specified country or other region has been evaluated 
and publicly communicated as follows:
    (A) Availability of pest risk analysis. APHIS published in the 
Federal Register, for 60 days public comment, a notice announcing the 
availability of a pest risk analysis that evaluated the risks associated 
with the importation of the particular fruit or vegetable.
    (B) Determination of risk; factors considered. The Administrator 
determined, and announced in the notice referred to in the previous 
paragraph, that, based on the information available, the application of 
one or more of the designated phytosanitary measures described in 
paragraph (b) of this section is sufficient to mitigate the risk that 
plant pests or noxious weeds could be introduced into or disseminated 
within the United States via the imported fruit or vegetable. In order 
for the Administrator to make the determination described in this 
paragraph, he or she must conclude based on the information presented in 
the risk analysis for the fruit or vegetable that the risk posed by each 
quarantine pest associated with the fruit or vegetable in the country or 
other region of origin is mitigated by one or more of the following 
factors:
    (1) Inspection. A quarantine pest is associated with the commodity 
in the country or region of origin, but the pest can be easily detected 
via inspection;
    (2) Pest freedom. No quarantine pests are known to be associated 
with the fruit or vegetable in the country or region of origin, or a 
quarantine pest is associated with the commodity in the country or 
region of origin but the commodity originates from an area in the 
country or region that meets the requirements of Sec. 319.56-5 for 
freedom from that pest;
    (3) Effectiveness of treatment. A quarantine pest is associated with 
the fruit or vegetable in the country or region of origin, but the risk 
posed by the pest can be reduced by applying an approved post-harvest 
treatment to the fruit or vegetable.
    (4) Pre-export inspection. A quarantine pest is associated with the 
commodity in the country or region of origin, but the commodity is 
subject to pre-export inspection, and the commodity is to be accompanied 
by a phytosanitary certificate that contains an additional declaration 
that the commodity has been inspected and found free of such pests in 
the country or region of origin.
    (5) Commercial consignments. A quarantine pest is associated with 
the fruit or vegetable in the country or region of origin, but the risk 
posed by the pest can be reduced by commercial practices.
    (ii) Issuance of import permits. The Administrator will announce his 
or her decision in a subsequent Federal Register notice. If appropriate, 
APHIS would begin issuing permits for importation of the fruit or 
vegetable subject to requirements specified in the notice because:
    (A) No comments were received on the pest risk analysis;
    (B) The comments on the pest risk analysis revealed that no changes 
to the pest risk analysis were necessary; or
    (C) Changes to the pest risk analysis were made in response to 
public comments, but the changes did not affect the overall conclusions 
of the analysis and the Administrator's determination of risk.
    (d) Amendment of import requirements. If, after August 17, 2007, the 
Administrator determines that one or more of the designated 
phytosanitary measures is not sufficient to mitigate the risk

[[Page 353]]

posed by any of the fruits and vegetables that are authorized 
importation into the United States under this section, APHIS will 
prohibit or further restrict importation of the fruit or vegetable. 
APHIS may also publish a notice in the Federal Register advising the 
public of its finding. The notice will specify the amended import 
requirements, provide an effective date for the change, and will invite 
public comment on the subject.

<R05>
Sec. 319.56-5  Pest-free areas.

    As provided elsewhere in this subpart, certain fruits and vegetables 
may be imported into the United States provided that the fruits or 
vegetables originate from an area that is free of a specific pest or 
pests. In some cases, fruits or vegetables may only be imported if the 
area of export is free of all quarantine pests that attack the fruit or 
vegetable. In other cases, fruits and vegetables may be imported if the 
area of export is free of one or more quarantine pests that attack the 
fruit or vegetable, and provided that the risk posed by the remaining 
quarantine pests that attack the fruit or vegetable is mitigated by 
other specific phytosanitary measures contained in the regulations in 
this subpart.
    (a) Application of international standard for pest free areas. APHIS 
requires that determinations of pest-free areas be made in accordance 
with the criteria for establishing freedom from pests found in 
International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures No. 4, ``Requirements 
for the establishment of pest free areas.'' The international standard 
was established by the International Plant Protection Convention of the 
United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization and is incorporated by 
reference in Sec. 300.5 of this chapter.
    (b) Survey protocols. APHIS must approve the survey protocol used to 
determine and maintain pest-free status, as well as protocols for 
actions to be performed upon detection of a pest. Pest-free areas are 
subject to audit by APHIS to verify their status.
    (c) Determination of pest freedom. (1) For an area to be considered 
free of a specified pest for the purposes of this subpart, the 
Administrator must determine, and announce in a notice or rule published 
in the Federal Register for 60 days public comment, that the area meets 
the criteria of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (2) The Administrator will announce his or her decision in a 
subsequent Federal Register notice. If appropriate, APHIS would begin 
issuing permits for importation of the fruit or vegetable from a pest-
free area because:
    (i) No comments were received on the notice or
    (ii) The comments on the notice did not affect the overall 
conclusions of the notice and the Administrator's determination of risk.
    (d) Decertification of pest-free areas; reinstatement. If a pest is 
detected in an area that is designated as free of that pest, APHIS would 
publish in the Federal Register a notice announcing that the pest-free 
status of the area in question has been withdrawn, and that imports of 
host crops for the pest in question are subject to application of an 
approved treatment for the pest. If a treatment for the pest is not 
available, importation of the host crops would be prohibited. In order 
for a decertified pest-free area to be reinstated, it would have to meet 
the criteria of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (e) General requirements for fruits and vegetables imported from 
pest-free areas.
    (1) Labeling. Each box of fruits or vegetables that is imported into 
the United States from a pest-free area under this subpart must be 
clearly labeled with:
    (i) The name of the orchard or grove of origin, or the name of the 
grower; and
    (ii) The name of the municipality and State in which the fruits or 
vegetables were produced; and
    (iii) The type and amount of fruit the box contains.
    (2) Phytosanitary certificate. A phytosanitary certificate must 
accompany the imported fruits or vegetables, and must contain an 
additional declaration that the fruits originate from

[[Page 354]]

a pest-free area that meets the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) 
of this section.
    (3) Safeguarding. If fruits or vegetables are moved from a pest-free 
area into or through an area that is not free of that pest, the fruits 
or vegetables must be safeguarded during the time they are present in a 
non-pest-free area by being covered with insect-proof mesh screens or 
plastic tarpaulins, including while in transit to the packinghouse and 
while awaiting packaging. If fruits or vegetables are moved through an 
area that is not free of that pest during transit to a port, they must 
be packed in insect-proof cartons or containers or be covered by insect-
proof mesh or plastic tarpaulins during transit to the port and 
subsequent export to the United States. These safeguards described in 
this section must be intact upon arrival in the United States.

Sec. 319.56-6  Trust fund agreements.

    If APHIS personnel need to be physically present in an exporting 
country or region to facilitate the exportation of fruits or vegetables 
and APHIS services are to be funded by the national plant protection 
organization (NPPO) of the exporting country or a private export group, 
then the NPPO or the private export group must enter into a trust fund 
agreement with APHIS that is in effect at the time the fruits or 
vegetables are exported. Under the agreement, the NPPO of the exporting 
country or the private export group must pay in advance all estimated 
costs that APHIS expects to incur in providing inspection services in 
the exporting country. These costs will include administrative expenses 
incurred in conducting the services and all salaries (including overtime 
and the Federal share of employee benefits), travel expenses (including 
per diem expenses), and other incidental expenses incurred by the 
inspectors in performing services. The agreement must require the NPPO 
of the exporting country or region or a private export group to deposit 
a certified or cashier's check with APHIS for the amount of those costs, 
as estimated by APHIS. The agreement must further specify that, if the 
deposit is not sufficient to meet all costs incurred by APHIS, the NPPO 
of the exporting country or a private export group must deposit with 
APHIS, before the services will be completed, a certified or cashier's 
check for the amount of the remaining costs, as determined by APHIS. 
After a final audit at the conclusion of each shipping season, any 
overpayment of funds would be returned to the NPPO of the exporting 
country or region or a private export group, or held on account.

    (b) Trust fund agreement. Except as provided in paragraph (h) of 
this section, the apples or pears may be imported only if the national 
plant protection organization (NPPO) of the exporting country has 
entered into a trust fund agreement with APHIS in accordance with Sec. 
319.56-6.
    (c) Responsibilities of the exporting country. The apples or pears 
may be imported in any single shipping season only if all of the 
following conditions are met:
    (1) Officials of the NPPO must survey each orchard producing apples 
or pears for shipment to the United States at least twice between spring 
blossoming and harvest. If the officials find any leaf miners that 
suggest the presence of Leucoptera malifoliella in an orchard, the 
officials must reject any fruit harvested from that orchard during that 
growing season for shipment to the United States. If the officials find 
evidence in an orchard of any other plant pest referred to in paragraph 
(g) of this section, they must ensure that the orchard and all other 
orchards within 1 kilometer of that orchard will be treated for that 
pest with a pesticide approved by the APHIS, in accordance with label 
directions and under the direction of the plant protection organization. 
If the officials determine that the treatment program has not been 
applied as required or is not controlling the plant pest in the orchard, 
they must reject any fruit harvested from that orchard during that 
growing season for shipment to the United States.
    (2) The apples or pears must be identified to the orchard from which 
they are harvested (the producing orchard) until the fruit arrives in 
the United States.
    (3) The apples or pears must be processed and inspected in approved 
packing sheds as follows:
    (i) Upon arrival at the packing shed, the apples or pears must be 
inspected for insect pests as follows: For each grower lot (all fruit 
delivered for processing from a single orchard at a given time), packing 
shed technicians must examine all fruit in one carton on every third 
pallet (there are approximately 42 cartons to a pallet), or at least 80 
apples or pears in every third bin (if the fruit is not in cartons on 
pallets). If they find any live larva or pupa of Leucoptera 
malifoliella, they must reject the entire grower lot for shipment to the 
United States, and the NPPO must reject for shipment any additional 
fruit from the producing orchard for the remainder of the shipping 
season.
    (ii) The apples or pears must be sorted, sized, packed, and 
otherwise handled in the packing sheds on grading and packing lines used 
solely for fruit intended for shipment to the United States, or, if on 
grading and packing lines used previously for other fruit, only after 
the lines have been washed with water.
    (iii) During packing operations, apples and pears must be inspected 
for insect pests as follows: All fruit in each grower lot must be 
inspected at each of two inspection stations on the packing line by 
packing shed technicians. In addition, one carton from every pallet in 
each grower lot must be inspected by officials of the plant protection 
service. If the inspections reveal any live larva or pupa of Leucoptera 
malifoliella, the entire grower lot must be rejected for shipment to the 
United States, and the plant protection service must reject for shipment 
any additional fruit from the producing orchard for the remainder of 
that shipping season. If the inspections reveal any other insect pest 
referred to in paragraph (g) of this section, and a treatment authorized 
in

[[Page 364]]

part 305 of this chapter is available, the fruit will remain eligible 
for shipment to the United States if the entire grower lot is treated 
for the pest under the supervision of an inspector. However, if the 
entire grower lot is not treated in this manner, or if a plant pest is 
found for which no treatment authorized in part 305 of this chapter is 
available, the entire grower lot will be rejected for shipment to the 
United States.
    (4) Apples or pears that pass inspection at approved packing sheds 
must be presented to an inspector for preclearance inspection as 
prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section or for inspection in the 
United States as prescribed in paragraph (h) of this section.
    (5) Apples and pears presented for preclearance inspection must be 
identified with the packing shed where they were processed, as well as 
with the producing orchard, and this identity must be maintained until 
the apples or pears arrive in the United States.
    (6) Facilities for the preclearance inspections prescribed in 
paragraph (d) of this section must be provided in the exporting country 
at a site acceptable to APHIS.
    (7) Any apples or pears rejected for shipment into the United States 
may not, under any circumstance, be presented again for shipment to the 
United States.
    (d) Preclearance inspection. Preclearance inspection will be 
conducted in the exporting country by an inspector. Preclearance 
inspection will be conducted for a minimum of 6,000 cartons of apples or 
pears, which may represent multiple grower lots from different packing 
sheds. The cartons examined during any given preclearance inspection 
will be known as an inspection unit. Apples or pears in any inspection 
unit may be shipped to the United States only if the inspection unit 
passes inspection as follows:
    (1) Inspectors will examine, fruit by fruit, a biometrically 
designed statistical sample of 300 cartons drawn from each inspection 
unit.
    (i) If inspectors find any live larva or pupa of Leucoptera 
malifoliella, they will reject the entire inspection unit for shipment 
to the United States. The inspectors also will reject for shipment any 
additional fruit from the producing orchard for the remainder of the 
shipping season. However, other orchards represented in the rejected 
inspection unit will not be affected for the remainder of the shipping 
season because of that rejection. Additionally, if inspectors reject any 
three inspection units in a single shipping season because of Leucoptera 
malifoliella on fruit processed by a single packing shed, no additional 
fruit from that packing shed will be accepted for shipment to the United 
States for the remainder of that shipping season.
    (ii) If the inspectors find evidence of any other plant pest 
referred to in paragraph (g) of this section, and a treatment authorized 
in part 305 of this chapter is available, fruit in the inspection unit 
will remain eligible for shipment to the United States if the entire 
inspection unit is treated for the pest under the supervision of an 
inspector. However, if the entire inspection unit is not treated in this 
manner, or if a plant pest is found for which no treatment authorized in 
part 305 of this chapter is available, the inspectors will reject the 
entire inspection unit for shipment to the United States. Rejection of 
an inspection unit because of pests other than Leucoptera malifoliella 
will not be cause for rejecting additional fruit from an orchard or 
packing shed.
    (iii) Apples and pears precleared for shipment to the United States 
as prescribed in this paragraph will not be inspected again in the 
United States (except as necessary to ensure that the fruit has been 
precleared) unless the preclearance program with the exporting country 
is terminated in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. If the 
preclearance program is terminated with any country, precleared fruit in 
transit to the United States at the time of termination will be spot-
checked by inspectors upon arrival in the United States for evidence of 
plant pests referred to in paragraph (g) of this section. If any live 
larva or pupa of Leucoptera malifoliella is found in any carton of 
fruit, inspectors will reject that carton and all other cartons in that 
consignment that are from the same producing orchard. In addition, the 
remaining cartons of fruit in that consignment will be reinspected as an

[[Page 365]]

inspection unit in accordance with the preclearance procedures 
prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (e) Termination of preclearance programs. The Administrator may 
terminate the preclearance program in a country if he or she determines 
that any of the conditions specified in paragraph (c) of this section 
are not met or because of pests found during preclearance inspections. 
Termination of the preclearance program will stop consignments of apples 
or pears from that country for the remainder of that shipping season. 
Termination of the preclearance program for findings of Leucoptera 
malifoliella in preclearance inspections in any country will be based on 
rates of rejection of inspection units as follows:
    (1) Termination because of findings of Leucoptera malifoliella. The 
preclearance program will be terminated with a country when, in one 
shipping season, inspection units are rejected because of Leucoptera 
malifoliella as follows:
    (i) Five inspection units in sequence among inspection units 1-20, 
or a total of 8 or more of the inspection units 1-20;
    (ii) Five inspection units in sequence among inspection units 21-40, 
or a total of 10 or more of the inspection units 1-40;
    (iii) Five inspection units in sequence among inspection units 41-
60, or a total of 12 or more of the inspection units 1-60;
    (iv) Five inspection units in sequence among inspection units 61-80, 
or a total of 14 or more of the inspection units 1-80;
    (v) Five inspection units in sequence among inspection units 81-100, 
or a total of 16 or more of the inspection units 1-100;
    (vi) Five inspection units in sequence among inspection units 101-
120, or a total of 18 or more of the inspection units 1-120.
    (vii) Sequence can be continued in increments of 20 inspection units 
by increasing the number of rejected inspection units by 2.
    (2) Termination because of findings of other plant pests. The 
preclearance program will be terminated with a country when, in one 
shipping season, inspection units are rejected because of other insect 
pests as follows:
    (i) Ten or more of the inspection units 1-20;
    (ii) Fifteen or more of the inspection units 1-40;
    (iii) Twenty or more of the inspection units 1-60;
    (iv) Twenty-five or more of the inspection units 1-80;
    (v) Thirty or more of the inspection units 1-100; or
    (vi) Thirty-five or more of the inspection units 1-120.
    (vii) Sequence can be continued in increments of 20 inspection units 
by increasing the number of rejected inspection units by 5.
    (f) Cold treatment. In addition to all other requirements of this 
section, apples or pears may be imported into the United States from 
France, Italy, Portugal, or Spain only if the fruit is cold treated for 
the Mediterranean fruit fly in accordance with part 305 of this chapter.
    (g) Plant pests; authorized treatments. (1) Apples from Belgium, 
Denmark, France, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Northern 
Ireland, Norway, Portugal, the Republic of Ireland, Spain, Sweden, 
Switzerland, and Germany; and pears from Belgium, France, Great Britain, 
Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain may be imported into the 
United States only if they are found free of the following pests or, if 
an authorized treatment is available, they are treated for: The pear 
leaf blister moth (Leucoptera malifoliella (O.G. Costa) (Lyonetiidae)), 
the plum fruit moth (Cydia funebrana (Treitschke) (Tortricidae)), the 
summer fruit tortrix moth (Adoxophyes orana (Fischer von Rosslertamm)

(Tortricidae)), and other insect pests that do not exist in the United 
States or that are not widespread in the United States.
    (2) Authorized treatments are listed in part 305 of this chapter.
    (h) Inspection in the United States. Notwithstanding provisions to 
the contrary in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the 
Administrator may allow apples or pears imported under this

[[Page 366]]

section to be inspected at a port of arrival in the United States, in 
lieu of a preclearance inspection, under the following conditions:
    (1) The Administrator has determined that inspection can be 
accomplished at the port of arrival without increasing the risk of 
introducing insect pests into the United States;
    (2) Each pallet of apples or pears must be completely enclosed in 
plastic, to prevent the escape of insects, before it is offloaded at the 
port of arrival;
    (3) The entire consignment of apples or pears must be offloaded and 
moved to an enclosed warehouse, where adequate inspection facilities are 
available, under the supervision of an inspector.
    (4) The Administrator must determine that a sufficient number of 
inspectors are available at the port of arrival to perform the services 
required.
    (5) The method of inspection will be the same as prescribed in

    (1) Inspectors will examine the contents of the cartons based on a 
biometric sampling scheme established for each inspection unit.
    (i) If the inspectors find evidence of any plant pest for which a 
treatment authorized in part 305 of this chapter is available, fruit in 
the inspection unit will remain eligible for shipment to the United 
States if the entire inspection unit is treated for the pest in Chile. 
However, if the entire inspection unit is not treated in this manner, or 
if a plant pest is found for which no treatment authorized in part 305 
of this chapter is available, the entire inspection unit will not be 
eligible for shipment to the United States.
    (ii) Apricots, nectarines, peaches, plumcot, and plums precleared 
for shipment to the United States as prescribed in this paragraph will 
not be inspected again in the United States except as necessary to 
ensure that the fruit has been precleared and for occasional monitoring 
purposes.
    (2) [Reserved]

[[Page 367]]

    (e) Termination of preclearance programs. Consignments of apricots, 
nectarines, peaches, plumcot, and plums will be individually evaluated 
regarding the rates of infestation of inspection units of these articles 
presented for preclearance. The inspection program for an article will 
be terminated when inspections establish that the rate of infestation of 
inspection units of the article by pests listed in paragraph (f) of this 
section exceeds 20 percent calculated on any consecutive 14 days of 
actual inspections (not counting days on which inspections are not 
conducted). Termination of the inspection program for an article will 
require mandatory treatment in Chile, prior to shipment to the United 
States, of consignments of the article for the remainder of that 
shipping season. If a preclearance inspection program is terminated with 
Chile, precleared fruit in transit to the United States at the time of 
termination will be spot-checked by inspectors upon arrival in the 
United States for evidence of plant pests referred to in paragraph (f) 
of this section.
    (f) Plant pests; authorized treatments. (1) Apricots, nectarines, 
peaches, plumcot, or plums from Chile may be imported into the United 
States only if they are found free of the following pests or, if an 
authorized treatment is available, they are treated for: Proeulia spp., 
Leptoglossus chilensis, Megalometis chilensis, Naupactus xanthographus, 
Listroderes subcinctus, and Conoderus rufangulus, and other insect pests 
that the Administrator has determined do not exist, or are not 
widespread, in the United States.
    (2) Authorized treatments are listed in part 305 of this chapter.
    (g) Inspection in the United States. Notwithstanding provisions to 
the contrary in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the 
Administrator may, in emergency or extraordinary situations, allow 
apricots, nectarines, peaches, plumcot, or plums imported under this 
section to be inspected at a port of arrival in the United States, in 
lieu of a preclearance inspection or fumigation in Chile, under the 
following conditions:
    (1) The Administrator is satisfied that a unique situation exists 
which justifies a limited exception to mandatory preclearance;
    (2) The Administrator has determined that inspection and/or 
treatment can be accomplished at the intended port of arrival without 
increasing the risk of introducing quarantine pests into the United 
States;
    (3) The entire consignment of apricots, nectarines, peaches, 
plumcot, or plums must be offloaded and moved to an enclosed warehouse, 
where inspection and treatment facilities are available.
    (4) The Administrator must determine that a sufficient number of 
inspectors are available at the port of arrival to perform the services 
required.
    (5) The method of sampling and inspection will be the same as 
prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section for preclearance 
inspections.

    (7) Panama: Provinces of Cocle, Herrera, and Los Santos; Districts 
of Aleanje, David, and Dolega in the Province of Chiriqui; and all areas 
in the Province of Panama that are west of the Panama Canal.
    (b) Beginning at least 30 days before harvest began and continuing 
through the completion of harvest, all trees in the field where the 
papayas were grown were kept free of papayas that were one-half or more 
ripe (more than one-fourth of the shell surface yellow), and all culled 
and fallen fruits were buried, destroyed, or removed from the farm at 
least twice a week.
    (c) The papayas were held for 20 minutes in hot water at 48 [deg]C 
(118.4 [deg]F).
    (d) When packed, the papayas were less than one-half ripe (the shell 
surface was no more than one-fourth yellow, surrounded by light green), 
and appeared to be free of all injurious insect pests.
    (e) The papayas were safeguarded from exposure to fruit flies from 
harvest to export, including being packaged so as to prevent access by 
fruit flies and other injurious insect pests. The package containing the 
papayas does not contain any other fruit, including papayas not 
qualified for importation into the United States.
    (f) All cartons in which papayas are packed must be stamped ``Not 
for importation into or distribution in HI.''
    (g) All activities described in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this 
section were carried out under the supervision and direction of plant 
health officials of the national plant protection organization (NPPO).
    (h) Beginning at least 1 year before harvest begins and continuing 
through the completion of harvest, fruit fly traps were maintained in 
the field where the papayas were grown. The traps were placed at a rate 
of 1 trap per hectare and were checked for fruit flies at least once 
weekly by plant health officials of the NPPO. Fifty percent of the traps 
were of the McPhail type and 50 percent of the traps were of the Jackson 
type. If the average Jackson trap catch was greater than seven Medflies 
per trap per week, measures were taken to control the Medfly population 
in the production area. The NPPO kept records of fruit fly finds for 
each trap, updated the records each time the traps were checked, and 
made the records available to APHIS inspectors upon request. The records 
were maintained for at least 1 year.
    (i) If the average Jackson trap catch exceeds 14 Medflies per trap 
per week, importations of papayas from that production area must be 
halted until the rate of capture drops to an average of 7 or fewer 
Medflies per trap per week.
    (j) In the State of Espirito Santo, Brazil, if the average McPhail 
trap catch was greater than seven South American fruit flies (Anastrepha 
fraterculus) per trap per week, measures were taken to control the South 
American fruit fly population in the production area. If the average 
McPhail trap catch exceeds 14 South American fruit flies per trap per 
week, importations of papayas from that production area must be halted 
until the rate of capture drops to an average of 7 or fewer South 
American fruit flies per trap per week.
    (k) All consignments must be accompanied by a phytosanitary 
certificate issued by the national Ministry of Agriculture stating that 
the papayas were grown, packed, and shipped in accordance with the 
provisions of this section.

into the United States with treatment in accordance with paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section or if produced in accordance with the systems 
approach described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (1) With treatment. (i) The tomatoes must be treated in Chile with 
methyl bromide in accordance with part 305 of this chapter. The 
treatment must be conducted in facilities registered with the Servicio 
Agricola y Ganadero (SAG) and with APHIS personnel monitoring the 
treatments;
    (ii) The tomatoes must be treated and packed within 24 hours of 
harvest. Once treated, the tomatoes must be safeguarded by an insect-
proof mesh screen or plastic tarpaulin while in transit to the 
packinghouse and awaiting packing. They must be packed in insect-proof 
cartons or containers, or insect-proof mesh or plastic tarpaulin under 
APHIS monitoring for transit to the airport and subsequent export to the 
United States. These safeguards must be intact upon arrival in the 
United States; and
    (iii) Tomatoes may be imported into the United States from Chile 
with treatment in accordance with this paragraph (d)(1) only if SAG has 
entered into a trust fund agreement with APHIS for that shipping season 
in accordance with Sec. 319.56-6. This agreement requires SAG to pay in 
advance all costs that APHIS estimates it will incur in providing the 
preclearance services prescribed in this section for that shipping 
season.
    (2) Systems approach. The tomatoes may be imported without 
fumigation for Tuta absoluta, Rhagoletis tomatis, and Mediterranean 
fruit fly (Medfly, Ceratitis capitata) if they meet the following 
conditions:
    (i) The tomatoes must be grown in approved production sites that are 
registered with SAG. Initial approval of the production sites will be 
completed jointly by SAG and APHIS. SAG will visit and inspect the 
production sites monthly, starting 2 months before harvest and 
continuing until the end of the shipping season. APHIS may monitor the 
production sites at any time during this period.
    (ii) Tomato production sites must consist of pest-exclusionary 
greenhouses, which must have double self-closing doors and have all 
other openings and vents covered with 1.6 mm (or less) screening.
    (iii) The tomatoes must originate from an area that has been 
determined by APHIS to be free of Medfly in accordance with the 
procedures described in Sec. 319.56-5 or an area where Medfly trapping 
occurs. Production sites in areas where Medfly is known to occur must 
contain traps for both Medfly and Rhagoletis tomatis in accordance with 
paragraphs (d)(2)(iii) and (d)(2)(iv) of this section. Production sites 
in all other areas do not require trapping for Medfly. The trapping 
protocol for the detection of Medfly in infested areas is as follows:
    (A) McPhail traps with an approved protein bait must be used within 
registered greenhouses. Traps must be placed inside greenhouses at a 
density of 4 traps/10 ha, with a minimum of at least two traps per 
greenhouse.
    (B) Medfly traps with trimedlure must be placed inside a buffer area 
500 meters wide around the registered production site, at a density of 1 
trap/10 ha and a minimum of 10 traps. These traps must be checked at 
least every 7 days. At least one of these traps must be near a 
greenhouse. Traps must be set for at least 2 months before export and 
trapping and continue to the end of the harvest season.
    (C) Medfly prevalence levels in the surrounding areas must be 0.7 
Medflies per trap per week or lower. If levels exceed this before 
harvest, the production site will be prohibited from shipping under the 
systems approach. If the levels exceed this after the 2 months prior to 
harvest, the production site

[[Page 374]]

would be prohibited from shipping under the systems approach until APHIS 
and SAG agree that the pest risk has been mitigated.
    (iv) Registered production sites must contain traps for Rhagoletis 
tomatis in accordance with the following provisions:
    (A) McPhail traps with an approved protein bait must be used within 
registered greenhouses. Traps must be placed inside greenhouses at a 
density of 4 traps/10 ha, with a minimum of at least two traps per 
greenhouse. Traps inside greenhouses will use the same bait for Medfly 
and Rhagoletis tomatis because the bait used for R. tomatis is 
sufficient for attracting both types of fruit fly within the confines of 
a greenhouse; therefore, it is unnecessary to repeat this trapping 
protocol in production sites in areas where Medfly is known to occur.
    (B) McPhail traps with an approved protein bait must be placed 
inside a 500 meter buffer zone at a density of 1 trap/10 ha surrounding 
the production site. At least one of the traps must be near a 
greenhouse. Traps must be set for at least 2 months before export until 
the end of the harvest season and must be checked at least every 7 days. 
In areas where Medfly trapping is required, traps located outside of 
greenhouses must contain different baits for Medfly and Rhagoletis 
tomatis. There is only one approved bait for R. tomatis and the bait is 
not strong enough to lure Medfly when used outside greenhouses; 
therefore, separate traps must be used for each type of fruit fly 
present in the area surrounding the greenhouses.
    (C) If within 30 days of harvest a single Rhagoletis tomatis is 
captured inside the greenhouse or in a consignment or if two R. tomatis 
are captured or detected in the buffer zone, shipments from the 
production site will be suspended until APHIS and SAG determine that 
risk mitigation is achieved.
    (v) Registered production sites must conduct regular inspections for 
Tuta absoluta throughout the harvest season and find these areas free of 
T. absoluta evidence (e.g., eggs or larvae). If within 30 days of 
harvest, two T. absoluta are captured inside the greenhouse or a single 
T. absoluta is found inside the fruit or in a consignment, shipments 
from the production site will be suspended until APHIS and SAG determine 
that risk mitigation is achieved.
    (vi) SAG will ensure that populations of Liriomyza huidobrensis 
inside greenhouses are well managed by doing inspections during the 
monthly visits specifically for L. huidobrensis mines in the leaves and 
for visible external pupae or adults. If L. huidobrensis is found to be 
generally infesting the production site, shipments from the production 
site will be suspended until APHIS and SAG agree that risk mitigation is 
achieved.
    (vii) All traps must be placed at least 2 months prior to harvest 
and be maintained throughout the harvest season and be monitored and 
serviced weekly.
    (viii) SAG must maintain records of trap placement, checking of 
traps, and of any Rhagoletis tomatis or Tuta absoluta captures for 1 
year for APHIS review. SAG must maintain an APHIS approved quality 
control program to monitor or audit the trapping program. APHIS must be 
notified when a production site is removed from or added to the program.
    (ix) The tomatoes must be packed within 24 hours of harvest in a 
pest-exclusionary packinghouse. The tomatoes must be safeguarded by a 
pest-proof screen or plastic tarpaulin while in transit to the 
packinghouse and while awaiting packing. Tomatoes must be packed in 
insect-proof cartons or containers or covered with insect-proof mesh or 
plastic tarpaulin for transit to the United States. These safeguards 
must remain intact until arrival in the United States.
    (x) During the time the packinghouse is in use for exporting fruit 
to the United States, the packinghouse may only accept fruit from 
registered approved production sites.
    (xi) SAG is responsible for export certification inspection and 
issuance of phytosanitary certificates. Each consignment of tomatoes 
must be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate issued by SAG with an 
additional declaration, ``These tomatoes were grown in an approved 
production site in Chile.'' The shipping box must be labeled with the 
identity of the production site.

[[Page 375]]

    (e) Tomatoes (fruit) (Solanum lycopersicum) from Australia. Tomatoes 
may be imported into the United States from Australia only in accordance 
with this section and other applicable provisions of this subpart.
    (1) The tomatoes must be grown in greenhouses registered with, and 
inspected by, the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service (AQIS);
    (2) Two months prior to shipping, AQIS must inspect the greenhouse 
to establish its freedom from the following quarantine pests: Bactrocera 
aquilonis, B. cucumis, B. jarvis, B. neohumeralis, B. tryoni, Ceratitis 
capitata, Chrysodeixis argentifera, C. erisoma, Helicoverpa armigera, H. 
punctigera, Lamprolonchaea brouniana, Sceliodes cordalis, and Spodoptera 
litura. AQIS must also set and maintain fruit fly traps inside the 
greenhouses and around the perimeter of the greenhouses. Inside the 
greenhouses, the traps must be APHIS-approved fruit fly traps, and they 
must be set at the rate of six per hectare. In all areas outside the 
greenhouse and within 8 kilometers of the greenhouse, fruit fly traps 
must be placed on a 1-kilometer grid. All traps must be checked at least 
every 7 days;
    (3) Within a registered greenhouse, capture of a single fruit fly or 
other quarantine pest will result in immediate cancellation of exports 
from that greenhouse until the source of the infestation is determined, 
the infestation has been eradicated, and measures are taken to preclude 
any future infestation;
    (4) Outside of a registered greenhouse, if one fruit fly of the 
species specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section is captured, the 
trap density and frequency of trap inspection must be increased to 
detect a reproducing colony. Capture of two Medflies or three of the 
same species of Bactrocera within 2 kilometers of each other and within 
30 days will result in the cancellation of exports from all registered 
greenhouses within 2 kilometers of the finds until the source of the 
infestation is determined and the fruit fly infestation is eradicated;
    (5) AQIS must maintain records of trap placement, checking of traps, 
and any fruit fly captures, and must make the records available to APHIS 
upon request;
    (6) The tomatoes must be packed within 24 hours of harvest. They 
must be safeguarded by an insect-proof mesh screen or plastic tarpaulin 
while in transit to the packinghouse or while awaiting packing. They 
must be placed in insect-proof cartons or containers, or securely 
covered with insect-proof mesh or plastic tarpaulin for transport to the 
airport or other shipping point. These safeguards must be intact upon 
arrival in the United States; and
    (7) Each consignment of tomatoes must be accompanied by a 
phytosanitary certificate issued by AQIS stating ``These tomatoes were 
grown, packed, and shipped in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 
319.56-28(e) of 7 CFR.''
    (f) Tomatoes (fruit) (Solanum lycopersicum) from certain countries 
in Central America. Pink or red tomatoes may be imported into the United 
States from Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and 
Panama only under the following conditions:
    (1) From areas free of Mediterranean fruit fly:
    (i) The tomatoes must be grown and packed in an area that has been 
determined by APHIS to be free of Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly) in 
accordance with the procedures described in Sec. 319.56-5.
    (ii) A pre-harvest inspection of the production site must be 
conducted by the national plant protection organization (NPPO) of the 
exporting country for pea leafminer, tomato fruit borer, and potato 
spindle tuber viroid. If any of these pests are found to be generally 
infesting the production site, the NPPO may not allow exports from that 
production site until the NPPO and APHIS have determined that risk 
mitigation has been achieved.
    (iii) The tomatoes must be packed in insect-proof cartons or 
containers or covered with insect-proof mesh or plastic tarpaulin at the 
packinghouse for transit to the United States. These safeguards must 
remain intact until arrival in the United States.
    (iv) The exporting country's NPPO is responsible for export 
certification, inspection, and issuance of phytosanitary

[[Page 376]]

certificates. Each consignment of tomatoes must be accompanied by a 
phytosanitary certificate issued by the NPPO and bearing the 
declaration, ``These tomatoes were grown in an area recognized to be 
free of Medfly and the consignment has been inspected and found free of 
the pests listed in the requirements.''
    (2) From areas where Medfly is considered to exist:
    (i) The tomatoes must be grown in approved registered production 
sites. Initial approval of the production sites will be completed 
jointly by the exporting country's NPPO and APHIS. The exporting 
country's NPPO must visit and inspect the production sites monthly 
starting 2 months before harvest and continuing through until the end of 
the shipping season. APHIS may monitor the production sites at any time 
during this period.
    (ii) Tomato production sites must consist of pest-exclusionary 
greenhouses, which must have double self-closing doors and have all 
other openings and vents covered with 1.6 mm (or less) screening.
    (iii) Registered sites must contain traps for the detection of 
Medfly both within and around the production site as follows:
    (A) Traps with an approved protein bait for Medfly must be placed 
inside the greenhouses at a density of four traps per hectare, with a 
minimum of two traps per greenhouse. Traps must be serviced on a weekly 
basis.
    (B) If a single Medfly is detected inside a registered production 
site or in a consignment, the registered production site will lose its 
ability to export tomatoes to the United States until APHIS and the 
exporting country's NPPO mutually determine that risk mitigation is 
achieved.
    (C) Medfly traps with an approved lure must be placed inside a 
buffer area 500 meters wide around the registered production site, at a 
density of 1 trap per 10 hectares and a minimum of 10 traps. These traps 
must be checked at least every 7 days. At least one of these traps must 
be near the greenhouse. Traps must be set for at least 2 months before 
export and trapping must continue to the end of the harvest.
    (D) Capture of 0.7 or more Medflies per trap per week will delay or 
suspend the harvest, depending on whether harvest has begun, for 
consignments of tomatoes from that production site until APHIS and the 
exporting country's NPPO can agree that the pest risk has been 
mitigated.
    (E) The greenhouse must be inspected prior to harvest for pea 
leafminer, tomato fruit borer, and potato spindle tuber viroid. If any 
of these pests, or other quarantine pests, are found to be generally 
infesting the greenhouse, exports from that production site will be 
halted until the exporting country's NPPO and APHIS determine that the 
pest risk has been mitigated.
    (iv) The exporting country's NPPO must maintain records of trap 
placement, checking of traps, and any Medfly captures in addition to 
production site and packinghouse inspection records. The exporting 
country's NPPO must maintain an APHIS-approved quality control program 
to monitor or audit the trapping program. The trapping records must be 
maintained for APHIS's review.
    (v) The tomatoes must be packed within 24 hours of harvest in a 
pest-exclusionary packinghouse. The tomatoes must be safeguarded by an 
insect-proof mesh screen or plastic tarpaulin while in transit to the 
packinghouse and while awaiting packing. The tomatoes must be packed in 
insect-proof cartons or containers, or covered with insect-proof mesh or 
plastic tarpaulin, for transit into the United States. These safeguards 
must remain intact until arrival in the United States or the consignment 
will be denied entry into the United States.
    (vi) During the time the packinghouse is in use for exporting 
tomatoes to the United States, the packinghouse may only accept tomatoes 
from registered approved production sites.
    (vii) The exporting country's NPPO is responsible for export 
certification, inspection, and issuance of phytosanitary certificates. 
Each consignment of tomatoes must be accompanied by a phytosanitary 
certificate issued by the NPPO and bearing the declaration, ``These 
tomatoes were grown in an approved production site

[[Page 377]]

and the consignment has been inspected and found free of the pests 
listed in the requirements.'' The shipping box must be labeled with the 
identity of the production site.
    (g) Tomatoes (fruit) (Solanum lycopersicum) from the Souss-Massa-
Draa region of Morocco. Pink tomatoes may be imported into the United 
States from the region of Souss-Massa-Draa in Morocco only in accordance 
with this section and other applicable provisions of this subpart.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ See footnote 5 to paragraph (a) of this section.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) The tomatoes must be grown in approved production sites within 
the region of Souss-Massa-Draa in Morocco in pest-exclusionary 
structures registered with, and inspected by, the Moroccan Ministry of 
Agriculture, Division of Plant Protection, Inspection, and Enforcement 
(DPVCTRF). Production sites will be approved jointly by DPVCTRF and 
APHIS. DPVCTRF will visit and inspect the production sites starting 2 
months before harvest and continuing until the end of the shipping 
season. APHIS may monitor the production sites at any time during this 
period;
    (2) The tomatoes may be shipped from the Souss-Massa-Draa region of 
Morocco only between December 1 and April 30, inclusive;
    (3) Beginning 2 months prior to the start of the shipping season and 
continuing through the end of the shipping season, DPVCTRF must set and 
maintain Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly) traps baited with trimedlure, 
or other approved protein bait, inside the pest-exclusionary structures 
at a rate of 8 traps per hectare, with a minimum of 4 traps per pest-
exclusionary structure. Traps must also be placed outside registered 
pest-exclusionary structures within a 2-kilometer radius at a rate of 4 
traps per square kilometer. All traps must be checked every 7 days;
    (4) DPVCTRF must maintain records of trap placement, trap 
maintenance, and any Medfly captures, and make the records available to 
APHIS upon request. DPVCTRF must maintain an APHIS-approved quality 
control program to monitor or audit the trapping program. The trapping 
records must be maintained for 1 year for APHIS review;
    (5) Capture of a single Medfly in a registered pest-exclusionary 
structure during the 2 months prior to export and continuing through the 
duration of the harvest, or detection of a Medfly in a consignment that 
is traced back to a registered pest-exclusionary structure, will 
immediately result in cancellation of exports from that pest-
exclusionary structure until the source of the infestation is 
determined, the Medfly infestation has been eradicated, and measures are 
taken to preclude any future infestation. Exports will not be reinstated 
until APHIS and DPVCTRF mutually determine that risk mitigation has been 
achieved. Capture of a single Medfly within 200 meters of a registered 
pest-exclusionary structure will necessitate increasing trap density in 
order to determine whether there is a reproducing population in the 
area. Six additional traps must be placed within a radius of 200 meters 
surrounding the trap where the Medfly was captured. Capture of two 
Medflies within 200 meters of a registered pest-exclusionary structure 
and within a 1-month time period will necessitate Malathion bait sprays 
in the area every 7 to 10 days for 60 days to ensure eradication;
    (6) No Medfly host material is permitted within 50 meters of the 
entry door of the pest-exclusionary structure or the packinghouse;
    (7) The tomatoes must be packed within 24 hours of harvest and must 
be pink at the time of packing. They must be safeguarded by an insect-
proof mesh screen or plastic tarpaulin while in transit to the 
packinghouse and while awaiting packing. They must be packed in insect-
proof cartons or containers, or covered by insect-proof mesh or plastic 
tarpaulin for transit to the airport or ship and export to the United 
States. These safeguards must be intact upon arrival in the United 
States. Sea containers must be kept closed if stored within 20 meters of 
Medfly host materials prior to loading;
    (8) During the time the packinghouse is in use for exporting fruit 
to the United States, the packinghouse may only accept fruit from 
registered approved production sites; and

[[Page 378]]

    (9) The Moroccan Ministry of Agriculture, Fresh Product Export 
(EACCE) is responsible for export certification inspection and issuance 
of phytosanitary certificates. Each consignment of tomatoes must be 
accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate issued by EACCE and bearing 
the declaration, ``These tomatoes were grown in registered pest-
exclusionary structures in Souss-Massa-Draa Region, Morocco, and were 
pink at the time of packing.''

    (d) Certification. All consignments of avocados must be accompanied 
by a phytosanitary certificate issued by the Mexican NPPO with an 
additional declaration certifying that the conditions specified in this 
section have been met.
    (e) Pest detection. (1) If any of the avocado seed pests Heilipus 
lauri, Conotrachelus aguacatae, C. perseae, or Stenoma catenifer are 
discovered in a municipality during the semiannual pest surveys, orchard 
surveys, packinghouse inspections, or other monitoring or inspection 
activity in the municipality, the Mexican NPPO must immediately initiate 
an investigation and take measures to isolate and eradicate the pests. 
The Mexican NPPO must also provide APHIS with information regarding the 
circumstances of the infestation and the pest risk mitigation measures 
taken. The municipality in which the pests are discovered will lose its 
pest-free certification and avocado exports from that municipality will 
be suspended until APHIS and the Mexican NPPO agree that the pest 
eradication measures taken have been effective and that the pest risk 
within that municipality has been eliminated.
    (2) If the Mexican NPPO discovers the stem weevil Copturus aguacatae 
in an orchard during an orchard survey or other monitoring or inspection 
activity in the orchard, the Mexican NPPO must provide APHIS with 
information regarding the circumstances of the infestation and the pest 
risk mitigation measures taken. The orchard in which the pest was found 
will lose its export certification immediately and avocado exports from 
that orchard will be suspended until APHIS and the Mexican NPPO agree 
that the pest eradication measures taken have been effective and that 
the pest risk within that orchard has been eliminated.
    (3) If the Mexican NPPO discovers the stem weevil Copturus aguacatae 
in fruit at a packinghouse, the Mexican NPPO must investigate the origin 
of the infested fruit and provide APHIS with information regarding the 
circumstances of the infestation and the pest risk mitigation measures 
taken. The orchard where the infested fruit originated will lose its 
export certification immediately and avocado exports from that orchard 
will be suspended until APHIS and the Mexican NPPO agree that the pest 
eradication measures taken have been effective and that the pest risk 
within that orchard has been eliminated.
    (f) Ports. The avocados may enter the United States only through a 
port of entry located in a State where the distribution of the fruit is 
authorized pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (g) Inspection. The avocados are subject to inspection by an 
inspector at the port of first arrival. At the port of first arrival, an 
inspector will sample and cut avocados from each consignment to detect 
pest infestation.
    (h) Inspection. The avocados are subject to inspection by an 
inspector at the port of first arrival, at any stops in the United 
States en route to an approved State, and upon arrival at the terminal 
market in the approved States. At the port of first arrival, an 
inspector will sample and cut avocados from each consignment to detect 
pest infestation.
    (i) Repackaging. If any avocados are removed from their original 
shipping boxes and repackaged, the stickers required by paragraph 
(c)(3)(vi) of this section may not be removed or obscured and the new 
boxes must be

Sec. 319.56-31  Peppers from Spain.

    Peppers (fruit) (Capsicum spp.) may be imported into the United 
States from Spain only under permit, and only in accordance with this 
section and all other applicable requirements of this subpart:
    (a) The peppers must be grown in the Alicante or Almeria Province of 
Spain in pest-proof greenhouses registered with, and inspected by, the 
Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food (MAFF);
    (b) The peppers may be shipped only from December 1 through April 
30, inclusive;
    (c) Beginning October 1, and continuing through April 30, MAFF must 
set and maintain Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata) (Medfly) 
traps baited with trimedlure inside the greenhouses at a rate of four 
traps per hectare. In all outside areas, including urban and residential 
areas, within 8 kilometers of the greenhouses, MAFF must set and 
maintain Medfly traps baited with trimedlure at a rate of four traps per 
square kilometer. All traps must be checked every 7 days;

immediately halt exports from that greenhouse until the Administrator 
determines that the source of infestation has been identified, that all 
Medflies have been eradicated, and that measures have been taken to 
preclude any future infestation. Capture of a single Medfly within 2 
kilometers of a registered greenhouse will necessitate increased trap 
density in order to determine whether there is a reproducing population 
in the area. Capture of two Medflies within 2 kilometers of a registered 
greenhouse during a 1-month period will halt exports from all registered 
greenhouses within 2 kilometers of the capture, until the source of 
infestation is determined and all Medflies are eradicated;
    (e) The peppers must be safeguarded from harvest to export by 
insect-proof mesh or plastic tarpaulin, including while in transit to 
the packinghouse and while awaiting packing. They must be packed in 
insect-proof cartons or covered by insect-proof mesh or plastic 
tarpaulin for transit to the airport and subsequent export to the United 
States. These safeguards must be intact upon arrival in the United 
States;
    (f) The peppers must be packed for shipment within 24 hours of 
harvest;
    (g) During shipment, the peppers may not transit other fruit fly-
supporting areas unless shipping containers are sealed by MAFF with an 
official seal whose number is noted on the phytosanitary certificate; 
and
    (h) A phytosanitary certificate issued by MAFF and bearing the 
declaration, ``These peppers were grown in registered greenhouses in 
Alicante or Almeria Province in Spain,'' must accompany the consignment.

Sec. 319.56-34  Clementines from Spain.

    Clementines (Citrus reticulata) from Spain may only be imported into 
the United States in accordance with this section and all other 
applicable provisions of this subpart.
    (a) Trust fund agreement. Clementines from Spain may be imported 
only if the Government of Spain or its designated representative enters 
into a trust fund agreement with APHIS before each shipping season in 
accordance with Sec. 319.56-6.
    (b) Grower registration and agreement. Persons who produce 
clementines in Spain for export to the United States must:
    (1) Be registered with the Government of Spain; and
    (2) Enter into an agreement with the Government of Spain whereby the 
producer agrees to participate in and follow the Mediterranean fruit fly 
management program established by the Government of Spain.
    (c) Management program for Mediterranean fruit fly; monitoring. The 
Government of Spain's Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata) 
management program must be approved by APHIS, and must contain the fruit 
fly trapping and recordkeeping requirements specified in this paragraph. 
The program must also provide that clementine producers must allow APHIS 
inspectors access to clementine production areas in order to monitor 
compliance with the Mediterranean fruit fly management program.
    (1) Trapping and control. In areas where clementines are produced 
for export to the United States, traps must be placed in Mediterranean 
fruit fly host plants at least 6 weeks prior to harvest. Bait treatments 
using malathion, spinosad, or another pesticide that is approved by 
APHIS and the Government of Spain must be applied in the production 
areas at the rate specified by Spain's Medfly management program.
    (2) Records. The Government of Spain or its designated 
representative must

[[Page 383]]

keep records that document the fruit fly trapping and control activities 
in areas that produce clementines for export to the United States. All 
trapping and control records kept by the Government of Spain or its 
designated representative must be made available to APHIS upon request.
    (3) Compliance. If APHIS determines that an orchard is not operating 
in compliance with the regulations in this section, it may suspend 
exports of clementines from that orchard.
    (d) Phytosanitary certificate. Clementines from Spain must be 
accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate stating that the fruit meets 
the conditions of the Government of Spain's Mediterranean fruit fly 
management program and applicable APHIS regulations.
    (e) Labeling. Boxes in which clementines are packed must be labeled 
with a lot number that provides information to identify the orchard 
where the fruit was grown and the packinghouse where the fruit was 
packed. The lot number must end with the letters ``US.'' All labeling 
must be large enough to clearly display the required information and 
must be located on the outside of the boxes to facilitate inspection.
    (f) Pre-treatment sampling; rates of inspection. For each 
consignment of clementines intended for export to the United States, 
prior to cold treatment, inspectors will cut and inspect 200 fruit that 
are randomly selected from throughout the consignment. If inspectors 
find a single live Mediterranean fruit fly in any stage of development 
during an inspection, the entire consignment of clementines will be 
rejected. If a live Mediterranean fruit fly in any stage of development 
is found in any two lots of fruit from the same orchard during the same 
shipping season, that orchard will be removed from the export program 
for the remainder of that shipping season.
    (g) Cold treatment. Clementines must be cold treated in accordance 
with part 305 of this chapter. Upon arrival of clementines at a port of 
entry into the United States, inspectors will examine the cold treatment 
data for each consignment to ensure that the cold treatment was 
successfully completed. If the cold treatment has not been successfully 
completed, the consignment will be held until appropriate remedial 
actions have been implemented.
    (h) Port of entry sampling. Clementines imported from Spain are 
subject to inspection by an inspector at the port of entry into the 
United States. At the port of first arrival, an inspector will sample 
and cut clementines from each consignment to detect pest infestation 
according to sampling rates determined by the Administrator. If a single 
live Mediterranean fruit fly in any stage of development is found, the 
consignment will be held until an investigation is completed and 
appropriate remedial actions have been implemented.
    (i) Suspension of program. If APHIS determines at any time that the 
safeguards contained in this section are not protecting against the 
introduction of Medflies into the United States, APHIS may suspend the 
importation of clementines and conduct an investigation into the cause 
of the deficiency.
    (j) Definitions. The following are definitions for terms used in 
this section:
    Consignment. (1) Untreated fruit. For untreated fruit, the term 
means one or more lots (containing no more than a combined total of 
200,000 boxes of clementines) that are presented to an inspector for 
pre-treatment inspection.
    (2) Treated fruit. For treated fruit, the term means one or more 
lots of clementines that are imported into the United States on the same 
conveyance.
    Lot. For the purposes of this section, a number of units of 
clementines that are from a common origin (i.e., a single producer or a 
homogenous production unit.) \9\

Sec. 319.56-38  Citrus from Chile.

    Clementines (Citrus reticulata Blanco var. Clementine), mandarins 
(Citrus reticulata Blanco), and tangerines (Citrus reticulata Blanco) 
may be imported into the United States from Chile, and grapefruit 
(Citrus paradisi Macfad.) and sweet oranges (Citrus sinensis (L.) 
Osbeck) may be imported into the continental United States from Chile, 
in accordance with this section and all other applicable provisions of 
this subpart.
    (a) The fruit must be accompanied by a permit issued in accordance 
with Sec. 319.56-3(b).
    (b) If the fruit is produced in an area of Chile where Mediterranean 
fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata) is known to occur, the fruit must be cold 
treated in accordance with part 305 of this chapter. Fruit for which 
cold treatment is required must be accompanied by documentation 
indicating that the cold treatment was initiated in Chile (a PPQ Form 
203 or its equivalent may be used for this purpose).
    (c) The fruit must either be produced and shipped under the systems 
approach described in paragraph (d) of this section or fumigated in 
accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
    (d) Systems approach. The fruit may be imported without fumigation 
for Brevipalpus chilensis if it meets the following conditions:
    (1) Production site registration. The production site where the 
fruit is grown must be registered with the national plant protection 
organization (NPPO) of Chile. To register, the production site must 
provide Chile's NPPO with the following information: Production site 
name, grower, municipality, province, region, area planted to each 
species, number of plants/hectares/species, and approximate date of 
harvest. Registration must be renewed annually.
    (2) Low prevalence production site certification. Between 1 and 30 
days prior to harvest, random samples of fruit must be collected from 
each registered production site under the direction of Chile's NPPO. 
These samples must undergo a pest detection and evaluation method as 
follows: The fruit and pedicels must be washed using a flushing method, 
placed in a 20 mesh sieve on top of a 200 mesh or finer sieve, sprinkled 
with a liquid soap and water solution, washed with water at high 
pressure, and washed with water at low pressure. The process must then 
be repeated. The contents of the sieves must then be placed on a petri 
dish and analyzed for the presence of live B. chilensis mites. If a 
single live B. chilensis mite is found, the production site will not 
qualify for certification as a low prevalence production site and will 
be eligible to export fruit to the United States only if the fruit is 
fumigated in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. Each 
production site may have only one opportunity per

[[Page 386]]

harvest season to qualify as a low prevalence production site, and 
certification of low prevalence will be valid for one harvest season 
only. The NPPO of Chile will present a list of certified production 
sites to APHIS.
    (3) Post-harvest processing. After harvest and before packing, the 
fruit must be washed, rinsed in a potable water bath, washed with 
detergent with brushing using bristle rollers, rinsed with a hot water 
shower with brushing using bristle rollers, predried at room 
temperature, waxed, and dried with hot air.
    (4) Phytosanitary inspection. The fruit must be inspected in Chile 
at an APHIS-approved inspection site under the direction of APHIS 
inspectors in coordination with the NPPO of Chile after the post-harvest 
processing. A biometric sample will be drawn and examined from each 
consignment of fruit, which may represent multiple grower lots from 
different packing sheds. Clementines, mandarins, or tangerines in any 
consignment may be shipped to the United States only if the consignment 
passes inspection as follows:
    (i) Fruit presented for inspection must be identified in the 
shipping documents accompanying each lot of fruit that identify the 
production site(s) where the fruit was produced and the packing shed(s) 
where the fruit was processed. This identity must be maintained until 
the fruit is released for entry into the United States.
    (ii) A biometric sample of boxes from each consignment will be 
selected and the fruit from these boxes will be visually inspected for 
quarantine pests, and a portion of the fruit will be washed and the 
collected filtrate will be microscopically examined for B. chilensis.
    (A) If a single live B. chilensis mite is found, the fruit will be 
eligible for importation into the United States only if it is fumigated 
in Chile in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. The 
production site will be suspended from the low prevalence certification 
program and all subsequent lots of fruit from the production site of 
origin will be required to be fumigated as a condition of entry to the 
United States for the remainder of the shipping season.
    (B) If inspectors find evidence of any other quarantine pest, the 
fruit in the consignment will remain eligible for importation into the 
United States only if an authorized treatment for the pest is available 
in part 305 of this chapter and the entire consignment is treated for 
the pest in Chile under APHIS supervision.
    (iii) Each consignment of fruit must be accompanied by a 
phytosanitary certificate issued by the NPPO of Chile that contains an 
additional declaration stating that the fruit in the consignment meets 
the conditions of Sec. 319.56-38(d).
    (e) Approved fumigation. Clementines, grapefruit, mandarins, sweet 
oranges, or tangerines that do not meet the conditions of paragraph (d) 
of this section may be imported into the United States if the fruit is 
fumigated either in Chile or at the port of first arrival in the United 
States with methyl bromide for B. chilensis in accordance with part 305 
of this chapter. An APHIS inspector will monitor the fumigation of the 
fruit and will prescribe such safeguards as may be necessary for 
unloading, handling, and transportation preparatory to fumigation. The 
final release of the fruit for entry into the United States will be 
conditioned upon compliance with prescribed safeguards and required 
treatment.
    (f) Trust fund agreement. Clementines, grapefruit, mandarins, sweet 
oranges, or tangerines may be imported into the United States under this 
section only if the NPPO of Chile or a private export group has entered 
into a trust fund agreement with APHIS in accordance with Sec. 319.56-
6.

Sec. 319.56-41  Citrus from Peru.

    Grapefruit (Citrus paradisi), limes (C. aurantiifolia), mandarins or 
tangerines (C. reticulata), sweet oranges (C. sinensis), and tangelos 
(Citrus tangelo) may be imported into the United States from Peru under 
the following conditions:
    (a) The fruit must be accompanied by a permit issued in accordance 
with Sec. 319.56-3(b).
    (b) The fruit may be imported in commercial consignments only.
    (c) Approved growing areas. The fruit must be grown in one of the 
following approved citrus-producing zones: Zone I, Piura; Zone II, 
Lambayeque; Zone III, Lima; Zone IV, Ica; and Zone V, Junin.
    (d) Grower registration and agreement. The production site where the 
fruit is grown must be registered for export with the national plant 
protection organization (NPPO) of Peru, and the producer must have 
signed an agreement with the NPPO of Peru whereby the producer agrees to 
participate in and follow the fruit fly management program established 
by the NPPO of Peru.
    (e) Management program for fruit flies; monitoring. The NPPO of 
Peru's fruit fly management program must be approved by APHIS, and must 
require that participating citrus producers allow APHIS inspectors 
access to production areas in order to monitor compliance with the fruit 
fly management program. The fruit fly management program must also 
provide for the following:
    (1) Trapping and control. In areas where citrus is produced for 
export to the United States, traps must be placed in fruit fly host 
plants at least 6 weeks prior to harvest at a rate mutually agreed upon 
by APHIS and the NPPO of Peru. If fruit fly trapping levels at a 
production site exceed the thresholds established by APHIS and the NPPO 
of Peru, exports from that production site will be suspended until APHIS 
and the NPPO of Peru conclude that fruit fly population levels have been 
reduced to an acceptable limit. Fruit fly traps are monitored weekly; 
therefore, reinstatements of production sites will be evaluated on a 
weekly basis.
    (2) Records. The NPPO of Peru or its designated representative must 
keep records that document the fruit fly trapping and control activities 
in areas that produce citrus for export to the United States. All 
trapping and control records kept by the NPPO of Peru or its designated 
representative must be made available to APHIS upon request.
    (f) Cold treatment. The fruit, except for limes (C. aurantiifolia), 
must be cold treated for Anastrepha fraterculus, A.

[[Page 391]]

obliqua, A. serpentina, and Ceratitis capitata (Mediterranean fruit fly) 
in accordance with part 305 of this chapter.
    (g) Phytosanitary inspection. Each consignment of fruit must be 
accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate issued by the NPPO of Peru 
stating that the fruit has been inspected and found free of Ecdytolopha 
aurantiana.
    (h) Port of first arrival sampling. Citrus fruits imported from Peru 
are subject to inspection by an inspector at the port of first arrival 
into the United States in accordance with Sec. 319.56-3(d). At the port 
of first arrival, an inspector will sample and cut citrus fruits from 
each consignment to detect pest infestation. If a single live fruit fly 
in any stage of development or a single E. aurantiana is found, the 
consignment will be held until an investigation is completed and 
appropriate remedial actions have been implemented.

Sec. 319.56-48  Conditions governing the entry of baby squash and 
baby courgettes from Zambia.

    Baby squash (Curcurbita maxima Duchesne) and baby courgettes (C. 
pepo. L.) measuring 10 to 25 millimeters (0.39 to 0.98 inches) in 
diameter and 60 to 105 millimeters (2.36 to 4.13 inches) in length may 
be imported into the continental United States from Zambia only under 
the conditions described in this section. These conditions are designed 
to prevent the introduction of the following quarantine pests: 
Aulacaspis tubercularis, Dacus bivitattus, Dacus ciliatus, Dacus 
frontalis, Dacus lounsburyii, Dacus punctatifrons, Dacus vertebratus, 
Diaphania indica, Helicoverpa armigera, and Spodoptera littoralis.
    (a) Approved greenhouses. The baby squash and baby courgettes must 
be grown in Zambia in insect-proof, pest-free greenhouses approved 
jointly by the Zambian national plant protection organization (NPPO) and 
APHIS.
    (1) The greenhouses must be equipped with double self-closing doors.
    (2) Any vents or openings in the greenhouses (other than the double 
self-closing doors) must be covered with 1.6 mm screening in order to 
prevent the entry of pests into the greenhouse.
    (3) The greenhouses must be inspected periodically by the Zambian 
NPPO or its approved designee to ensure that sanitary procedures are 
employed to exclude plant pests and diseases and to verify that the 
screening is intact.
    (4) The greenhouses also must be inspected monthly for the 
quarantine pests listed in the introductory text of this section by the 
Zambian NPPO or its approved designee, beginning 2 months before harvest 
and continuing for the duration of the harvest. APHIS must be allowed to 
inspect or monitor the greenhouses during this period as well. If, 
during these inspections, any of the quarantine pests listed in the 
introductory text of this section is found inside the greenhouse, the 
Zambian NPPO will immediately prohibit that greenhouse from exporting 
baby squash or baby courgettes to the United States and notify APHIS of 
the action. The prohibition will remain in effect

[[Page 395]]

until the Zambian NPPO and APHIS agree that the risk has been mitigated.
    (b) Trapping for Dacus spp. fruit flies. Trapping for Dacus 
bivitattus, Dacus ciliatus, Dacus frontalis, Dacus lounsburyii, Dacus 
punctatifrons, and Dacus vertebratus (referred to in paragraph (b) of 
this section, collectively, as Dacus spp. fruit flies) is required both 
inside and outside the greenhouse. Trapping must be conducted beginning 
2 months before harvest and continue for the duration of the harvest.
    (1) Inside the greenhouse. Approved fruit fly traps with an approved 
protein bait must be placed inside the greenhouses at a density of four 
traps per hectare, with a minimum of at least two traps per greenhouse. 
The traps must be serviced at least once every 7 days. If a Dacus spp. 
fruit fly is found in a trap inside the greenhouse, the Zambian NPPO 
will immediately prohibit that greenhouse from exporting baby squash or 
baby courgettes to the United States and notify APHIS of the action. The 
prohibition will remain in effect until the Zambian NPPO and APHIS agree 
that the risk has been mitigated.
    (2) Outside the greenhouse. (i) Approved fruit fly traps with an 
approved protein bait must be placed inside a buffer area 500 meters 
wide around the greenhouse at a density of 1 trap per 10 hectares, with 
a total of at least 10 traps. At least one of these traps must be placed 
near the greenhouse. These traps must be serviced at least once every 7 
days.
    (ii) No shade trees are permitted within 10 meters of the entry door 
of the greenhouse, and no fruit fly host plants are permitted within 50 
meters of the entry door of the greenhouse. While trapping is being 
conducted, no fruit fly host material (such as fruit) may be brought 
into the greenhouse or be discarded within 50 meters of the entry door 
of the greenhouse. Ground applications of an approved protein bait spray 
for the Dacus spp. fruit flies must be used on all shade trees and host 
plants within 200 meters surrounding the greenhouse every 6 to 10 days 
starting at least 30 days before and during harvest.
    (iii) Dacus spp. fruit fly prevalence levels lower than 0.7 flies 
per trap per week (F/T/W) must be maintained outside the greenhouse for 
the duration of the trapping. If the F/T/W is 0.7 or greater outside the 
greenhouse, the Zambian NPPO will immediately prohibit that greenhouse 
from exporting baby squash or baby courgettes to the United States and 
notify APHIS of the action. The prohibition will remain in effect until 
the Zambian NPPO and APHIS agree that the risk has been mitigated.
    (3) Records and monitoring. The Zambian NPPO or its approved 
designee must maintain records of trap placement, trap servicing, and 
any Dacus spp. captures. The Zambian NPPO must maintain an APHIS-
approved quality control program to audit the trapping program. APHIS 
must be given access to review 1 year's worth of trapping data for any 
approved greenhouse upon request.
    (c) Packinghouse procedures. Baby squash and baby courgettes must be

No shade trees are permitted within 10 meters of the entry door of the 
packinghouse, and no fruit fly host plants are permitted within 50 
meters of the entry door of the packinghouse. In addition, during 
packing, no fruit fly host material other than the baby squash and baby 
courgettes may be brought into the packinghouse, and no fruit fly host 
material may be discarded within 50 meters of the entry door of the 
packinghouse. The baby squash or baby courgettes must be safeguarded by 
a pest-proof screen or plastic tarpaulin while in transit to the 
packinghouse and while awaiting packing. The baby squash or baby 
courgettes must be packed in insect-proof cartons for shipment to the 
United States. These cartons must be labeled with the identity of the 
greenhouse. While packing the baby squash or baby courgettes for export 
to the United States, the packinghouse may only accept baby squash or 
baby courgettes from approved greenhouses. These safeguards must remain 
intact until the arrival of the baby squash or baby courgettes in the 
United States. If the safeguards do not remain intact, the consignment 
will not be allowed to enter the United States.

Sec. 319.56-49  Eggplant from Israel.

    Eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) may be imported into the continental 
United States from Israel only under the conditions described in this 
section. These conditions are designed to prevent the introduction of 
the following quarantine pests: Ceratitis capitata, Eutetranychus 
orientalis, Helicoverpa armigera, Nipaecoccus viridis, Scirtothrips 
dorsalis, and Spodoptera littoralis.
    (a) Approved pest-exclusionary structures. The eggplant must be 
grown in pest-exclusionary structures in approved production sites in 
the Arava Valley of Israel by growers registered with the Israeli 
national plant protection organization (NPPO). Initial approval of the 
production sites must be completed jointly by the Israeli NPPO and 
APHIS.
    (1) The pest-exclusionary structures must be equipped with double 
self-closing doors.
    (2) Any vents or openings in the pest-exclusionary structures (other 
than the double self-closing doors) must be covered with 1.6 mm or 
smaller screening in order to prevent the entry of pests into the pest-
exclusionary structure.
    (3) The pest-exclusionary structures must be inspected periodically 
by the Israeli NPPO or its approved designee to ensure that sanitary 
procedures are employed to exclude plant pests and diseases and to 
verify that the screening is intact.
    (4) The pest-exclusionary structures also must be inspected monthly 
for the quarantine pests listed in the introductory text of this section 
by the Israeli NPPO or its approved designee, beginning 2 months before 
harvest and continuing for the duration of the harvest. APHIS must be 
granted access to inspect or monitor the pest-exclusionary structures 
during this period as well. If, during these inspections, any quarantine 
pests listed in the introductory text of this section are found inside a 
pest-exclusionary structure, the Israeli NPPO will immediately prohibit 
that pest-exclusionary structure from exporting eggplant to the 
continental United States and notify APHIS of the action. The 
prohibition will remain in effect until the Israeli NPPO and APHIS agree 
that the risk has been mitigated.
    (b) Trapping for Medfly. Trapping for Mediterranean fruit fly 
(Medfly, Ceratitis capitata) is required both inside and outside the 
pest-exclusionary structures. Trapping must begin 2 months before 
harvest and continue for the duration of the harvest.
    (1) Inside the pest-exclusionary structures. APHIS-approved fruit 
fly traps with an approved protein bait must be placed inside the pest-
exclusionary structures at a density of four traps per hectare, with a 
minimum of at least two traps per pest-exclusionary structure. The traps 
must be serviced at least once every 7 days. If a single Medfly is found 
in a trap inside a pest-exclusionary structure, the Israeli NPPO will 
immediately prohibit that pest-exclusionary structure from exporting 
eggplant to the continental United States and notify APHIS of the 
action. The prohibition will remain in effect until the Israeli NPPO and 
APHIS agree that the risk has been mitigated.
    (2) Outside the pest-exclusionary structures. (i) No shade trees are 
permitted within 10 meters of the entry door of the pest-exclusionary 
structures, and no fruit fly host plants are permitted within 50 meters 
of the entry door of the pest-exclusionary structures. While trapping is 
being conducted, no fruit fly host material (such as fruit) may be 
brought into the pest-exclusionary structures or be discarded within 50 
meters of the entry door of the pest-exclusionary structures.

[[Page 397]]

    (ii) A treatment jointly approved by the Israeli NPPO and APHIS must 
be applied for the duration of the eggplant harvest in the areas of the 
Arava Valley where fruit fly host material occurs in backyards.
    (iii) Trapping for Medfly must be conducted by the Israeli NPPO or 
its approved designee throughout the year in the agricultural region 
along the Arava Highway 90 and in the residential area of Paran.
    (iv) Trapping records must be kept and made available for APHIS 
review upon request.
    (c) Packinghouse procedures. The eggplant must be packed within 24 
hours of harvest in a pest-exclusionary packinghouse. While packing the 
eggplant for export to the continental United States, the packinghouse 
may only accept eggplant from approved pest-exclusionary structures. No 
shade trees are permitted within 10 meters of the entry door of the 
packinghouse, and no fruit fly host plants are permitted within 50 
meters of the entry door of the packinghouse. The eggplant must be 
safeguarded by a pest-proof screen or plastic tarpaulin while in transit 
to the packinghouse and while awaiting packing. Packinghouse procedures 
must include culling of any visibly damaged, overripe, or infested 
eggplant. The eggplant must be packed in either individual insect-proof 
cartons or boxes labeled with the specific place of origin or non-
insect-proof cartons or boxes that are covered by insect-proof mesh or 
plastic tarpaulins. Covered non-insect-proof cartons or boxes must be 
placed in shipping containers that have identification labels indicating 
the specific place of origin. These safeguards must remain intact until 
the arrival of the eggplant in the continental United States or the 
consignment will not be allowed to enter the continental United States.
    (d) Commercial consignments. Eggplant from Israel may be imported in 
commercial consignments only.
    (e) Phytosanitary certificate. Each consignment of eggplant must be 
accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate of inspection issued by the 
Israeli NPPO with an additional declaration reading as follows: ``The 
eggplant in this consignment has been grown in an approved production 
site and inspected and found free of the pests listed in 7 CFR 319.56-
49.''

in Sec. 319.73-3 of this subpart:
    (1) Unroasted coffee;
    (2) Coffee plants and leaves; and
    (3) Empty sacks previously used for unroasted coffee.
    (b) Due to the risk of Mediterranean fruit fly and other injurious 
insects, seeds of all kinds when in pulp, including coffee berries or 
fruits, are prohibited importation into all parts of the United States 
by Sec. 319.37-2(a) of this part, except as provided in Sec. 319.37-

<R05>
Sec. 319.73-3  Conditions for transit movement of certain products 
through Puerto Rico or Hawaii.

    (a) Mail. Samples of unroasted coffee that are transiting Hawaii or 
Puerto Rico en route to other destinations and that are packaged to 
prevent the escape of any plant pests may proceed without action by an 
inspector. Packaging that would prevent the escape of plant pests 
includes, but is not limited to, sealed cartons, airtight containers, or 
vacuum packaging. Samples of unroasted coffee received by mail but not 
packaged in this manner are subject to inspection and safeguard by an 
inspector. These samples must be returned to origin or forwarded to a 
destination outside Hawaii or Puerto Rico in a time specified by an 
inspector and in packaging that will prevent the escape of any plant 
pests. If this action is not possible, the samples must be destroyed.
    (b) Cargo. Samples of unroasted coffee that are transiting Hawaii or 
Puerto Rico as cargo and that remain on the carrier may proceed to a 
destination outside Hawaii or Puerto Rico without action by an 
inspector. Samples may be transshipped in Puerto Rico or Hawaii only 
after an inspector determines that they are packaged to prevent the 
escape of any plant pests. Samples that are not packaged in this manner 
must be rewrapped or packaged in a manner prescribed by an inspector to 
prevent the escape of plant pests before the transshipment will be 
allowed.
    (c) Other mail, cargo, and baggage shipments of articles covered by

[[Page 403]]

Sec. 319.73-2 arriving in Puerto Rico or Hawaii may not be unloaded or 
transshipped in Puerto Rico or Hawaii and are subject to inspection and 
other applicable requirements of the Plant Safeguard Regulations (part 
352 of this chapter).


<R05>
Sec. 319.73-4  Costs.

    All costs of inspection, packing materials, handling, cleaning, 
safeguarding, treating, or other disposal of products or articles under 
this subpart will be borne by the owner, importer, or agent of the owner 
or importer, including a broker. The services of an inspector during 
regularly assigned hours of duty and at the usual places of duty will be 
furnished without cost to the importer.

<R05>
Sec. 319.74-1  Definitions.

    Administrator. The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service, United States Department of Agriculture, or any 
employee of the United States Department of Agriculture delegated to act 
in his or her stead.
    Cut flower. The highly perishable commodity known in the commercial 
flower-producing industry as a cut flower, which is the severed portion 
of a plant, including the inflorescence and any parts of the plant 
attached to it, in a fresh state. This definition does not include 
dried, bleached, dyed, or chemically treated decorative plant materials; 
filler or greenery, such as fern fronds and asparagus plumes, frequently 
packed with fresh cut flowers; or Christmas greenery, such as holly, 
mistletoe, and Christmas trees.
    Inspector. Any individual authorized by the Administrator to enforce 
this subpart.
    United States. All of the States, the District of Columbia, Guam, 
the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands of the 
United States, and all other territories or possessions of the United 
States.


<R05>
Sec. 319.74-2  Conditions governing the entry of cut flowers.

    (a) Inspection. All cut flowers imported into the United States must 
be made available to an inspector for examination at the port of first 
arrival and must remain at the port of first arrival until released, or 
authorized further movement, by an inspector.
    (b) Actions to prevent the introduction of plant pests; notice by an 
inspector. If an inspector orders any disinfection, cleaning, treatment, 
reexportation, or other action with regard to imported cut flowers that 
are found to be infested with injurious plant pests or infected with 
diseases, the inspector will provide an emergency action notification 
(PPQ Form 523) to the importer, owner, or agent or representative of the 
importer or owner of the cut flowers. The importer, owner, or agent or 
representative of the importer or owner must, within the time specified 
in the PPQ Form 523 and at his or her own expense, destroy the cut 
flowers, ship them to a point outside the United States, move them to an 
authorized site, and/or apply treatments, clean, or apply other 
safeguards to the cut flowers as prescribed by the inspector on the PPQ 
Form 523. Further, if the importer, owner, or agent or representative of 
the importer or owner fails to follow the conditions on PPQ Form 523 by 
the time specified on the form, APHIS will arrange for destruction of 
the cut flowers, and the importer, owner, or agent or representative of 
the importer or owner will be responsible for all costs incurred. Cut 
flowers that have been cleaned or treated must be made available for 
further inspection, cleaning, and treatment at the option of the 
inspector at any time and place indicated by the inspector before the 
requirements of this subpart will have been met. Neither the Department 
of Agriculture nor the inspector may be held responsible for any adverse 
effects of treatment on imported cut flowers.
    (c) Fumigation for agromyzids. (1) Cut flowers imported from any 
country or locality and found upon inspection to be infested with 
agromyzids (insects of the family Agromyzidae) must be fumigated at the 
time of importation with methyl bromide in accordance with

[[Page 404]]

paragraph (c)(2) of this section, with the following exceptions:
    (i) Fumigation will not be required for cut flowers imported from 
Canada (including Labrador and Newfoundland) or Mexico because of the 
finding of agromyzids.
    (ii) Fumigation will not be required for cut flowers of 
Chrysanthemum spp. imported from Colombia or the Dominican Republic 
because of the finding of agromyzids, when such agromyzids are 
identified by an inspector to be only agromyzids of the species 
Liriomyza trifolii (Burgess).
    (2) Fumigation schedules. Fumigation of cut flowers for agromyzids 
(insects of the family Agromyzidae) must consist of fumigation with 
methyl bromide at normal atmospheric pressure in a chamber or under a 
tarpaulin in accordance with one of the following schedules:

1\1/2\ lbs. per 1,000 cu. ft. for 2 hours at 80-90 [deg]F.
    (19 oz. concentration at first \1/2\ hour)
    (12 oz. concentration at 2 hours); or
2 lbs. per 1,000 cu. ft. for 2 hours at 70-79 [deg]F.
    (24 oz. concentration at first \1/2\ hour)
    (16 oz. concentration at 2 hours); or
2\1/2\ lbs. per 1,000 cu. ft. for 2 hours at 60-69 [deg]F.
    (30 oz. concentration at first \1/2\ hour)
    (20 oz. concentration at 2 hours); or
3 lbs. per 1,000 cu. ft. for 2 hours at 50-59 [deg]F.
    (36 oz. concentration at first \1/2\ hour)
    (24 oz. concentration at 2 hours); or
3\1/2\ lbs. per 1,000 cu. ft. for 2 hours at 40-49 [deg]F.
    (41 oz. concentration at first \1/2\ hour)
    (27 oz. concentration at 2 hours)

    Note: There is a possibility that some cut flowers could be damaged 
by such fumigation.

Ecuador, Iceland, Japan, Korea, Liechtenstein, Macedonia, Malaysia, 
Mexico, Moldova, Monaco, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Republic of South 
Africa, Russia, San Marino, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, 
Ukraine, Uruguay, Venezuela, Yugoslavia; the European Union (Austria, 
Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, 
France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, 
Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, 
Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom); and all countries, 
territories, and possessions of countries located in part or entirely 
between 90[deg] and 180[deg] East longitude.
    (3) Cut flowers of any species listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section may be imported into the United States from any region listed in 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section only under the following conditions:
    (i) The flowers must be grown in a production site that is 
registered with the national plant protection organization (NPPO) of the 
country in which the production site is located or with the NPPO's 
designee, and the NPPO or its designee must provide a list of registered 
sites to APHIS.
    (ii) Each shipment of cut flowers must be accompanied by a 
phytosanitary certificate or equivalent documentation, issued by the 
NPPO of the country of origin or its designee, that contains an 
additional declaration stating that the place of production as well as 
the consignment have been inspected and found free of Puccinia horiana.
    (iii) Box labels and other documents accompanying shipments of cut 
flowers must be marked with the identity of the registered production 
site.
    (iv) APHIS-authorized inspectors must also be allowed access to 
production sites and other areas necessary to monitor the chrysanthemum 
white rust-free status of the production sites.
    (4) Cut flowers not meeting these conditions will be refused entry 
into the United States. The detection of chrysanthemum white rust in a 
shipment of cut flowers from a registered production site upon arrival 
in the United States will result in the prohibition of imports 
originating from the production site until such time when APHIS and the 
NPPO of the exporting country, can agree that the eradication measures 
taken have been effective and that the pest risk within the production 
site has been eliminated.
    (e) Irradiation. Cut flowers and foliage that are required under 
this part to be treated or subjected to inspection to control one or 
more of the plant pests listed in Sec. 305.31(a) of this chapter may 
instead be treated with irradiation. Commodities treated with 
irradiation for plant pests listed in Sec. 305.31(a) must be irradiated 
at the doses listed in Sec. 305.31(a), and the irradiation treatment 
must be conducted in accordance with the other requirements of Sec. 
305.34 of this chapter. There is a possibility that some cut flowers 
could be damaged by such irradiation.
    (f) Refusal of entry. If an inspector finds that imported cut 
flowers are so infested with a plant pest or infected with disease that, 
in the judgment of the inspector, they cannot be cleaned or treated, or 
if they contain soil or other prohibited contaminants, the entire lot 
may be refused entry into the United States.

<R05>
Sec. 319.75  Restrictions on importation of restricted articles; disposal
of articles refused importation.

    (a) The Secretary has determined that in order to prevent the entry 
into the United States of khapra beetle (Trogoderma granarium Everts) it 
is necessary to restrict the importation of certain articles from 
foreign countries and localities. Accordingly, no person shall import 
any restricted article unless in conformity with all of the applicable 
restrictions in this subpart.
    (b) Any article refused importation for noncompliance with the 
requirements of this subpart shall be promptly removed from the United 
States or abandoned by the importer, and pending such action shall be 
subject to the immediate application of such safeguards against escape

Sec. 322.12  Risk assessment procedures for approving countries.

    (a) The national government of the region wishing to export must 
request that we perform a risk assessment for the importation into the 
United States of honeybees, honeybee germ plasm, or bees other than 
honeybees from that region.
    (b) When we receive a request, we will evaluate the science-based 
risks associated with such importation. Our risk assessment will be 
based on information provided by the exporting region, information from 
topical scientific literature, and, if applicable, information we gain 
from a site visit to the exporting region. The risk assessment will 
include:
    (1) Identification of all bee diseases, including fungi, bacteria, 
viruses, mycoplasmas, and protozoa, that occur in the exporting region 
but not in the United States or that are listed as significant for 
international trade by the Office International des Epizooties (OIE);
    (2) Identification of all bee parasites, including mites, that occur 
in the exporting region but not in the United States or that are listed 
as significant for international trade by the OIE;
    (3) Identification of all species and subspecies of honeybees that 
occur in the exporting region but not in the United States or that are 
listed as significant for international trade by the OIE, if applicable;
    (4) Identification of all pests of bee culture, such as the small 
hive beetle, that occur in the exporting region but not in the United 
States or that are listed as significant for international trade by the 
OIE;
    (5) Evaluation of the probability of establishment, including 
pathway, entry, colonization, and spread potentials, of any diseases, 
parasites, undesirable species or subspecies of honeybees, or pests 
identified in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1), (2), (3), or (4) of 
this section;
    (6) Evaluation of the potential consequences of establishment, 
including economic, environmental, and perceived social and political 
effects, of each disease, parasite, undesirable species or subspecies of 
honeybees, or pest

[[Page 420]]

identified in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1), (2), (3), or (4) of 
this section; and
    (7) Consideration of the effectiveness of the regulatory system of 
the exporting region to control bee diseases, parasites, undesirable 
species and subspecies of honeybees, and pests that occur there and to 
prevent occurrences of new bee diseases, parasites, undesirable species 
and subspecies of honeybees, and pests.
    (c) Based on the conclusions of the risk assessment, we will either:
    (1) Publish in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking 
to allow honeybees, honeybee germ plasm, or bees other than honeybees to 
be imported into the United States from that region; or
    (2) Deny the request in writing, stating the specific reasons for 
that action.
    (d) We will publish a notice of availability of all completed risk 
assessments for public comment.

<R05>
Sec. 322.15  APHIS review of permit applications; denial or cancellation
of permits.

    (a) Review of permit applications to import restricted organisms--
(1) Consultation. During our review of your permit application, we may 
consult with any Federal officials; appropriate officials of any State, 
Territory, or other jurisdiction in the United States in charge of 
research or regulatory programs relative to bees; and any other 
qualified governmental or private research laboratory, institution, or 
individual. We will conduct these consultations to gain information on 
the risks associated with the importation of the restricted organisms.
    (2) Review by destination State. We will transmit a copy of your 
permit application, along with our anticipated decision on the 
application, to the appropriate regulatory official in the destination 
State for review and recommendation. A State's response, which we will 
consider before taking final action on the permit application, may take 
one of the following forms:
    (i) The State recommends that we issue the permit;
    (ii) The State recommends that we issue the permit with specified 
additional conditions;
    (iii) The State recommends that we deny the permit application and 
provides scientific, risk-based reasons supporting that recommendation; 
or
    (iv) The State makes no recommendation, thereby concurring with our 
decision regarding the issuance of the permit. \4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ If a State regulatory official does not respond within 20 
business days, we will conclude that the State has chosen to make no 
recommendation regarding the issuance of the permit.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Results of review. After a complete review of your application, 
we will either:
    (1) Issue you a written permit with, if applicable, certain specific 
conditions listed for the importation of the restricted organisms you 
applied to import. You must initial each condition on the proposed 
permit and return the proposed permit conditions to the Permit Unit 
before we will issue you a signed valid permit; or

[[Page 422]]

    (2) Notify you that your application has been denied and provide 
reasons for the denial.
    (c) Denial of permit applications. APHIS will deny an application 
for a permit to import a restricted organism regulated under this 
subpart when, in its opinion, such movement would involve a danger of 
dissemination of an exotic bee disease or parasite, or an undesirable 
species or subspecies of honeybee. Danger of such dissemination may be 
deemed to exist when:
    (1) Existing safeguards against dissemination are inadequate and no 
adequate safeguards can be arranged; or
    (2) The potential for disseminating an exotic bee disease or 
parasite, or an undesirable species or subspecies of honeybee, with the 
restricted organism outweighs the probable benefits that could be 
derived from the proposed movement and use of the restricted organism; 
or
    (3) When you, as a previous permittee, failed to maintain the 
safeguards or otherwise observe the conditions prescribed in a previous 
permit and have failed to demonstrate your ability or intent to observe 
them in the future; or
    (4) The proposed movement of the restricted organism is adverse to 
the conduct of an eradication, suppression, control, or regulatory 
program of APHIS.
    (d) Cancellation of permits. (1) APHIS may cancel any outstanding 
permit whenever:
    (i) We receive information subsequent to the issuance of the permit 
of circumstances that would constitute cause for the denial of an 
application for permit under paragraph (c) of this section; or
    (ii) You, as the permittee, fail to maintain the safeguards or 
otherwise observe the conditions specified in the permit or in any 
applicable regulations.
    (2) Upon cancellation of a permit, you must either:
    (i) Surrender all restricted organisms to an APHIS inspector; or
    (ii) Destroy all restricted organisms under the supervision of an 
APHIS inspector.
    (e) Appealing the denial of permit applications or cancellation of 
permits. If your permit application has been denied or your permit has 
been canceled, APHIS will promptly inform you, in writing, of the 
reasons for the denial or cancellation. You may appeal the decision by 
writing to the Administrator and providing all of the facts and reasons 
upon which you are relying to show that your permit application was 
wrongfully denied or your permit was wrongfully canceled. The 
Administrator will grant or deny the appeal as promptly as circumstances 
allow and will state, in writing, the reasons for the decision. If there 
is a conflict as to any material fact, you may request a hearing to 
resolve the conflict. Rules of practice concerning the hearing will be 
adopted by the Administrator.

Sec. 322.16  Packaging of shipments.

    (a) Restricted organisms must be packed in a container or 
combination of containers that will prevent the escape of the organisms 
and the leakage of any contained materials. The container must be 
sufficiently strong to prevent it from rupturing or breaking during 
shipment.
    (b) The outer container must be clearly marked with the contents of 
the shipment, i.e., either ``Live Bees,'' ``Bee Germ Plasm,'' or ``Live 
Bee Brood,'' and the name of the region of origin.
    (c) Only approved packing materials may be used in a shipment of 
restricted organisms.
    (1) The following materials are approved as packing materials: 
Absorbent cotton or processed cotton padding free of cottonseed; cages 
made of processed wood; cellulose materials; excelsior; felt; ground 
peat (peat moss); paper or paper products; phenolic resin foam; sawdust; 
sponge rubber; thread waste, twine, or cord; and vermiculite.
    (2) Other materials, such as host material for the organism, soil, 
or other types of packing material, may be included in a container only 
if identified in the permit application and approved by APHIS on the 
permit.

[[Page 423]]


<R05>
Sec. 322.17  Mailed packages.

    (a) If you import a restricted organism through the mail or through 
commercial express delivery, you must attach a special mailing label 
(APHIS Form 599), which APHIS will provide with your permit, to the 
package or container. The mailing label indicates that APHIS has 
authorized the shipment.
    (b) You must address the package containing the restricted organism 
to the containment facility or apiary identified on the permit (post 
office boxes are not allowed).
    (c) If the restricted organism arrives in the mail without the 
mailing label described in paragraph (a) of this section or addressed to 
a containment facility or apiary other than the one listed on the 
permit, an inspector will refuse to allow the organism to enter the 
United States.


<R05>
Sec. 322.18  Restricted organisms in a commercial vehicle arriving
at a land border port in the United States.

    (a) If you import a restricted organism through a land border port 
in the United States by commercial vehicle (i.e., automobile or truck), 
then the person carrying the restricted organism must present the permit 
required by Sec. 322.14 and an invoice or packing slip accurately 
indicating the complete contents of the shipment to the inspector at the 
land border port.
    (b) The restricted organisms must be surrendered at the port of 
entry and can continue on to the destination identified on the permit 
only by a bonded carrier (commercial express delivery).
    (c) If you fail to present a copy of the permit and an invoice or 
packing list accurately indicating the complete contents of the shipment 
at the port of entry, an inspector will refuse the organism's entry to 
the United States or confiscate and destroy the refused material.

Sec. 322.19  Inspection; refusal of entry.

    (a) APHIS may inspect any restricted organism at the time of 
importation to determine if the organism meets all of the requirements 
of this part.
    (b) If, upon inspection, any shipment fails to meet the requirements 
of the regulations, that shipment will be refused entry into the United 
States. In accordance with Sec. 322.2(c), the inspector will offer the 
shipper the opportunity to immediately export any refused shipments. If 
the shipper declines to immediately export the shipment, we will destroy 
the shipment at his or her expense.


<R05>
Sec. 322.20  Ports of entry.

    A restricted organism may be imported only at a port of entry 
staffed by an APHIS inspector. \5\ After a restricted organism has been 
cleared for importation at the port of entry, the organism can only be 
transported by a bonded commercial carrier immediately and directly from 
the port of entry to the containment facility or apiary identified on 
the permit. You may open the package containing the restricted organism 
only within the containment facility or apiary identified on the permit.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Inspection of premises. Prior to issuing a permit to import 
restricted organisms, we will inspect the apiary

[[Page 424]]

or containment facility where you intend to contain the restricted 
organisms. In order to approve the apiary or containment facility, an 
inspector must determine that adequate safeguards are in place to 
prevent the release of diseases or parasites of bees, or of undesirable 
species or strains of honeybees. We will use the following criteria to 
determine whether adequate safeguards are in place:
    (1) Enclosed containment facilities. (i) Will the facility's 
entryways, windows, and other structures, including water, air, and 
waste handling systems, contain the restricted organisms, parasites and 
pathogens, and prevent the entry of other organisms and unauthorized 
visitors?
    (ii) Does the facility have operational and procedural safeguards in 
place to prevent the escape of the restricted organisms, parasites, and 
pathogens, and to prevent the entry of other organisms and unauthorized 
visitors?
    (iii) Does the facility have a means of inactivating or sterilizing 
restricted organisms and any breeding materials, pathogens, parasites, 
containers, or other material?
    (2) Containment apiaries. (i) Is the apiary located in an area 
devoid of indigenous bees and sufficiently isolated to prevent contact 
between indigenous bees and imported restricted organisms? Is the area 
extending from the apiary to the nearest indigenous bees constantly 
unsuitable for foraging individuals of the imported restricted 
organisms?
    (ii) Does the apiary have sufficient physical barriers to prevent 
the entry of unauthorized visitors?
    (iii) Does the apiary have operational and procedural safeguards in 
place to prevent the escape of the restricted organisms, parasites, and 
pathogens, and to prevent the entry of other organisms and unauthorized 
visitors?
    (iv) Does the apiary have a means of inactivating or sterilizing 
restricted organisms, and any hives, wax, pathogens, parasites, 
containers, or other materials?
    (3) Containment apiaries for honeybees resulting from germ plasm 
imported from nonapproved regions.
    (i) Does the apiary have sufficient physical barriers to prevent the 
entry of unauthorized visitors?
    (ii) Are there sufficient physical barriers (e.g., excluders) in 
hives in the apiary to prevent the escape of all adult queen and drone 
honeybees resulting from the germ plasm?
    (iii) Does the apiary have operational and procedural safeguards in 
place to prevent the escape of all queen and drone honeybees resulting 
from the germ plasm?
    (iv) Does the apiary have a means of destroying colonies of 
honeybees with undesirable characteristics that may result from imported 
germ plasm?
    (c) Holding in containment. (1) If we issue a permit for importing 
restricted organisms into an approved containment facility or apiary, 
you may not remove or release the restricted organisms, or the progeny 
or germ plasm resulting from the restricted organisms, from the apiary 
or facility without our prior approval.
    (2) You must allow us to inspect the apiary or facility and all 
documents associated with the importation or holding of restricted 
organisms at any time to determine whether safeguards are being 
maintained to prevent the release of the restricted organisms, their 
progeny and germ plasm, parasites, and pathogens.
    (3) You must inform us immediately, but no later than 24 hours after 
detection, if restricted organisms escape from the facility
    (d) Release from containment apiary or facility. (1) After rearing 
the restricted organisms in an approved containment facility or apiary 
through at least 4 months of active reproduction with no evidence of 
nonindigenous parasites or pathogens or of undesirable characteristics, 
you may submit a request to us for the release of the bees. The request 
must include:
    (i) Inspection protocols;
    (ii) Inspection frequencies;
    (iii) Names and titles of inspectors;
    (iv) Complete information, including laboratory reports, on 
detection of diseases and parasites in the population;
    (v) Complete notes and observations on behavior, such as 
aggressiveness and swarming; and

[[Page 425]]

    (vi) Any other information or data relating to bee diseases, 
parasites, or adverse species or subspecies.
    (2) Mail your request for release to the Permit Unit, PPQ, APHIS, 
4700 River Road Unit 133, Riverdale, MD 20737-1236, or fax to (301) 734-
8700.
    (3) When we receive a complete request for release from containment, 
we will evaluate the request and determine whether the bees may be 
released. Our evaluation may include an environmental assessment or 
environmental impact statement prepared in accordance with the National 
Environmental Policy Act. We may conduct an additional inspection of the 
bees during our evaluation of the request. You will receive a written 
statement as soon as circumstances allow that approves or denies your 
request for release of the bees.

<R05>
Sec. 330.101  Policy.

    The purpose of the regulations in this part is to prevent the 
dissemination of plant pests into the United States, or interstate, by 
regulating the movement of plant pests into or through the United 
States, or interstate, and the movement of means of conveyance, earth, 
stone and quarry products, garbage, and certain other products and 
articles into or through the United States, or from any Territory or 
possession into or through any other Territory or possession or the 
continental United States. The Deputy Administrator shall employ 
procedures to carry out this purpose which will impose a minimum of 
impediment to foreign commerce and travel whenever practicable, 
consistent with proper precaution against plant pest dissemination. The 
same policy is to be applied

[[Page 430]]

in the case of interstate commerce and travel.


<R05>
Sec. 330.102  Basis for certain regulations.

Sec. 330.105  Inspection.

    (a) Inspection of foreign arrivals. In order to prevent the 
dissemination into the United States of plant pests and for the purpose 
of carrying out the regulations in this part, all plant pests; means of 
conveyance and their stores; baggage; mail; plants; plant products; 
soil; stone and quarry products under Sec. 330.300; garbage; and any 
other product or article of any character whatsoever which an inspector 
considers may be infested or infected by or contain a plant pest, 
arriving in the United States from any place outside thereof for entry 
into or movement through the United States shall be subject to 
inspection by an inspector at the port of first arrival, except that 
mail will be handled in accordance with the joint customs and postal 
regulations for inspecting and handling mail. No such plant pests; means 
of conveyance or their stores; baggage; mail; plants; plant products; 
soil; stone or quarry products under Sec. 330.300; garbage; or other 
products or articles which an inspector notifies the Customs authorities 
should be held for inspection shall be released by Customs officers for 
entry or onward movement until released by an inspector. The release of 
all means of conveyance, products and articles regulated under parts 
319, 321, and 352 of this chapter shall be in accordance with the 
requirements of those parts and the applicable provisions in this part. 
Whenever it shall be deemed safe to modify the requirements of this 
section by exempting any class of means of conveyance, products or 
articles from the requirement that they be held for inspection and 
release of the inspector, the exemptions shall be specified in 
administrative instructions. Inspectors shall make local arrangements, 
in accordance with policies of the Plant Protection and Quarantine 
Programs, with the Collector of Customs for the release by Customs 
officers on behalf of the inspector of any class of means of conveyance, 
their stores, baggage, mail, or other products or articles when such 
arrangements do not increase unduly the danger of plant pest 
dissemination and will facilitate clearance of means of conveyance, 
baggage, mail, or other products or articles.
    (b) Inspection of domestic movements. For the purpose of preventing 
the interstate movement of plant pests, provisions requiring inspection 
of means of conveyance and products or articles moving interstate may be

[[Page 431]]

issued as regulations in association with quarantines in part 301 or 
part 318 of this chapter or in this part.

    Note: Notices appearing at 24 FR 4650, June 9, 1959, 24 FR 5363, 
July 2, 1959, 24 FR 6889, August 26, 1959, and 24 FR 7519, September 18, 
1959, provide in part as follows: That means of conveyance subject to 
such inspection and release requirements and arriving at any port of 
entry outside the regularly assigned hours of duty of the Federal plant 
quarantine inspector, will be held for such inspection and release, 
until the regularly assigned hours of duty. However, notice is also 
hereby given that pursuant to the provisions of the Act of August 28, 
1950 (7 U.S.C. 2260) such inspection service outside of the regularly 
assigned hours of duty may be made available to any interested person, 
upon a reimbursable basis and in accordance with applicable regulations, 
upon request to the Plant Quarantine Inspector in Charge at such port.
    Information concerning regularly assigned hours of duty for Federal 
plant quarantine inspectors at each port where such inspection is 
available may be obtained locally by application to the Plant Quarantine 
Inspector in Charge at such port.

<R05>
Sec. 330.106  Emergency measures.

    (a) Procedures to prevent pest dissemination. Whenever inspection of 
any means of conveyance, stores, baggage, mail, plants, plant products, 
earth, stone and quarry products, garbage, or other products or articles 
of any character whatsoever, arriving in the United States from a place 
outside thereof, or moving interstate, discloses a plant pest, or 
provides a reason to believe such a pest is present (other than one 
moving under permit in accordance with any conditions in the permit and 
the provisions in this part) which is new to, or not theretofore known 
to be widely prevalent or distributed within and throughout the United 
States, the inspector shall employ procedures necessary to prevent the 
dissemination of the plant pest. Such procedures shall also be employed 
with respect to means of conveyance or products or articles of any 
character whatsoever which have moved into the United States or 
interstate and which the inspector has reason to believe were infested 
or infected by or contained any such plant pest at the time of such 
movement. The inspector may follow administrative instructions 
containing procedures prescribed for certain situations, or he may 
follow a procedure selected by him from administratively approved 
methods known to be effective. The procedure may involve seizure, 
quarantine, treatment, application of other remedial measures, 
exportation, return to shipping point of origin, destruction, or other 
disposal, but no means of conveyance, product, article, or plant pest 
owned by any person shall be destroyed, exported, or returned to 
shipping point of origin or ordered to be so handled, unless there is, 
in the opinion of the inspector, no less drastic action adequate to 
prevent the dissemination of the plant pest. In forming such an opinion 
that no less drastic action is adequate, the inspector shall be guided 
by applicable specific and general instructions received from officers 
of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs. In taking action with 
respect to any means of conveyance, product, article, plant pest, the 
inspector shall take cognizance of applicable requirements of the 
customs and postal laws and regulations.
    (b) Orders for remedial measures. The inspector may order the owner 
of any means of conveyance, product, article, or plant pest, subject to 
disposal under paragraph (a) of this section, to treat, apply other 
remedial measures, destroy, or make other disposal thereof without cost 
to the Federal Government and in a manner specified in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Failure to apply remedial measures. If the measures required by 
the inspector are not applied promptly by the owner within the time 
limits specified by the inspector, the inspector shall apply measures 
necessary to prevent the dissemination of the plant pests.
    (d) Khapra beetle infestations of means of conveyance, or cargo or 
stores thereof; other infestations. As a means of preventing the 
dissemination into the United States, or interstate, of the khapra 
beetle (Trogoderma granarium Everts), the following procedures will be 
applicable when that insect is found, or there is reason to believe it 
is present, in a means of conveyance within paragraph (a) of this 
section, or

[[Page 432]]

in any cargo or stores in such a means of conveyance, or in any cargo or 
stores unloaded or landed, or being unloaded or landed, in the United 
States therefrom. These procedures will also apply with respect to other 
plant pests when the inspector finds they are necessary and sufficient 
to prevent the spread of such pests.
    (1) Infestation in storerooms and similar compartments of means of 
conveyance (except aircraft). (i) When infestation is found only in 
stores or storerooms, galleys, pantries, or similar noncargo 
compartments of a means of conveyance, except aircraft, the inspector 
shall prescribe and supervise the application of such remedial measures 
as, in his opinion, will be effective under conditions that will not 
spread the infestation to other parts of the means of conveyance, or to 
adjacent piers or other installations. If, in the opinion of the 
inspector, fumigation is the only available safeguard to eliminate the 
infestation, he shall order the owner to arrange for immediate 
fumigation of the infested stores and portions of the means of 
conveyance.
    (ii) If the means of conveyance is to leave the territorial limits 
of the United States directly for a port in another country within 24 
hours of such order, the inspector may suspend compliance with the 
fumigation requirement pending departure from the United States. Pending 
fumigation or departure, the inspector may seal the openings of infested 
compartments, packages, or articles, if in his opinion the action is 
necessary to prevent plant pest dissemination while the means of 
conveyance remains in the teritorial limits of the United States, as 
authorized in Sec. 330.110. The inspector may extend the 24-hour period 
to 48 hours, if, in his judgment, such extension is warranted by plans 
of the owner to remove the means of conveyance from the territorial 
limits of the United States within the extended period, the inability of 
the contractor to begin fumigation within the 24-hour period, or other 
reason deemed valid by the inspector. Further extension shall be given 
only under authority of the Deputy Administrator. Pending compliance 
with the requirement of fumigation, or the departure from the 
territorial limits of the United States directly for a port in another 
country, no stores, laundry, furnishings or equipment, or other articles 
or products whether in cargo or stores, shall be unloaded from the means 
of conveyance except as authorized by the inspector and under conditions 
prescribed by him. The owner of an infested means of conveyance under 
notice for fumigation which leaves the territorial limits of the United 
States without fumigation should arrange for the eradication of the 
infestation before returning to the same or another port in the United 
States. Upon return to a port in the United States and unless the 
infestation has been eliminated to the satisfaction of the inspector, 
the means of conveyance shall be subject to fumigation immediately upon 
arrival in the United States. Unloading or landing of any product or 
article shall not be permitted pending compliance with the fumigation 
requirement, except as authorized by the inspector and under conditions 
prescribed by him.
    (iii) If the means of conveyance is to remain at the port where the 
infestation was found or is to be moved to another port in the United 
States, the inspector shall prescribe and supervise the application of 
the remedial measures at the port where the infestation is found, as 
provided in this paragraph, or he may authorize the means of conveyance 
to be moved to another port for fumigation or the application of other 
remedial measures under safeguards prescribed by him.
    (iv) In all instances where the inspector prescribed procedures 
concerned with the application of remedial measures which involve (a) 
withholding permission to discharge articles or products; (b) permission 
to discharge after such permission has been withheld; (c) discontinuance 
of discharging; or (d) resumption of discharging after it has been 
discontinued, the appropriate Customs officer shall be immediately 
notified in writing. The inspector shall also inform the Customs 
officers at the port where the infestation is found and at such other 
ports as may be necessary of the requirement for fumigation and/or 
permission to move coastwise to another U.S. port for fumigation or 
other remedial measures.

[[Page 433]]

    (2) Infestation in cargo compartments of means of conveyance (except 
aircraft). When infestation is found in cargo compartments or in cargo 
of a means of conveyance, except aircraft, the inspector shall prescribe 
and supervise the application of such remedial measures as, in his 
opinion are necessary, with respect to the cargo and the portions of the 
means of conveyance which contain or contained or were contaminated by 
the infested cargo. If in the opinion of the inspector fumigation is the 
only available safeguard to eliminate the infestation, he shall order 
the owner to arrange for immediate fumigation of the infested portions 
of such means of conveyance and cargo. However, if such cargo 
compartments cannot be fumigated without fumigating the entire means of 
conveyance, the inspector may order the entire means of conveyance and 
cargo to be fumigated. The inspector shall notify the owner of the means 
of conveyance of such requirement and the owner shall arrange for 
immediate fumigation. Discharge of cargo shall be discontinued unless 
the inspector allows it to continue under safeguards to be prescribed by 
him. The provisions applicable to stores and storerooms in paragraph 
(d)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section shall apply to cargo and cargo 
areas of such means of conveyance. Customs officers shall be informed as 
required in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.
    (3) Infestation in an aircraft. If infestation is found in an 
aircraft, the inspector may apply seals as provided in Sec. 330.110, 
and he may require such temporary safeguards as he deems necessary, 
including the discontinuance of further unloading or landing of any 
products or articles except as authorized by him. Upon finding such 
infestation in an aircraft the inspector shall promptly notify the Plant 
Protection and Quarantine Programs of all circumstances and the 
temporary safeguards employed, and the Plant Protection and Quarantine 
Programs will specify the measures for eliminating the infestation which 
will not be deleterious to the aircraft or its operating components. Any 
insecticidal application required shall be approved by the Deputy 
Administrator for use in aircraft. If the aircraft is to depart from the 
territorial limits of the United States within 24 hours after the 
infestation is found, the inspector shall permit such departure in lieu 
of the application of other measures and shall prior to departure break 
any seals that would prevent access to the aircraft or safe operation 
thereof. Other seals shall remain intact at time of departure and shall 
be broken by the aircraft commander or a crew member upon his order only 
after the aircraft is beyond the territorial limits of the United 
States. Extension of the 24-hour period shall be given only under 
authority of the Deputy Administrator. The owner of the aircraft under 
notice of khapra beetle infestation which leaves the territorial limits 
of the United States before the infestation has been eradicated should 
arrange for eradication before returning the aircraft to the United 
States. Upon return to the United States, if the infestation is not 
eliminated to the satisfaction of the inspector, the aircraft shall be 
subject to the same disinfestation requirements and other safeguards 
immediately upon arrival in the United States. Customs officers shall be 
notified as required in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.
    (4) Precautions. The owner of a means of conveyance required to be 
fumigated pursuant to this section shall arrange with a competent 
operator to apply the fumigant under the supervision of the inspector. 
The owner shall understand that if certain fumigants are used they may 
result in residues in or on foodstuffs which may render them unsafe for 
use as food items. He is hereby warned against such use unless as 
ascertains that the fumigated foodstuffs are fit for human consumption. 
It should also be understood by the owner that emergency measures 
prescribed by the inspector to safeguard against dissemination of 
infestation may have adverse effects on certain products and articles, 
and that the acceptance of fumigation as a requirement is an alternative 
to the immediate removal of the infested means of conveyance and any 
products and articles thereon, from the territorial limits of the United 
States. Products or articles in a means of conveyance, or compartments 
thereof, which may be exposed to methyl bromide or other remedial 
measures and

[[Page 434]]

may be adversely affected thereby, may be removed from the means of 
conveyance or compartments thereof prior to the application of the 
remedial measures if in the opinion of the inspector this can be done 
without danger of plant pest dissemination and under conditions 
authorized by him, for additional inspection and/or application of 
effective remedial measures.

[56 FR 14844, Apr. 12, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 330.108  Authority to issue administrative instructions.

    The Deputy Administrator is authorized to issue the administrative 
instructions for which provision is made in the regulations in this 
part, for the purpose of preventing dissemination of plant pests into 
the United States or interstate. In addition, whenever the Deputy 
Administrator shall find that existing conditions as to pest risk 
involved in the movement of plant pests, means of conveyance, or other 
products or articles to which the regulations in this part apply, make 
it safe to modify by making less stringent the restrictions contained in 
any of such regulations, he shall publish such findings in 
administrative instructions, specifying the manner in which the 
regulations shall be made less stringent whereupon such modification 
shall become effective.


<R05>
Sec. 330.109  Caution.

    In applying treatments or taking other measures prescribed in 
administrative instructions or by the inspector, it should be understood 
that inexactness or carelessness may result in injury or damage.


<R05>
Sec. 330.110  Seals.

    (a) Use authorized; form. Whenever, in the opinion of the inspector, 
it is necessary, as a safeguard in order to prevent the dissemination of 
plant pests into the United States, or interstate, seals may be applied 
to openings, packages, or articles requiring the security provided by 
such seals. The words ``openings, packages, or articles'' shall include 
any form of container, shelf, bin, compartment, or other opening, 
package, or article which the inspector may have occasion to seal in 
lieu of more drastic action or otherwise, as a safeguard against plant 
pest dissemination. The seals may be automatic metal seals or labels or 
tags and will be provided by the Plant Protection and Quarantine 
Programs. When they consist of a label or tag, they will be printed in 
black ink on yellow paper and read substantially as follows: ``Warning! 
The opening, package, or article to which this seal is affixed is sealed 
under authority of law. This seal is not to be broken while within the 
territorial limits of the United States except by, or under instructions 
of, an inspector.''
    (b) Breaking of seals. Seals may be broken: (1) By an inspector; (2) 
by a Customs officer for Customs purposes, in which case the opening, 
package, or article will be resealed with Customs seals; (3) by the 
owner or his agent when the means of conveyance, product, or article has 
left the territorial limits of the United States; (4) by any person 
authorized by the inspector or the Deputy Administrator under conditions 
specified by the inspector or Deputy Administrator. No person shall 
break seals applied under authority of this section except as provided 
in this paragraph. The movement into or through the United States, or 
interstate, of any means of conveyance or product or article on which a 
seal, applied under this paragraph, has been broken in violation of this 
paragraph is

[[Page 435]]

hereby prohibited, except as authorized by an inspector.
    (c) Notice of sealing. When an inspector seals any opening, product 
or article, he shall explain the purpose of such action to the owner or 
his representative and shall present him with a written notice of the 
conditions under which the seal may be broken, if requested to do so.

Sec. 330.111  Advance notification of arrival of aircraft and watercraft.

    The owner, operator, or other representative of any aircraft or 
watercraft entering the United States from a foreign country, or 
arriving in the continental United States from Hawaii or any territory 
or possession of the United States, shall provide every Plant Protection 
and Quarantine office (PPQ office) serving a port of arrival on the 
itinerary of the craft while in the United States with advance 
notification of intent to arrive at that port. This advance notification 
of arrival shall:
    (a) Reach the appropriate PPQ office not less than 12 hours before 
the craft's estimated time of arrival at the port;
    (b) Be communicated by radio, wire, telephone, or any other means; 
and
    (c) Include the following information:
    (1) The name or other identifying feature of the individual craft;
    (2) The date and estimated time of arrival at the port;
    (3) The location of arrival, providing the most site-specific data 
available, such as the dock, pier, wharf, berth, mole, anchorage, gate, 
or facility, and;
    (4) The names of all foreign and non-Continental U.S. ports where 
any cargo, crew, or passenger destined for the continental United States 
has boarded the craft since its most recent arrival at a port in the 
United States.
    (d) If the craft's estimated time of arrival changes by more than 
one hour, the PPQ office that serves the port of arrival must be 
notified and provided with updated information immediately.
    (e) If the craft's site of arrival changes after a PPQ office has 
received advance notification of arrival, both that PPQ office and the 
newly affected PPQ office shall be notified of this change immediately. 
This applies, too, to site-specific changes involving watercraft.
    (f) If the craft's point of arrival is an anchorage, the PPQ office 
shall be notified, as soon as possible after the craft's arrival at the 
anchorage, of the specific site, such as berth, mole, pier, to which the 
craft will be moving, as well as of its estimated time of arrival at 
that site.
    (g) Aircraft and watercraft meeting any of the following conditions 
are exempt from the provisions in this section, and need not provide 
advance notification of arrival:
    (1) The craft is not regularly used to carry passengers or cargo for 
a fee;
    (2) The aircraft is making a flight scheduled in the Official 
Airline Guide, North American Edition, or the Official Airline Guide, 
Worldwide Edition, unless the scheduled time of arrival changes by more 
than one hour or the plane is diverted to another landing port;
    (3) An inspector has precleared the aircraft in Hawaii, a territory 
or possession of the United States, or a foreign port, having determined 
that the aircraft contained only articles that are not prohibited or 
restricted importation into the United States under the provisions of 7

    (4) Personnel of the United States armed forces, including the U.S. 
Coast Guard, in Hawaii, a territory or possession of the United States, 
or a foreign port, have precleared an aircraft, having determined that 
the aircraft contained only articles that are not prohibited or 
restricted importation into the United States under the provisions of 7 
CFR chapter III and 9 CFR chapter I.
    (5) The owner, operator, or other representative of the aircraft or 
watercraft not leaving the United States has been informed in writing by 
a PPQ inspector that notification of intended arrival is not required at 
subsequent ports in the United States.

                     Subpart_Movement of Plant Pests


<R05>
Sec. 330.200  Movement of plant pests regulated; permits required.

    No person shall knowingly move any plant pest into or through the 
United States from any place outside thereof, or interstate, or 
knowingly accept delivery of any plant pest so moving unless such 
movement is authorized under permit under this part and is made in 
accordance with the conditions therein and the provisions in this part. 
The movement of snails and slugs, as well as other plant pests, is 
governed by such provisions. Biological specimens of plant pests, in 
preservative or dried, may be imported without further restriction under 
this part, but subject to inspection on arrival in the United States to 
confirm the nature of the material and freedom from risk of plant pest 
dissemination.


<R05>
Sec. 330.201  Applications for permits to move plant pests.

    (a) Into or through the United States from any place outside 
thereof. Only persons resident in the United States may apply for 
permits to move plant pests into the United States from any place 
outside thereof. Persons resident in the United States proposing such 
movement into the United States, or any person proposing movement 
through the United States, of any plant pests shall first make 
application for permits authorizing such movement by submitting to the 
Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs the form provided therefor by 
the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs, or by submitting in the 
form of a letter or other written communication the following 
information insofar as is known to the applicant, for each kind of pest 
for which a permit is requested: (1) Scientific name of the pest, (2) 
stage, (3) quantity, (4) origin, (5) destination, (6) whether the pest 
is established in the State, Territory or other jurisdiction of 
destination in the United States, (7) method of shipment, (8) proposed 
port of first arrival in the United States, (9) approximate date of 
arrival, (10) number of parcels expected to be moved, (11) intended use, 
(12) measures to be employed to prevent danger of plant pest 
dissemination, and (13) method of final disposition. In addition, if 
host materials must necessarily accompany the plant pests, the 
application shall show the name of the host materials and the reasons it 
is necessary for them to accompany the plant pests. Applications for 
permits to move plant pests through the United States should state the 
name of the port of export instead of the information required by 
paragraph (a)(6) of this section. Any applicant for a permit to move 
plant pests into or through the United States from any place outside 
thereof will facilitate the consideration of his application by 
furnishing any additional information known to him concerning the 
economic importance of the pests and the justification for the movement.
    (b) Interstate (including interstate for export). Persons proposing 
to move plant pests interstate shall first make application for permits 
authorizing such movement by submitting to the Plant Protection and 
Quarantine Programs the form provided therefor by the Plant Protection 
and Quarantine Programs or by submitting the required information in the 
form of a letter or other written communication showing all pertinent 
information specified in paragraph (a) of this section and also the 
approximate date of the movement, except that persons desiring to move 
plant pests interstate to a port in the United States for export to a 
place outside of the United States \1\ shall use the form provided 
therefor by the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs or submit to 
the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs in the form of a letter or 
other written communication the following information for each kind of 
pest: Scientific name of the pest, stage, quantity, origin, destination, 
method of shipment, proposed port of export from the

[[Page 437]]

United States, approximate date of the movement, number of parcels to be 
moved, proposed use, and measures to be employed to prevent danger of 
plant pest dissemination during the interstate movement. However, in 
case it is proposed to move interstate, within or from an area 
quarantined under Sec. Sec. 301.38, 301.45, 301.48, 301.52, 301.63, 
301.64, 301.72, 301.76, 301.77, 301.78, 301.79, 301.80, or 301.81 of 
this chapter any plant pest covered by said section, the application 
should be made to the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs of the 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the Department. In any 
case the applicant for a permit will facilitate the consideration of his 
application by furnishing any additional information known to him 
concerning the economic importance of the pests and the justification 
for the movement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Persons contemplating the shipment of plant pests to places 
outside the United States should make prior arrangements directly, or 
through the recipient, with the country of destination for the receipt 
of the plant pests into the country of destination. Many countries have 
laws governing the movement of plant pests into those countries, and 
therefore it is advisable to make advance arrangements for attaching 
permits, etc., as may be required by the countries of destination.

<R05>
Sec. 330.202  Consideration of applications for permits to move plant pests.

    The Deputy Administrator, upon the receipt of an application, made 
in accordance with Sec. 330.201 (a) or (b), for a permit for movement 
of a plant pest into or through the United States from any place outside 
thereof, or interstate, shall consider the application on its merits.
    (a) Consultation. He may consult with any Federal officials, the 
appropriate officials of any State, Territory, or other jurisdiction in 
the United States in charge of research or regulatory programs relative 
to plant pests, and any other qualified governmental or private research 
laboratory, institution, or individual, for views on the danger of plant 
pest dissemination into the United States, or interstate, in connection 
with the movement proposed.
    (b) Inspection of premises. The Deputy Administrator may inspect the 
site where plant pests are proposed to be handled in connection with or 
after their movement under permit to determine whether existing or 
proposed facilities will be adequate to prevent plant pest dissemination 
in case a permit is issued, provided that the person in possession 
thereof is the applicant or such inspection is otherwise authorized.

<R05>
Sec. 330.203  Action on applications for permits to move plant pests;
form of and conditions in permits.

    The Deputy Administrator, having considered an application for 
permit to move a plant pest, shall approve or deny the application in 
accordance with Sec. 330.204. If the application is denied, the 
applicant shall be furnished the reasons therefor. If the application is 
approved, the Deputy Administrator shall issue the permit including any 
conditions which, in the opinion of the Deputy Administrator, are 
necessary to prevent dissemination of plant pests into the United States 
or interstate. Such conditions may include requirements for inspection 
of the premises where the plant pests are to be handled, after their 
movement under the permits, to determine whether the facilities thereat 
are adequate to prevent plant pest dissemination and the conditions of 
the permit are otherwise being observed. Permits authorizing movement of 
plant pests through the United States will include shipping instructions 
as to routing, labelling, and similar requirements as conditions of the 
permits. Any applicable conditions prescribed in administrative 
instructions may be incorporated in a written permit by citation, but 
shall be applicable whether or not so cited. The Deputy Administrator 
may, prior to the issuance of the permit, require the applicant to agree 
in writing to the conditions under which the plant pests will be 
safeguarded. The permits may be issued in a prescribed form or in letter 
form, or a combination thereof. A permit without conditions may be 
issued orally.


<R05>
Sec. 330.204  Denial or cancellation of permits; reconsiderations.

    (a) The Deputy Administrator will deny an application for a permit 
to move a plant pest when, in his opinion, such movement would involve a 
danger

[[Page 438]]

of dissemination of the pest. Danger of plant pest dissemination may be 
deemed to exist when:
    (1) No acceptable safeguards adequate to prevent plant pest 
dissemination can be arranged;
    (2) The destructive potential of the plant pest to plants, and parts 
and products thereof, should it escape despite proposed safeguards, 
outweighs the probable benefits to be derived from the proposed movement 
and use of the pest;
    (3) The applicant, as a previous permittee, failed to maintain the 
safeguards or otherwise observe the conditions prescribed in a previous 
permit and failed to demonstrate his ability or intent to observe them 
in the future;
    (4) The movement is adverse to the conduct of an eradication, 
suppression, control, or regulatory program of the Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service; or
    (5) The movement is objected to in writing by an appropriate 
official of a State, Territory or possession, or the District of 
Columbia on the ground it will involve a danger of dissemination of the 
plant pest into the State, Territory or possession, or District.
    (b) The Deputy Administrator may cancel any outstanding permit 
whenever:
    (1) Information is received subsequent to the issuance of the permit 
of circumstances that constitute cause for the denial of an application 
for permit under paragraph (a) of this section; or
    (2) The permittee has not maintained the safeguards or otherwise 
observed the conditions specified in the permit or in any applicable 
regulations or administrative instructions.
    (c) Any person denied a permit, or whose permit has been canceled, 
may request the Deputy Administrator in person or in writing for a 
reconsideration, and may submit any additional information he may have 
to support the original application.


<R05>
Sec. 330.205  Disposal of plant pests when permits are canceled.

    When an outstanding permit for the movement of a plant pest is 
canceled by the Deputy Administrator and not reinstated under Sec. 
330.204(c), the further movement of the plant pest covered thereby into 
or through the United States, or interstate, is prohibited by the Plant 
Protection Act unless authorized in another permit. The permittee should 
arrange for disposal of the plant pest involved in a manner satisfactory 
to the Deputy Administrator to prevent plant pest dissemination. The 
Deputy Administrator may, whenever he deems it necessary as an emergency 
measure in order to prevent the dissemination of any plant pest new to 
or not theretofore known to be widely prevalent or distributed within 
and throughout the United States, seize, quarantine, treat, apply other 
remedial measures to, destroy, or otherwise dispose of, in such manner 
as he deems appropriate, any plant pest which is moving without 
compliance with any conditions in the permit or the provisions of this 
part or after the permit has been canceled.

Sec. 330.206  Permits for plant pest movement associated with 
National Defense projects.

    The Deputy Administrator will facilitate research associated with 
National Defense projects through issuance of permits for movement of 
plant pests for such research, upon receiving assurance satisfactory to 
him that adequate safeguards will surround utilization of the plant 
pests to prevent their dissemination.


<R05>
Sec. 330.207  Permits for movement of organisms issued by other agencies.

    Inspectors shall recognize permits for the movement of organisms 
issued under other acts by other Federal agencies. When such organisms 
are also plant pests, any further conditions of movement to carry out 
the purposes of the Plant Protection Act which have been prescribed in 
administrative instructions, or in correspondence concerning a single 
shipment, shall be complied with but no additional permit will be 
required under this part.

Sec. 330.208  Courtesy permits.

    The Deputy Administrator may issue permits for the movement into or 
through the United States, or interstate, or organisms which are not 
subject to regulation under the Plant Protection Actor any other act, as 
a courtesy to facilitate movement when the movement might otherwise be 
impeded because of the similarity of the organisms with others regulated 
under the Plant Protection Act. He may likewise issue such permits on 
behalf of any agency requesting such action as a courtesy to facilitate 
movement for organisms not subject to regulation under the Plant 
Protection Act but subject to regulation under some other act.

Sec. 330.209  Permits for means of conveyance.

    No permit shall be required for movement into or through the United 
States from any place outside thereof, or interstate, of a means of 
conveyance unless the primary purpose of such movement of the means of 
conveyance is to move plant pests.


<R05>
Sec. 330.210  Packing materials and containers for plant pest movement;
host materials.

    Plant pests moved into or through the United States, or interstate, 
must be free of soil, except when the Deputy Administrator approves in 
the permit the movement of soil with the plant pest. Subject to this 
exception, only approved packing materials are to be employed in the 
shipment of plant pests. Approved packing materials for the movement of 
plant pests under this part will be prescribed in administrative 
instructions or approved in specific cases by the Deputy Administrator. 
Such actions will be coordinated with and may supplement any 
requirements of the Post Office Department governing packing and 
packaging of any materials for movements covered by the postal laws and 
regulations. All containers shall be stoutly constructed so as to 
prevent breakage in transit and danger of plant pest dissemination and 
shall be labeled in accordance with Sec. 330.211. The Deputy 
Administrator may allow the movement of host materials with plant pests 
under permits when they must necessarily accompany the pests, although 
such movement is otherwise barred under the Plant Protection Act.

    (10) Thread waste; twine; or cord.
    (11) Vermiculite.
    (b) Advance approval for the use of any other packing material for 
any specific movement should be obtained from the Deputy Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 330.211  Labeling of plant pests for movement under permits.

    (a) Interstate movement. For interstate movements of plant pests a 
label shall be attached to each parcel containing the pests as evidence 
that the movement of the plant pests is authorized. Such label shall 
also disclose the contents of the parcel.
    (b) Movement into or through the United States from places outside 
thereof by mail or cargo. (1) When a permit authorizing the movement of 
plant pests into the United States from any place outside thereof is 
issued to an applicant under this part, it will be accompanied by 
distinctive labels, with instructions for their use by the foreign 
shipper. Such labels will be issued in quantity sufficient to permit 
attaching one to each parcel to be moved. The labels will direct the 
parcels to specified inspection stations of the Plant Protection and 
Quarantine Programs, or other designated points, for clearance. The 
stations will be notified by the

[[Page 440]]

Deputy Administrator in advance of the expected arrival of the plant 
pests. Plant pests so moved by mail may be refused entry unless the 
containers thereof bear such labels. Cargo shipments of plant pests so 
moved may be refused entry unless they bear such labels or are otherwise 
plainly marked to identify the contents.
    (2) Any labelling requirements with respect to the movement of plant 
pests through the United States will be included in shipping 
instructions issued as conditions of the permits.
    (c) Misuse of labels. No labels unused in accordance with the terms 
of the permit may be used for the movement of any other plant pest. The 
Plant Protection Act provides for a penalty \2\ for the misuse of such 
labels. Any unauthorized movement of plant pests under a label will be 
refused by the inspector, and the plant pests may be destroyed or 
otherwise dealt with as set forth in Sec. 330.106 if deemed necessary 
as an emergency measure.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Section 424 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7734) provides 
that persons who violate this act, or who forge, counterfeit or--without 
authority from the Secretary--use, alter, deface, or destroy any 
certificate, permit or other document may, after notice and opportunity 
for a hearing, be assessed a civil penalty that does not exceed the 
greater of: (a) $50,000 for individuals, except that the civil penalty 
may not exceed $1,000 in the case of an initial violation by an 
individual moving regulated articles not for monetary gain; $250,000 for 
any other person or legal entity, such as partnerships, corporations, 
associations, or joint ventures; and $500,000 for all violations 
adjudicated in a single proceeding; or (b) twice the gross pecuniary 
gain derived from or loss caused by any violation, forgery, 
counterfeiting, unauthorized use, defacing, or destruction of a 
certificate, permit, or other document provided for by this act. Section 
424 of the Plant Protection Act also provides penalties for criminal 
violations, under which knowing violators of the act may be found guilty 
of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, fined in accordance with title 18

Sec. 330.212  Movement of plant pests by baggage.

    Persons proposing to move plant pests into or through the United 
States from any place outside thereof, or from any Territory or 
possession into or through any other Territory or possession, or the 
Continental United States, by baggage, shall show the permit authorizing 
the movement to the inspector upon arrival at the port where the baggage 
is inspected. The conditions specified for the movement must be 
observed. The inspector will insure that the movement is handled in 
accordance with the terms of the permit. If it is necessary to move the 
plant pest to another place for clearance, the owner will be responsible 
for all costs incidental to such forwarding. Pending forwarding, the 
inspector will specify and supervise the application of safeguards 
against danger of plant pest dissemination and may retain custody of the 
pests until forwarded.

Sec. 330.300  Soil from foreign countries or Territories or possessions. \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The movement of soil from Puerto Rico into or through any other 
State, Territory, or District of the United States is also subject to 
the provisions of the imported fire ant quarantine and regulations 
contained in 7 CFR 301.81 et seq.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No soil shall be moved into or through the United States from any 
place outside thereof or from any Territory or possession into or 
through any other Territory or possession or the Continental United 
States, whether the soil is moved as such or incidentally adhering to 
means of conveyance or other articles, except as authorized in Sec. 
318.60 or Sec. 319.69 of this chapter, or this subpart.
    (a) Permits authorized. The Deputy Administrator may issue permits 
under this section for movements of soil not governed by Sec. 318.60 or 
Sec. 319.69 of this chapter, for research, analytical, religious, 
ceremonial, patriotic, or similar purposes, or such other purposes as he 
shall deem consistent with the objectives of this part, specifying in 
the permit or in the related correspondence,

[[Page 441]]

the safeguards, including methods of treatment, or other conditions 
which he deems necessary for the purpose of preventing the dissemination 
of plant pests into the United States or interstate. Whenever it is 
possible to formulate a general rule specifying such conditions, it 
shall be promulgated in administrative instructions and the applicable 
provisions thereof may be incorporated into a permit by citation, but 
shall be applicable whether or not so cited.
    (b) Application for permits. Only persons resident in the United 
States may apply for permits under this section to move soil into the 
United States from any place outside thereof, or from any territory or 
possession into or through any other Territory or possession or the 
Continental United States. Persons resident in the United States 
contemplating such movements, or any persons contemplating movement 
through the United States, of soil under this section shall first make 
application for permits authorizing such movement by submitting to the 
Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs the form provided therefor by 
the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs or by submitting, in the 
form of a letter or other written communication, the following 
information: Origin of the shipment, destination, quantity, method of 
shipment, proposed port of first arrival in the United States, port of 
export (if applicable), approximate date of arrival in the United 
States, intended use, measures to be employed to prevent danger of plant 
pest dissemination, method of final disposition, and the number of 
parcels expected to be moved. In acting upon the application for permits 
for such movement of soil, the Deputy Administrator will follow the 
procedures outlined in Sec. 330.202 for the consideration of 
applications for permits to move plant pests insofar as they are 
applicable.
    (c) Issuance of permits; conditions of permits. Upon the approval of 
an application for a permit authorizing the movement of soil under this 
section, the permit will be issued. The permit may contain any 
conditions which are necessary, in the opinion of the Deputy 
Administrator, to prevent dissemination of plant pests into the United 
States or interstate, including conditions with respect to routing, 
packing, and labeling of the soil. The Deputy Administrator may require 
the applicant to agree in writing to such conditions prior to the 
issuance of the permit. The importer will receive, as a part of the 
permit, information on the manner in which the importation is to be 
made. A permit without conditions may be issued orally.
    (d) Containers; labels. All containers for soil moved under this 
section shall be stoutly constructed so as to prevent breakage in 
transit and danger of plant pest dissemination and shall be 
appropriately labeled as to contents. If the soil is moved by mail, 
special mailing labels will be issued to the importer, with instructions 
for their use, which he is to send to the foreign shipper. The quantity 
of mailing labels issued will be sufficient for the foreign shipper to 
attach one to each parcel moved by mail. Such mailing labels will 
indicate to the postal and the plant quarantine officials that the 
movement is authorized under the conditions specified in this permit. 
Importations arriving by mail without labels will be subject to refusal 
of entry into the United States, or interstate movement, by the 
inspector unless treated, at the expense of the owner, in a manner to 
remove danger of plant pest dissemination. The Deputy Administrator may 
issue mailing labels for movement into or through the United States from 
any place outside thereof, or from any Territory or possession into or 
through any other Territory or possession of the continental United 
States, of earth other than soil when the movement might otherwise be 
impeded because of the similarity to soil subject to this section.

Sec. 330.401  Garbage generated onboard a conveyance.

    (a) Applicability. This section applies to garbage generated onboard 
any means of conveyance during international or interstate movements as 
provided in this section and includes food scraps, table refuse, galley 
refuse, food wrappers or packaging materials, and other waste material 
from stores, food preparation areas, passengers' or crews' quarters, 
dining rooms, or any other areas on the means of conveyance. This 
section also applies to meals and other food that were available for 
consumption by passengers and crew on an aircraft but were not consumed.
    (1) Not all garbage generated onboard a means of conveyance is 
regulated for the purposes of this section. Garbage regulated for the 
purposes of this section is defined as ``regulated garbage'' in 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (2) Garbage that is commingled with regulated garbage is also 
regulated garbage.
    (b) Garbage regulated because of movements outside the United States 
or Canada. For purposes of this section, garbage on or removed from a 
means of conveyance is regulated garbage, if, when the garbage is on or 
removed from the means of conveyance, the means of conveyance has been 
in any port outside the United States and Canada within the previous 2-
year period. There are, however, two exceptions to this provision. These 
exceptions are as follows:
    (1) Exception 1: Aircraft. Garbage on or removed from an aircraft is 
exempt from requirements under paragraph (d) of this section if the 
following conditions are met when the garbage is on or removed from the 
aircraft:
    (i) The aircraft had previously been cleared of all garbage and of 
all meats and meat products, whatever the country of origin, except 
meats that are shelf-stable; all fresh and condensed milk and cream from 
countries designated in 9 CFR 94.1 as those in which foot-and-mouth 
disease exists; all fresh fruits and vegetables; and all eggs; and the 
items previously cleared from the aircraft as prescribed by this 
paragraph have been disposed of according to the procedures for 
disposing of regulated garbage, as specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and 
(d)(3) of this section.
    (ii) After the garbage and stores referred to in paragraph (b)(1)(i) 
of this section were removed, the aircraft has not been in a non-
Canadian foreign port.
    (2) Exception 2: Other conveyances. Garbage on or removed in the 
United States from a means of conveyance other than an aircraft is 
exempt from requirements under paragraph (d) of this section if the 
following conditions are met when the garbage is on or removed from the 
means of conveyance:
    (i) The means of conveyance is accompanied by a certificate from an 
inspector stating the following:
    (A) That the means of conveyance had previously been cleared of all 
garbage and of all meats and meat products, whatever the country of

disease exists; all fresh fruits and vegetables; and all eggs; and the 
items previously cleared from the means of conveyance as prescribed by 
this paragraph have been disposed of according to the procedures for 
disposing of regulated garbage, as specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and 
(d)(3) of this section.
    (B) That the means of conveyance had then been cleaned and 
disinfected in the presence of the inspector; and
    (ii) Since being cleaned and disinfected, the means of conveyance 
has not been in a non-Canadian foreign port.
    (c) Garbage regulated because of certain movements to or from 
Hawaii, territories, or possessions. For purposes of this section, 
garbage on or removed from a means of conveyance is regulated garbage, 
if at the time the garbage is on or removed from the means of 
conveyance, the means of conveyance has moved during the previous 1-year 
period, either directly or indirectly, to the continental United States 
from any territory or possession or from Hawaii, to any territory or 
possession from any other territory or possession or from Hawaii, or to 
Hawaii from any territory or possession. There are, however, two 
exceptions to this provision. These exceptions are as follows:
    (1) Exception 1: Aircraft. Garbage on or removed from an aircraft is 
exempt from requirements under paragraph (d) of this section if the 
following two conditions are met when the garbage is on or removed from 
the aircraft:
    (i) The aircraft had been previously cleared of all garbage and all 
fresh fruits and vegetables, and the items previously cleared from the 
aircraft as prescribed by this paragraph have been disposed of according 
to the procedures for disposing of regulated garbage, as specified in 
paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section.
    (ii) After the garbage and stores referred to in paragraph (c)(1)(i) 
of this section were removed, the aircraft has not moved to the 
continental United States from any territory or possession or from 
Hawaii; to any territory or possession from any other territory or 
possession or from Hawaii; or to Hawaii from any territory or 
possession.
    (2) Exception 2: Other conveyances. Garbage on or removed from a 
means of conveyance other than an aircraft is exempt from requirements 
under paragraph (d) of this section if the following two conditions are 
met when the garbage is on or removed from the means of conveyance:
    (i) The means of conveyance is accompanied by a certificate from an 
inspector stating that the means of conveyance had been cleared of all 
garbage and all fresh fruits and vegetables; and the items previously 
cleared from the means of conveyance as prescribed by this paragraph 
have been disposed of according to the procedures for disposing of 
regulated garbage, as specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this 
section.
    (ii) After being cleared of the garbage and stores referred to in 
paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the means of conveyance has not 
moved to the continental United States from any territory or possession 
or from Hawaii; to any territory or possession from any other territory 
or possession or from Hawaii; or to Hawaii from any territory or 
possession.
    (d) Restrictions on regulated garbage. (1) Regulated garbage may not 
be disposed of, placed on, or removed from a means of conveyance except 
in accordance with this section.
    (2) Regulated garbage is subject to general surveillance for 
compliance with this section by inspectors and to disposal measures 
authorized by the Plant Protection Act and the Animal Health Protection 
Act to prevent the introduction and dissemination of pests and diseases 
of plants and livestock.
    (3) All regulated garbage must be contained in tight, covered, leak-
proof receptacles during storage on board a means of conveyance while in 
the territorial waters, or while otherwise within the territory of the 
United States. All such receptacles shall be contained inside the guard 
rail if on a watercraft. Such regulated garbage shall not be unloaded 
from such means of conveyance in the United States unless such regulated 
garbage is removed in tight, covered, leak-proof receptacles under

[[Page 445]]

the direction of an inspector to an approved facility for incineration, 
sterilization, or grinding into an approved sewage system, under direct 
supervision by such an inspector, or such regulated garbage is removed 
for other handling in such manner and under such supervision as may, 
upon request in specific cases, be approved by the Administrator as 
adequate to prevent the introduction and dissemination of plant pests 
and animal diseases and sufficient to ensure compliance with applicable 
laws for environmental protection. Provided that, a cruise ship may 
dispose of regulated garbage in landfills at Alaskan ports only, if and 
only if the cruise ship does not have prohibited or restricted meat or 
animal products on board at the time it enters Alaskan waters for the 
cruise season, and only if the cruise ship, except for incidental travel 
through international waters necessary to navigate safely between ports, 
remains in Canadian and U.S. waters off the west coast of North America, 
and calls only at continental U.S. and Canadian ports during the entire 
cruise season.
    (i) Application for approval of a facility or sewage system may be 
made in writing by the authorized representative of any carrier or by 
the official having jurisdiction over the port or place of arrival of 
the means of conveyance to the Administrator, Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 
20250. The application must be endorsed by the operator of the facility 
or sewage system.
    (ii) Approval will be granted if the Administrator determines that 
the requirements set forth in this section are met. Approval may be 
denied or withdrawn at any time, if the Administrator determines that 
such requirements are not met, after notice of the proposed denial or 
withdrawal of the approval and the reasons therefor, and an opportunity 
to demonstrate or achieve compliance with such requirements, has been 
afforded to the operator of the facility or sewage system and to the 
applicant for approval. However, approval may also be withdrawn without 
such prior procedure in any case in which the public health, interest, 
or safety requires immediate action, and in such case, the operator of 
the facility or sewage system and the applicant for approval shall 
promptly thereafter be given notice of the withdrawal and the reasons 
therefor and an opportunity to show cause why the approval should be 
reinstated.
    (e) The Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs and Veterinary 
Services, Animal, and Plant Health Inspection Service, will cooperate 
with other Federal, State, and local agencies responsible for enforcing 
other statutes and regulations governing disposal of the regulated 
garbage to the end that such disposal shall be adequate to prevent the 
dissemination of plant pests and livestock or poultry diseases and 
comply with applicable laws for environmental protection. The 
inspectors, in maintaining surveillance over regulated garbage movements 
and disposal, shall coordinate their activities with the activities of 
representatives of the Environmental Protection Agency and other 
Federal, State, and local agencies also having jurisdiction over such 
regulated garbage


<R05>
Sec. 330.402  Garbage generated in Hawaii.

    (a) Applicability. This section applies to garbage generated in 
households, commercial establishments, institutions, and businesses 
prior to interstate movement from Hawaii, and includes used paper, 
discarded cans and bottles, and food scraps. Such garbage includes, and 
is commonly known as, municipal solid waste.
    (1) Industrial process wastes, mining wastes, sewage sludge, 
incinerator ash, or other wastes from Hawaii that the Administrator 
determines do not pose risks of introducing animal or plant pests or 
diseases into the continental United States are not regulated under this 
section.
    (2) The interstate movement from Hawaii to the continental United 
States of agricultural wastes and yard waste (other than incidental 
amounts (less than 3 percent) that may be present in municipal solid 
waste despite reasonable efforts to maintain source separation) is 
prohibited.
    (3) Garbage generated onboard any means of conveyance during 
interstate

[[Page 446]]

movement from Hawaii is regulated under Sec. 330.401.
    (b) Restrictions on interstate movement of garbage. The interstate 
movement of garbage generated in Hawaii to the continental United States 
is regulated as provided in this section.
    (1) The garbage must be processed, packaged, safeguarded, and 
disposed of using a methodology that the Administrator has determined is 
adequate to prevent the introduction or dissemination of plant pests 
into noninfested areas of the United States.
    (2) The garbage must be moved under a compliance agreement in 
accordance with Sec. 330.403. APHIS will only enter into a compliance 
agreement when the Administrator is satisfied that the Agency has first 
satisfied all its obligations under the National Environmental Policy 
Act and all applicable Federal and State statutes to fully assess the 
impacts associated with the movement of garbage under the compliance 
agreement.
    (3) All such garbage moved interstate from Hawaii to any of the 
continental United States must be moved in compliance with all 
applicable laws for environmental protection.


<R05>
Sec. 330.403  Compliance agreement and cancellation.

    (a) Any person engaged in the business of handling or disposing of 
garbage in accordance with this subpart must first enter into a 
compliance agreement with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 
(APHIS). Compliance agreement forms (PPQ Form 519) are available without 
charge from local USDA/APHIS/Plant Protection and Quarantine offices, 
which are listed in telephone directories.
    (b) A person who enters into a compliance agreement, and employees 
or agents of that person, must comply with the following conditions and 
any supplemental conditions which are listed in the compliance 
agreement, as deemed by the Administrator to be necessary to prevent the 
dissemination into or within the United States of plant pests and 
livestock or poultry diseases:
    (1) Comply with all applicable provisions of this subpart;
    (2) Allow inspectors access to all records maintained by the person 
regarding handling or disposal of garbage, and to all areas where 
handling or disposal of garbage occurs;
    (3)(i) If the garbage is regulated under Sec. 330.401, remove 
garbage from a means of conveyance only in tight, covered, leak-proof 
receptacles;
    (ii) If the garbage is regulated under Sec. 330.402, transport 
garbage interstate in packaging approved by the Administrator;
    (4) Move the garbage only to a facility approved by the 
Administrator; and
    (5) At the approved facility, dispose of the garbage in a manner 
approved by the Administrator and described in the compliance agreement.
    (c) Approval for a compliance agreement may be denied at any time if 
the Administrator determines that the applicant has not met or is unable 
to meet the requirements set forth in this subpart. Prior to denying any 
application for a compliance agreement, APHIS will provide notice to the 
applicant thereof, and will provide the applicant with an opportunity to 
demonstrate or achieve compliance with requirements.
    (d) Any compliance agreement may be canceled, either orally or in 
writing, by an inspector whenever the inspector finds that the person 
who has entered into the compliance agreement has failed to comply with 
this subpart. If the cancellation is oral, the cancellation and the 
reasons for the cancellation will be confirmed in writing as promptly as 
circumstances allow. Any person whose compliance agreement has been 
canceled may appeal the decision, in writing, within 10 days after 
receiving written notification of the cancellation. The appeal must 
state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show 
that the compliance agreement was wrongfully canceled. As promptly as 
circumstances allow, the Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in 
writing, stating the reasons for the decision. A hearing will be held to 
resolve any conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice 
concerning a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator. This 
administrative remedy must be exhausted before a

[[Page 447]]

person can file suit in court challenging the cancellation of a 
compliance agreement.
    (e) Where a compliance agreement is denied or canceled, the person 
who entered into or applied for the compliance agreement may be 
prohibited, at the discretion of the Administrator, from handling or 
disposing of regulated garbage.

agent or toxin may only be transferred to an individual or entity 
registered to possess, use, or transfer that agent or toxin. A select 
agent or toxin may only be transferred under the conditions of this 
section and must be authorized by APHIS or CDC prior to the transfer. 
\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ The requirements of this section do not apply to transfers 
within a registered entity (i.e., the sender and the recipient are 
covered by the same certificate of registration).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) In addition to any permit required under part 330 of this 
chapter, a transfer may be authorized if:
    (1) The sender:
    (i) Has at the time of transfer a certificate of registration that 
covers the particular select agent or toxin to be transferred and meets 
all the requirements of this part;

<R05>
Sec. 340.0  Restrictions on the introduction of regulated articles.

    (a) No person shall introduce any regulated article unless the 
Administrator is:
    (1) Notified of the introduction in accordance with Sec. 340.3, or 
such introduction is authorized by permit in accordance with Sec. 
340.4, or such introduction is conditionally exempt from permit 
requirements under Sec. 340.2(b); and
    (2) Such introduction is in conformity with all other applicable 
restrictions in this part. \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Part 340 regulates, among other things, the introduction of 
organisms and products altered or produced through genetic engineering 
that are plant pests or are believed to be plant pests. The introduction 
into the United States of such articles also may be subject to other 
regulations promulgated under the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7701-
7772) and found in 7 CFR parts 319, 330, and 360. For example, under 
regulations promulgated in ``Subpart-Nursery Stock, Plants, Roots, 
Bulbs, Seeds, and Other Plant Products'' (7 CFR 319.37-3), a permit is 
required for the importation of certain classes of nursery stock whether 
such stock is genetically engineered or not. Accordingly, individuals 
should refer to those regulations before importing any nursery stock.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Any regulated article introduced not in compliance with the 
requirements of this part shall be subject to the immediate application 
of such remedial measures or safeguards as an inspector determines 
necessary to prevent the introduction of such plant pests. \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ An inspector may hold, seize, quarantine, treat, apply other 
remedial measures to, destroy, or otherwise dispose of plants, plant 
pests, or other articles in accordance with sections 411, 412, 421, and 
434 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7711, 7712, 7731, and 7754).

<R05>
Sec. 340.2  Groups of organisms which are or contain plant pests and exemptions.

    (a) Groups of organisms which are or contain plant pests. The 
organisms that are or contain plant pests are included in the taxa or 
group of organisms contained in the following list. Within any taxonomic 
series included on the list, the lowest unit of classification actually 
listed is the taxon or group which may contain organisms which are 
regulated. Organisms belonging to all lower taxa contained within the 
group listed are included as organisms that may be or may contain plant 
pests, and are regulated if they meet the definition of plant pest in 
Sec. 340.1 \4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Any organism belonging to any taxa contained within any listed 
genera or taxa is only considered to be a plant pest if the organism 
``can directly or indirectly injure, or cause disease, or damage in any 
plants or parts thereof, or any processed, manufactured, or other 
products of plants.'' Thus a particular unlisted species within a listed 
genus would be deemed a plant pest for purposes of Sec. 340.2, if the 
scientific literature refers to the organism as a cause of direct or 
indirect injury, disease, or damage to any plants, plant parts or 
products of plants. (If there is any question concerning the plant pest 
status of an organism belonging to any listed genera or taxa, the person 
proposing to introduce the organism in question should consult with 
APHIS to determine if the organism is subject to regulation.)

    Note: Any genetically engineered organism composed of DNA or RNA 
sequences, organelles, plasmids, parts, copies, and/or analogs, of or 
from any of the groups of organisms listed below shall be deemed a 
regulated article if it also meets the definition of plant pest in Sec. 
340.1.

Sec. 340.3  Notification for the introduction of certain regulated articles. \5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ APHIS may issue guidelines regarding scientific procedures, 
practices, or protocols which it has found acceptable in making various 
determinations under the regulations. A person may follow an APHIS 
guideline or follow different procedures, practices, or protocols. When 
different procedures, practices, or protocols are followed, a person 
may, but is not required to, discuss the matter in advance with APHIS to 
help ensure that the procedures, practices, or protocols to be followed 
will be acceptable to APHIS.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (a) General. Certain regulated articles may be introduced without a 
permit, provided that the introduction is in compliance with the 
requirements of this section. Any other introduction of regulated 
articles require a permit under Sec. 340.4, with the exception of 
introductions that are conditionally exempt from permit requirements 
under Sec. 340.2(b) of this part.
    (b) Regulated articles eligible for introduction under the 
notification procedure. Regulated articles which meet all of the 
following six requirements and the performance standards set forth in 
paragraph (c) of this section are eligible for introduction under the 
notification procedure.
    (1) The regulated article is any plant species that is not listed as 
a noxious weed in regulations at 7 CFR part 360 under the Plant 
Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7712), and, when being considered for release 
into the environment, the regulated article is not considered by the 
Administrator to be a weed in the area of release into the environment.
    (2) The introduced genetic material is ``stably integrated'' in the 
plant genome, as defined in Sec. 340.1.
    (3) The function of the introduced genetic material is known and its 
expression in the regulated article does not result in plant disease.
    (4) The introduced genetic material does not:
    (i) Cause the production of an infectious entity, or
    (ii) Encode substances that are known or likely to be toxic to 
nontarget organisms known or likely to feed or live on the plant 
species, or
    (iii) Encode products intended for pharmaceutical or industrial use.
    (5) To ensure that the introduced genetic sequences do not pose a 
significant risk of the creation of any new plant virus, plant virus-
derived sequences must be:
    (i) Noncoding regulatory sequences of known function, or
    (ii) Sense or antisense genetic constructs derived from viral genes 
from plant viruses that are prevalent and endemic in the area where the 
introduction will occur and that infect plants of the same host species, 
and that do not encode a functional noncapsid gene product responsible 
for cell-to-cell movement of the virus.
    (6) The plant has not been modified to contain the following genetic 
material from animal or human pathogens:
    (i) Any nucleic acid sequence derived from an animal or human virus, 
or
    (ii) Coding sequences whose products are known or likely causal 
agents of disease in animals or humans.
    (c) Performance standards for introductions under the notification 
procedure. The following performance standards must be met for any 
introductions under the notification procedure.
    (1) If the plants or plant materials are shipped, they must be 
shipped in such a way that the viable plant material is unlikely to be 
disseminated while in transit and must be maintained at the destination 
facility in such a way that there is no release into the environment.
    (2) When the introduction is an environmental release, the regulated 
article must be planted in such a way that they are not inadvertently 
mixed with non-regulated plant materials of any species which are not 
part of the environmental release.
    (3) The plants and plant parts must be maintained in such a way that 
the identity of all material is known while it is in use, and the plant 
parts must be contained or devitalized when no longer in use.
    (4) There must be no viable vector agent associated with the 
regulated article.
    (5) The field trial must be conducted such that:
    (i) The regulated article will not persist in the environment, and
    (ii) No offspring can be produced that could persist in the 
environment.

[[Page 465]]

    (6) Upon termination of the field test:
    (i) No viable material shall remain which is likely to volunteer in 
subsequent seasons, or
    (ii) Volunteers shall be managed to prevent persistence in the 
environment.
    (d) Procedural requirements for notifying APHIS. The following 
procedures shall be followed for any introductions under the 
notification procedure:
    (1) Notification should be directed to the Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Biotechnology and 
Scientific Services, Biotechnology Permits, 4700 River Road, Unit 147, 
Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1237.
    (2) The notification shall include the following:
    (i) Name, title, address, telephone number, and signature of the 
responsible person;
    (ii) Information necessary to identify the regulated article(s), 
including:
    (A) The scientific, common, or trade names, and phenotype of 
regulated article,
    (B) The designations for the genetic loci, the encoded proteins or 
functions, and donor organisms for all genes from which introduced 
genetic material was derived, and
    (C) The method by which the recipient was transformed;
    (iii) The names and locations of the origination and destination 
facilities for movement or the field site location for the environmental 
release; and the size of the introduction,
    (iv) The date and, in the case of environmental release, the 
expected duration of the introduction (release); and
    (v) A statement that certifies that introduction of the regulated 
article will be in accordance with the provisions of this section.
    (3) Notification must be submitted to APHIS:
    (i) At least 10 days prior to the day of introduction, if the 
introduction is interstate movement.
    (ii) At least 30 days prior to the day of introduction, if the 
introduction is an importation.
    (iii) At least 30 days prior to the day of introduction, if the 
introduction is an environmental release.
    (4) Field test reports must be submitted to APHIS within 6 months 
after termination of the field test. Field test reports shall include 
the APHIS reference number, methods of observation, resulting data, and 
analysis regarding all deleterious effects on plants, nontarget 
organisms, or the environment.
    (5) The Administrator, shall be notified of any unusual occurrence 
within the time periods and in the manner specified in Sec. 
340.4(f)(10).
    (6) Access shall be allowed for APHIS and State regulatory officials 
to inspect facilities and/or the field test site and any records 
necessary to evaluate compliance with the provisions of paragraphs (b) 
and (c) of this section.
    (e) Administrative action in response to notification. (1) APHIS 
will provide copies of all notifications to appropriate State regulatory 
official(s) for review within 5 business days of receipt. Comments to 
APHIS from appropriate State regulatory officials in response to 
notifications for interstate movement of regulated articles will not be 
required by APHIS prior to acknowledgment, although States may provide 
their reviews to APHIS at their discretion.
    (2) The Administrator, will provide acknowledgement within 10 days 
of receipt that the interstate movement is appropriate under 
notification.
    (3) The Administrator, will provide acknowledgement within 30 days 
of receipt that the importation is appropriate under notification.
    (4) APHIS will provide acknowledgment within 30 days of receipt that 
the environmental release is appropriate under notification. Such 
acknowledgment will apply to field testing for 1 year from the date of 
introduction, and may be renewed annually by submission of an additional 
notification to APHIS.
    (5) A person denied permission for introduction of a regulated 
article under notification may apply for a permit for introduction of 
that regulated article without prejudice.

    (1) Limited permit for interstate movement. The responsible person 
may apply for a single limited permit for the interstate movement of 
multiple regulated articles in lieu of submitting an application for 
each individual interstate movement. Each limited permit issued shall be 
numbered and shall be valid for one year from the date of issuance. If a 
permit is sought for multiple interstate movements between contained 
facilities the responsible individual shall specify in the permit 
application all the regulated articles to be moved interstate; the 
origins and destinations of all proposed shipments; a detailed 
description of all the contained facilities where regulated articles 
will be utilized at destination; and a description of the containers 
that will be used to transport the regulated articles. A limited permit 
for interstate movement of a regulated article shall only be valid for 
the movement of those regulated articles moving between those locations 
specified in the application. If a person seeks to move regulated 
articles other than those specified in the application, or to a location 
other than those listed in the application, a supplemental application 
shall be submitted to APHIS. No person shall move a regulated article 
interstate unless the number of the limited permit appears on the 
outside of the shipping container. The responsible person shipping a 
regulated article interstate shall keep records for one year 
demonstrating that the regulated article arrived at its intended 
destination. The responsible person seeking a limited permit for 
interstate movement shall submit on an application form obtained from 
APHIS, the

regulated articles. The responsible person importing a regulated article 
shall keep records for one year demonstrating that the regulated article 
arrived at its intended destination. The responsible person seeking a 
limited permit for importation shall submit on an application form 
obtained from APHIS data required by paragraphs (b) (1), (2), (4), (6), 
(7), (9), and (11) through (14) of this section. \9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ Renewals may receive shorter review. In the case of a renewal 
for a limited permit for importation that has been issued less than one 
year earlier, APHIS will notify the responsible person within 15 days 
that either: (1) The renewal permit is approved or (2) that a 60 day 
review period is necessary because the conditions of the original permit 
have changed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) Premises inspection. An inspector may inspect the site or 
facility where regulated articles are proposed, pursuant to a permit, to 
be released into the environment or contained after their interstate 
movement or importation. Failure to allow the inspection of a premises 
prior to the issuance of a permit or limited permit shall be grounds for 
the denial of the permit.
    (e) Administrative action on applications. After receipt and review 
by APHIS of the application and the data submitted pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section, including any additional information requested by 
APHIS, a permit shall be granted or denied. If a permit is denied, the 
applicant shall be promptly informed of the reasons why the permit was 
denied and given the opportunity to appeal the denial in accordance with 
the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section. If a permit is granted, 
the permit will specify the applicable conditions for introduction of 
the regulated article under this part.
    (f) Permit conditions. A person who is issued a permit and his/her 
employees or agents shall comply with the following conditions, and any 
supplemental conditions which shall be listed on the permit, as deemed 
by the Administrator to be necessary to prevent the dissemination and 
establishment of plant pests:
    (1) The regulated article shall be maintained and disposed of (when 
necessary) in a manner so as to prevent the dissemination and 
establishment of plant pests.
    (2) All packing material, shipping containers, and any other 
material accompanying the regulated article shall be treated or disposed 
of in such a manner so as to prevent the dissemination and establishment 
of plant pests.

hours, to the place where the regulated article is located and to any 
records relating to the introduction of a regulated article;
    (6) The regulated article shall, when possible, be kept identified 
with a label showing the name of the regulated article, and the date of 
importation;
    (7) The regulated article shall be subject to the application of 
measures determined by the Administrator to be necessary to prevent the 
accidental or unauthorized release of the regulated article;
    (8) The regulated article shall be subject to the application of 
remedial measures (including disposal) determined by the Administrator 
to be necessary to prevent the spread of plant pests;
    (9) A person who has been issued a permit shall submit to APHIS a 
field test report within 6 months after the termination of the field 
test. A field test report shall include the APHIS reference number, 
methods of observation, resulting data, and analysis regarding all 
deleterious effects on plants, nontarget organisms, or the environment.
    (10) APHIS shall be notified within the time periods and manner 
specified below, in the event of the following occurrences:
    (i) Orally notified immediately upon discovery and notify in writing 
within 24 hours in the event of any accidental

notice form provided for such purpose; and
    (iii) Mark and identify the regulated article in accordance with 
Sec. 340.5 of this part.
    (g) Withdrawal or denial of a permit. Any permit which has been 
issued may be withdrawn by an inspector or the Administrator if he/she 
determines that the holder thereof has not complied with one or more of 
the conditions listed on the permit. APHIS will confirm the reasons for 
the withdrawal of the permit in writing within ten (10) days. Any person 
whose permit has been withdrawn or any person who has been denied a 
permit may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within 
ten (10) days after receiving the written notification of the withdrawal 
or denial. The appeal shall state all of the facts and reasons upon 
which the person relies to show that the permit was wrongfully withdrawn 
or denied. The Administrator shall grant or deny the appeal, in writing, 
stating the reasons for the decision as promptly as circumstances allow. 
If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing shall be held 
to resolve such conflict. Rules of practice concerning such a hearing 
will be adopted by the Administrator.
    (h) Courtesy permit--(1) Issuance. The Administrator may issue a 
courtesy permit for the introduction of organisms modified through 
genetic engineering which are not subject to regulation under this part 
to facilitate movement when the movement might otherwise be impeded 
because of the similarity of the organism to other organisms regulated 
under this part.
    (2) Application. A person seeking a courtesy permit shall submit on 
an application form obtained from APHIS data required by paragraphs (b) 
(1), (2), and (5) of this section and shall indicate such data is being 
submitted as a request for a courtesy permit. A person should also 
include a statement explaining why he or she believes the organism or 
product does not come within the definition of a regulated article. The 
application shall be submitted at least 60 days prior to the time the 
courtesy permit is sought.
    (3) Administrative action. APHIS shall complete an initial review 
within 15 days of the date of receipt of the application. If the 
application is complete, the responsible individual shall be notified of 
the date of receipt of the application for purposes of advising the 
applicant when the 60 day review period commenced. If the application is 
not complete, the responsible individual will be advised what additional 
information must be submitted, and shall commence the 60 day review 
period upon receipt of the additional information, assuming the 
additional information submitted is adequate. Within 60 days from the 
date of receipt of a complete application, APHIS will either issue a 
courtesy permit or advise the responsible individual that a permit is 
required under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.

    (1) Description of the biology of the nonmodified recipient plant 
and information necessary to identify the recipient plant in the 
narrowest taxonomic grouping applicable.
    (2) Relevant experimental data and publications.
    (3) A detailed description of the differences in genotype between 
the regulated article and the nonmodified recipient organism. Include 
all scientific, common, or trade names, and all designations necessary 
to identify: the donor organism(s), the nature of the transformation 
system (vector or vector agent(s)), the inserted genetic material and 
its product(s), and the regulated article. Include country and locality 
where the donor, the recipient, and the vector organisms and the 
regulated articles are collected, developed, and produced.
    (4) A detailed description of the phenotype of the regulated 
article. Describe known and potential differences from the unmodified 
recipient organism that would substantiate that the regulated article is 
unlikely to pose a greater plant pest risk than the unmodified organism 
from which it was derived, including but not limited to: Plant pest risk 
characteristics, disease and pest susceptibilities, expression of the 
gene product, new enzymes, or changes to plant metabolism, weediness of 
the regulated article, impact on the weediness of any other

[[Page 472]]

plant with which it can interbreed, agricultural or cultivation 
practices, effects of the regulated article on nontarget organisms, 
indirect plant pest effects on other agricultural products, transfer of 
genetic information to organisms with which it cannot interbreed, and 
any other information which the Administrator believes to be relevant to 
a determination. Any information known to the petitioner that indicates 
that a regulated article may pose a greater plant pest risk than the 
unmodified recipient organism shall also be included.
    (5) Field test reports for all trials conducted under permit or 
notification procedures, involving the regulated article, that were 
submitted prior to submission of a petition for determination of 
nonregulated status or prior to submission of a request for extension of 
a determination of nonregulated status under paragraph (e) of this part. 
Field test reports shall include the APHIS reference number, methods of 
observation, resulting data, and analysis regarding all deleterious 
effects on plants, nontarget organisms, or the environment.
    (d) Administrative action on a petition. (1) A petition for 
determination of nonregulated status under this part which meets the 
requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section will be filed by 
the Administrator, stamped with the date of filing, and assigned a 
petition number. The petition number shall identify the file established 
for all submissions relating to the petition. APHIS will promptly notify 
the petitioner in writing of the filing and the assigned petition 
number. If a petition does not meet the requirements specified in this 
section, the petitioner shall be sent a notice indicating how the 
petition is deficient.
    (2) After the filing of a completed petition, APHIS shall publish a 
notice in the Federal Register. This notice shall specify that comments 
will be accepted from the public on the filed petition during a 60 day 
period commencing with the date of the notice. During the comment 
period, any interested person may submit to the Administrator, written 
comments, regarding the filed petition, which shall become part of the 
petition file.

decision. The decision shall be placed in the public petition file in 
the offices of APHIS and notice of availability published in the Federal 
Register.
    (e) Extensions to determinations of nonregulated status. (1) The 
Administrator may determine that a regulated article does not pose a 
potential for plant pest risk, and should therefore not be regulated 
under this part, based on the similarity of that organism to an 
antecedent organism.
    (2) A person may request that APHIS extend a determination of 
nonregulated status to other organisms. Such a request shall include 
information to establish the similarity of the antecedent organism and 
the regulated articles in question.
    (3) APHIS will announce in the Federal Register all preliminary 
decisions to extend determinations of nonregulated status 30 days before 
the decisions become final and effective. If additional information

it will issue a revised decision.
    (4) If a request to APHIS to extend a determination of nonregulated 
status under this part is denied, APHIS will inform the submitter of 
that request of the reasons for denial. The submitter may submit a 
modified request or a separate petition for determination of 
nonregulated status without prejudice.
    (f) Denial of a petition; appeal. (1) The Administrator's written 
notification of denial of a petition shall briefly set forth the reason 
for such denial. The written notification shall be sent by certified 
mail. Any person whose petition has been denied may appeal the 
determination in writing to the Administrator within 10 days from 
receipt of the written notification of denial.

[[Page 473]]

    (2) The appeal shall state all of the facts and reasons upon which 
the person relies, including any new information, to show that the 
petition was wrongfully denied. The Administrator shall grant or deny 
the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision as promptly 
as circumstances allow. An informal hearing may be held by the 
Administrator if there is a dispute of a material fact. Rules of 
Practice concerning such a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.

Sec. 340.8  Container requirements for the movement of regulated articles.

    (a) General requirements. A regulated article shall not be moved 
unless it complies with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, 
unless a variance has been granted in accordance with the provisions of 
paragraph (c) of this section. \12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ The requirements of this section are in addition to and not in 
lieu of any other packing requirements such as those for the 
transportation of etiologic agents prescribed by the Department of 
Transportation in Title 49 CFR or any other agency of the Federal 
government.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Container requirements--(1) Plants and plant parts. All plants 
or plant parts, except seeds, cells, and subcellular elements, shall be 
packed in a sealed plastic bag of at least 5 mil thickness, inside a 
sturdy, sealed, leak-proof, outer shipping container constructed of 
corrugated fiberboard, corrogated cardboard, wood, or other material of 
equivalent strength.
    (2) Seeds. All seeds shall be transported in a sealed plastic bag of 
at least 5 mil thickness, inside a sealed metal container, which shall 
be placed inside a second sealed metal container. Shock absorbing 
cushioning material shall be placed between the inner and outer metal 
containers. Each metal container shall be independently capable of 
protecting the seeds and preventing spillage or escape. Each set of 
metal containers shall then be enclosed in a sturdy outer shipping 
container constructed of corrugated fiberboard, corrugated cardboard, 
wood, or other material of equivalent strength.
    (3) Live microorganisms and/or etiologic agents, cells, or 
subcellular elements. All regulated articles which are live (non-

[[Page 474]]

inactivated) microorganisms, or etiologic agents, cells, or subcellular 
elements shall be packed as specified below:
    (i) Volume not exceeding 50 ml. Regulated articles not exceeding 50 
ml shall be placed in a securely closed, watertight container (primary 
container, test tube, vial, etc.) which shall be enclosed in a second, 
durable watertight container (secondary container). Several primary 
containers may be enclosed in a single secondary container, if the total 
volume of all the primary containers so enclosed does not exceed 50 ml. 
The space at the top, bottom, and sides between the primary and 
secondary containers shall contain sufficient nonparticulate absorbent 
material (e.g., paper towel) to absorb the entire contents of the 
primary container(s) in case of breakage or leakage. Each set of primary 
and secondary containers shall then be enclosed in an outer shipping 
container constructed of corrugated fiberboard, corrugated cardboard, 
wood, or other material of equivalent strength.
    (ii) Volume greater than 50 ml. Regulated articles which exceed a 
volume of 50 ml. shall comply with requirements specified in paragraph 
(b)(3)(i) of this section. In addition, a shock absorbing material, in 
volume at least equal to that of the absorbent material between the 
primary and secondary containers, shall be placed at the top, bottom, 
and sides between the secondary container and the outer shipping 
container. Single primary containers shall not contain more than 1,000 
ml. of material. However, two or more primary containers whose combined 
volumes do not exceed 1,000 ml. may be placed in a single, secondary 
container. The maximum amount of micro-organisms or etiologic agents, 
cells, or subcellular elements which may be enclosed within a single 
outer shipping container shall not exceed 4,000 ml.
    (iii) Dry ice. If dry ice is used as a refrigerant, it shall be 
placed outside the secondary container(s). If dry ice is used between 
the secondary container and the outer shipping container, the shock 
absorbing material shall be placed so that the secondary container does 
not become loose inside the outer shipping container as the dry ice 
sublimates.
    (4) Insects, mites, and related organisms. Insects, mites, and other 
small arthropods shall be packed for shipment as specified in this 
paragraph or in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Insects (any life 
stage) shall be placed in an escape-proof primary shipping container 
(insulated vacuum container, glass, metal, plastic, etc.) and sealed to 
prevent escape. Such primary container shall be placed securely within a 
secondary shipping container of crushproof styrofoam or other material 
of equivalent strength; one or more rigid ice packs may also be placed 
within the secondary shipping container; and sufficient packing material 
shall be added around the primary container to prevent movement of the 
primary shipping container. The secondary (styrofoam or other) container 
shall be placed securely within an outer shipping container constructed 
of corrugated fiberboard, corrugated cardboard, wood, or other material 
of equivalent strength.
    (5) Other macroscopic organisms. Other macroscopic organisms not 
covered in paragraphs (b) (1), (2), and (4) of this section which do not 
require continuous access to atmospheric oxygen shall be packaged as 
specified in paragraph (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section. All macroscopic 
organisms which are not plants and which require continuous access to 
atmospheric oxygen shall be placed in primary shipping containers 
constructed of a sturdy, crush-proof frame of wood, metal, or equivalent 
strength material, surrounded by escape-proof mesh or netting of a 
strength and mesh size sufficient to prevent the escape of the smallest 
organism in the shipment, with edges and seams of the mesh or netting 
sealed to prevent escape of organisms. Each primary shipping container 
shall be securely placed within a larger secondary shipping container 
constructed of wood, metal, or equivalent strength material. The primary 
and secondary shipping containers shall then be placed securely within 
an outer shipping container constructed of corrugated fiberboard, 
corrugated cardboard, wood, or other material of

[[Page 475]]

equivalent strength, which outer container may have air holes or spaces 
in the sides and/or ends of the container, provided that the outer 
shipping container must retain sufficient strength to prevent crushing 
of the primary and secondary shipping containers.
    (c) Request for a variance from container requirements. A 
responsible person who believes the container requirements normally 
applicable to the movement of the person's regulated article(s) are 
inappropriate due to unique circumstances (such as the nature, volume, 
or life stage of the regulated article) may submit in an application for 
a permit, a request for a variance from the container requirements. The 
request for a variance under this section shall consist of a short 
statement describing why the normally applicable container requirements 
are inappropriate for the regulated article which the person proposes to 
move and what container requirements the person would use in lieu of the 
normally prescribed container requirements. USDA shall advise the 
responsible person in writing at the time a permit is granted on the 
person's request for a variance.

Sec. 351.3  Procedure on arrival.

    All parcel post or other mail packages from foreign countries which, 
either from examination or external evidence, are found or are believed 
to contain plants or plant products, shall be dispatched for submission, 
or actually submitted, to the plant quarantine inspector at the most 
accessible location listed in Sec. 351.2. The inspector shall pass upon 
the contents under the Plant Quarantine Act and Federal Plant Pest Act 
and with the cooperation of the customs and postal officers either
    (a) Release the package from further plant quarantine examination 
and endorse his decision thereon; or
    (b) Divert it to the Plant Quarantine Station at Washington, DC, 
Brownsville, Tex., Hoboken, N.J., Honolulu, Hawaii, Jamaica, L.I., N.Y., 
Laredo, Tex., Miami, Fla., New Orleans, La., San Francisco, Calif., San 
Juan, P.R., San Pedro, Calif., or Seattle, Wash., for whatever 
disposition is deemed warranted. If so diverted, the plant quarantine 
inspector shall attach to the package the yellow and green special 
mailing tag addressed to the proper quarantine station. A package so 
diverted shall be accompanied by customs card Form 3511 and transmitted 
to the appropriate Customs office for referral to the Plant Quarantine 
Station. Envelopes containing customs card Form 3511 addressed to the 
collector of customs, New York, N.Y., shall contain a notation that the 
material is to be referred to the Plant Protection and Quarantine 
Programs, Hoboken, N.J.

amended at 36 FR 24917, Dec. 24, 1971]


<R05>
Sec. 351.4  Records.

    The customs officers at Washington, DC, Brownsville, Tex., Hoboken, 
N.J., Honolulu, Hawaii, Jamaica, L.I., N.Y., Laredo, Tex., Miami, Fla., 
New Orleans, La., San Francisco, Calif., San Juan, P.R., San Pedro, 
Calif., or Seattle, Wash., shall keep a record of such packages as may 
be delivered to representatives of the Department of Agriculture, and 
upon the return thereof shall prepare a mail entry to accompany the 
dutiable package and deliver it to the postmaster for delivery or onward 
dispatch or in appropriate cases subject the shipment to formal customs 
entry procedure.

[28 FR 5204, May 24, 1963]


<R05>
Sec. 351.5  Return or destruction.

    Where the plant quarantine inspector requires the entire shipment to 
be returned to the country of origin as a prohibited importation (in 
which event he shall endorse his action thereon) and delivers the 
shipment to the collector of customs, the collector shall in turn 
deliver it to the postmaster for dispatch to the country of origin. If, 
upon examination, the plant material is deemed dangerous to plant life, 
the collector of customs shall permit the plant quarantine inspector to 
destroy immediately both the container and its contents. In either case 
the plant quarantine inspector shall notify the addressee of the action 
taken and the reason therefor. If the objectionable plant material forms 
only a portion of the contents of the mail package and in the judgment 
of the inspector the package can safely be delivered to the addressee, 
after removing and destroying the objectionable material, such procedure 
is authorized. In the latter case the inspector shall place in the 
package a memorandum (Form AQI-387) informing the addressee of the 
action taken by the inspector and describing the matter which has been 
seized and destroyed and the reasons therefor.

Sec. 351.6  Packages in closed mail dispatches.

    The foregoing instructions shall be followed in the treatment of 
packages containing plants or plant products received in closed mail 
dispatches made

[[Page 477]]

up for transmission directly to a post office located at a customs port 
at which no plant quarantine inspector is stationed. Such packages 
(accompanied by customs card Form 3511) shall be forwarded by the 
collector of customs through the postmaster to the most accessible 
location listed in Sec. 351.2 for appropriate treatment in the manner 
hereinbefore provided. This procedure shall also be followed in respect 
to such packages which are forwarded to unlisted post offices from the 
post office of original receipt, without having received plant 
quarantine examination. Packages discovered at post offices where no 
customs officer is located shall be forwarded by the postmaster under 
his official penalty envelope addressed to the collector of customs at 
the most accessible location listed for appropriate treatment as 
prescribed herein.

    (3) After inspection by the customs and quarantine officers, and 
with their approval, the addressee, or his authorized agent, shall 
repack and readdress the mail parcel under customs supervision; affix to 
the parcel the necessary postage, and comply with other mailing 
requirements, after which the parcel shall be delivered to the 
postmaster for exportation by mail pursuant to 19 CFR 9.11(a). The 
contents of the original parcel may be subdivided and exported in 
separate parcels in like manner.
    (4) It will not be necessary to issue a customs mail entry nor to 
require formal entry of the shipments.
    (5) The mail shipments referred to shall be accorded special

<R05>
Sec. 352.5  Permit; requirement, form and conditions.

    (a) General. (1) Permits are required for the arrival, unloading or 
landing, or other movement into or through the United States of plants, 
plant products, plant pests, and soil subject to this part. The permit 
may consist of a general authorization as set out in paragraph (b), (c), 
or (d) of this section or Sec. 352.11, or it may be a specific permit. 
A specific permit may be formal or oral except as a formal permit is 
required by paragraph (c) or (e) of this section. The Deputy 
Administrator may in administrative instructions require specific or 
formal permits for any class of products or articles subject to this 
part.
    (2) A formal permit may be issued in prescribed form, in letter 
form, or a combination thereof. A rubber stamp impression or other 
endorsement made by the inspector on pertinent Customs documents 
covering the products or articles involved may constitute the formal 
permit in appropriate cases.
    (b) Permit for prohibited or restricted products or articles brought 
in for temporary stay where unloading or landing in the United States is 
not intended. No permit other than the authorization contained in this 
paragraph shall be required for bringing into the United States any 
plants, plant products, plant pests, or soil subject to this part for 
temporary stay where unloading or landing in the United States is not 
intended, e.g., in connection with residue cargo movement under Customs 
procedure, or in connection with Customs entry for exportation or for 
transportation and exportation. This authorization also includes 
transshipment of products and articles under this paragraph from a 
carrier directly to another carrier of the same company when 
necessitated by an emergency or operating requirement and effected in 
accordance with safeguards prescribed in writing or orally by the 
inspector under Sec. 352.10.
    (c) Permit for prohibited or restricted products or articles 
unloaded or landed for immediate transshipment and exportation, or 
immediate transportation and exportation. When in the opinion of the 
inspector it is unnecessary to specify in a formal permit the safeguards 
required to prevent plant pest dissemination, plants, plant products, 
plant pests, or soil subject to this part may be unloaded or landed for 
immediate transshipment and exportation or for immediate transportation 
and exportation, as provided in Sec. 352.10, with the approval of the 
inspector and no further permit than the authorization contained in this 
paragraph; otherwise a formal permit shall be required for such 
unloading or landing.
    (d) Permit for restricted products or articles moving as residue 
cargo from port of first arrival to port of entry. Restricted plants, 
plant products, plant pests, or soil subject to this part arriving in 
the United States for movement under residue cargo procedures of Customs 
from a port of first arrival to another port for Customs entry into the 
United States may be allowed to so move without permit other than the 
authorization contained in this paragraph, if the inspector finds that 
apparently they can meet the applicable requirements of parts 319 of 
this chapter at the port where entry is to be made; otherwise a formal 
permit shall be required for such movement. Such restricted products and 
articles shall become subject to the applicable permit

[[Page 482]]

and other requirements of parts 319 of this chapter upon arrival at the 
port where Customs entry is to be made and shall not be unloaded or 
landed unless they comply with the applicable requirements.
    (e) Formal permits required for certain prohibited or restricted 
products or articles brought into a foreign trade zone. A formal permit 
must be obtained to bring any prohibited or restricted plants, plant 
products, plant pests, or soil subject to the provisions in this part, 
into a foreign trade zone for storage, manipulation, or other handling, 
except for immediate transshipment and exportation or for immediate 
transportation and exportation. Special conditions to safeguard such 
storage, manipulation, or other possession or handling may be specified 
in the permit, and when so specified shall be in addition to any other 
applicable requirements of this part or the safeguards prescribed by the 
inspector or otherwise under this part.

Sec. 352.6  Application for permit and approval or denial thereof.

    (a) Plants and plant products. Except as otherwise provided in this 
paragraph, any person desiring to unload or land, or otherwise move into 
or through the United States, any plants or plant products for which a 
specific permit is required by Sec. 352.5, shall in the case of 
prohibited plants or plant products, and should in the case of 
restricted plants or plant products, in advance of arrival in the United 
States of the plants or plant products, submit an application for a 
permit to the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs, \1\ stating such 
of the following information as is relevant: The name and address of the 
importer, the approximate quantity and kind of plants and plant products 
it is desired to import under this part, the country where grown, the 
United States port of arrival, the United States port of export, the 
proposed routing from the port of arrival to the port of exportation, 
means of transportation to be employed (i.e., mail, air mail, express, 
air express, freight, air freight, baggage), and the name and address of 
the agent representing the importer. Applications may be made on forms 
provided for the purpose by the Plant Protection and Quarantine 
Programs, or orally, or by letter, telegram, or other means of 
communication furnishing all the information required by this paragraph. 
Applications need not be made for shipments handled under general 
authorizations set forth in Sec. 352.5 (b), (c), or (d), or in Sec. 
352.11.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Application for such permits should be addressed to the Animal 
and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, 
Port Operations, Permit Unit, 4700 River Road, Unit 136, Riverdale, 
Maryland 20737-1236.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Plant pests. Any person desiring to unload or land, or otherwise 
move into or through the United States, any plant pest for which a 
specific permit is required by Sec. 352.5 shall, in advance of the 
arrival of the plant pests in the United States, submit an application 
to the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs \2\ for a permit as 
specified by Sec. 330.201 of this chapter.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Application for permits should be made to the Plant Protection 
and Quarantine Programs, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, 
U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Soil. Any person desiring to bring into or unload or land, or 
otherwise move into or through the United States, any soil for which a 
specific permit is required by Sec. 352.5 shall, in advance of the 
arrival of the soil in the United States, submit an application for 
permit to the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs \2\ as specified 
by Sec. 330.300(b) of this chapter.
    (d) Constructive oral application. If a permit has not been issued 
in advance of arrival, application for any required permit (other than a 
formal permit) shall be considered to have been made orally to the 
inspector at the port of arrival by presentation of the shipment for 
entry or its listing on the manifest or other documentation, but this 
shall not excuse failure to make timely application as required by this 
section. Express application is required for a formal permit.
    (e) Approval or denial of permits. Upon approval of the application, 
the permit

[[Page 483]]

will be issued. Any conditions necessary to eliminate danger of plant 
pest dissemination may be specified in the permit, or otherwise as 
provided in Sec. 352.10. Permits will be denied if, in the opinion of 
the Deputy Administrator, it is not possible to prescribe conditions

<R05>
Sec. 352.9  Ports.

    The arrival, unloading, landing, or possession of plants, plant 
products, plant pests, soil, or other products or articles subject to 
this part shall not be allowed at points within the United States other 
than at the ports specified in the Customs Regulations in 19 CFR 1.1 and 
19 CFR 6.13, and Agana, Guam, or such other ports as may be named in 
permits or administrative instructions. Restrictions on the ports which 
may be used for particular types of handling of any products or articles 
subject to this part may be specified generally in administrative 
instructions or in permits in specific cases. When ports are specified 
in permits or otherwise, the arrival, unloading, landing, or possession 
of the products or articles involved at other ports will not be allowed 
except as the inspector may authorize changes in the ports specified.


<R05>
Sec. 352.10  Inspection; safeguards; disposal.

    (a) Inspection and release. Prohibited and restricted products and 
articles subject to this part shall be subject to inspection at the port 
of first arrival in accordance with Sec. 330.105(a) of this chapter and 
shall not be released by Customs officers for unloading, landing, or 
other onward movement or entry until released by an inspector or a 
Customs officer on behalf of an inspector in accordance with the 
procedure prescribed in Sec. 330.105(a) of this chapter. If diversion 
or change of Customs entry is not permitted for any movements authorized 
under this part, the inspector at the original port of Customs entry 
shall appropriately endorse Customs documents to show that fact. 
However, the inspector at the U.S. port of export may approve diversion 
or change of Customs entry to permit movement to a different foreign 
country, or entry into the United States, subject to all other 
applicable requirements under this part or part 319 or 330 of this 
chapter. If diversion or change of Customs entry is desired at a Customs 
port in the United States where there is no inspector, the owner may 
apply to the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs \3\ for 
information as to applicable conditions. If diversion or change of 
Customs entry is desired at port, confirmation will be given by the 
Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs to the appropriate Customs

officers and Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs inspectors.

Programs, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Safeguards. (1) The unloading, landing, retention on board as 
stores and furnishings or cargo, transshipment and exportation, 
transportation and exportation, onward movment to the port of entry as 
residue cargo or under a Customs entry for immediate transportation, and 
other movement or possession within the United States of prohibited or 
restricted products and articles under this part shall be subject to 
such safeguards as may be prescribed in the permits and this part and 
any others which, in the opinion of the inspector, are necessary and are 
specified by him to prevent plant pest dissemination. In the case of 
prohibited or restricted products or articles subject to this part which 
are unloaded or landed for transshipment and exportation or 
transportation and exportation, or for onward movement to the port of 
entry as residue cargo or under a Customs entry for immediate 
transportation, this shall include necessary safeguards with respect to 
any movement within the port area between the point of arrival and the 
point of temporary storage, other handling, or point of departure, 
including a foreign trade zone. Prohibited and restricted products and 
articles subject to this part which are unloaded or landed for 
transshipment and exportation or transportation and exportation, or for 
onward movement as residue cargo or under a Customs entry for immediate 
transportation, shall be transshipped, or transported and exported from 
the United States, or moved onward immediately. This shall mean the 
shortest practicable interval of time commensurate with the risk of 
plant pest dissemination required to transfer the products or articles 
from one carrier to another and to move them onward or from the United 
States. If, in the opinion of the inspector, considerations of risk of 
plant pest dissemination require, such movement shall be made without 
regard to the noncompetitive or competitive relations of the carriers 
concerned, and the inspector shall promptly report to the Plant 
Protection and Quarantine Programs the circumstances when the emergency 
is so acute that subsequent movement is required on a carrier of a 
company other than the one bringing the products or articles to the 
United States or on which onward movement was contemplated by the 
shipper or forwarding carrier. Prohibited or restricted plants, plant 
products, plant pests, and soil which were intended for entry into the 
United States under part 319 or 330 of this chapter, or for movement 
into or through the United States under this part, and which were 
refused such entry or movement before unloading or landing, or which 
were refused such entry or movement after unloading or landing and are 
immediately reloaded on the same carrier, may be retained on board 
pending removal from the United States or other disposal, but shall be 
subject to the safeguards specified under this section. Prohibited or 
restricted products and articles which were refused entry or movement 
under said parts after unloading or landing and which are not 
immediately reloaded in accordance with this section shall be subject to 
such safeguard action as the inspector deems necessary to carry out the 
purposes of this part.
    (2) Safeguards prescribed by an inspector under this section shall 
be prescribed to the owner by the inspector in writing except that the 
inspector may prescribe the safeguards orally when, in his opinion, the 
circumstances and related Customs procedures do not require written 
notice to the owner of the safeguards to be followed by the owner. In 
prescribing safeguards, the relevant requirements of parts 319 and 330 
of this chapter and this part shall be considered. The safeguards 
prescribed shall be the minimum required to prevent plant pest 
dissemination. Destruction or exportation shall be required only when no 
less drastic measures are deemed by the inspector to be adequate to 
prevent plant pest dissemination. The inspector may follow 
administrative instructions promulgated for certain situations, or he 
may follow a procedure selected by him from administratively approved 
methods known to be effective in similar situations. In the case of 
aircraft that are contaminated with insect pests, only an insecticidal 
formulation, approved for use in aircraft, may be so applied as

[[Page 485]]

an emergency measure. If the application is not effective against the 
insect pests or if other pests must be safeguarded against, the 
inspector shall report the circumstances promptly to the Plant 
Protection and Quarantine Programs and receive instructions as to 
safeguards that will not have a deleterious effect on the structure of 
the aircraft or its operating equipment. In prescribing safeguards 
consideration will be given to such factors as:
    (i) The nature and habits of the plant pests known to be, or likely 
to be, present with the plants, plant products, soil, or other products 
or articles.
    (ii) Nature of the plants, plant products, plant pests, soil, or 
other products or articles.
    (iii) Nature of containers or other packaging and adequacy thereof 
to prevent plant pest dissemination.
    (iv) Climatic conditions as they may have a bearing on plant pest 
dispersal, and refrigeration if provided.
    (v) Routing pending exportation.
    (vi) Presence of soil.
    (vii) Construction or physical condition and type of carrier.
    (viii) Facilities for treatment, or for incineration or other 
destruction.
    (ix) Availability of transportation facilities for immediate 
exportation.
    (x) Any other related factor which should be considered, such as 
intent to export to an adjacent or nearby country.
    (c) Disposal. (1) If prohibited or restricted products or articles 
subject to this part are not safeguarded in accordance with measures 
prescribed under this part, or cannot be adequately safeguarded to 
prevent plant pest dissemination, they shall be seized, destroyed, or 
otherwise disposed of according to law. Whenever disposal action is to 
be taken by the inspector he shall notify the local Customs officer in 
advance.
    (2) When a shipment of any products or articles subject to this part 
has been handled in accordance with all conditions and safeguards 
prescribed in this part and in the permit and by the inspector, the 
inspector shall inform the local Customs officer concerned of the 
release of such products or articles, in appropriate manner.

Sec. 352.11  Mail.

    (a) Transit mail. (1) Plants, plant products, plant pests, and soil 
which arrive in the United States in closed dispatches by international 
mail or international parcel post and which are in transit through the 
United States to another country shall be allowed to move through the 
United States without further permit than the authorization contained in 
this section. Notice of arrival shall not be required as other 
documentation meets the requirement for this notice.
    (2) Inspectors ordinarily will not inspect transit mail or parcel 
post, whether transmitted in open mail or in closed dispatches. They may 
do so if it comes to their attention that any such mail or parcel post 
contains prohibited or restricted products or articles which require 
safeguard action. Inspection and disposal in such cases will be made in 
accordance with this part and part 330 of this chapter, and in 
conformity with regulations and procedures of the Post Office Department 
for handling transit mail and parcel post.
    (b) Importation for exportation. Plants and plant products to be 
imported for exportation, by mail, will be handled under permit in 
accordance with Part 351 of this chapter.

Sec. 352.13  Certain conditions under which change of Customs entry
or diversion is permitted.

    When plants, plant products, plant pests, and soil released for 
exportation, transshipment and exportation, or transportation and 
exportation, under this part, have met all applicable permit and other 
requirements for importation, including inspection and treatment, as 
provided in part 319 or 330 of this chapter, the form of Customs

[[Page 486]]

entry may be changed and the shipment may be diverted at any time to 
permit delivery of the products and articles to a destination in the 
United States, so far as the requirements in this part are involved. The 
Customs officer concerned at the original port of Customs entry shall be 
informed by the inspector that such release has been made and that such 
change of entry or diversion is approved under this part by appropriate 
endorsement of Customs documents.

    All costs incident to the inspection, handling, safeguarding, or 
other disposal of prohibited or restricted products or articles under 
the provisons in this part shall be borne by the owner. Services of the 
inspector during regularly assigned hours of duty at the usual places of 
duty shall be furnished without cost to the person requesting the 
services, unless a user fee is payable under Sec. 354.3 of this 
chapter.

provisions in this part, it should be understood that inexactness or 
carelessness may result in injury or damage. It should also be 
understood by the owners that emergency measures prescribed by the 
inspector to safeguard against plant pest dissemination may have adverse 
effects on certain products and articles and that they will take the 
calculated risk of such adverse effects of authorized measures.

Sec. 353.2  Purpose and administration.

    The export certification program does not require certification of 
any exports, but does provide certification of plants and plant products 
as a service to exporters. After assessing the phytosanitary condition 
of the plants or plant products intended for export, relative to the 
receiving country's regulations, an inspector issues an internationally 
recognized phytosanitary certificate (PPQ Form 577), a phytosanitary 
certificate for reexport (PPQ Form 579), or an export certificate for 
processed plant products (PPQ Form 578) if warranted. APHIS also enters 
into written agreements with industry to allow the issuance of industry-
issued certificates giving assurance that a plant product has been 
handled, processed, or inspected in a manner required by a foreign 
government. An industry-issued certificate includes an ISPM 15 quality/
treatment mark.

Sec. 353.8  Accreditation of non-government facilities.

    (a) The Administrator may accredit a non-government facility to 
perform specific laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services 
if the Administrator determines that the non-government facility meets 
the criteria of paragraph (b) of this section. \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ A list of accredited non-government facilities may be obtained 
by writing to Phytosanitary Issues Management, PPQ, APHIS, 4700 River 
Road, Unit 140, Riverdale, MD 20737-1236.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) A non-government facility's compliance with the criteria of 
paragraph (b) of this section shall be determined through an assessment 
of the facility and its fitness to conduct the laboratory testing or 
phytosanitary inspection services for which it seeks to be accredited. 
If, after evaluating the results of the assessment, the Administrator 
determines that the facility meets the accreditation criteria, the 
facility's application for accreditation will be approved.
    (2) The Administrator may deny accreditation to, or withdraw the 
accreditation of, any non-government facility to conduct laboratory 
testing or phytosanitary inspection services upon a determination that 
the facility does not meet the criteria for accreditation or maintenance 
of accreditation under paragraph (b) of this section and has failed to 
take the remedial action recommended to correct identified deficiencies.
    (i) In the case of a denial, the operator of the facility will be 
informed of the reasons for the denial and may appeal the decision in 
writing to the Administrator within 10 days after receiving notification 
of the denial. The appeal must include all of the facts and reasons upon 
which the person relies to show that the facility was wrongfully denied 
accreditation. The Administrator will grant or deny the appeal in 
writing as promptly as circumstances permit, stating the reason for his 
or her decision. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a 
hearing will be held to resolve the conflict. Rules of practice 
concerning the hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.
    (ii) In the case of withdrawal, before such action is taken, the 
operator of the facility will be informed of the reasons for the 
proposed withdrawal. The operator of the facility may appeal the 
proposed withdrawal in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after 
being informed of the reasons for the proposed withdrawal. The appeal 
must include all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies 
to show that the reasons for the proposed withdrawal are incorrect or do 
not support the withdrawal of the accreditation of the facility. The 
Administrator will grant or deny the appeal in writing as promptly as 
circumstances permit, stating the reason for his or her decision. If 
there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing will be held to 
resolve the conflict. Rules of practice concerning the hearing will be 
adopted by the Administrator. However, withdrawal shall become effective 
pending final determination in the proceeding when the Administrator 
determines that such action is necessary to protect the public health, 
interest, or safety. Such withdrawal will be effective upon oral or 
written notification, whichever is earlier, to the operator of the 
facility. In the event of oral notification, written confirmation will 
be given as promptly as circumstances allow. This withdrawal will 
continue in effect pending the completion of the proceeding, and any 
judicial review thereof, unless otherwise ordered by the Administrator.
    (3) The Administrator will withdraw the accreditation of a non-
government

[[Page 496]]

facility if the operator of the facility informs APHIS in writing that 
the facility wishes to terminate its accredited status.
    (4) A non-government facility whose accreditation has been denied or 
withdrawn may reapply for accreditation using the application procedures 
in paragraph (b) of this section. If the facility's accreditation was 
denied or withdrawn under the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, the facility operator must include with the application written 
documentation specifying what actions have been taken to correct the 
conditions that led to the denial or withdrawal of accreditation.
    (5) All information gathered during the course of a non-government 
facility's assessment and during the term of its accreditation will be 
treated by APHIS with the appropriate level of confidentiality, as set 
forth in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's administrative regulations 
in Sec. 1.11 of this title.
    (b) Criteria for accreditation of non-government facilities. (1) 
Specific standards for accreditation in a particular area of laboratory 
testing or phytosanitary inspection are set forth in this part and may 
be obtained by writing to APHIS. If specific standards for accreditation 
in a particular area of laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection 
have not been promulgated by APHIS, and the Administrator determines 
that accreditation in that area is practical, APHIS will develop 
appropriate standards applicable to accreditation in the area for which 
the non-government facility is seeking accreditation and publish a 
notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register to inform the 
public and other interested persons of the opportunity to comment on and 
participate in the development of those standards.
    (2) The operator of a non-government facility seeking accreditation 
to conduct laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection shall submit 
an application to the Administrator. The application must be completed 
and signed by the operator of the facility or his or her authorized 
representative and must contain the following:
    (i) Legal name and full address of the facility;
    (ii) Name, address, and telephone and fax number of the operator of 
the facility or his or her authorized representative;
    (iii) A description of the facility, including its physical plant, 
primary function, scope of operation, and, if applicable, its 
relationship to a larger corporate entity; and
    (iv) A description of the specific laboratory testing or 
phytosanitary inspection services for which the facility is seeking 
accreditation.
    (3) Upon receipt of the application, APHIS will review the 
application to identify the scope of the assessment that will be 
required to adequately review the facility's fitness to conduct the 
laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services for which it is 
seeking accreditation. Before the assessment of the facility begins, the 
applicant's representative must agree, in writing, to fulfill the 
accreditation procedure, especially to receive the assessment team, to 
supply any information needed for the evaluation of the facility, and to 
enter into a trust fund agreement as provided by paragraph (c) of this 
section to pay the fees charged to the applicant facility regardless of 
the result of the assessment and to pay the charges of subsequent 
maintenance of the accreditation of the facility. Once the agreement has 
been signed, APHIS will assemble an assessment team and commence the 
assessment as soon as circumstances permit. The assessment team will 
measure the facility's fitness to conduct the laboratory testing or 
phytosanitary inspection services for which it is seeking accreditation 
against the specific standards identified by the Administrator for those 
services by reviewing the facility in the following areas:
    (i) Physical plant. The facility's physical plant (e.g., laboratory 
space, office space, greenhouses, vehicles, etc.) must meet the criteria 
identified in the accreditation standards as necessary to properly 
conduct the laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services for 
which it seeks accreditation.
    (ii) Equipment. The facility's personnel must possess or have 
unrestricted access to the equipment (e.g., microscopes, computers, 
scales, triers,

[[Page 497]]

etc.) identified in the accreditation standards as necessary to properly 
conduct the laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services for 
which it seeks accreditation. The calibration and monitoring of that 
equipment must be documented and conform to prescribed standards.
    (iii) Methods of testing or inspection. The facility must have a 
quality manual or equivalent documentation that describes the system in 
place at the facility for the conduct of the laboratory testing or 
phytosanitary inspection services for which the facility seeks 
accreditation. The manual must be available to, and in use by, the 
facility personnel who perform the services. The methods and procedures 
followed by the facility to conduct the laboratory testing or 
phytosanitary inspection services for which it seeks accreditation must 
be commensurate with those identified in the accreditation standards and 
must be consistent with or equivalent to recognized international 
standards for such testing or inspection.
    (iv) Personnel. The management and facility personnel accountable 
for the laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services for 
which the facility is seeking accreditation must be identified and must 
possess the training, education, or experience identified in the 
accreditation standards as necessary to properly conduct the testing or 
inspection services for which the facility seeks accreditation, and that 
training, education, or experience must be documented.
    (4) To retain accreditation, the facility must agree to:
    (i) Observe the specific standards applicable to its area of 
accreditation;
    (ii) Be assessed and evaluated on a periodic basis by means of 
proficiency testing or check samples;
    (iii) Demonstrate on request that it is able to perform the tests or 
inspection services representative of those for which it is accredited;
    (iv) Resolve all identified deficiencies;
    (v) Notify APHIS as soon as possible, but no more than 10 days 
following its occurrence, of any change in key management personnel or 
facility staff accountable for the laboratory testing or phytosanitary 
inspection services for which the facility is accredited; and
    (vi) Report to APHIS as soon as possible, but no more than 10 days 
following its occurrence, any change involving the location, ownership, 
physical plant, equipment, or other conditions that existed at the 
facility at the time accreditation was granted.
    (c) Fees and trust fund agreement. The fees charged by APHIS in 
connection with the initial accreditation of a non-government facility 
and the maintenance of that accreditation shall be adequate to recover 
the costs incurred by the government in the course of APHIS' 
accreditation activities. To cover those costs, the operator of the 
facility seeking accreditation must enter into a trust fund agreement 
with APHIS under which the operator of the facility will pay in advance 
all estimated costs that APHIS expects to incur through its involvement 
in the pre-accreditation assessment process and the maintenance of the 
facility's accreditation. Those costs shall include administrative 
expenses incurred in those activities, such as laboratory fees for 
evaluating check test results, and all salaries (including overtime and 
the Federal share of employee benefits), travel expenses (including per 
diem expenses), and other incidental expenses incurred by the APHIS in 
performing those activities. The operator of the facility must deposit a 
certified or cashier's check with APHIS for the amount of the costs, as 
estimated by APHIS. If the deposit is not sufficient to meet all costs 
incurred by APHIS, the operator of the facility must deposit another 
certified or cashier's check with APHIS for the amount of the remaining 
costs, as determined by APHIS, before APHIS' services will be completed. 
After a final audit at the conclusion of the pre-accreditation 
assessment, any overpayment of funds will be returned to the operator of 
the facility or held on account until needed for future activities 
related to the maintenance of the facility's accreditation.

Sec. 353.9  Standards for accreditation of non-government facilities
to perform laboratory seed health testing and seed crop 

phytosanitary inspection.

    (a) Application for accreditation, certification of accreditation, 
and monitoring of accredited facilities. A facility may apply to be 
accredited to perform laboratory seed health testing or seed crop 
phytosanitary inspection, or to renew such accreditation, by submitting 
an application in accordance with Sec. 353.8(b)(2) of this part. If 
there are portions of the application deemed to contain trade secret or 
confidential business information (CBI), each page of the application 
containing such information should be marked ``CBI Copy.'' The 
application must be accompanied by a copy of the facility's quality 
manual and a nonrefundable application fee of $1,000. The applicant must 
make additional deposits to cover the costs of gaining and maintaining 
accreditation into a trust fund established in accordance with Sec. 
353.8(c) of this part upon request by the Administrator.
    (1) Upon determining that a facility is eligible for accreditation, 
the Administrator will issue the facility a certificate of 
accreditation. Accreditation will be for a period of 3 years from the 
date of issuance of the certificate of accreditation and may be renewed 
by submitting a new application and application fee in accordance with 
this paragraph.
    (2) The Administrator may deny or withdraw accreditation in 
accordance with Sec. 353.8(a)(2) of this part. A facility may appeal 
denial of accreditation in accordance with Sec. 353.8(a)(2)(i) of this 
part, and may appeal withdrawal of accreditation in accordance with 
Sec. 353.8(a)(2)(ii) of this part.
    (3) A facility that has been denied accreditation or had its 
accreditation withdrawn may not reapply within 60 days of the date the 
facility was notified in writing that accreditation was denied or 
withdrawn.
    (4) After a facility is accredited, the facility must allow APHIS 
access to the facility and all of its equipment and records for the 
purpose of conducting unannounced audits to determine the facility's 
continuing eligibility for accreditation. Such audits will occur at 
least once a year and may be performed more frequently at the discretion 
of the Administrator.
    (b) Standards for accreditation. A facility that, in accordance with 
Sec. 353.8(b)(2) of this part, applies to be accredited to perform 
laboratory seed health testing or seed crop phytosanitary inspection 
will be evaluated for accreditation against these standards:
    (1) Physical plant. The facility's physical plant (e.g., laboratory 
space, office space, greenhouses, vehicles, etc.) must:
    (i) Have laboratory and office spaces enclosed by walls and locking 
doors to prevent unauthorized access;
    (ii) Conform to all State and local zoning and other ordinances; and
    (iii) Provide a work area that is dedicated to laboratory functions 
and has sufficient space to conduct the required tests and store the 
materials and samples required for the tests in a manner that prevents 
contamination by other samples in the laboratory and from other sources.
    (2) The facility must have access to all equipment required to 
conduct the laboratory testing or seed crop phytosanitary inspections 
for which it is accredited. Specific test methodologies, materials, and 
the calibration and monitoring of the equipment must conform to 
Reference Manual B, which is incorporated by reference at Sec. 300.4 of 
this chapter. The general requirements for each test category are as 
follows:
    (i) Seed crop phytosanitary inspections. Seed crop phytosanitary 
inspection may also include related activities such as collection of 
seed samples for later laboratory testing, visual inspection of seed 
just prior to export, and inspection of greenhouses or growth chambers 
where plants are grown for seed production, as well as visual inspection 
of seed crops. In the field, inspectors must use accurate field maps, 
hand lenses, and secure containers for the collection, storage, and 
transportation of samples. Inspectors must have direct access to a 
laboratory that is fully equipped to carry out any necessary diagnostic 
tests needed for field samples.
    (ii) Direct visual examination. Visual examination of seed requires 
a stereo

[[Page 499]]

microscope. Visual examination of tissue requires a compound light 
microscope. Visual examination of loosely attached or accompanying 
material requires a centrifuge and shaker.
    (iii) Incubation. Required equipment includes incubation chambers, 
laminar flow hoods, media preparation equipment, scales, pH meters, 
distilled and sterile water, gas burners, an autoclave, and the 
appropriate media for the specified tests.
    (iv) Grow-out tests. Grow-out tests require a greenhouse, growth 
chamber, or an outdoor quarantine location, and access to a laboratory 
that is fully equipped to carry out any required diagnostic tests.
    (v) Serological tests. These tests require grinding, extraction, and 
sample purification equipment; fluorescent microscopes; plate readers; 
spectrophotometers; and the appropriate assay materials; or the 
appropriate equipment to use field ready test kits.
    (vi) DNA probes. To conduct these tests, a laboratory must be 
equipped with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) equipment, including 
thermal cyclers, electrophoresis and gel blotting equipment, and the 
reagents and DNA polymerases necessary to conduct the PCR.
    (3) Methods of testing and inspection. The facility must conduct its 
laboratory seed health testing and seed crop phytosanitary inspection 
procedures in accordance with Reference Manual B. The facility must have 
a quality manual documenting its quality system for laboratory seed 
health testing and seed crop phytosanitary inspection procedures. The 
quality system must follow the general guidelines described in ANSI/ASQC 
Q9001-1994, American National Standard: Quality Systems-Model for 
Quality Assurance in Design, Development, Production, Installation and 
Servicing. Acceptable models for quality systems for accredited 
facilities are also described in detail in Reference Manual A, which is 
incorporated by reference at Sec. 300.3 of this chapter. The personnel 
who perform the testing and inspection services must comply with the 
quality manual, and management must enforce this compliance. The 
facility must maintain documented procedures for identification, 
collection, indexing, access, filing, storage, maintenance, and 
disposition of quality system records. The facility must maintain 
quality system records to demonstrate conformance to the quality manual 
and the effective operation of the quality system.
    (4) Personnel. There must be a selection procedure and a training 
system to ensure technical competence of all staff members. The 
education, technical knowledge, and experience required to perform 
assigned test and inspection functions must be documented and clearly 
defined. In addition:
    (i) Evaluation of plant or tissue samples must be undertaken by a 
plant pathologist or by laboratory technicians under the supervision of 
a plant pathologist, who may provide such supervision either on-site, or 
from a remote location. Where personnel are required to be trained at a 
facility to evaluate the particular types of plants or tissue samples 
handled by the facility, the training program must be evaluated by APHIS 
and determined to be effective.
    (ii) All staff must have access to and be familiar with the 
reference materials, guides, and manuals required for the routine 
performance of the tests and inspections they conduct.

passengers shall be accounted for separately and shall be regarded as 
trust funds held by the person possessing such fees as agents, for the 
beneficial interest of the United States. All such user fees held by any 
person shall be property in which the person holds only a possessory 
interest and not an equitable interest. As compensation for collecting, 
handling, and remitting the AQI user fees for international passengers,

spaces.
    (7) Compliance. Each carrier, travel agent, United States-based tour 
wholesaler, or other entity subject to this section must allow APHIS

    (4) If a designated State inspector issues a certificate, the State 
where the certificate is issued may charge for inspection services 
provided in that State.
    (5) Any State which wishes to charge a fee for services it provides 
to issue certificates must establish fees in accordance with one of the 
following guidelines:
    (i) Calculation of a ``cost-per-certificate'' fee. The State must:
    (A) Estimate the annual number of certificates to be issued;
    (B) Determine the total cost of issuing certificates by adding 
together delivery, \2\ support,\3\ and administrative \4\ costs; and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Delivery costs are costs such as employee salary and benefits, 
transportation, per diem, travel, purchase of specialized equipment, and 
user fee costs associated with maintaining field offices. Delivery hours 
are similar hours taken by inspectors, including travel time, inspection 
time, and time taken to complete paperwork.
    \3\ Support costs are costs at supervisory levels which are similar 
to delivery costs, and user fee costs such as training, automated data 
processing, public affairs, enforcement, legal services, communications, 
postage, budget and accounting services, and payroll, purchasing, 
billing, and collecting services. Support hours are similar hours taken 
at supervisory levels, as well as hours taken in training, automated 
data processing, enforcement, legal services, communication, budgeting 
and accounting, payroll purchasing, billing, and collecting.
    \4\ Administrative costs are costs incurred as a direct result of 
collecting and monitoring Federal phytosanitary certificates. 
Administrative hours are hours taken as a direct result of collecting 
and monitoring Federal phytosanitary certificates.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (C) Divide the cost of issuing certificates by the estimated number 
of certificates to be issued to obtain a ``raw'' fee. The State may 
round the ``raw'' fee up to the nearest quarter, if necessary for ease 
of calculation, collection, or billing; or
    (ii) Calculation of a ``cost-per-hour'' fee. The State must:
    (A) Estimate the annual number of hours taken to issue certificates 
by adding together delivery, \2\ support, \3\ and administrative \4\ 
hours;
    (B) Determine the total cost of issuing certificates by adding 
together delivery, support, and administrative costs; and
    (C) Divide the cost of issuing certificates by the estimated number 
of hours taken to issue certificates to obtain a ``cost-per-hour'' fee. 
The State may round the ``cost-per-hour'' fee up to the nearest quarter, 
if necessary for ease of calculation, collection, or billing.
    (h)[Reserved]
    (i) Payment methods. For payment of any of the AQI user fees 
required in paragraph (g) of this section, we will

[[Page 523]]

accept personal checks for amounts less than $100, and checks drawn on 
commercial accounts, cashier's checks, certified checks, traveler's 
checks, and money orders for any amount. All payments must be for the 
exact amount due.
    (j) The person for whom the service is provided and the person 
requesting the service are jointly and severally liable for payment of 
user fees for any import or entry services listed below, of $56 per 
hour, or $14 per quarter hour, with a minimum fee of $14 for each 
employee required to perform the following services. If the services 
must be conducted on a Sunday or holiday or at any other time outside 
the normal tour of duty of the employee, then the premium user fee rate 
as listed below applies, as well as the 2-hour minimum charge and a 
commuted traveltime period required by Sec. 354.1(a)(2). If the 
services requested are performed on a Sunday, the hourly user fee rate 
will be $74, or $18.50 per quarter hour, with a $18.50 minimum. If the 
services requested are performed on a day other than Sunday outside the 
normal tour of duty of the employee providing the service, the hourly 
user fee rate will be $65, or $16.25 per quarter hour, with a $16.25 
minimum:
    (1) Conducting inspections, on vessels or in storage areas, of solid 
wood packing material or cargo when a shipment arrives without a 
certificate or exporter statement required under Sec. 319.40-5(g) or 
Sec. 319.40-5(h) of this chapter, or with an incomplete certificate or 
exporter statement; and
    (2) Supervising the separation of cargo from solid wood packing 
material denied entry under this subpart and the destruction or 
reexportation of the solid wood packing material. (Approved by the

Sec. 355.22  Validation of documentation.

    (a) Documentation for any mailed or nonmailed terrestrial plant 
which is required to have documentation under 50 CFR part 17 or part 23 
at the time of importation, must be validated by an inspector prior to 
movement of such plant from the Customs inspection area at the port of 
entry. The original documentation must be surrendered to the inspector 
at the time of validation.
    (b) Documentation for any mailed or nonmailed terrestrial plant 
which is listed in 50 CFR 17.12 or 23.23 and which is required to have 
documentation under 50 CFR part 17 or part 23 at the time of exportation 
or reexportation, must be validated at the port of export or reexport by 
an inspector prior to the exportation or reexportation of such plant. 
\5\ The original and one copy of the documentation must be submitted for 
validation, and the copy must be surrendered to the inspector at the 
time of validation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ It is the policy of the Department of Agriculture to allow, if 
inspectors are available, terrestrial plants listed in 50 CFR 17.12 or 
23.23 which are intended for export to be inspected at the premises 
where such plants are grown. However, the documentation required for the 
export of such plants by 50 CFR part 17 or part 23 shall only be 
validated at the port of export and only when such plants are presented 
at the port for export together with the documents required by 50 CFR 
part 17 or part 23 and a certified statement by the inspector who 
inspected the plants that the plants are apparently eligible for 
exportation in accordance with the provisions of this part and 
provisions of 50 CFR chapter I relating to the Act and Convention. 
Plants which have been previously inspected must be exported through a 
designated port (unless allowed by the United States Department of the 
Interior to be exported through a nondesignated port) in order to comply 
with section 9(f) of the Act [16 U.S.C. 1538(f)]. Plants which are 
inspected at the premises of origin must be available at the port of 
export for monitoring inspections and for other inspections deemed need 
for enforcement purposes, but, unless so inspected, will not need to be 
unpacked, inspected and repacked at the port. Information concerning the 
availability of inspectors to conduct inspections at the premise of 
origin may be obtained by calling local offices of Plant Protection and 
Quarantine, which are listed in telephone directories, or by writing the 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and 
Quarantine, Operational Support--Director's Office, 4700 River Road, 
Unit 131, Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1236.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Documentation for a plant shall be validated under this section 
upon endorsement of the documentation by an inspector when he or she 
determines that the plant was apparently eligible for importation, 
exportation, or reexportation in accordance with the

[[Page 530]]

provisions of this part and the provisions of 50 CFR chapter I relating 
to the Act and Convention.
    (d) To obtain validation of documentation, the importer, exporter, 
or reexporter, or agent thereof, shall make available to an inspector:
    (1) All shipping documents (including bills of lading, waybills, 
packing lists, and invoices):
    (2) All documents required by the Act and Convention; and
    (3) The plant being imported, exported, or reexported.

Sec. 355.23  Recordkeeping, access, and reports.

    (a) Any person engaged in business as an importer, exporter, or 
reexporter of terrestrial plants listed in 50 CFR part 17 or part 23 
shall keep such records as will fully and correctly disclose each 
importation, exportation, or reexportation of terrestrial plants made by 
such person and the subsequent disposition made by such person of the 
plants. Such records shall include shipping documents for each shipment 
of plants imported, exported, or reexported; a description of the form 
of the plants (such as whole live plants, cuttings, seeds, or other 
specific parts or derivatives of plants); the scientific and common 
names of the plants; the country or place of origin of the plants; the 
date and place of importation, exportation, or reexportation of the 
plants; the number (weight if the plants cannot be quantified by number) 
and specific location of plants; the date and means of subsequent 
disposition of the plants, whether by sale, barter, consignment, loan, 
delivery, destruction, or other means; and names and addresses of 
persons to whom the plants were disposed, if applicable.
    (b) Every record required to be kept under this section shall be 
kept for a period of 5 years after the occurrence of the transactions to 
which the records relate, and for such further time as the Deputy 
Administrator may require by written notice to the person required to 
keep such records under this part for purposes of any investigation, 
litigation, or other proceeding under the Act or this part.
    (c) Any person engaged in business as an importer, exporter, or 
reexporter of terrestrial plants listed in 50 CFR part 17 or part 23 
shall, upon presentation of credentials by an inspector or duly 
authorized representatives of the Secretary; during ordinary business 
hours of the person given notice, afford such inspector access to the 
person's place of business, the opportunity to examine the person's 
inventory of plants and the records required to be kept under paragraph 
(a) of this section, and the opportunity to copy such records. The use 
of a room, table, or other facilities (other than reproduction 
equipment) necessary for examination and copying of records and for such 
examination of inventory shall be afforded such inspector.
    (d) Any person engaged in business as an importer, exporter, or 
reexporter of terrestrial plants listed in 50 CFR part 17 or part 23, 
upon written request by the Deputy Administrator, shall submit within 60 
days of such request, a report concerning any of the information 
required to be maintained under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

Sec. 356.1  Property subject to forfeiture procedures.

    This part sets forth procedures relating to the forfeiture of any 
plant, equipment, means of conveyance or other property \1\ seized under 
the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) 
or the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 (16 U.S.C. 3371 et seq.), \2\ in 
possession (actual or constructive) of the United States Department of 
Agriculture, and subject to forfeiture under these Acts because of 
activities pertaining to the importation, exportation, or reexportation 
of terrestrial plants.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Under section 11(e)(4) of the Endangered Species Act (``Act''; 
16 U.S.C. 1540(e)(4)) any such equipment and means of conveyance would 
be subject to forfeiture upon conviction of a criminal violation 
pursuant to section 11(b)(1) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1540(b)(1)); however, 
such a plant may be subject to forfeiture regardless of whether a 
criminal conviction is obtained.
    \2\ Under section 5(a)(2) of the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 (16 
U.S.C. 3374(a)(2)) USDA has authority to initiate forfeiture proceedings 
against all vessels, vehicles, aircraft, and other equipment used to aid 
in the importation or exportation of plants in a criminal violation of 
the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 for which a felony conviction has been 
obtained if (a) the owner of such vessel, vehicle, aircraft, or 
equipment was at the time of the alleged illegal act a consenting part 
or privy thereto or in the exercise of due care should have known that 
such vessel, vehicle, aircraft, or equipment would be used in a criminal 
violation of the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981, and (b) the violation 
involved the sale or purchase of, the offer of sale or purchase of, or 
the intent to sell or purchase plants. However, under section 5(a)(1) of 
the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 (16 U.S.C. 3474(a)(1) plants seized for 
violations of the Amendments are subject to forfeiture regardless of 
whether a civil penalty assessment or criminal conviction is obtained.

[49 FR 46336, Nov. 26, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 356.2  Appraisement.

    Promptly following the seizure or other receipt of property 
specified in Sec. 356.1, the Deputy Administrator shall determine the 
retail value of such property in the same quantity or quantities as 
seized. If the property may lawfully be sold in the United States, the 
value thereof shall be determined by ascertaining the price at which the 
property or similar property in the ordinary course of trade is freely 
offered for sale at the time of appraisement, and at a principal market 
as close as possible to the place of appraisement. If the property may 
not lawfully be sold in the United States, the value thereof shall be 
determined by other reasonable means.


<R05>
Sec. 356.3  Property valued at greater than $10,000; notice of seizure
and civil action to obtain forfeiture.

    Promptly following the seizures or other receipt of any property 
specified in Sec. 356.1 and determined under Sec. 356.2 to have a 
value greater than $10,000, the Deputy Administrator shall mail a notice 
of seizure by registered or certified mail to the current or last known 
or reasonable ascertainable address, return receipt requested, to 
persons known or reasonably ascertained to be the owner or agent of the 
seized property and to any other person having an interest in the 
property. Such notice shall describe the seized property, shall state 
the time, date, place, and reason for the seizure, that there is a right 
to petition for remission or mitigation of forfeiture pursuant to Sec. 
356.7, and shall state that action shall be taken in accordance with 
this part. Promptly following the seizure of such property, the 
Secretary shall also submit a report concerning such property to the 
U.S. Attorney for the district in which the seizure was made for 
institution of forfeiture proceedings in the U.S. District Court. The 
report shall provide a statement of all the relevant facts and 
circumstances of the case, including the names of the witnesses, and a 
citation to the laws believed to have been violated and on which 
reliance may be had for forfeiture.


<R05>
Sec. 356.4  Property valued at $10,000 or less; notice of seizure
administrative action to obtain forfeiture.

    (a) When authorized. The Secretary shall take measures to obtain 
forfeiture in accordance with this section of any property specified in 
Sec. 356.1 and determined under Sec. 356.2 to have a value of $10,000 
or less.
    (b) Waiver of forfeiture procedures by owner of seized property. A 
person

[[Page 532]]

claiming to be an owner or to have an interest in any property specified 
in Sec. 356.1 with a value of $10,000 or less may waive any rights to 
any procedures relating to forfeiture under this subpart by signing a 
statement providing for waiver of such rights.
    (1) The Deputy Administrator shall publish a copy of the notice of 
seizure and proposed forfeiture as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, by posting for 21 days in a conspicuous place accessible to the 
public at the Plant Protection and Quarantine Enforcement office nearest 
the place of seizure. The time and date of posting shall be indicated on 
the notice.
    (2) Upon the execution of such statement and following publication 
of the notice for 21 days as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, any interest in such property by such owner shall become 
forfeited under the Act without further action under this subpart, and 
the Deputy Administrator shall not be required to send such owner any 
notices or declarations otherwise required by this subpart.
    (c) Procedure absent waiver of forfeiture procedures by owner. (1) 
Notice of seizure and proposed forfeiture. Promptly following seizure of 
property, the Deputy Administrator shall issue a notice of seizure and 
proposed forfeiture. The notice shall be in substantially the same form 
as a complaint for forfeiture filed in the U.S. District Court. The 
notice shall describe the seized property, including any identification 
numbers, such as the license, registration, motor, and serial numbers 
for a motor vehicle. The notice shall state the time, date, and place of 
seizure; the reason for seizure; and shall specify the value of the 
property as determined under Sec. 356.2. The notice shall contain 
specific reference to the provisions of the Act, permit, certificate, or 
regulations allegedly violated and under which the property is subject 
to forfeiture. The notice shall state that any person desiring to claim 
the property must file a claim and a bond in accordance with paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section, and shall state that if a proper claim and bond 
are not received by the specified office within the time prescribed by 
such paragraph, the property will be declared forfeited to the United 
States and disposed of according to law. The notice shall also advise 
interested persons of their right to file a petition for remission or 
mitigation of forfeiture in accordance with Sec. 356.7.
    (i) Promptly following the seizure, The Deputy Administrator shall 
mail a copy of the notice by registered or certified mail, return 
receipt requested, to persons known or reasonably ascertained to be the 
owner or agent of the seized property, and to any other person having an 
interest in the property, if such owner or agent or other person and 
their address is known or reasonably ascertainable.
    (ii) Publication. Promptly following the seizure, the Deputy 
Administrator shall publish a copy of the notice by posting for 21 days 
in a conspicuous place accessible to the public at the Plant Protection 
and Quarantine enforcement office nearest the place of seizure. The time 
and date of posting shall be indicated on the notice.
    (2) Filing a claim and bond. Upon issuance of the notice of proposed 
forfeiture, any person claiming ownership of or other interest in the 
seized property may file with the office specified in the notice a claim 
to the property and a bond in the amount of $250, with sureties to be 
approved by the Deputy Administrator, conditioned that in case of 
condemnation of the articles so claimed, the obligor shall pay all the 
costs and expenses of the proceedings to obtain such condemnation. Any 
claim and bond must be received in such office within 20 days after 
posting of the notice of proposed forfeiture, and shall state claimant's 
interest in the property. The Deputy Administrator may extend the 20 day 
period with an appropriate statement on the posted notice of proposed 
forfeiture, if necessary, to allow a person deemed to have an interest 
in the property at least 10 days to file such a claim and bond after 
receipt of a notice of proposed forfeiture. The bond shall be on a U.S. 
Customs Form 4615 or on a similar form provided by Plant Protection and 
Quarantine. There shall be endorsed on the bond a list or schedule in 
substantially the following form which shall be signed by the claimant 
in the presence of the witnesses to the bond, and attested by the 
witnesses:


[[Page 533]]


List or schedule containing a description of seized articles, claim for 
which is covered by the bond:

________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________

    The foregoing list is correct.

________________________________________________________________________

Claimant

Attest:_________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________


The claim and bond referred to in the paragraph shall not entitle the 
claimant or any other person to possession of the property.
    (3) Transmittal to U.S. Attorney. As soon as practicable after 
timely receipt by the specified office of a proper claim and bond in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the Secretary shall 
transmit such claim, bond (with a duplicate list and description of the 
articles seized), and a report as described in Sec. 356.3 to the U.S. 
Attorney for the district in which seizure was made for forfeiture 
proceedings in the U.S. District Court.
    (d) Summary forfeiture. If a proper claim and bond are not received 
by the specified office within the time periods as specified in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the property shall be forfeited and 
the Deputy Administrator shall prepare a declaration of forfeiture. The 
declaration of forfeiture shall be in writing, and the Deputy 
Administrator shall send such declaration by registered or certified 
mail, return receipt requested, to each person whose whereabouts and 
prior interests in the seized property are known or reasonably 
ascertainable. The declaration shall be in substantially the same form 
as a default judgment of forfeiture entered in U.S. District Court. The 
declaration shall describe the property and state the time, date, place, 
and reason for its seizure. The declaration shall identify the notice of 
proposed forfeiture, describing the dates and manner of publication of 
the notice and any efforts made to serve the notice personally or by 
mail. The declaration shall state that in response to the notice a 
proper claim and bond were not timely received by the proper office from 
any claimant, and that, therefore, all potential claimants are deemed to 
admit the truth of the allegations of the notice. The declaration shall 
conclude with an order of condemnation and forfeiture of the property to 
the United States for disposition according to law.

(Information collection requirements were approved by the Office of 
Budget and Management under control number 0579-0076)


<R05>
Sec. 356.5  Bonded release.

    (a) The Deputy Administrator may accept a bond or other security, in 
the amount of the value of the property as determined under Sec. 356.3, 
in place of any property specified in Sec. 356.1 and release the 
property to the owner or agent of the property, if such action would not 
frustrate the purposes of the Act and Convention. As an example, this 
section does not allow the release of terrestrial plants that are 
without documentation required under 50 CFR chapter I.
    (b) Any request for the return of property based on the acceptance 
of a bond or other security shall be submitted in writing to the Deputy 
Administrator. The request shall include evidence to establish that the 
person making the request is the sole owner of the property referred to 
in the request or is the agent of the sole owner of such property. A 
response in writing, granting or denying the request, and the reasons 
therefor, shall be sent to the person making the request.


<R05>
Sec. 356.6  Storage of property.

    Following the seizure or other receipt of any property specified in 
Sec. 356.1 and valued at $10,000 or less, the property shall remain in 
the custody of the Deputy Administrator pending disposition. Pending 
such disposition, the property shall be stored in such place, as, in the 
opinion of the Deputy Administrator, is most convenient and appropriate 
with due regard to the expense involved, whether or not the place of 
storage is within the judicial district in which the property was 
seized.


<R05>
Sec. 356.7  Petition for remission or mitigation of forfeiture.

    (a) Any person who has an interest in any property specified in 
Sec. 356.1 and valued at $10,000 or less, or any person who has 
incurred or is alleged to have

[[Page 534]]

incurred a forfeiture of any such property, may file with the Deputy 
Administrator a petition for remission or mitigation of forfeiture while 
the property is in the custody of the Deputy Administrator.
    (b) A petition filed with the Deputy Administrator need not be in 
any particular form, but must contain the following:
    (1) A description of the property:
    (2) The time, date, and place of seizure;
    (3) Evidence of the petitioner's interest in the property such as 
contracts, bills of sale, invoices, security interests, certificates of 
title; and
    (4) A statement of all facts and circumstances relied upon by the 
petitioners to justify remission or mitigation of the forfeiture.
    (c) The petition shall be signed by the petitioner or the 
petitioner's attorney at law. If the petitioner is a business, the 
petition must be signed by a partner, officer, or petitioner's attorney 
at law.
    (d) Upon receiving the petition, the Deputy Administrator shall 
decide whether or not to grant relief. In making a decision, the Deputy 
Administrator shall consider the information submitted by the 
petitioner, as well as any other available information relating to the 
matter, and may require that testimony be taken concerning the petition.
    (e) If the Deputy Administrator finds that the forfeiture was 
incurred without willful negligence or without any intention on the part 
of the petitioner to violate the law or finds the existence of such 
mitigating circumstances as to justify remission or mitigation of the 
forfeiture or alleged forfeiture, the Deputy Administrator may remit or 
mitigate the same upon terms and conditions as he deems reasonable and 
just. However, remission or mitigation will not be made if such action 
would frustrate the purposes of the Act or Convention. As an example, 
this section does not allow remission or mitigation with respect to 
terrestrial plants that are without documentation required under 50 CFR 
chapter I.
    (f) The Deputy Administrator shall notify the petitioner in writing 
concerning whether the petition was granted or denied, and shall state 
the reasons therefor. If the petition is denied fully or in part, the 
petitioner may then file a supplemental petition, but no supplemental 
petition shall be considered unless it is received within 60 days from 
the date of the Deputy Administrator's notification concerning the 
original petition. The Deputy Administrator shall notify the petitioner 
in writing concerning the action taken in response to the supplemental 
petition, and shall state the reasons therefor.

(Information collection requirements were approved by the Office of 
Budget and Management under control number 0579-0076)


<R05>
Sec. 356.8  Return procedure.

    If, at the conclusion of proceedings, seized property is to be 
returned to the person determined to be the owner or agent thereof, the 
Deputy Administrator shall issue a letter or other document to the 
person determined to be owner or agent thereof authorizing its return. 
This letter shall be delivered personally or sent by registered or 
certified mail, return receipt requested, and shall identify the person 
determined to be the owner or agent, the seized property, and if 
appropriate, the bailee of the seized property. It shall also provide 
that upon presentation of the letter or other document and proper 
identification, and the signing of a receipt provided by Plant 
Protection and Quarantine, the seized property is authorized to be 
released.


<R05>
Sec. 356.9  Filing of documents.

    (a) Any document required by this subpart to be filed or served 
within a certain period of time, will be considered filed or served as 
of the time of receipt by the party with or upon whom filing or service 
is required.
    (b) Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays shall be included in 
computing the time allowed for the filing or serving of any document or 
paper; except that when such time expires on a Saturday, Sunday or 
federal holiday, such period shall be extended to include the next 
following business day.

Sec. 360.300  General prohibitions and restrictions on the movement
of noxious weeds; permits.

    (a) No person may move a Federal noxious weed into or through the 
United States, or interstate, unless:
    (1) He or she obtains a permit for such movement in accordance with 
paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section; and
    (2) The movement is consistent with the specific conditions 
contained in the permit.
    (b) The Deputy Administrator will issue a written permit for the 
movement of a noxious weed into or through the United States, or 
interstate, if application is made for such movement and if the Deputy 
Administrator determines that such movement, under conditions specified 
in the permit, would not involve a danger of dissemination of the 
noxious weed in the United States, or interstate; otherwise such a 
permit will not be issued.
    (c) All such permits issued shall contain in written form in the 
permit any conditions (other than those conditions specified in this 
part) under which the permit is to be granted, e.g. conditions with 
respect to shipment, storage, and destruction.
    (d) If the permit is denied, the applicant shall be furnished the 
reasons therefor.
    (e) The Deputy Administrator may revoke any outstanding permit 
issued under this section, and may deny future permit applications, if 
the Deputy Administrator determines that the issuee has failed to comply 
with any provision of the Act or this section, including conditions of 
any permit issued. Upon request, any permit holder will be afforded an 
opportunity for a hearing with respect to the merits or validity of any 
such revocation involving his or her permit.

<R05>
Sec. 360.400  Preemption of State and local laws.

    (a) Under section 436 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7756), a 
State or political subdivision of a State may not regulate in foreign 
commerce any noxious weed in order to control it, eradicate it, or 
prevent its dissemination. A State or political subdivision of a State 
also may not impose prohibitions or restrictions upon the movement in 
interstate commerce of noxious weeds if the Secretary has issued a 
regulation or order to prevent the dissemination of the noxious weed 
within the United States. The only exceptions to this are:
    (1) If the prohibitions or restrictions issued by the State or 
political subdivision of a State are consistent with and

[[Page 538]]

do not exceed the regulations or orders issued by the Secretary; or
    (2) If the State or political subdivision of a State demonstrates to 
the Secretary and the Secretary finds that there is a special need for 
additional prohibitions or restrictions based on sound scientific data 
or a thorough risk assessment.
    (b) Therefore, in accordance with section 436 of the Plant 
Protection Act, the regulations in this part preempt all State and local 
laws and regulations that are inconsistent with or exceed the 
regulations in this part unless a special need request has been granted 
in accordance with the regulations in Sec. Sec. 301.1 through 301.13 of 
this chapter.

Sec. 361.2  Preemption of State and local laws; general restrictions
on the importation of seed and screenings.

    (a) The regulations in this part preempt State and local laws 
regarding seed and screenings imported into the United States while the 
seed and screenings are in foreign commerce. Seed and screenings 
imported for immediate distribution and sale to the consuming public 
remain in foreign commerce until sold to the ultimate consumer. The 
question of when foreign commerce ceases in other cases must be 
considered on a case-by-case basis.
    (b) No person shall import any agricultural seed, vegetable seed, or 
screenings into the United States unless the importation is in 
compliance with this part.
    (c) Any agricultural seed, vegetable seed, or screenings imported 
into the United States not in compliance with this part shall be subject 
to exportation, destruction, disposal, or any remedial measures that the 
Administrator determines are necessary to prevent the dissemination into 
the United States of noxious weeds.
    (d) Except as provided in Sec. 361.7(b), coated or pelleted seed 
may enter the United States only if each lot of seed is accompanied by 
an officially drawn and sealed sample of seed drawn from the lot before 
the seed was coated or pelleted. The sample must be drawn in a manner 
consistent with that described in Sec. 361.5 of this part.
    (e) Except as provided in Sec. Sec. 361.4(a)(3) and 361.7(c), 
screenings of all agricultural seed and vegetable seed are prohibited 
entry into the United States.

[62 FR 48460, Sept. 16, 1997, as amended at 74 FR 53400, Oct. 19, 2009]


<R05>
Sec. 361.3  Declarations and labeling.

    (a) All lots of agricultural seed, vegetable seed, and screenings 
imported into the United States must be accompanied by a declaration 
from the importer of the seed or screenings. The declaration must state 
the kind, variety, and origin of each lot of seed or screenings and the 
use for which the seed or screenings are being imported.
    (b) Each container of agricultural seed and vegetable seed imported 
into the United States for seeding (planting) purposes must be labeled 
to indicate the identification code or designation for the lot of seed; 
the name of each kind or kind and variety of agricultural seed or the 
name of each kind and variety of vegetable seed present in the lot in 
excess of 5 percent of the whole; and the designation ``hybrid'' when 
the lot contains hybrid seed. Kind and variety names used on the

[[Page 543]]

label shall conform to the kind and variety names used in the 
definitions of ``agricultural seed'' and ``vegetable seed'' in Sec. 
361.1. If any seed in the lot has been treated, each container must be 
further labeled, in type no smaller than 8 point, as follows:
    (1) The label must indicate that the seed has been treated and 
provide the name of the substance or process used to treat the seed. 
Substance names used on the label shall be the commonly accepted coined, 
chemical (generic), or abbreviated chemical name.
    (i) Commonly accepted coined names are commonly recognized as names 
of particular substances, e.g., thiram, captan, lindane, and dichlone.
    (ii) Examples of commonly accepted chemical (generic) names are 
blue-stone, calcium carbonate, cuprous oxide, zinc hydroxide, 
hexachlorobenzene, and ethyl mercury acetate. The terms ``mercury'' or 
``mercurial'' may be used in labeling all types of mercurials.
    (iii) Examples of commonly accepted abbreviated chemical names are 
BHC (1,2,3,4,5,6-Hexachlorocyclohexane) and DDT (dichloro diphenyl 
trichloroethane).
    (2) If the seed has been treated with a mercurial or similarly toxic 
substance harmful to humans and vertebrate animals, the label must 
include a representation of a skull and crossbones and a statement 
indicating that the seed has been treated with poison. The skull and 
crossbones must be at least twice the size of the type used for the 
information provided on the label, and the poison warning statement must 
be written in red letters on a background of distinctly contrasting 
color. Mercurials and similarly toxic substances include the following:

Aldrin, technical
Demeton
Dieldrin
p-Dimethylaminobenzenediazo sodium sulfonate
Endrin
Ethion
Heptachlor
Mercurials, all types
Parathion
Phorate
Toxaphene
O-O-Diethyl-O-(isopropyl-4-methyl-6-pyrimidyl) thiophosphate
O,O-Diethyl-S-2-(ethylthio) ethyl phosphorodithioate

    (3) If the seed has been treated with a substance other than one 
classified as a mercurial or similarly toxic substance under paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, and the amount remaining with the seed is 
harmful to humans or other vertebrate animals, the label must indicate 
that the seed is not to be used for food, feed, or oil purposes. Any 
amount of any substance used to treat the seed that remains with the 
seed will be considered harmful when the seed is in containers of more 
than 4 ounces, except that the following substances will not be deemed 
harmful when present at a rate less than the number of parts per million 
(p/m) indicated:

Allethrin--2 p/m
Malathion--8 p/m
Methoxyclor--2 p/m
Piperonyl butoxide--20 p/m (8 p/m on oat and sorghum)
Pyrethrins--3 p/m (1 p/m on oat and sorghum)

    (c) In the case of seed in bulk, the information required under 
paragraph (b) of this section shall appear in the invoice or other 
records accompanying and pertaining to such seed. If the seed is in 
containers and in quantities of 20,000 pounds or more, regardless of the 
number of lots included, the information required on each container 
under paragraph (b) of this section need not be shown on each container 
if each container has stenciled upon it or bears a label containing a 
lot designation and the invoice or other records accompanying and 
pertaining to such seed bear the various statements required for the 
respective seeds.
    (d) Each container of agricultural seed and vegetable seed imported 
into the United States for cleaning need not be labeled to show the 
information required under paragraph (b) of this section if:
    (1) The seed is in bulk;
    (2) The seed is in containers and in quantities of 20,000 pounds or 
more, regardless of the number of lots involved, and the invoice or 
other records accompanying and pertaining to the seed show that the seed 
is for cleaning; or

[[Page 544]]

    (3) The seed is in containers and in quantities of less than 20,000 
pounds, and each container carries a label that bears the words ``Seed 
for cleaning.''


<R05>
Sec. 361.4  Inspection at the port of first arrival.

    (a) All agricultural seed, vegetable seed, and screenings imported 
into the United States shall be made available for examination by an 
APHIS inspector at the port of first arrival and shall remain at the 
port of first arrival until released by an APHIS inspector. Lots of 
agricultural seed, vegetable seed, or screenings may enter the United 
States without meeting the sampling requirements of paragraph (b) of 
this section if the lot is:
    (1) Seed that is not being imported for seeding (planting) purposes 
and the declaration required by Sec. 361.3(a) states the purpose for 
which the seed is being imported;
    (2) Seed that is being shipped in bond through the United States;
    (3) Screenings from seeds of wheat, oats, barley, rye, buckwheat, 
field corn, sorghum, broomcorn, flax, millet, proso, soybeans, cowpeas, 
field peas, or field beans that are not being imported for seeding 
(planting) purposes and the declaration accompanying the screenings as 
required under Sec. 361.2(a) indicates that the screenings are being 
imported for processing or manufacturing purposes;
    (4) Seed that is being imported for sowing for experimental or 
breeding purposes, is not for sale, is limited in quantity to the amount 
indicated in column 3 of table 1 of Sec. 361.5, and is accompanied by a 
declaration stating the purpose for which it is being imported (seed 
imported for increase purposes only will not be considered as being 
imported for experimental or breeding purposes); or
    (5) Seed that was grown in the United States, exported, and is now 
returning to the United States, provided that the person importing the 
seed into the United States furnishes APHIS with the following 
documentation:
    (i) Export documents indicating the quantity of seed and number of 
containers, the date of exportation from the United States, the 
distinguishing marks on the containers at the time of exportation, and 
the name and address of the United States exporter;
    (ii) A document issued by a Customs or other government official of 
the country to which the seed was exported indicating that the seed was 
not admitted into the commerce of that country; and
    (iii) A document issued by a Customs or other government official of 
the country to which the seed was exported indicating that the seed was 
not commingled with other seed after being exported to that country.
    (b) Except as provided in Sec. Sec. 361.5(a)(2) and 361.7, samples 
will be taken from all agricultural seed and vegetable seed imported 
into the United States for seeding (planting) purposes prior to being 
released into the commerce of the United States.
    (1) Samples of seed will be taken from each lot of seed in 
accordance with Sec. 361.5 to determine whether any seeds of noxious 
weeds listed in Sec. 361.6(a) are present. If seeds of noxious weeds 
are present at a level higher than the tolerances set forth in Sec. 
361.6(b), the lot of seed will be deemed to be adulterated and will be 
rejected for entry into the United States for seeding (planting) 
purposes. Once deemed adulterated, the lot of seed must be:
    (i) Exported from the United States;
    (ii) Destroyed under the monitoring of an APHIS inspector;
    (iii) Cleaned under APHIS monitoring at a seed-cleaning facility 
that is operated in accordance with Sec. 361.8(a); or
    (iv) If the lot of seed is adulterated with the seeds of a noxious 
weed listed in Sec. 361.6(a)(2), the seed may be allowed entry into the 
United States for feeding or manufacturing purposes, provided the 
importer withdraws the original declaration and files a new declaration 
stating that the seed is being imported for feeding or manufacturing 
purposes and that no part of the seed will be used for seeding 
(planting) purposes.
    (2) Seed deemed adulterated may not be mixed with any other seed 
unless the Administrator determines that two or more lots of seed deemed 
adulterated are of substantially the same quality and origin. In such 
cases, the

[[Page 545]]

Administrator may allow the adulterated lots of seed to be mixed for 
cleaning as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (3) If the labeling of a lot of seed is false or misleading in any 
respect, the seed will be rejected for entry into the United States. A 
falsely labeled lot of seed must be:
    (i) Exported from the United States;
    (ii) Destroyed under the monitoring of an APHIS inspector; or
    (iii) The seed may be allowed entry into the United States if the 
labeling is corrected under the monitoring of an APHIS inspector to 
accurately reflect the character of the lot of seed.


<R05>
Sec. 361.5  Sampling of seeds.

    (a) Sample sizes. As provided in Sec. 361.4(b), samples of seed 
will be taken from each lot of seed being imported for seeding 
(planting) purposes to determine whether any seeds of noxious weeds 
listed in Sec. 361.6(a) are present. The samples shall be drawn in the 
manner described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. Unused 
portions of samples of rare or expensive seeds will be returned by APHIS 
upon request of the importer.
    (1) A minimum sample of not less than 1 quart shall be drawn from 
each lot of agricultural seed; a minimum sample of not less than 1 pint 
shall be drawn from each lot of vegetable seed, except that a sample of 
\1/4\ pint will be sufficient for a vegetable seed importation of 5 
pounds or less. The minimum sample shall be divided repeatedly until a 
working sample of proper weight has been obtained. If a mechanical 
divider cannot be used or is not available, the sample shall be 
thoroughly mixed, then placed in a pile; the pile shall be divided 
repeatedly into halves until a working sample of the proper weight 
remains. The weights of the working samples for noxious weed examination 
for each lot of seed are shown in column 1 of table 1 of this section. 
If the lot of seed is a mixture, the following methods shall be used to 
determine the weight of the working sample:
    (i) If the lot of seed is a mixture consisting of one predominant 
kind of seed or a group of kinds of similar size, the weight of the 
working sample shall be the weight shown in column 1 of table 1 of this 
section for the kind or group of kinds that comprises more than 50 
percent of the sample.
    (ii) If the lot of seed is a mixture consisting of two or more kinds 
or groups of kinds of different sizes, none of which comprises over 50 
percent of the sample, the weight of the working sample shall be the 
weighted average (to the nearest half gram) of the weight shown in 
column 1 of table 1 of this section for each of the kinds that comprise 
the sample, as determined by the following method:
    (A) Multiply the percentage of each component of the mixture 
(rounded off to the nearest whole number) by the sample sizes shown in 
column 1 of table 1 of this section;
    (B) Add all these products;
    (C) Total the percentages of all components of the mixtures; and
    (D) Divide the sum in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section by the 
total in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(C) of this section.
    (2) It is not ordinarily practical to sample and test small lots of 
seed offered for entry. The maximum sizes of lots of each kind of seed 
not ordinarily sampled are shown in column 2 of table 1 of this section.
    (3) The maximum sizes of lots of each kind of seed allowed entry 
without sampling for sowing for experimental or breeding purposes as 
provided in Sec. 361.4(a)(4) are shown in column 3 of table 1 of this 
section.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Method of sampling. (1) When an importation consists of more 
than one lot, each lot shall be sampled separately.
    (2) For lots of six or fewer bags, each bag shall be sampled. A 
total of at least five trierfuls shall be taken from the lot.
    (3) For lots of more than six bags, five bags plus at least 10 
percent of the number of bags in the lot shall be sampled. (Round off 
numbers with decimals to the nearest whole number, raising 0.5 to the 
next whole number.) Regardless of the lot size, it is not necessary to 
sample more than 30 bags.
    (4) When the lot of seed to be sampled is comprised of seed in small 
containers that cannot practically be sampled as described in paragraph 
(b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section, entire unopened containers may be 
taken in sufficient number to supply a sample that meets the minimum 
size requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (c) Drawing samples. Samples will not be drawn unless each container 
is labeled to show the lot designation and the name of the kind and 
variety of each agricultural seed, or kind and variety of each vegetable 
seed, appearing on the invoice and other entry papers, and a declaration 
has been filed by the importer as required under Sec. 361.2(a). In 
order to secure a representative sample, an APHIS inspector will draw 
equal portions from evenly distributed parts of the quantity of seed to 
be sampled; the APHIS inspector, therefore, must be given access to all 
parts of that quantity.

[[Page 551]]

    (1) For free-flowing seed in bags or in bulk, a probe or trier shall 
be used. For small free-flowing seed in bags, a probe or trier long 
enough to sample all portions of the bag shall be used. When drawing 
more than one trierful of seed from a bag, a different path through the 
seed shall be used when drawing each sample.
    (2) For non-free-flowing seed in bags or bulk that may be difficult 
to sample with a probe or trier, samples shall be obtained by thrusting 
one's hand into the seed and withdrawing representative portions. The 
hand shall be inserted in an open position with the fingers held closely 
together while the hand is being inserted and the portion withdrawn. 
When more than one handful is taken from a bag, the handfuls shall be 
taken from well-separated points.
    (3) When more than one sample is drawn from a single lot, the 
samples may be combined into a composite sample unless it appears that 
the quantity of seed represented as a lot is not of uniform quality, in 
which case the separate samples shall be forwarded together, but without 
being combined into a composite sample.
    (d) In most cases, samples will be drawn and examined by an APHIS 
inspector at the port of first arrival. The APHIS inspector may release 
a shipment if no contaminants are found and the labeling is sufficient. 
If contaminants are found or the labeling of the seed is insufficient, 
the APHIS inspector may forward the sample to the USDA Seed Examination 
Facility (SEF), Beltsville, MD, for analysis, testing, or examination. 
APHIS will notify the owner or consignee of the seed that samples have 
been drawn and forwarded to the SEF and that the shipment must be held 
intact pending a decision by APHIS as to whether the seed is within the 
noxious weed seed tolerances of Sec. 361.6 and is accurately labeled. 
If the decision pending is with regard to the noxious weed seed content 
of the seed and the seed has been determined to be accurately labeled, 
the seed may be released for delivery to the owner or consignee under 
the following conditions:
    (1) The owner or consignee executes with Customs either a Customs 
single-entry bond or a Customs term bond, as appropriate, in such amount 
as is prescribed by applicable Customs regulations;
    (2) The bond must contain a condition for the redelivery of the seed 
or any part thereof upon demand of the Port Director of Customs at any 
time;
    (3) Until the seed is approved for entry upon completion of APHIS' 
examination, the seed must be kept intact and not tampered with in any 
way, or removed from the containers except under the monitoring of an 
APHIS inspector; and
    (4) The owner or consignee must keep APHIS informed as to the 
location of the seed until it is finally entered into the commerce of 
the United States.

Sec. 361.7  Special provisions for Canadian-origin seed and screenings.

    (a) In addition to meeting the declaration and labeling requirements 
of Sec. 361.2 and all other applicable provisions of this part, all 
Canadian-origin agricultural seed and Canadian-origin vegetable seed 
imported into the United States from Canada for seeding (planting) 
purposes or cleaning must be accompanied by a certificate of analysis 
issued by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency or by a private seed 
laboratory accredited by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Samples of 
seed shall be drawn using sampling methods comparable to those detailed 
in Sec. 361.5 of this part. The seed analyst who examines the seed at 
the laboratory must be accredited to analyze the kind of seed covered by 
the certificate.
    (1) If the seed is being imported for seeding (planting) purposes, 
the certificate of analysis must verify that the seed meets the noxious 
weed seed tolerances of Sec. 361.6. Such seed will not be subject to 
the sampling requirements of Sec. 361.3(b).
    (2) If the seed is being imported for cleaning, the certificate of 
analysis must name the kinds of noxious weed seeds that are to be 
removed from the lot of seed. Seed being imported for cleaning must be 
consigned to a facility operated in accordance with Sec. 361.8(a).
    (b) Coated or pelleted agricultural seed and coated or pelleted 
vegetable seed of Canadian origin may be imported into the United States 
if the seed was analyzed prior to being coated or pelleted and is 
accompanied by a certificate of analysis issued in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Screenings otherwise prohibited under this part may be imported 
from Canada if the screenings are imported for processing or manufacture 
and are consigned to a facility operating under a compliance agreement 
as provided by Sec. 361.8(b).

Sec. 361.8  Cleaning of imported seed and processing of certain 
Canadian-origin screenings.

    (a) Imported seed that is found to contain noxious weed seeds at a 
level higher than the tolerances set forth in Sec. 361.6(b) may be 
cleaned under the monitoring of an APHIS inspector. The cleaning will be 
at the expense of the owner or consignee.
    (1) At the location where the seed is being cleaned, the identity of 
the seed must be maintained at all times to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator. The refuse from the cleaning must be placed in containers 
and securely sealed and identified. Upon completion of the cleaning, a 
representative sample of the seed will be analyzed by a registered seed 
technologist, an official seed laboratory, or by APHIS; if the seed is 
found to be within the noxious weed tolerances set forth in Sec. 
361.6(b), the seed may be allowed entry into the United States;

[[Page 554]]

    (2) The refuse from the cleaning must be destroyed under the 
monitoring of an APHIS inspector at the expense of the owner or 
consignee of the seed.
    (3) Any person engaged in the business of cleaning imported seed may 
enter into a compliance agreement under paragraph (c) of this section to 
facilitate the cleaning of seed imported into the United States under 
this part.
    (b) Any person engaged in the business of processing screenings who 
wishes to process screenings imported from Canada under Sec. 361.7(c) 
that are otherwise prohibited under this part must enter into a 
compliance agreement under paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) A compliance agreement for the cleaning of imported seed or 
processing of otherwise prohibited screenings from Canada shall be a 
written agreement \1\ between a person engaged in such a business, the 
State in which the business operates, and APHIS, wherein the person 
agrees to comply with the provisions of this part and any conditions 
imposed pursuant thereto. Any compliance agreement may be canceled 
orally or in writing by the APHIS inspector who is monitoring its 
enforcement whenever the inspector finds that the person who entered 
into the compliance agreement has failed to comply with the provisions 
of this part or any conditions imposed pursuant thereto. If the 
cancellation is oral, the decision and the reasons for the decision 
shall be confirmed in writing, as promptly as circumstances permit. Any 
person whose compliance agreement has been canceled may appeal the 
decision to the Administrator, in writing, within 10 days after 
receiving written notification of the cancellation. The appeal shall 
state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show 
that the compliance agreement was wrongfully canceled. The Administrator 
shall grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for such 
decision, as promptly as circumstances permit. If there is a conflict as 
to any material fact, a hearing shall be held to resolve such conflict. 
Rules of practice concerning such a hearing will be adopted by the 
Administrator.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Compliance Agreement forms are available without charge from 
Permit Unit, PPQ, APHIS, 4700 River Road Unit 136, Riverdale, MD 20737-
1236, and from local offices of the Plant Protection and Quarantine. 
(Local offices are listed in telephone directories).

Sec. 361.9  Recordkeeping.

    (a) Each person importing agricultural seed or vegetable seed under 
this part must maintain a complete record, including copies of the 
declaration and labeling required under this part and a sample of seed, 
for each lot of seed imported. Except for the seed sample, which may be 
discarded 1 year after the entire lot represented by the sample has been 
disposed of by the person who imported the seed, the records must be 
maintained for 3 years following the importation.
    (b) Each sample of vegetable seed and each sample of agricultural 
seed must be at least equal in weight to the sample size prescribed for 
noxious weed seed examination in table 1 of Sec. 361.5.
    (c) An APHIS inspector shall, during normal business hours, be 
allowed to inspect and copy the records.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
0579-0124)


<R05>
Sec. 361.10  Costs and charges.

    Unless a user fee is payable under Sec. 354.3 of this chapter, the 
services of an APHIS inspector during regularly assigned hours of duty 
and at the usual places of duty will be furnished without cost. The U.S. 
Department of Agriculture's provisions relating to overtime charges for 
an APHIS inspector's services are set forth in part 354 of this chapter. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will not be responsible for any costs 
or charges incident to inspections or compliance with this part, other 
than for the services of the APHIS inspector during regularly assigned 
hours of duty and at the usual places of duty. All expenses incurred by 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture (including travel, per diem or 
subsistence, and salaries of officers or employees of the Department) in 
connection with the monitoring of cleaning, labeling, other 
reconditioning, or destruction of seed, screenings, or refuse under this 
part shall be reimbursed by the owner or consignee of the seed or 
screenings.

Sec. 370.1  Scope and purpose.

    These regulations are issued pursuant to the Freedom of Information 
Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552), and in accordance with the requirements 
of the Department of Agriculture regulations in part 1, subpart A of 
this title. The availability of records of the Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service (APHIS), and the procedures by which the public may 
obtain such information, shall be governed by the Department regulations 
as implemented by the regulations in this part. It is the policy of 
APHIS to be an open agency and to promptly make available for public 
inspection any records or information which are required to be released 
under the Act. Material which is exempt from disclosure will also be 
promptly made available when the Agency in its discretion determines 
that release of such material is in the public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 370.2  Published materials.

    Rules and regulations of APHIS relating to its regulatory 
responsibilities are continuously published in the Federal Register, and 
codified in this chapter III, title 7, and in 9 CFR chapter I. APHIS 
issues publications explaining animal and plant health programs and the 
laws and regulations, including quarantines, under which the programs 
are conducted. These publications are, for the most part available free 
from the Office of Governmental and Public Affairs, USDA, Washington, DC 
20250; or, in some cases from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. 
Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, at established rates.

Sec. 372.1  Purpose.

    These procedures implement section 102(2) of the National 
Environmental

[[Page 563]]

Policy Act by assuring early and adequate consideration of environmental 
factors in Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service planning and 
decisionmaking and by promoting the effective, efficient integration of 
all relevant environmental requirements under the National Environmental 
Policy Act. The goal of timely, relevant environmental analysis will be 
secured principally by adhering to the National Environmental Policy Act 
implementing regulations (40 CFR parts 1500-1508), especially provisions 
pertaining to timing (Sec. 1502.5), integration (Sec. 1502.25), and 
scope of analysis (Sec. 1508.25).


<R05>
Sec. 372.2  Designation of responsible APHIS official.

    The Administrator of APHIS, or an agency official to whom the 
Administrator may formally delegate the task, is responsible for overall 
review of APHIS' NEPA compliance.


<R05>
Sec. 372.3  Information and assistance.

    Information, including the status of studies, and the availability 
of reference materials, as well as the informal interpretations of 
APHIS' NEPA procedures and other forms of assistance, will be made 
available upon request to Environmental Analysis and Documentation, 
Biotechnology, Biologics, and Environmental Protection, APHIS, USDA, 
P.O. Drawer 810, Riverdale MD 20738, (301) 436-8565 (Hyattsville) or 
(301) 734-8565 (Riverdale).


<R05>
Sec. 372.4  Definitions.

    The terminology set forth in the Council on Environmental Quality's 
(CEQ) implementing regulations at 40 CFR part 1508 is incorporated 
herein. In addition, the following terms, as used in these procedures, 
are defined as follows:
    APHIS. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).
    Decisionmaker. The agency official responsible for executing 
findings of no significant impact in the environmental assessment 
process and the record of decision in the environmental impact statement 
process.
    Department. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).
    Environmental unit. Environmental Analysis and Documentation, the 
analytical unit in Biotechnology, Biologics, and Environmental 
Protection responsible for coordinating APHIS' compliance with the 
National Environmental Policy Act and other environmental laws and 
regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 372.5  Classification of actions.

    (a) Actions normally requiring environmental impact statements. This 
class of policymakings and rulemakings seeks to establish programmatic 
approaches to animal and plant health issues. Actions in this class 
typically involve the agency, an entire program, or a substantial 
program component and are characterized by their broad scope (often 
global or nationwide) and potential effect (impacting a wide range of 
environmental quality values or indicators, whether or not affected 
individuals or systems may be completely identified at the time). 
Ordinarily, new or untried methodologies, strategies, or techniques to 
deal with pervasive threats to animal and plant health are the subjects 
of this class of actions. Alternative means of dealing with those 
threats usually have not been well developed. Actions in this class 
include:
    (1) Formulation of contingent response strategies to combat future 
widespread outbreaks of animal and plant diseases; and
    (2) Adoption of strategic or other long-range plans that purport to 
adopt for future program application a preferred course of action.
    (b) Actions normally requiring environmental assessments but not 
necessarily environmental impact statements. This class of APHIS actions 
may involve the agency as a whole or an entire program, but generally is 
related to a more discrete program component and is characterized by its 
limited scope (particular sites, species, or activities) and potential 
effect (impacting relatively few environmental values or systems). 
Individuals and systems that may be affected can be identified. 
Methodologies, strategies, and techniques employed to deal with the 
issues at hand are seldom new or untested. Alternative means of dealing 
with

[[Page 564]]

those issues are well established. Mitigation measures are generally 
available and have been successfully employed. Actions in this class 
include:
    (1) Policymakings and rulemakings that seek to remedy specific 
animal and plant health risks or that may affect opportunities on the 
part of the public to influence agency environmental planning and 
decisionmaking. Examples of this category of actions include:
    (i) Development of program plans that seek to adopt strategies, 
methods, and techniques as the means of dealing with particular animal 
and plant health risks that may arise in the future;
    (ii) Implementation of program plans at the site-specific, action 
level, except for actions that are categorically excluded, as provided 
in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) Planning, design, construction, or acquisition of new 
facilities, or proposals for modifications to existing facilities.
    (3) Disposition of waste and other hazardous or toxic materials at 
laboratories and other APHIS facilities, except for actions that are 
categorically excluded, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (4) Approvals and issuance of permits for proposals involving 
genetically engineered or nonindigenous species, except for actions that 
are categorically excluded, as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (5) Research or testing that:
    (i) Will be conducted outside of a laboratory or other containment 
area (field trials, for example); or
    (ii) Reaches a stage of development (e.g., formulation of 
premarketing strategies) that forecasts an irretrievable commitment to 
the resulting products or technology.
    (c) Categorically excluded actions. This class of APHIS actions 
shares many of the same characteristics--particularly in terms of the 
extent of program involvement, as well as the scope, effect of, and the 
availability of alternatives to proposed actions--as the class of 
actions that normally requires environmental assessments but not 
necessarily environmental impact statements. The major difference is 
that the means through which adverse environmental impacts may be 
avoided or minimized have actually been built right into the actions 
themselves. The efficacy of this approach generally has been established 
through testing and/or monitoring. The Department of Agriculture has 
also promulgated a listing of categorical exclusions that are applicable 
to all agencies within the department unless their procedures provide 
otherwise. Those categorical exclusions, codified at 7 CFR 1b.3(a), are 
entirely appropriate for APHIS. Other actions in this class include:
    (1) Routine measures. (i) Routine measures, such as identifications, 
inspections, surveys, sampling that does not cause physical alteration 
of the environment, testing, seizures, quarantines, removals, 
sanitizing, inoculations, control, and monitoring employed by agency 
programs to pursue their missions and functions. Such measures may 
include the use--according to any label instructions or other lawful 
requirements and consistent with standard, published program practices 
and precautions--of chemicals, pesticides, or other potentially 
hazardous or harmful substances, materials, and target-specific devices 
or remedies, provided that such use meets all of the following criteria 
(insofar as they may pertain to a particular action):
    (A) The use is localized or contained in areas where humans are not 
likely to be exposed, and is limited in terms of quantity, i.e., 
individualized dosages and remedies;
    (B) The use will not cause contaminants to enter water bodies, 
including wetlands;
    (C) The use does not adversely affect any federally protected 
species or critical habitat; and
    (D) The use does not cause bioaccumulation.
    (ii) Examples of routine measures include:
    (A) Inoculation or treatment of discrete herds of livestock or 
wildlife undertaken in contained areas (such as a barn or corral, a zoo, 
an exhibition, or an aviary);
    (B) Pesticide treatments applied to infested plants at a nursery; 
and

[[Page 565]]

    (C) Isolated (for example, along a highway) weed control efforts.
    (2) Research and development activities. (i) Activities that are 
carried out in laboratories, facilities, or other areas designed to 
eliminate the potential for harmful environmental effects--internal or 
external--and to provide for lawful waste disposal.
    (ii) Examples of this category of actions include:
    (A) The development and/or production (including formulation, 
repackaging, movement, and distribution) of previously approved and/or 
licensed program materials, devices, reagents, and biologics;
    (B) Research, testing, and development of animal repellents; and
    (C) Development and production of sterile insects.
    (3) Licensing and permitting. (i) Issuance of a license, permit, or 
authorization to ship for field testing previously unlicensed veterinary 
biological products;
    (ii) Permitting, or acknowledgment of notifications for, confined 
field releases of genetically engineered organisms and products; and
    (iii) Permitting of:
    (A) Importation of nonindigenous species into containment 
facilities,
    (B) Interstate movement of nonindigenous species between containment 
facilities, or
    (C) Releases into a State's environment of pure cultures of 
organisms that are either native or are established introductions.
    (4) Rehabilitation of facilities. Rehabilitation of existing 
laboratories and other APHIS facilities, functional replacement of parts 
and equipment, and minor additions to such existing APHIS facilities.
    (d) Exceptions for categorically excluded actions. Whenever the 
decisionmaker determines that a categorically excluded action may have 
the potential to affect ``significantly'' the quality of the ``human 
environment,'' as those terms are defined at 40 CFR 1508.27 and 1508.14, 
respectively, an environmental assessment or an environmental impact 
statement will be prepared. For example:
    (1) When any routine measure, the incremental impact of which, when 
added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions 
(regardless of what agency or person undertakes such actions), has the 
potential for significant environmental impact;
    (2) When a previously licensed or approved biologic has been 
subsequently shown to be unsafe, or will be used at substantially higher 
dosage levels or for substantially different applications or 
circumstances than in the use for which the product was previously 
approved;
    (3) When a previously unlicensed veterinary biological product to be 
shipped for field testing contains live microorganisms or will not be 
used exclusively for in vitro diagnostic testing; or
    (4) When a confined field release of genetically engineered 
organisms or products involves new species or organisms or novel 
modifications that raise new issues.

<R05>
Sec. 372.6  Early planning for applicants and non-APHIS entities.

    Each prospective applicant who anticipates the need for approval of 
proposed activities classified as normally requiring environmental 
documentation is encouraged to contact, at the earliest opportunity, 
APHIS' program staff.

[60 FR 6002, Feb. 1, 1995; 60 FR 13212, Mar. 10, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 372.7  Consultation.

    Prospective applicants are encouraged to contact APHIS program 
officials to determine what types of environmental analyses or 
documentation, if any, need to be prepared. NEPA documents will 
incorporate, to the fullest extent possible, surveys and studies 
required by other environmental statutes, such as the Endangered Species 
Act.

[60 FR 6002, Feb. 1, 1995; 60 FR 13212, Mar. 10, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 372.8  Major planning and decision points and public involvement.

    (a) Major planning and decisions points. The NEPA process will be 
fully coordinated with APHIS planning in

[[Page 566]]

cooperation with program personnel. Specific decision points or 
milestones will be identified and communicated to the public and others 
in a notice of intent and in the context of the public scoping process.
    (b) Public involvement. There will be an early and open process for 
determining the scope of issues to be addressed in the environmental 
impact statement process.
    (1) A notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement 
will be published in the Federal Register as soon as it is determined 
that a proposed major Federal action has the potential to affect 
significantly the quality of the human environment. The notice may 
include a preliminary scope of environmental study. All public and other 
involvement in APHIS' environmental impact statement process, including 
the scoping process, commenting on draft documents, and participation in 
the preparation of any supplemental documents, will be pursuant to CEQ's 
implementing regulations.
    (2) Opportunities for public involvement in the environmental 
assessment process will be announced in the same fashion as the 
availability of environmental assessments and findings of no significant 
impact.
    (3) Notification of the availability of environmental assessments 
and findings of no significant impact for proposed activities will be 
published in the Federal Register, unless it is determined that the 
effects of the action are primarily of regional or local concern. Where 
the effects of the action are primarily of regional or local concern, 
notice will normally be provided through publication in a local or area 
newspaper of general circulation and/or the procedures implementing 
Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs.''
    (4) All environmental documents, comments received, and any 
underlying documents, including interagency correspondence where such 
correspondence transmits comments of Federal agencies on the 
environmental impact of proposals for which documents were prepared 
(except for privileged or confidential information (50 FR 38561)), will 
be made available to the public upon request. Materials to be made 
available will be provided without charge, to the extent practicable, or 
at a fee not more than the actual cost of reproducing copies required to 
be sent to other Federal agencies, including CEQ.


<R05>
Sec. 372.9  Processing and use of environmental documents.

    (a) Environmental assessments will be forwarded immediately upon 
completion to the decisionmaker for a determination of whether the 
proposed action may have significant effects on the quality of the human 
environment, and for the execution, as appropriate, of a finding of no 
significant impact or a notice of intent to prepare an environmental 
impact statement.
    (1) The availability of environmental assessments will be announced 
by publishing a notice consistent with the notification provisions of 
Sec. 372.8.
    (2) Comments, if any, will be transmitted, together with any 
analyses and recommendations, to the APHIS decisionmaker who may then 
take appropriate action.
    (3) Changes to environmental assessments and findings of no 
significant impact that are prompted by comments, new information, or 
any other source, will normally be announced in the same manner as the 
notice of availability (except that all commenters will be mailed copies 
of changes directly) prior to implementing the proposed action or any 
alternative.
    (b) Environmental impact statements will be processed from inception 
(publication of the notice of intent) to completion (publication of a 
final environmental impact statement or a supplement) according to the 
Council on Environmental Quality implementing regulations.
    (c) For rulemaking or adjudicatory proceedings, relevant 
environmental documents, comments, and responses will be a part of the 
administrative record.
    (d) For all APHIS activity that is subject to the NEPA process, 
relevant environmental documents, comments, and responses will accompany 
proposals through the review process.
    (e) The APHIS decisionmaker will consider the alternatives discussed 
in

[[Page 567]]

environmental documents in reaching a determination on the merits of 
proposed actions.
    (f) APHIS will implement mitigation and other conditions established 
in environmental documentation and committed to as part of the 
decisionmaking process.


<R05>
Sec. 372.10  Supplementing environmental impact statements.

    Once a decision to supplement an environmental impact statement is 
made, a notice of intent will be published. The administrative record 
will thereafter be open. The supplemental document will then be 
processed in the same fashion (exclusive of scoping) as a draft and a 
final statement (unless alternative procedures are approved by CEQ) and 
will become part of the administrative record.
