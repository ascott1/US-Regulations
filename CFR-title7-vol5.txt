                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2000), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

2 (b) and (c).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Testing is performed by the Agricultural Research Service of 
USDA as follows: In a greenhouse, the suspect plant, or test subject, is 
placed under a screen with a control plant, i.e., a known rust-
susceptible variety of Berberis, Mahoberberis, or Mahonia. Infected 
wheat stems, a primary host of black stem rust, are placed on top of the 
screen. The plants are moistened and maintained in 100% humidity, 
causing the spores to swell and fall on the plants lying under the 
screen. The plants are then observed for 7 days at 20-80% relative 
humidity. This test procedure is repeated 12 times. If in all 12 tests, 
the rust-susceptible plant shows signs of infection after 7 days and the 
test plants do not, USDA will declare the test plant variety rust-
resistant. The tests must be performed on new growth, just as the leaves 
are unfolding.

Sec. 301.38-3  Protected areas.

    (a) The Administrator may designate as a protected area in paragraph 
(c) of this section any State that has eradicated rust-susceptible 
plants of the genera Berberis, Mahoberberis, and Mahonia under the 
cooperative Federal-State eradication program. In addition, the State 
must employ personnel with responsibility for the issuance and 
withdrawal of certificates in accordance with Sec. 301.38-5, and 
maintain and enforce an inspection program under which every plant 
nursery within the State is inspected at least once each year to ensure 
that they are free of rust-susceptible plants. During the requisite 
nursery inspections, all nursery stock shall be examined to determine 
that it consists only of rust-resistant varieties of the genera 
Berberis, Mahoberberis, and Mahonia, and that the plants are true to 
type. Plants that do not meet this criteria must be destroyed.
    (b) The Administrator may designate as a protected area any county 
within a State, rather than the entire State, if areas within the State 
have eradicated rust-susceptible plants of the genera Berberis, 
Mahoberberis, and Mahonia

[[Page 14]]

under the cooperative Federal-State program, and;
    (1) The State employs personnel with responsibility for the issuance 
and withdrawal of certificates in accordance with Sec. 301.38-5;
    (2) The State is enforcing restrictions on the intrastate movement 
of the regulated articles that are equivalent to those imposed by this 
subpart on the interstate movement of regulated articles, as determined 
by the Administrator; and
    (3) The State maintains and enforces an inspection program under 
which every plant nursery within the county is inspected at least once 
each year to ensure that plant nurseries within that area are free of 
rust-susceptible plants of the genera Berberis, Mahoberberis, and 
Mahonia. During the requisite nursery inspections, all nursery stock 
shall be examined to determine that it consists only of rust-resistant 
varieties of the genera Berberis, Mahoberberis, and Mahonia, and that 
the plants are true to type. Plants that do not meet this criteria must 
be destroyed.
    (c) All seed used to propagate plants of the genera Berberis, 
Mahoberberis, and Mahonia in protected areas, and all seed used to 
propagate plants of the genera Berberis, Mahoberberis, and Mahonia that 
are certified as rust-resistant for interstate movement into protected 
areas, must be produced at properties where a State inspector has 
verified that no wild or domesticated rust-susceptible plants are 
growing at or within one-half mile of the property.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Persons performing the inspections must be able to recognize 
rust-susceptible varieties of Berberis, Mahoberberis, and Mahonia. 
Inspectors must work side by side, 10 to 20 feet apart, and walk outward 
away from the property a distance of one-half mile measured from the 
edge of the property, and observe all plants growing in the half-mile 
band. The distance between the inspectors may vary within this range, 
depending upon the visibility of the plant growth. In areas with low 
brush and flat terrain, the inspectors may be the maximum distance of 20 
feet apart if they can observe all plants growing within 10 feet of 
them. In areas of high plant growth or hilly terrain, the inspectors 
must be closer together due to limited or obstructed visibility. 
Inspectors must observe all plants growing between themselves and the 
mid-point of the distance between themselves and the next inspector. 
This process must be repeated so that the entire band, measured from the 
border of the property to the circumference of an imaginary circle 
having the property as its mid-point, is visually inspected in this 
manner.

    (a) Non-protected areas. (1) Interstate movement of regulated 
articles into or through any State or area that is not designated a 
protected area under Sec. 301.38-3(c) is allowed without restriction 
under this subpart.

[[Page 15]]

    (b) Protected areas--(1) Prohibited movement. The following 
regulated articles are prohibited from moving interstate into or through 
any protected area:
    (i) All Berberis seedlings and plants of less than 2 years' growth, 
and rust-susceptible Berberis plants, seeds, fruits, and other plant 
parts capable of propagation.
    (ii) Rust-susceptible Mahoberberis and Mahonia plants, seedlings, 
seeds, fruits, and other plant parts capable of propagation.
    (2) Restricted movement: The following regulated articles may be 
moved interstate into or through a protected area with a certificate 
issued and attached in accordance with Secs. 301.38-5 and 301.38-7 of 
this subpart:
    (i) Plants of at least two years' growth, seeds, fruits, and other 
plant parts capable of propagation of the genus Berberis that are 
designated as rust-resistant in Sec. 301.38-2(b) of this subpart;
    (ii) Plants, seedlings, seeds, fruits, and other plant parts capable 
of propagation of the genera Mahoberberis and Mahonia that are 
designated as rust-resistant in Sec. 301.38-2(c) of this subpart.

article not eligible for certification under Sec. 301.38-4(b)(2) to move 
interstate into or through a protected area to a specified destination 
that is stated in the permit and is outside the protected area, if the 
requirements of all other applicable Federal domestic plant quarantines 
are met. A regulated article moved interstate under a limited permit 
must be placed in a closed sealed container that prevents unauthorized 
removal of the regulated article, and that remains sealed until the 
regulated article reaches the final destination stated in the permit. At 
the final destination, the sealed container must be opened only in the 
presence of an inspector or with the authorization of an inspector 
obtained expressly for that shipment.
    (d) The United States Department of Agriculture may move any 
regulated article interstate into or through a protected area in

under paragraph (c) of this section, who desires to move interstate a 
regulated article that must be accompanied by a certificate under 
Sec. 301.38-4(b), shall, as far in advance of the desired interstate 
movement as possible (and no less than 48 hours before the desired 
interstate movement), request an inspector \5\ to issue a certificate. 
To expedite the issuance of a certificate, an inspector may direct that 
the regulated articles be assembled in a manner that facilitates 
inspection.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Services of an inspector may be requested by contacting a local 
APHIS office (listed in telephone directories under Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine). The

moved interstate in accordance with Sec. 301.38-4; and
    (2) Determines that the regulated article may be moved interstate in 
accordance with all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and 
regulations applicable to the regulated article.
    (c) Certificates for interstate movement of regulated articles may 
be issued by an inspector to a person operating under a compliance 
agreement for use with subsequent shipments of regulated articles to 
facilitate their movement. A person operating under a compliance 
agreement must make the determinations set forth in paragraph (b) of 
this section before shipping any regulated articles.

[[Page 16]]

    (d) Any certificate that has been issued may be withdrawn by an 
inspector, orally or in writing, if he or she determines that the holder 
of the certificate has not complied with the conditions of this subpart 
for the use of the certificate. If the withdrawal is oral, the inspector 
will confirm the withdrawal and the reasons for the withdrawal, in 
writing, within 20 days of oral notification of the withdrawal. Any 
person whose certificate has been withdrawn may appeal the decision, in 
writing within 10 days after receiving written notification of the 
withdrawal. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons upon 
which the person relies to show that the certificate was wrongfully 
withdrawn. A hearing will be held to resolve any conflict as to any 
material fact. An appeal shall be granted or denied, in writing, as 
promptly as circumstances allow, and the reasons for the decision shall 
be stated. In a non-protected area, appeal shall be made to the 
Administrator. The Administrator shall adopt rules of practice for the 
hearing. The certificate will remain withdrawn pending decision of the

Sec. 301.45-2  Authorization to designate and terminate designation of generally infested areas.

    (a) Generally infested areas. The Administrator shall list as 
generally infested areas in Sec. 301.45-3 each State or each portion 
thereof in which a gypsy moth general infestation has been found by an 
inspector, or each portion of a State which the Administrator deems 
necessary to regulate because of its proximity to infestation or its 
inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from infested 
localities; Except that, an area shall not be listed as a generally 
infested area if the Administrator has determined that:
    (1) The area is subject to a gypsy moth eradication program 
conducted by the Federal government or a State government in accordance 
with the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) alternative of the Final 
Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) on Gypsy Moth Suppression and 
Eradication Projects that was filed with the United States Environmental 
Protection Agency on March 18, 1985; and
    (2) State or Federal delimiting trapping surveys conducted in 
accordance with Section II, ``Survey Procedures--Gypsy Moth'' of the 
Gypsy Moth Treatment Manual show that the average number of gypsy moths 
caught per trap is less than 10 and that the trapping surveys show that 
the eradication program is effectively diminishing the gypsy moth 
population of the area.
    (b) Less than an entire State will be designated as a generally 
infested area only if the Administrator has determined that:
    (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine or 
regulation which imposes restrictions on the intrastate movement of the 
regulated articles which are substantially the same as those which are 
imposed with respect to the interstate movement of such articles under 
this subpart; and,
    (2) The designation of less than the entire State as a generally 
infested area will be adequate to prevent the artificial interstate 
spread of infestations of the gypsy moth.
    (c) Temporary designation of areas as generally infested areas. The 
Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any area in any 
State as a generally infested area in accordance with the criteria 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section. An inspector will give 
written notice of the designation to the owner or person in possession 
of the area and thereafter, the interstate movement of any regulated 
article from such areas is subject to the applicable provisions of this 
subpart. As soon as practicable, each generally infested area will be 
added to the list in Sec. 301.45-3 or the designation will be terminated 
by the Administrator or an authorized inspector, and notice thereof 
shall be given to the owner or person in possession of the areas.
    (d) Termination of designation as a generally infested area. The 
Administrator shall terminate the designation of any area as a generally 
infested area whenever the Administrator determines that the area no 
longer requires

Sec. 301.45-4  Conditions governing the interstate movement of regulated articles and outdoor household articles from generally infested areas.

    (a) Regulated articles and outdoor household articles from generally 
infested areas. (1) A regulated article, except for an article moved in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, shall not be moved 
interstate from any generally infested area into or through any area 
that is not generally infested unless a certificate or permit has been 
issued and attached to such regulated article in accordance with 
Secs. 301.45-5 and 301.45-8.<SUP>4</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Requirements under all other applicable Federal domestic plant 
quarantines must also be met.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) An outdoor household article shall not be moved interstate from 
any generally infested area into or through any area that is not 
generally infested unless a certificate or OHA document has been issued 
and attached to such outdoor household article in accordance with 
Secs. 301.45-5 and 301.45-8.
    (b) A regulated article originating outside of any generally 
infested area may be moved interstate directly through any generally 
infested area without a certificate or permit if the point of origin of 
the article is clearly indicated by shipping documents, its identity has 
been maintained, and it has been safeguarded against infestation while 
in any generally infested area during the months of April through June. 
To be safeguarded, the article must be in an enclosed vehicle, or 
completely enclosed by a covering adequate to prevent access by gypsy 
moths, such as canvas, plastic, or closely woven cloth.
    (c) A regulated article originating in a generally infested area may 
be moved interstate from a generally infested area without a certificate 
if it complies with (1) or (2) of this paragraph:
    (1) The article is moved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for 
experimental or scientific purposes, and:
    (i) Is moved pursuant to a permit issued for each article by the 
Administrator;
    (ii) Is moved in accordance with conditions specified on the permit 
and found by the Administrator to be adequate to prevent the 
dissemination of the gypsy moth, i.e., conditions of treatment, 
processing, shipment, and disposal; and
    (iii) Is moved with a tag or label securely attached to the outside 
of the container containing the article or securely attached to the 
article itself if not in a container, and with such tag or label bearing 
a permit number corresponding to the number of the permit issued for 
such article.
    (2) The article is logs, pulpwood, or wood chips, and the person 
moving the article has attached a signed accurate statement to the 
waybill or other shipping documents accompanying the article stating 
that he or she has inspected the article in accordance with the Gypsy 
Moth Program Manual no more than 5 days prior to the date of movement 
and has found no life stages of gypsy moth on the article.


<R05>
Sec. 301.45-5  Issuance and cancellation of certificates, limited permits, and outdoor household article documents.

    (a) A certificate may be issued by an inspector for the movement of 
a regulated article or an outdoor household article (OHA) if the 
inspector determines that it is eligible for certification for movement 
to any destination under all Federal domestic plant quarantines 
applicable to such article and:
    (1) It has originated in noninfested premises in a generally 
infested area and has not been exposed to the gypsy

[[Page 25]]

moth while within the generally infested area; or
    (2) The inspector inspects the article no more than 5 days prior to 
the date of movement during the months of April through August (14 days 
prior to the date of movement from September through March) and finds it 
to be free of the gypsy moth; or
    (3) It has been treated under the direction of an inspector to 
destroy the gypsy moth in accordance with the treatment manual; or
    (4) It has been grown, produced, manufactured, stored, or handled in 
such a manner that no infestation would be transmitted thereby as 
determined by an inspector.
    (b) Limited permits may be issued by an inspector to allow 
interstate movement of any regulated article under this subpart to 
specified destinations for specified handling, utilization, processing, 
or treatment in accordance with the treatment manual, when, upon 
evaluation of all of the circumstances involved in each case, the 
Administrator determines that such movement will not result in the 
spread of the gypsy moth because life stages of the moths will be 
destroyed by such specified handling, utilization, processing or 
treatment, or the pest will not survive in areas to which shipped, and 
the requirements of all other applicable Federal domestic plant 
quarantines have been met.
    (c) Certificate and limited permit forms may be issued by an 
inspector to any person for use for subsequent shipments of regulated 
articles provided the person is operating under a compliance agreement. 
Any person operating under a compliance agreement may reproduce the 
forms as needed to attach them to regulated articles moved under a 
compliance agreement. Any person operating under a compliance agreement 
may execute and issue the certificate forms or reproduction of such 
forms, for the interstate movement of regulated articles from the 
premises of such person identified in the compliance agreement, if the 
person has treated such regulated articles as specified in the 
compliance agreement, and if the regulated articles are eligible for 
certification for movement to any destination under all applicable 
Federal domestic plant quarantines. Any person operating under a 
compliance agreement may execute and issue the limited permit forms, or 
reproductions of such forms, for the interstate movement of regulated 
articles to specified destinations when an inspector has made the 
determinations specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) A certificate may be issued by a qualified certified applicator 
for the interstate movement of any outdoor household article or mobile 
home if such qualified certified applicator determines the following:
    (1) That the article has been inspected by the qualified certified 
applicator and found to be free of any life stage of the gypsy moth; or
    (2) That the article has been treated by, or treated under the 
direct supervision of, the qualified certified applicator to destroy any 
life stage of the gypsy moth in accordance with methods and procedures 
prescribed in section III of the Gypsy Moth Program Manual.
    (e) An OHA document may be issued by the owner of an outdoor 
household article for the interstate movement of the article if such 
person has inspected the outdoor household article and has found it to 
be free of any life stage of gypsy moth.
    (f) Any certificate or permit which has been issued or authorized 
may be withdrawn by an inspector if he determines that the holder 
thereof has not complied with any condition for the use of such 
document. The reasons for the withdrawal shall be confirmed in writing 
as promptly as circumstances permit. Any person whose certificate or 
permit has been withdrawn may appeal the decision in writing to the 
Administrator within ten (10) days after receiving the written 
notification of the withdrawal. The appeal shall state all of the facts 
and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the certificate or 
permit was wrongfully withdrawn. The Administrator shall grant or deny 
the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for his decision as promptly 
as circumstances permit. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, 
a hearing shall be held to resolve such conflict. Rules of practice 
concerning

[[Page 26]]

such a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.

<R05>
Sec. 301.45-6  Compliance agreement and cancellation thereof.

    (a) Any person engaged in the business of growing, handling, or 
moving regulated articles may enter into a compliance agreement to 
facilitate the movement of such articles under this subpart. Qualified 
certified applicators must enter into compliance agreements, in 
accordance with the definition of qualified certified applicator in 
Sec. 301.45-1. A compliance agreement shall specify safeguards necessary 
to prevent spread of the gypsy moth, such as disinfestation practices or 
application of chemical materials in accordance with the treatment 
manual. Compliance agreement forms may be obtained from the 
Administrator or an inspector.
    (b) Any compliance agreement may be canceled by the inspector who is 
supervising its enforcement, orally or in writing, whenever the 
inspector finds that such person has failed to comply with the 
conditions of the agreement. If the cancellation is oral, the decision 
and the reasons therefore shall be confirmed in writing, as promptly as 
circumstances permit. Any person whose compliance agreement has been 
canceled may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within 
ten (10) days after receiving written notification of the cancellation. 
The appeal shall state all of the facts and reasons upon which the 
person relies to show that the compliance agreement was wrongfully 
canceled. The Administrator shall grant or deny the appeal, in writing, 
stating the reasons for such decision, as promptly as circumstances 
permit. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing shall 
be held to resolve such conflict. Rules of practice concerning such a 
hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.

Sec. 301.45-7  Assembly and inspection of regulated articles and outdoor household articles.

    Persons (other than those authorized to use certificates or limited 
permits, or reproductions thereof, under Sec. 301.45-5(c)) who desire to 
move interstate a regulated article which must be accompanied by a 
certificate or permit shall, at least 7 days before the desired 
movement, request an inspector to examine the article prior to movement. 
Persons who desire to move interstate an outdoor household article 
accompanied by a certificate issued in accordance with Sec. 301.45-5 
shall, at least 14 days before the desired movement, request an 
inspector to examine the article prior to movement. Persons who desire 
to move interstate an outdoor household article or a mobile home 
accompanied by a certificate issued by a qualified certified applicator 
in accordance with Sec. 301.45-5(d) shall request a qualified certified 
applicator to examine the article prior to movement. Such articles shall 
be assembled at such point and in such manner as the inspector or 
qualified certified applicator designates to facilitate inspection.


<R05>
Sec. 301.45-8  Attachment and disposition of certificates, limited permits, and outdoor household article documents.

    (a) A certificate, limited permit, or OHA document required for the 
interstate movement of a regulated article or outdoor household article 
must at all times during such movement be securely attached to the 
outside of the container containing the regulated article or outdoor 
household article, securely attached to the article itself if not in a 
container, or securely attached to the consignee's copy of the waybill 
or other shipping document: Provided, however, That the requirements of 
this section may be met by attaching the certificate, limited permit, or 
OHA document to the consignee's copy of the waybill or other shipping 
document only if the regulated article or outdoor household article is 
sufficiently described on the certificate, limited permit, OHA document 
or shipping document to identify such article.

[[Page 27]]

    (b) The certificate, limited permit, or OHA document for the 
movement of a regulated article or outdoor household article shall be 
furnished by the carrier to the consignee at the destination of the 
shipment.
    (c) Any qualified certified applicator who issues a certificate or 
OHA document shall at the time of issuance send a copy of the 
certificate or OHA document to the APHIS officer in charge for the State 
in which the document is issued.

Sec. 301.45-9  Inspection and disposal of regulated articles and pests.

    Any properly identified inspector is authorized to stop and inspect, 
and to seize, destroy, or otherwise dispose of, or require disposal of 
regulated articles, outdoor household articles, and gypsy moths as 
provided in section 10 of the Plant Quarantine Act (7 U.S.C. 164a) and 
section 105 of the Federal Plant Pest Act (7 U.S.C. 150dd).


<R05>
Sec. 301.45-10  Movement of live gypsy moths.

    Regulations requiring a permit for, and otherwise governing the

<R05>
Sec. 301.45-11  Costs and charges.

    The services of the inspector shall be furnished without cost. The

of the inspector.


<R05>
Sec. 301.45-12  Disqualification of qualified certified applicator to issue certificates.

    (a) Any qualified certified applicator may be disqualified from 
issuing certificates by the Administrator if he determines that one of 
the following has occurred:
    (1) Such person is not certified by a State and/or Federal 
Government as a commercial certified applicator under the Federal 
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (86 Stat. 983; 7 
U.S.C. 136b) in a category allowing use of the restricted pesticides 
Spray N Kill (EPA Registration No. 8730-30), Ficam W (EPA Registration 
No. 45639-1), and acephate (Orthene<SUP></SUP>); or

recertified as a certified commercial applicator under FIFRA, a workshop 
approved by the Administrator on the identification and treatment of 
life stages of gypsy moth on outdoor household articles and mobile 
homes.
    (b) The disqualification is effective upon oral or written 
notification, whichever is earlier. The reasons for the disqualification 
shall be confirmed in writing as promptly as circumstances permit, 
unless contained in the written notification. Any qualified certified 
applicator who is disqualified from issuing certificates may appeal the 
decision in writing to the Administrator within ten (10) days after 
receiving written notification of the disqualification. The appeal shall 
state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show 
that the disqualification was a wrongful action. The Administrator shall 
grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for his 
decision as promptly as circumstances permit. If there is a conflict as 
to any material fact, a hearing shall be held to resolve such conflict. 
Rules of practice concerning such a hearing will be adopted by the 
Administrator.

Sec. 301.48-2  Authorization to designate, and terminate designation of, regulated airports.

    (a) An inspector may declare any airport within a quarantined State 
to be a regulated airport when he or she determines that adult 
populations of Japanese beetle exist during daylight hours at the 
airport to the degree that aircraft constitute a threat to spread the 
Japanese beetle and aircraft destined for the States listed in 
Sec. 301.48(b) may be leaving the airport.
    (b) An inspector shall terminate the designation provided for under 
paragraph (a) of this section when he or she determines that adult

<R05>
Sec. 301.48-4  Conditions governing the interstate movement of regulated articles from quarantined States.

    A regulated article may be moved interstate from a regulated airport 
to any State <SUP>1</SUP> designated in Sec. 301.48(b) only if:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Requirements under all other applicable Federal domestic plant 
quarantines must be met.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (a) An inspector, upon visual inspection of the airport and/or the 
aircraft, determines that the regulated article does not present a 
threat to spread the Japanese beetle because adult beetle populations 
are not present; or
    (b) The aircraft is opened and loaded only while it is enclosed 
inside a hangar that an inspector has determined to be free of and 
safeguarded against Japanese beetle; or
    (c) The aircraft is loaded during the hours of 8:00 p.m. to 7:00 
a.m. only or lands and departs during those hours and, in either 
situation, is kept completely closed while on the ground during the 
hours of 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.; or
    (d) If opened and loaded between the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 
p.m., the aircraft is inspected, treated, and safeguarded. Inspection, 
treatment, and safeguarding must be done either under a compliance 
agreement in accordance with Sec. 301.48-8 or under the direct 
supervision of an inspector. On a case-by-case basis, inspectors will 
determine which of the following conditions, and any supplemental 
conditions deemed necessary by the Administrator to prevent the spread 
of Japanese beetle, are required:
    (1) All openings of the aircraft must be closed or safeguarded 
during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. by exclusionary devices or by 
other means approved by the Administrator.
    (2) All cargo containers that have not been safeguarded in a 
protected area must be inspected immediately prior to and during the 
loading process. All personnel must check their clothing immediately 
prior to entering the aircraft. All Japanese beetles found must be 
removed and destroyed.
    (3) All areas around doors and hatches or other openings in the 
aircraft must be inspected prior to removing the exclusionary devices. 
All Japanese beetles found must be removed and destroyed. All doors and 
hatches must be closed immediately after the exclusionary devices are 
moved away from the aircraft.
    (4) Aircraft must be treated in accordance with the Treatment Manual 
no more than 1 hour before loading. Particular attention should be paid 
to the ball mat area and the holes around the main entrance. The 
aircraft must then be aerated under safeguard conditions as required by 
the Treatment Manual.
    (5) Aircraft treatment records must be maintained by the applicator 
completing or supervising the treatment for a period of 2 years. These 
records must be provided upon request for review by an inspector. 
Treatment records shall include the pesticide used, the date of 
application, the location where the pesticide was applied (airport and 
aircraft), the amount of pesticide applied, and the name of the 
applicator.
    (6) When a designated aircraft is replaced with an alternate one 
just prior

[[Page 30]]

to departure (the procedure known as ``tail swapping''), the alternate 
aircraft must be inspected and all Japanese beetles must be removed. The 
aircraft must be safeguarded by closing all openings and hatches or by 
equipping the aircraft with exclusionary devices until the aircraft is 
ready for use. During loading, all treatment and safeguard requirements 
applicable to regularly scheduled aircraft must be implemented.
    (7) Aircraft may be retreated in the noninfested State if live 
Japanese beetles are found.
    (8) Notification of unscheduled commercial flights and of all 
military flights must be given at least 1 hour before departure to the 
appropriate person in the destination airport of any of the States 
listed in Sec. 301.48(b). Notification of arriving military flights 
should also be given to base commanders to facilitate the entrance of 
Federal and/or State inspectors onto the base if necessary.

Sec. 301.48-7  Nonliability of the Department.

    The U.S. Department of Agriculture disclaims liability for any costs 
incident to inspections or compliance with the provisions of the 
quarantine and regulations in this subpart other than for the services 
of the inspector.


<R05>
Sec. 301.48-8  Compliance agreements and cancellation.

    (a) Any person engaged in the business of moving regulated articles 
may enter into a compliance agreement to facilitate the movement of such 
articles under this subpart. Any person who enters into a compliance 
agreement, and employees or agents of that person, must allow an 
inspector access to all records regarding treatment of aircraft and to 
all areas where loading, unloading, and treatment of aircraft occurs.
    (b) A compliance agreement may be canceled by an inspector, orally 
or in writing, whenever he or she determines that the person who has 
entered into the compliance agreement has failed to comply with the 
agreement or this subpart. If the cancellation is oral, the cancellation 
and the reasons for the cancellation will be confirmed in writing within 
20 days of oral notification. Any person whose compliance agreement has 
been canceled may appeal the decision, in writing, to the Administrator 
within 10 days after receiving written notification of the cancellation. 
The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person 
relies to show that the compliance agreement was wrongfully canceled. A 
hearing will be held to resolve any conflict as to any material fact. 
The Administrator shall adopt rules of practice for the hearing. An 
appeal shall be granted or denied, in writing, as promptly as 
circumstances allow, and the reasons for the decision shall be stated. 
The compliance agreement will remain canceled pending the decision on 
the appeal.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, 
the Administrator will list as a quarantined area, in paragraph (c) of 
this section, each State, or each portion of a State, in which the pine 
shoot beetle has been found by an inspector, in which the Administrator

    (2) The designation of less than the entire State as a regulated 
area will otherwise be adequate to prevent the artificial interstate 
spread of the pine shoot beetle.
    (b) The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any 
nonquarantined area in a State as a quarantined area in accordance with 
the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The 
Administrator will give a copy of this regulation along with a written 
notice of this temporary designation to the owner or person in 
possession of the nonquarantined area; thereafter, the interstate 
movement of any regulated article from an area temporarily designated as 
a quarantined area is subject to this subpart. As soon as practicable, 
this area will be added to the list in paragraph (c) of this section, or 
the designation will be terminated by the Administrator or an inspector. 
The owner or person in possession of an area for which designation is 
terminated will be given notice of the termination as soon as 
practicable.
    (c) The areas described below are designated as quarantined areas:

Sec. 301.50-5  Issuance and cancellation of certificates and limited permits.

    (a) A certificate will be issued by an inspector \3\ for the 
interstate movement of a regulated article if the inspector determines 
that:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Services of an inspector may be requested by contacting the 
local offices of Plant Protection and Quarantine, which are listed in 
telephone directories. The addresses and telephone numbers of local 
offices may also be obtained from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Domestic and Emergency 
Operations, 4700 River Road Unit 134, Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1236.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1)(i) The regulated article has been treated under the direction of 
an inspector in accordance with Sec. 301.50-10 of this subpart; or
    (ii) Based on inspection of the premises of origin, if the regulated 
article is a greenhouse-grown pine (such as bonsai), that the greenhouse 
is free from the pine shoot beetle and is screened to prevent entry of 
the pine shoot beetle; or
    (iii) Based on inspection of the regulated article, if the regulated 
article is a pine seedling or a pine transplant and is no greater than 
36 inches high with a bole diameter at soil level of 1 inch or less, 
that it is free from the pine shoot beetle; or
    (iv) Based on inspection by an inspector (branch tip-by-branch tip) 
of pine nursery stock, that it is free from the pine shoot beetle; or
    (v) If the regulated article is a pine log with bark attached or 
pine lumber with bark attached or a pine stump, that its source tree has 
been felled during the period of July through October; and
    (2)(i) The regulated article will be moved through the quarantined 
area during October, November, or December, or when the ambient air 
temperature is below 10  deg.C (50  deg.F); or
    (ii) The regulated article will be moved through the quarantined 
area during the period of January through September, if the ambient air 
temperature is 10  deg.C (50  deg.F) or higher, in an enclosed vehicle 
or completely enclosed by a covering adequate to prevent access by the 
pine shoot beetle; or
    (iii) The pine log with bark attached, pine lumber with bark 
attached, or

[[Page 36]]

pine stump, from a tree felled during the period of July through 
October, will be shipped interstate from the quarantined area during the 
period of July through October; and
    (3) The regulated article is to be moved in compliance with any 
additional emergency conditions the Administrator may impose, under 
section 105 of the Federal Plant Pest Act (7 U.S.C. 150dd),\4\ to 
prevent the spread of the pine shoot beetle; and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Section 105 of the Federal Plant Pest Act (7 U.S.C. 150dd) 
provides that the Secretary of Agriculture may--under certain 
conditions--seize, quarantine, treat, destroy, or apply other remedial 
measures to articles that the Administrator has reason to believe are 
infested, infected by, or contain plant pests.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (4) The regulated article is eligible for unrestricted movement 
under all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations 
applicable to the regulated articles.
    (b) An inspector \5\ will issue a limited permit for the interstate 
movement of a regulated article if the inspector determines that:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See footnote 3 to Sec. 301.50-5(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1)(i) The regulated article is to be moved interstate to a 
specified destination for specified handling, processing, or utilization 
(the destination and other conditions to be listed in the limited 
permit), and this interstate movement will not result in the spread of 
the pine shoot beetle. If the regulated article is part of a shipment of 
pine Christmas trees, the inspector will make a pest-risk determination 
on the basis of an inspection conducted in accordance with Sec. 301.50-
5(c) of this paragraph; or
    (ii) The regulated article is to be moved interstate from a 
quarantined area to a quarantined area and will transit any non-
quarantined area in an enclosed vehicle or completely enclosed by a 
covering adequate to prevent access by the pine shoot beetle; and
    (2) The regulated article is to be moved in compliance with any 
additional emergency conditions the Administrator may impose, under 
section 105 of the Federal Plant Pest Act (7 U.S.C. 150dd), to prevent 
the spread of the pine shoot beetle; and
    (3) The regulated article is eligible for interstate movement under 
all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable 
to the regulated article.
    (c) The number of pine Christmas trees randomly selected for 
inspection is determined by the size and type of shipment, in accordance 
with the following tables. If a shipment mixes painted and natural 
trees, the inspection procedure for painted trees will apply.

    (d) Certificates and limited permits for use for interstate movement 
of regulated articles may be issued by an inspector or person operating 
under a compliance agreement. A person operating under a compliance 
agreement may issue a certificate for the interstate movement of a 
regulated article if an inspector has determined that the regulated 
article is otherwise eligible for a certificate in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section. A person

[[Page 37]]

operating under a compliance agreement may issue a limited permit for 
interstate movement of a regulated article when an inspector has 
determined that the regulated article is eligible for a limited permit 
in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (e) Any certificate or limited permit that has been issued may be 
withdrawn by an inspector orally, or in writing, if he or she determines 
that the holder of the certificate or limited permit has not complied 
with all conditions under this subpart for the use of the certificate or 
limited permit. If the withdrawal is oral, the withdrawal and the 
reasons for the withdrawal shall be confirmed in writing as promptly as 
circumstances allow. Any person whose certificate or limited permit has 
been withdrawn may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator 
within 10 days after receiving the written notification of the 
withdrawal. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons upon 
which the person relies to show that the certificate or limited permit 
was wrongfully withdrawn. As promptly as circumstances allow, the 
Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the 
reasons for the decision. A hearing will be held to resolve any conflict 
as to any material fact. Rules of practice concerning such a hearing 
will be adopted by the Administrator.

Sec. 301.51-3  Quarantined areas.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, 
the Administrator will list as a quarantined area in paragraph (c) of 
this section, each State or each portion of a State in which the Asian 
longhorned beetle has been found by an inspector, in which the 
Administrator has reason to believe that the Asian longhorned beetle is 
present, or that the Administrator considers necessary to regulate 
because of its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from 
localities where Asian longhorned beetle has been found. Less than an 
entire State will be designated as a quarantined area only if the 
Administrator determines that:
    (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the 
intrastate movement of regulated articles that are equivalent to those 
imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of regulated 
articles; and
    (2) The designation of less than an entire State as a quarantined 
area will be adequate to prevent the artificial interstate spread of the 
Asian longhorned beetle.
    (b) The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any 
nonquarantined area as a quarantined area in accordance with the 
criteria

[[Page 40]]

specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The Administrator will give 
written notice of this designation to the owner or person in possession 
of the nonquarantined area, or, in the case of publicly owned land, to 
the person responsible for the management of the nonquarantined area. 
Thereafter, the interstate movement of any regulated article from an 
area temporarily designated as a quarantined area is subject to this 
subpart. As soon as practicable, this area either will be added to the 
list of designated quarantined areas in paragraph (c) of this section, 
or the Administrator will terminate the designation. The owner or person 
in possession of, or, in the case of publicly owned land, the person 
responsible for the management of, an area for which the designation is 
terminated will be given written notice of the termination as soon as 
practicable.
    (c) The following areas are designated as quarantined areas:

Sec. 301.51-4  Conditions governing the interstate movement of regulated articles from quarantined areas.

    (a) Any regulated article may be moved interstate from a quarantined 
area only if moved under the following conditions:
    (1) With a certificate or limited permit issued and attached in 
accordance with Secs. 301.51-5 and 301.51-8;
    (2) Without a certificate or limited permit if:
    (i) The regulated article is moved by the United States Department 
of Agriculture for experimental or scientific purposes; or
    (ii) The regulated article originates outside the quarantined area 
and is moved interstate through the quarantined area under the following 
conditions:
    (A) The points of origin and destination are indicated on a waybill 
accompanying the regulated article; and
    (B) The regulated article is moved through the quarantined area 
without stopping, or has been stored, packed, or handled at locations 
approved by an inspector as not posing a risk of infestation by Asian 
longhorned beetle; and
    (C) The article has not been combined or commingled with other 
articles so as to lose its individual identity.
    (b) When an inspector has probable cause to believe a person or 
means of conveyance is moving a regulated article interstate, the 
inspector is authorized to stop the person or means of conveyance to 
determine whether a regulated article is present and to inspect the 
regulated article. Articles found to be infected by an inspector, and 
articles not in compliance with the regulations in this subpart, may be 
seized, quarantined, treated, subjected to other remedial measures, 
destroyed, or otherwise disposed of.


<R05>
Sec. 301.51-5   Issuance and cancellation of certificates and limited permits.

    (a) An inspector <SUP>1</SUP> or person operating under a compliance 
agreement will issue a certificate for the interstate movement of a 
regulated article if he or she determines that the regulated article:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Inspectors are assigned to local offices of APHIS, which are 
listed in local telephone directories. Information concerning such local 
offices may also be obtained from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Domestic and Emergency 
Operations, 4700 River Road Unit 134, Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1236.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1)(i) Is apparently free of Asian longhorned beetle in any stage of 
development, based on inspection of the regulated article; or
    (ii) Has been grown, produced, manufactured, stored, or handled in 
such a manner that, in the judgment of the inspector, the regulated 
article does not present a risk of spreading Asian longhorned beetle; 
and
    (2) Is to be moved in compliance with any additional emergency 
conditions that the Administrator may impose under section 105 of the 
Federal Plant Pest Act (7 U.S.C. 150dd) <SUP>2</SUP> in order to

[[Page 42]]

prevent the artificial spread of Asian longhorned beetle; and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Section 105 of the Federal Plant Pest Act (7 U.S.C. 150dd) 
provides that the Secretary of Agriculture may--under certain 
conditions--seize, quarantine, treat, destroy, or apply other remedial 
measures to articles that the Administrator has reason to believe are 
infested by, infected by, or contain plant pests.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Is eligible for unrestricted movement under all other Federal 
domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to the regulated 
articles.
    (b) An inspector or a person operating under a compliance agreement 
will issue a limited permit for the interstate movement of a regulated 
article not eligible for a certificate if he or she determines that the 
regulated article:
    (1) Is to be moved interstate to a specified destination for 
specific processing, handling, or utilization (the destination and other 
conditions to be listed on the limited permit), and this interstate 
movement will not result in the spread of Asian longhorned beetle 
because Asian longhorned beetle will be destroyed by the specific 
processing, handling, or utilization; and
    (2) Is to be moved in compliance with any additional emergency 
conditions that the Administrator may impose under section 105 of the 
Federal Plant Pest Act (7 U.S.C. 150dd) in order to prevent the spread 
of Asian longhorned beetle; and
    (3) Is eligible for unrestricted movement under all other Federal 
domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to the regulated 
article.
    (c) An inspector shall issue blank certificates and limited permits 
to a person operating under a compliance agreement in accordance with 
Sec. 301.51-6 or authorize reproduction of the certificates or limited 
permits on shipping containers, or both, as requested by the person 
operating under the compliance agreement. These certificates and limited 
permits may then be completed and used, as needed, for the interstate 
movement of regulated articles that have met all of the requirements of 
paragraph (a) or (b), respectively, of this section.
    (d) Any certificate or limited permit may be canceled orally or in 
writing by an inspector whenever the inspector determines that the 
holder of the certificate or limited permit has not complied with this 
subpart or any conditions imposed under this subpart. If the 
cancellation is oral, the cancellation will become effective 
immediately, and the cancellation and the reasons for the cancellation 
will be confirmed in writing as soon as circumstances permit. Any person 
whose certificate or limited permit has been cancelled may appeal the 
decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after receiving 
the written cancellation notice. The appeal must state all of the facts 
and reasons that the person wants the Administrator to consider in 
deciding the appeal. A hearing may be held to resolve a conflict as to 
any material fact. Rules of practice for the hearing will be adopted by 
the Administrator. As soon as practicable, the Administrator will grant 
or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision.

Sec. 301.64-10  Treatments.

    Treatments for regulated articles must be one of the following:
    (a) Apple, grapefruit, orange, pear, plum, pomegranate, quince, and 
tangerine. Cold treatment in accordance with the PPQ Treatment Manual. 
For the full identification of this standard, see Sec. 300.1 of this 
chapter, ``Materials incorporated by reference''.
    (b) Soil within the dripline of plants that are producing or that 
have produced fruits listed in Sec. 301.64-2(a). Remove host fruits from 
host plants prior to treatment. Using ground equipment, drench the soil 
under the host plants with 5 lb a.i. diazinon per acre (0.12 lb or 2 oz 
avdp per 1,000 ft \2\) mixed with 130 gal of water per acre (3 gal per 
1,000 ft \2\). Apply at 14- to 16-day intervals as needed. Repeat 
applications if infestations become established. In addition to the 
above, follow all label directions for diazinon.
    (c) Premises. A field, grove, or area that is located within the 
quarantined area but outside the infested core area, and that produces 
regulated articles, must receive regular treatments with either 
malathion or spinosad bait spray. These treatments must take place at 6-
to 10-day intervals, starting a sufficient time before harvest (but not 
less than 30 days before harvest) to allow for completion of egg and 
larvae development of the Mexican fruit fly. Determination of the time 
period must be based on the day degrees model for Mexican fruit fly. 
Once treatment has begun, it must continue through the harvest period. 
The malathion bait spray treatment must be applied by aircraft or ground 
equipment at a rate of 2.4 oz of technical grade malathion and 9.6 oz of 
protein hydrolysate per acre. The spinosad bait spray treatment must be 
applied by aircraft or ground equipment at a rate of 0.01 oz of a USDA-
approved spinosad formulation and 48 oz of protein hydrolysate per acre. 
For ground applications, the mixture may be diluted with water to 
improve coverage.
    (d) Grapefruit and oranges. Methyl bromide in accordance with the 
PPQ Treatment Manual.
    (e) Grapefruit, oranges, and tangerines. High-temperature forced air 
in accordance with the PPQ Treatment Manual.
    (f) Citrons, litchis, longans, persimmons, and white zapotes. Cold 
treatment in accordance with the PPQ Treatment Manual (for full 
identification of this standard, see Sec. 300.1 of this chapter, 
``Materials incorporated by reference'') and in accordance with the 
following schedule:

Identification of exposed plants at high risk for developing citrus 
canker will be based on an evaluation of all of the circumstances 
related to their exposure, including, but not limited to, the following:
    (i) The stage of maturity of the exposed plant at the time of 
exposure, the size and degree of infestation to which the plants were 
exposed.
    (ii) The proximity of exposed plants to infected plants or 
contaminated articles at the time of exposure, and
    (iii) The length of time the plants were exposed.
    (3) No more than 30 days before the beginning of harvest, an 
inspector walked through the grove, inspected every tree, and found the 
grove free of citrus canker, and, in groves producing limes, an 
inspector walked through the grove every 120 days or less thereafter for 
as long as harvest continued, inspected every lime tree on each walk-
through, and continued to find the grove free of citrus canker.

localities in which the Mediterranean fruit fly has been found. Less 
than an entire State will be designated as a quarantined area only if 
the Administrator determines that:
    (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the 
intrastate movement of the regulated articles that are equivalent to 
those imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of regulated 
articles; and
    (2) The designation of less than the entire State as a quarantined 
area will prevent the interstate spread of the Mediterranean fruit fly.

possession of the nonquarantined area; thereafter,

[[Page 65]]

the interstate movement of any regulated article from an area 
temporarily designated as a quarantined area is subject to this subpart. 
As soon as practicable, this area will be added to the list in paragraph 
(c) of this section or the designation shall be terminated by the 
Administrator or an inspector. The owner or person in possession of an 
area for which designation is terminated will be given notice of the 
termination as soon as practicable.
    (c) There are no areas in the continental United States quarantined

accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, is approved as a 
treatment for any berry, fruit, nut, or vegetable listed as a regulated 
article in Sec. 301.78-2(a) of this subpart.
    (1) Approved facility. The irradiation treatment facility and 
treatment protocol must be approved by the Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service. In order to be approved, a facility must:
    (i) Be capable of administering a minimum absorbed ionizing 
radiation dose of 225 Gray (22.5 krad) to the fruits and vegetables; 
<SUP>8</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ The maximum absorbed ionizing radiation dose and the irradiation 
of food is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration under 21 CFR 
part 179.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) Be constructed so as to provide physically separate locations 
for treated and untreated fruits and vegetables, except that fruits and 
vegetables traveling by conveyor directly into the irradiation chamber 
may pass through an area that would otherwise be separated. The 
locations must be separated by a permanent physical barrier such as a 
wall or chain link fence 6 or more feet high to prevent transfer of 
cartons;
    (iii) Complete a compliance agreement with the Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service as provided in Sec. 301.78-6 of this subpart; 
and
    (iv) Be certified by Plant Protection and Quarantine for initial use 
and annually for subsequent use. Recertification is required in the 
event that an increase or decrease in radioisotope or a major 
modification to equipment that affects the delivered dose. 
Recertification may be required in cases where a significant variance in 
dose delivery is indicated.
    (2) Treatment monitoring. Treatment must be carried out under the 
monitoring of an inspector. This monitoring must include inspection of 
treatment records and unannounced inspection visits to the facility by 
an inspector. Facilities that carry out continual irradiation operations 
must notify an inspector at least 24 hours before the

[[Page 69]]

date of operations. Facilities that carry out periodic irradiation 
operations must notify an inspector of scheduled operations at least 24 
hours before scheduled operations.<SUP>9</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ Inspectors are assigned to local offices of the Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service, which are listed in telephone directories.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Packaging. Fruits and vegetables that are treated within a 
quarantined area must be packaged in the following manner:
    (i) The cartons must have no openings that will allow the entry of 
fruit flies and must be sealed with seals that will visually indicate if 
the cartons have been opened. They may be constructed of any material 
that prevents the entry of fruit flies and prevents oviposition by fruit 
flies into the fruit in the carton.<SUP>10</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ If there is a question as to the adequacy of a carton, send a 
request for approval of the carton, together with a sample carton, to 
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and 
Quarantine, Phytosanitary Issues Management Team, 4700 River Road Unit 
140, Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1236.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) The pallet-load of cartons must be wrapped before it leaves the 
irradiation facility in one of the following ways:
    (A) With polyethylene sheet wrap;
    (B) With net wrapping; or
    (C) With strapping so that each carton on an outside row of the 
pallet load is constrained by a metal or plastic strap.
    (iii) Packaging must be labeled with treatment lot numbers, packing 
and treatment facility identification and location, and dates of packing 
and treatment.
    (4) Dosage. The fruits and vegetables must receive a minimum 
absorbed ionizing radiation dose of 225 Gray (22.5 krad).<SUP>11</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ See footnote 8.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (5) Dosimetry systems. (i) Dosimetry must demonstrate that the 
absorbed dose, including areas of minimum and maximum dose, is mapped, 
controlled, and recorded.
    (ii) Absorbed dose must be measured using a dosimeter that can 
accurately measure an absorbed dose of 225 Gray (22.5 krad).
    (iii) The number and placement of dosimeters used must be in 
accordance with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) 
standards.<SUP>12</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ Designation E 1261, ``Standard Guide for Selection and 
Calibration of Dosimetry Systems for Radiation Processing,'' American 
Society for Testing and Materials, Annual Book of ASTM Standards.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (6) Records. Records or invoices for each treated lot must be made 
available for inspection by an inspector during normal business hours (8 
a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays). An 
irradiation processor must maintain records as specified in this section 
for a period of time that exceeds the shelf life of the irradiated food 
product by 1 year, and must make these records available for inspection 
by an inspector. These records must include the lot identification, 
scheduled process, evidence of compliance with the scheduled process, 
ionizing energy source, source calibration, dosimetry, dose distribution 
in the product, and the date of irradiation.
    (7) Request for approval and inspection of facility. Persons 
requesting approval of an irradiation treatment facility and treatment 
protocol must submit the request for approval in writing to the Animal 
and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, 
Oxford Plant Protection Center, 901 Hillsboro St., Oxford, NC 27565. 
Before the Administrator determines whether an irradiation facility is 
eligible for approval, an inspector will make a personal inspection of 
the facility to determine whether it complies with the standards of 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (8) Denial and withdrawal of approval. (i) The Administrator will 
withdraw the approval of any irradiation treatment facility when the 
irradiation processor requests in writing the withdrawal of approval.
    (ii) The Administrator will deny or withdraw approval of an 
irradiation treatment facility when any provision of this section is not 
met. Before withdrawing or denying approval, the Administrator will 
inform the irradiation processor in writing of the reasons for the 
proposed action and provide the irradiation processor with an 
opportunity to respond. The Administrator

[[Page 70]]

will give the irradiation processor an opportunity for a hearing 
regarding any dispute of a material fact, in accordance with rules of 
practice that will be adopted for the proceeding. However, the 
Administrator will suspend approval pending final determination in the 
proceeding, if he or she determines that suspension is necessary to 
prevent the spread of any dangerous insect infestation. The suspension 
will be effective upon oral or written notification, whichever is 
earlier, to the irradiation processor. In the event of oral 
notification, written confirmation will be given to the irradiation 
processor within 10 days of the oral notification. The suspension will 
continue in effect pending completion of the proceeding and any judicial 
review of the proceeding.
    (9) Department not responsible for damage. This treatment is 
approved to assure quarantine security against Mediterranean fruit fly. 
From the literature available, the fruits and vegetables authorized for 
treatment under this section are believed tolerant to the treatment; 
however, the facility operator and shipper are responsible for 
determination of tolerance. The Department of Agriculture and its 
inspectors assume no responsibility for any loss or damage resulting 
from any treatment prescribed or supervised. Additionally, the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission is responsible for ensuring that irradiation 
facilities are constructed and operated in a safe manner. Further, the 
Food and Drug Administration is responsible for ensuring that irradiated 
foods are safe and wholesome for human consumption.
    (d) Premises. A field, grove, or area that is located within the 
quarantined area but outside the infested core area, and that produces 
regulated articles, must receive regular treatments with malathion bait 
spray. These treatments must take place at 6 to 10-day intervals, 
starting a sufficient time before harvest (but not less than 30 days 
before harvest) to allow for completion of egg and larvae development of 
the Mediterranean fruit fly. Determination of the time period must be 
based on day degrees. Once treatment has begun, it must continue through 
the harvest period. The malathion bait spray treatment must be applied 
at a rate of 1.2 fluid ounces of technical grade malathion (1.4 ounces 
by weight) and 10.8 fluid ounces of protein hydrolysate (13.2 ounces by 
weight) per acre, for a total of 12 fluid ounces per acre.
    (e) Soil. Soil within the drip area of plants that are producing or 
have produced the berries, fruits, nuts, and vegetables listed in 
Sec. 301.78-2(a) of this subpart: Apply diazinon at the rate of 5 pounds 
actual ingredient per acre to the soil within the drip area with 
sufficient water to wet the soil to a depth of at least \1/2\ inch. Both 
immersion and pour-on treatment procedures are also acceptable.

<R05>
Sec. 301.80-2  Authorization to designate, and terminate designation of, regulated areas and suppressive or generally infested areas; and to exempt articles 
          from certification, permit, or other requirements.

    (a) Regulated areas and suppressive or generally infested areas. The 
Deputy Administrator shall designate as regulated areas, in a 
supplemental regulation designated as Sec. 301.80-2a, each quarantined 
State, or each portion thereof in which witchweed has been found or in 
which there is reason to believe that witchweed is present or which it 
is deemed necessary to regulate because of its proximity to infestation 
or its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from infested 
localities. The Deputy Administrator, in the supplemental regulation, 
may designate any regulated area or portion thereof, as a suppressive 
area or a generally infested area in accordance with the definitions 
thereof in

[[Page 73]]

Sec. 301.80-1. Less than an entire quarantined State will be designated 
as a regulated area only if the Deputy Administrator is of the opinion 
that:
    (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine or 
regulation which imposes restrictions on the intrastate movement of the 
regulated articles which are substantially the same as those which are 
imposed with respect to the interstate movement of such articles under 
this subpart; and
    (2) The designation of less than the entire State as a regulated 
area will otherwise be adequate to prevent the interstate spread of 
witchweed.
    (b) Temporary designation of regulated areas and suppressive or 
generally infested areas. The Deputy Administrator or an authorized 
inspector may temporarily designate any other premises in a quarantined 
State as a regulated area and may designate the regulated area or 
portions thereof as a suppressive or generally infested area, in 
accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section 
for designating such area, by serving written notice thereof on the 
owner or person in possession of such premises, and thereafter the 
interstate movement of regulated articles from such premises by any 
person having notice of the designation shall be subject to the 
applicable provisions of this subpart. As soon as practicable, such 
premises shall be added to the list in Sec. 301.80-2a if a basis then 
exists for their designation.
    (c) Termination of designation as a regulated area and a suppressive 
or generally infested area. The Deputy Administrator shall terminate the 
designation provided for under paragraph (a) of this section of any area 
designated as a regulated area or a suppressive or a generally infested 
area when he determines that such designation is no longer required 
under the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The 
Deputy Administrator or an inspector shall terminate the designation 
provided for under paragraph (b) of this section of any premises 
designated as a regulated area or a suppressive or a generally infested 
area when he determines that such designation is no longer required 
under the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section, and 
notice thereof shall be given to the owner or person in possession of 
the premises.
    (d) Exemption of articles from certification, permit, or other 
requirements. The Deputy Administrator may, in a supplemental regulation 
designated as Sec. 301.80-2b, list regulated articles or movements of 
regulated articles which shall be exempt from the certification, permit, 
or other requirements of this subpart under such conditions as he may 
prescribe, if he finds that facts exist as to the pest risk involved in 
the movement of such regulated articles which make it safe to so relieve 
such requirements.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Requirements under all other applicable Federal domestic plant 
quarantines must also be met.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (a) Any regulated articles, except soil samples for processing, 
testing, or analysis, may be moved interstate from any quarantined State 
under the following conditions:
    (1) With certificate or permit issued and attached in accordance 
with Secs. 301.80-4 and 301.80-7, if moved:
    (i) From any generally infested area or any suppressive area into or

which exempts certain articles from certificate and permit requirements; 
or

    (ii) From a generally infested area to a contiguous generally 
infested area; or

    (iii) From a suppressive area to a contiguous generally infested 
area; or

    (iv) Between contiguous suppressive areas unless the person in 
possession of the articles has been notified by an inspector that a 
hazard of spread of the witchweed exists; or

    (v) Through or reshipped from any regulated area if the articles 
originated outside of any regulated area and if the point of origin of 
the articles is clearly indicated, their identity has been maintained, 
and they have been safeguarded against infestation while in the 
regulated area in a manner satisfactory to the inspector; or

    (3) From any area outside the regulated areas, if moved:

    (i) With a certificate or permit attached; or

    (A) The regulated articles are exempt from certification and permit 
requirements under the provisions of Sec. 301.80-2b; or

    (B) The point of origin of such movement is clearly indicated on the 
articles or shipping document which accompanies the articles and if the 
movement is not made through any regulated area.

emergency situations, soil samples for processing, testing, or analysis 
may be moved interstate from any regulated area only to laboratories 
approved \4\ by the Deputy Administrator and so listed by him in a 
supplemental regulation. \5\

[[Page 77]]

A certificate or permit will not be required to be attached to such soil 
samples except in those emergency situations where the Deputy 
Administrator has authorized such movement to another destination with a 
certificate or permit issued and attached in accordance with 
Secs. 301.80-4(d) and 301.80-7. Soil samples originating in areas 
outside of the regulated areas will not require such a certificate or

<R05>
Sec. 301.80-4  Issuance and cancellation of certificates and permits.

    (a) Certificates may be issued for any regulated articles (except 
soil samples for processing, testing, or analysis) by an inspector if he 
determines that they are eligible for certification for movement to any 
destination under all Federal domestic plant quarantines applicable to 
such articles and:

    (1) Have originated in noninfested premises in a regulated area and 
have not been exposed to infestation while within the regulated areas; 
or

    (2) Have been treated to destroy infestation in accordance with the 
treatment manual; or

    (3) Have been grown, produced, manufactured, stored, or handled in 
such a manner that no infestation would be transmitted thereby.

    (b) Limited permits may be issued by an inspector to allow 
interstate movement of regulated articles (except soil samples for 
processing, testing, or analysis) not eligible for certification under 
this subpart, to specified destinations for limited handling, 
utilization, or processing, or for treatment in accordance with the 
treatment manual, when upon evaluation of the circumstances involved in 
each specific case he determines that such movement will not result in 
the spread of witchweed and requirements of other applicable Federal 
domestic plant quarantines have been met.

    (c) Restricted destination permits may be issued by an inspector to 
allow the interstate movement (for other than scientific purposes) of 
regulated articles (except soil samples for processing, testing, or 
analysis) to any destination permitted under all applicable Federal 
domestic plant quarantines if such articles are not eligible for 
certification under all such quarantines but would otherwise qualify for 
certification under this subpart.
    (d) Scientific permits to allow the interstate movement of regulated 
articles, and certificates or permits to allow the movement of soil 
samples for processing, testing, or analysis in emergency situations, 
may be issued by the Deputy Administrator under such conditions as may 
be prescribed in each specific case by the Deputy Administrator to 
prevent the spread of witchweed.
    (e) Certificate, limited permit, and restricted destination permit 
forms may be issued by an inspector to any person for use by the latter 
for subsequent shipments of regulated articles (except soil samples for 
processing, testing, or analysis) provided such person is operating 
under a compliance agreement; and any such person may be authorized by 
an inspector to reproduce such forms on shipping containers or 
otherwise. Any such person may execute and issue the certificate forms, 
or reproductions of such forms, for the interstate movement of regulated 
articles from the premises of such person identified in the compliance 
agreement if such person has treated such regulated articles to destroy 
infestation in accordance with the treatment manual, and if such 
regulated articles are eligible for certification for movement to any 
destination under all Federal domestic plant quarantines applicable to 
such articles. Any such person may execute and issue the limited permit 
forms, or reproductions of such forms, for interstate movement of 
regulated articles to specified destinations when the inspector has made 
the determinations specified in paragraph (b) of this section. Any such 
person may execute and issue the restricted destination permit forms, or 
reproductions of such forms, for the interstate movement of

[[Page 78]]

regulated articles not eligible for certification under all Federal 
domestic plant quarantines applicable to such articles, under the 
conditions specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (f) Any certificate or permit which has been issued or authorized 
may be withdrawn by the inspector or the Deputy Administrator if he 
determines that the holder thereof has not complied with any condition 
for the use of such document imposed by this subpart. As soon as 
possible after such withdrawal, the holder of the certificate or permit 
shall be notified in writing by the Deputy Administrator or an inspector 
of the reason therefor and afforded reasonable opportunity to present 
his views thereon, and if there is a conflict as to any material fact, a 
hearing shall be held to resolve such conflict.

agreement forms may be obtained from the Deputy Administrator or an 
inspector.
    (b) Any compliance agreement may be canceled by the inspector who is 
supervising its enforcement whenever he finds that such other party has 
failed to comply with the conditions of the agreement. As soon as 
possible after such cancellation, such party shall be notified in 
writing by the Deputy Administrator or an inspector of the reason 
therefor and afforded reasonable opportunity to present views thereon, 
and if there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing shall be 
held to resolve such conflict.

advance as possible, request an inspector to examine the articles prior 
to movement. Such articles shall be assembled at such points and in such 
a manner as the inspector designates to facilitate inspection.

Sec. 301.81-3  Quarantined areas.

    (a) The Administrator will quarantine each State or each portion of 
a State that is infested.
    (b) Less than an entire State will be listed as a quarantined area 
only if the Administrator determines that:
    (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the 
intrastate movement of the regulated articles listed in Sec. 301.81-2 
that are equivalent to the interstate movement restrictions imposed by 
this subpart; and
    (2) Designating less than the entire State as a quarantined area 
will prevent the spread of the imported fire ant.
    (c) The Administrator may include uninfested acreage within a 
quarantined area due to its proximity to an infestation or 
inseparability from the infested locality for quarantine purposes, as 
determined by:
    (1) Projections of spread of imported fire ant around the periphery 
of the infestation, as determined by previous years' surveys;
    (2) Availability of natural habitats and host materials, within the 
uninfested acreage, suitable for establishment and survival of imported 
fire ant populations; and
    (3) Necessity of including uninfested acreage within the quarantined 
area in order to establish readily identifiable boundaries.
    (d) The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any 
nonquarantined area as a quarantined area in accordance with the 
criteria specified in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section. The 
Administrator will give written notice of this designation to the owner 
or person in possession of the nonquarantined area, or, in the case of 
publicly owned land, to the person responsible for the management of the 
nonquarantined area; thereafter, the interstate movement of any 
regulated article from an area temporarily designated as a quarantined 
area is subject to this subpart. As soon as practicable, this area 
either will be added to the list of designated quarantined areas in 
paragraph (e) of this section, or the Administrator will terminate the 
designation. The owner or person in possession of, or, in the case of 
publicly owned land, the person responsible for the management of, an 
area for which the designation is terminated will be given written 
notice of the termination as soon as practicable.

    Certification Period: As long as kept free of noncompacted soil.
    Limitations: Regardless of the type of cleaning equipment used, all 
debris and noncompacted soil must be removed unless it is steam-heated 
by a ``steam jenny'' to disinfest the articles. Used soil-moving 
equipment, such as bulldozers, dirt pans, motor graders, and draglines, 
are difficult to clean sufficiently to eliminate pest risk.
    Precaution: Steam may remove loose paint and usually is not 
recommended for use on equipment with conveyor belts and rubber parts.

                            2. Hay and Straw

    Baled hay and straw stored in direct contact with the ground is

    d. General requirements for emulsifiable chlorpyrifos, bifenthrin, 
or tefluthrin.
    Conditions and Type of Soil: Any friable soil may be treated.

                           Method A--Immersion

                                Equipment

    1. A watertight container for mixing the treating solutions.
    2. Open-top, watertight container sufficiently large to accommodate 
the treating solution and plants.
    Procedure: Locate immersion tank in well-ventilated place. Do not 
remove burlap wrap or plastic containers with drain holes prior to 
immersion Immerse soil balls and containers, singly or in groups, so 
that soil is

[[Page 92]]

completely covered by solution. Plants must remain in solution until 
bubbling ceases. Plant balls should have space between them when grouped 
in trays, baskets, or other dipping containers. After removal from dip, 
plants may be set on drainboard until adequately drained.
    Thorough saturation of the plant balls or containers with the 
insecticide solution is essential.
    As treating progresses, freshly prepared treating mixture should be 
added to maintain liquid at immersion depth. Dispose of tank contents 8 
hours after mixing. Clean tank before recharging. Disposal must comply 
with State and local regulations.
    Precautions: Runoff of the solution from the treatment area should 
not be permitted. Excess solution (and used solution) must be disposed 
of in accordance with State and local regulations.

                            Method B--Drench

                                Equipment

    1. A large-capacity bulk mixing tank, either pressurized or gravity-
flow for mixing and holding the insecticide solution.
    2. Properly equipped hoses and watering nozzles that can be attached 
to the mixing tank and used to thoroughly saturate the plant balls with 
the insecticide solution.

                                Procedure

    1. Plants Balled with Burlap--Apply the chlorpyrifos solution as a 
substitute for plain water to the plants during the routine watering 
activities. Do not remove burlap wrap from plants prior to treatment. 
Treat plants singly or in groups with the chlorpyrifos solution to the 
point of runoff on a twice daily schedule for 3 consectutive days.
    The above treatment should be carried out in a well-ventilated place 
normally used to maintain plants prior to shipment. The treatment will 
be enhanced by adding any agricultural wetting agent such as Ortho-
77<Register>, Tronic<Register>, Tecowet<Register>, etc., to the 
chlorpyrifos solution at the labeled rate (usually \1/2\ pint per 100 
gallons of water).
    2. Containerized Plants--Apply the bifenthrin or chlorpyrifos 
solution to the point of saturation one time only. The volume of the 
treating solution must be at least \1/5\ (20%) of the volume of the 
container.
    Precautions: Thorough saturation of the plant balls or containers 
with the insecticide solution is essential. Runoff of the solution from 
the treatment area should not be permitted. Excess solution (and used 
solution) must be disposed of in accordance with State and local 
regulations.

                      Method C--Topical Application

    Apply bifenthrin according to the label instructions for topical 
application. The method may be used only with nursery stock in 3- and 4-
quart containers. Penetration of the pesticide in larger containers does 
not provide sufficient residual activity.
    Irrigate all treated containers with 1.5 inches of water following 
application.
    Precautions: Runoff of the solution from the treatment area should 
not be permitted. Excess solution (and used solution) must be disposed 
of in accordance with State and local regulations.
    Manufacture of the 10WP (wettable powder) formulation was 
discontinued in 1998; however, the EPA will allow this product to be 
utilized until supplies are exhausted.

              Method D--Granular Incorporation (Bifenthrin)

    Apply bifenthrin according to the label instructions for granular 
incorporation. Mix thoroughly to distribute product evenly throughout 
the soil or potting media. After potting, containers must be watered to 
the point of saturation.
    Precautions: Saturation of the soil or potting media with the 
granular bifenthrin is essential. Water that drains from the treatment 
area, which may contain bifenthrin, must be disposed of in accordance 
with State and local laws.

              Method E--Granular Incorporation (Tefluthrin)

    Apply tefluthrin according to the label directions for granular 
incorporation. Mix thoroughly to distribute the granular tefluthrin 
evenly throughout the soil or potting media. After potting, containers 
must be watered to the point of saturation.
    Precautions: Saturation of the soil or potting media with the 
tefluthrin is essential. Water that drains from the treatment area, 
which may contain tefluthrin, must be disposed of in accordance with 
State and local laws.

      4. Imported-Fire-Ant-Free Nursery--Containerized Plants Only

    This detection, control, exclusion, and enforcement program is 
designed to keep nurseries free of the imported fire ant and provides a 
basis to certify containerized nursery stock for interstate movement.
    Participating regulated establishments must be operating under a 
compliance agreement. Such compliance agreements shall state the 
specific requirements that a shipper agrees to follow to move plants in 
accordance with the requirements of the program. Certificates and a 
nursery identification number may be issued to the nursery for use on 
shipments of regulated articles.

                                Detection

    A successful treatment program depends upon early detection of 
imported fire ant

[[Page 93]]

colonies. Nursery owners are required to survey visually their entire 
premises twice monthly for the presence of imported fire ants.
    Nurseries participating in this program will be inspected by Federal 
or State inspectors at least twice per year. More frequent inspections 
may be necessary depending upon imported fire ant infestation levels 
immediately surrounding the nursery, the thoroughness of nursery 
management in maintaining imported-fire-ant-free premises, and the 
number of previous detections of imported fire ants in or near 
containerized plants. Inspections by Federal and State inspectors should 
be more frequent just before and during the peak shipping season. Any 
nurseries determined during nursery inspections to have imported fire 
ant colonies must be immediately treated to the extent necessary to 
eliminate the colonies.

                                 Control

    Nursery plants that are shipped under this program must originate in 
a nursery free of imported fire ant. Nursery owners must implement a 
treatment program with registered bait and contact insecticides. The 
premises, including growing and holding areas, must be maintained free 
of the imported fire ant. As part of this treatment program, all exposed 
soil surfaces (including sod and mulched areas) on property where plants 
are grown, potted, stored, handled, loaded, unloaded, or sold must be 
treated with a broadcast application of hydramethylnon 
(AMDRO<Register>), fenoxycarb (AWARD<Register>), or pyriproxyfen 
(Distance<Register>) baits at least once every six months. The first 
application is more effective when applied early in the spring. An early 
spring bait application provides control before alate queens are 
produced or have time to establish new colonies. Follow label directions 
for use.
    When properly used, baits are between 80 percent and 90 percent 
effective. Follow-up treatments with a contact insecticide must be 
applied to eliminate all remaining colonies. Mound drench treatments 
with a registered formulation of chlorpyrifos or diazinon are approved. 
Follow label directions for use.

                                Exclusion

Bifenthrin
    For plants grown on the premises: Treatment of potting media with 
granular, flowable, or wettable powder formulation of bifenthrin prior 
to planting is required. This treatment reduces the risk of infestation 
of containers by alate queens flying in from adjacent or nearby infested 
premises. The dosage rate for granular bifenthrin is variable and is 
determined by the certification period selected; for flowable bifenthrin 
it is 25 ppm; for wettable powder it is 25 ppm.
    Apply this treatment according to the label instructions.
    Mixing must be adequate to blend the required dosage of pesticide 
throughout the entire potting soil mixture.
    For plants received from outside sources: To prevent the spread into 
a nursery free of the imported fire ant by newly introduced, infested 
nursery plants, all plants must be:
    (a) Obtained from nurseries free of imported fire ant that are 
certified under a compliance agreement; or
    (b) Treated with bifenthrin drench upon delivery in accordance with 
this imported fire ant regulatory treatment manual (III.C.3.b), and 
within 180 days be either:
    (1) Repotted in treated potting soil media,
    (2) Retreated with bifenthrin drench, immersion, or topical 
application (III.C.3.b) at 180-day intervals, or
    (3) Shipped.
Tefluthrin
    For plants grown on the premises: Treatment of soil or potting media 
with granular, flowable tefluthrin prior to planting is permitted as an 
alternative to treatment with granular or wettable powder formulation of 
bifenthrin. This treatment reduces the risk of infestation of containers 
by alate queens flying in from adjacent or nearby infested premises. The 
dosage rate is variable, determined by the selected certification 
period, for the granular tefluthrin.
    Apply this treatment according to the label directions.
    Mixing must be adequate to blend the required dosage of granular 
tefluthrin throughout the entire soil or potting media.

                               Enforcement

    The nursery owner shall maintain records of the nursery's surveys 
and treatments for the imported fire ant. These records shall be made 
available to State and Federal inspectors upon request.
    If imported fire ants are detected in nursery stock during an 
inspection by a Federal or State inspector, issuance of certificates for 
movement shall be suspended until necessary treatments are applied and 
the plants and nursery premises are determined to be free of the 
imported fire ant. A Federal or State inspector may declare a nursery to 
be free of the imported fire ant upon reinspection of the premises. This 
inspection must be conducted no sooner than 30 days after treatment to 
ensure its effectiveness. During this period, certification may be based 
upon the drench or immersion treatment provided in paragraph III.C.3. of 
this manual, titled ``Plants--Balled or in Containers.''
    Upon notification by the department of agriculture in any State of 
destination that a confirmed imported fire ant infestation was

[[Page 94]]

found on a shipment from a nursery considered free of the imported fire 
ant, the department of agriculture in the State of origin shall cease 
its certification of shipments from that nursery. An investigation by 
Federal or State inspectors will commence immediately to determine the 
probable source of the problem and to ensure that the problem is 
resolved. If the problem is an infestation, issuance of certification 
for movement on the basis of imported-fire-ant-free premises will be 
suspended until treatment and elimination of the infestation is 
completed. Reinstatement into the program will be granted upon 
determination that the nursery premises are free of the imported fire 
ant, and that all other provisions of this manual are being followed.
    In cases where the issuance of certificates is suspended through 
oral notification, the suspension and the reasons for the suspension 
will be confirmed in writing within 20 days of the oral notification of 
the suspension. Any person whose issuance of certificates has been 
suspended may appeal the decision, in writing, within 10 days after 
receiving the written suspension notice. The appeal must state all of 
the facts and reasons that the person wants the Administrator to 
consider in deciding the appeal. A hearing may be held to resolve any 
conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice for the hearing will 
be adopted by the Administrator. As soon as practicable, the 
Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the 
reasons for the decision.
    Violations of the quarantine shall be investigated by Federal or 
State inspectors and appropriate penalties will be assessed to 
discourage further violations.
    This imported-fire-ant-free nursery program is not mandatory for 
movement of regulated articles. Plants, balled or in containers, may 
otherwise be certified for movement using the chlorpyrifos, bifenthrin, 
or tefluthrin treatments described in paragraph III.C.3 of this manual, 
titled ``Plants, Balled or in Containers.'' However, certification for 
movement under the imported-fire-ant-free nursery program will be 
granted only if all of the provisions of this program are followed.
    Certification Period: Continuous as long as all provisions of the 
imported-fire-ant-free nursery program are followed.

 5. Field-Grown Woody Ornamentals (In-Field Treatment Prior to Harvest)

    Material: Chlorpyrifos used in combination with fenoxycarb 
(AWARD<SUP></SUP>), hydramethylnon (AMDRO<SUP></SUP>), or pyriproxyfen 
(Distance<SUP></SUP>) fire ant bait.
    Dosage: Fenoxycarb (AWARD<SUP></SUP>), hydramethylnon 
(AMDRO<SUP></SUP>), or pyriproxyfen (Distance<SUP></SUP>) at 1.0-1.5 
lb (0.45-0.68 kg) bait/acre. Chlorpyrifos at 6.0 lb (2.7 kg) a.i./acre.
    Method: Apply fenoxycarb (AWARD<Register>), hydramethylnon 
(AMDRO<Register>), or pyriproxyfen (Distance<Register>) only when ants 
are actively foraging (follow EPA-approved label directions for use). 
Broadcast application with any type of equipment that can be calibrated 
to deliver 1.0-1.5 lb (0.45-0.68 kg) of bait per acre. Three to five 
days after the fenoxycarb (AWARD<Register>), hydramethylnon 
(AMDRO<Register>), or pyriproxyfen (Distance<Register>) application, 
apply chlorpyrifos broadcast at 6.0 lb (2.7 kg) a.i. per acre. Treatment 
area must extend at least 10 feet beyond the base of all plants that are 
to be certified.
    Exposure Period: 30 days. Plants can be certified 30 days after 
treatment.
    Certification Period: 12 weeks.
    Special Information: This in-field treatment is based on a 
sequential application of fenoxycarb (AWARD<Register>), hydramethylnon 
(AMDRO<Register>), or pyriproxyfen (Distance<Register>) followed by 
chlorpyrifos. The combination treatment is necessary since broadcast 
application of chlorpyrifos (or other short-term residual insecticides) 
usually does not eliminate large, mature IFA colonies, and no bait, 
including fenoxycarb (AWARD<Register>) or hydramethylnon 
(AMDRO<Register>), is capable of providing a residual barrier against 
reinfestation by new queens. Therefore, the fenoxycarb (AWARD<Register>) 
hydramethylnon (AMDRO<Register>), or pyriproxyfen (Distance<Register>) 
application will drastically reduce the IFA population while 
chlorpyrifos, applied approximately 5 days later, will destroy any 
remaining weakened colonies and also leave a residual barrier against 
reinfestation by new queens for at least 12 weeks.

          6. Blueberries and Other Fruit and Nut Nursery Stocks

    Certain States have special local need labeling in accordance with 
section 24(c) of FIFRA for D-z-n<Register> Diazinon AG-500 and D-z-
n<Register> Diazinon 50W, which APHIS will recognize as a regulatory 
treatment for containerized nonbearing blueberries and fruit and nut 
plants. Follow label directions for use.

                       7. Plants--Greenhouse Grown

    Greenhouse grown plants are certifiable without treatment if the 
inspector determines that the greenhouse is constructed of fiberglass, 
glass, or plastic in such a way that IFA is physically excluded and 
cannot become established within the enclosure. No other treatment of 
the plants will be necessary if they are not exposed to infestation.

                              8. Grass--Sod

                                Material

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Exposure Period: 48 hours.

                                 Method

    1. Apply a single broadcast application of chlorpyrifos with ground 
equipment.
    2. Immediately after treatment, water the treated areas with at 
least \1/2\ inch of water.
    Chlorpyrifos wettable powder Dursban<Register> 50-WP: Follow label 
directions for regulatory treatment for IFA.

                              9. Soil--Bulk

    Method: Bulk soil is eligible for movement when heated either by dry 
or steam heat after all parts of the mass have been brought to the 
required temperature.
    Temperature: 150 deg. F (65.5 deg. C).
    Certification Period: As long as protected from recontamination.

                            10. Soil Samples

    Soil samples are eligible for movement when heated or frozen as 
follows:

                                  Heat

    Method: Soil samples are heated either by dry heat or steam heat. 
All parts of the mass must be brought to the required temperature.
    Temperature: 150 deg. F (65.5 deg. C).
    Certification Period: As long as protected from recontamination.

                                  Cold

    Method: Soil samples are frozen in any commercial cold storage, 
frozen food locker, or home freezer capable of rapidly reducing to and 
maintaining required temperature. Soil samples will be placed in 
containers, such as plastic bags--one sample per bag. The containers 
will be arranged in the freezer in a manner to allow the soil samples to 
freeze in the fastest possible time. If desired, the frozen samples may 
be shipped in one carton.
    Temperature: -10 deg. to -20 deg. F (-23 deg. to -29 deg. C) for at 
least 24 hours.
    Certification Period: As long as protected from recontamination.
    D. Mitigative Measures. The following measures are required to 
minimize impact on the environment and human health. Any person 
requesting certification to authorize the movement of regulated articles 
must adhere to these measures where applicable.
    1. All applicable Federal, State, and local environmental laws and 
regulations must be followed.
    2. Safety equipment and clothing, as specified by the label 
instructions, must be used and worn during treatments and during 
inspections.
    3. Safety practices shall be communicated, and regulated 
establishment managers must require that on-the-job safety practices be 
followed.
    4. All pesticides must be applied, handled, stored, and used in 
accordance with label instructions.
    5. Empty pesticide containers must be disposed of in accordance with 
Federal and State regulations.
    6. Pesticide remaining in containers after completion of an 
application must be retained and disposed of in accordance with label 
instructions and Federal and State regulations.
    7. Oral or written warning must be provided to workers and the 
general public, indicating pesticide application areas during 
application and appropriate reentry periods.
    8. Owners/managers of regulated properties must take precautions to 
limit access by the public, livestock, and wildlife to treated areas.
    9. Accidental spill or water runoff of liquid or granular pesticides 
leading to potential contamination of ground and surface waters must be 
minimized by appropriate operating procedures. Catchment facilities 
(temporary or permanent) adequate to prevent contamination of ground and 
surface water are necessary in loading areas where liquid drenches and 
immersions are applied.
    10. An environmental monitoring plan, including monitoring 
procedures, must be implemented by APHIS. Monitoring must be conducted 
to determine if additional mitigative measures are necessary.

    Source: 37 FR 24330, Nov. 16, 1972, unless otherwise noted.

                       Quarantine and Regulations


<R05>
Sec. 301.85  Quarantine; restriction on interstate movement of specified regulated articles.

    (a) Notice of quarantine. Pursuant to the provisions of sections 8 
and 9 of the Plant Quarantine Act of August 20, 1912, as amended, and 
section 106 of the Federal Plant Pest Act (7 U.S.C. 161, 162, 150ee), 
the Secretary of Agriculture heretofore determined after public hearing 
that it was necessary to quarantine the State of New York in order to 
prevent the spread of the golden nematode (Heterodera rostochiensis), 
which causes a dangerous disease of potatoes and certain other plants, 
and not theretofore widely prevalent or distributed within and 
throughout the United States. Therefore, under the authority of said 
provisions, the Secretary hereby continues to quarantine the State of 
New York, with respect to the interstate movement from the quarantined 
State of the articles described in paragraph (b) of this section, issues 
the regulations in this subpart governing such movement, and gives 
notice of said quarantine and regulations.
    (b) Quarantine restrictions on interstate movement of specified 
regulated articles. No common carrier or other person shall move 
interstate from any quarantined State any of the following articles 
(defined in Sec. 301.85-1(q) as regulated articles), except in 
accordance with the conditions prescribed in this subpart:
    (1) Soil, compost, humus, muck, peat, and decomposed manure, 
separately or with other things.
    (2) Plants with roots, except soil-free aquatic plants.
    (3) Grass sod.
    (4) Plant crowns and roots for propagation.
    (5) True bulbs, corms, rhizomes, and tubers of ornamental plants.
    (6) Irish potatoes included within any one or more of the following 
paragraph (b)(6)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section:
    (i) Irish potatoes for seed; and
    (ii) Irish potatoes unless--
    (A) Each is at least 1\1/2\ inches in diameter based on measurement 
by a sizing screen or sizing chain, each is substantially free of soil 
as a result of grading (a method of removing soil mechanically) under a 
compliance agreement in accordance with Sec. 301.85-5(b), and they are 
moved in an approved container; or

<R05>
Sec. 301.85-2  Authorization to designate, and terminate designation of, regulated areas and suppressive or generally infested areas; and to exempt articles 
          from certification, permit, or other requirements.

    (a) Regulated areas and suppressive or generally infested areas. The 
Deputy Administrator shall list as regulated areas, in a supplemental 
regulation designated as Sec. 301.85-2a, each quarantined State; or each 
portion thereof in which golden nematode has been found or in which 
there is reason to believe that golden nematode is present, or which it 
is deemed necessary to regulate because of their proximity to 
infestation or their inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes 
from infested localities. The Deputy Administrator, in the supplemental 
regulation, may divide any regulated area into a suppressive area or a 
generally infested area in accordance with the definitions thereof in 
Sec. 301.85-1. Less than an entire quarantined State will be designated 
as a regulated area only if the Deputy Administrator is of the opinion 
that:
    (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine or 
regulation which imposes restrictions on the intrastate movement of the 
regulated articles which are substantially the same as those which are 
imposed with respect to the interstate movement of such articles under 
this subpart; and
    (2) The designation of less than the entire State as a regulated 
area will otherwise be adequate to prevent the

[[Page 99]]

interstate spread of the golden nematode.
    (b) Temporary designation of regulated areas and suppressive or 
generally infested areas. The Deputy Administrator or an authorized 
inspector may temporarily designate any other premises in a quarantined 
State as a regulated area and a suppressive or generally infested area, 
in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section for listing such area, by serving written notice thereof on the 
owner or person in possession of such premises, and thereafter the 
interstate movement of regulated articles from such premises by any 
person having notice of the designation shall be subject to the 
applicable provisions of this subpart. As soon as practicable, such 
premises shall be added to the list in Sec. 301.85-2a if a basis then 
exists for their designation; otherwise the designation shall be 
terminated by the Deputy Administrator or an authorized inspector and 
notice thereof shall be given to the owner or person in possession of 
the premises.
    (c) Termination of designation as a regulated area and a suppressive 
or generally infested area. The Deputy Administrator shall terminate the 
designation provided for under paragraph (a) of this section of any area 
listed as a regulated area and suppressive or generally infested area 
when he determines that such designation is no longer required under the 
criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) Exemption of articles from certification, permit, or other 
requirements. The Deputy Administrator may, in a supplemental regulation 
designated as Sec. 301.85-2b, list regulated articles or movements of 
regulated articles which shall be exempt from the certification, permit, 
or other requirements of this subpart under such conditions as he may 
prescribe, if he finds that facts exist as to the pest risk involved in 
the movement of such regulated articles which make it safe to so relieve 
such requirements.

Sec. 301.85-4  Issuance and cancellation of certificates and permits.

    (a) Certificates may be issued for any regulated articles (except 
soil samples for processing, testing, or analysis) by an inspector if he 
determines that they are eligible for certification for movement to any 
destination under all Federal domestic plant quarantines applicable to 
such articles and:
    (1) Have originated in noninfested premises in a regulated area and 
have not been exposed to infestation while within the regulated areas; 
or
    (2) Have been treated to destroy infestation in accordance with the 
treatment manual; or
    (3) Have been grown, produced, manufactured, stored, or handled in 
such a manner that no infestation would be transmitted thereby.
    (b) Limited permits may be issued by an inspector to allow 
interstate movement of regulated articles (except soil samples for 
processing, testing or analysis) not eligible for certification under 
this subpart, to specified destinations for limited handling, 
utilization, or processing, or for treatment in accordance with the 
treatment manual, when, upon evaluation of the circumstances involved in 
each specific case he determines that such movement will not result in 
the spread of the golden nematode and requirements of other applicable 
Federal domestic plant quarantines have been met.
    (c) Restricted destination permits may be issued by an inspector to 
allow the interstate movement (for other than scientific purposes) of 
regulated articles (except soil samples for processing, testing, or 
analysis) to any destination permitted under all applicable Federal 
domestic plant quarantines if such articles are not eligible for 
certification under all such quarantines but would otherwise qualify for 
certification under this subpart.
    (d) Scientific permits to allow the interstate movement of regulated 
articles and certificates or permits to allow the movement of soil 
samples for processing, testing, or analysis in emergency situations may 
be issued by the Deputy Administrator under such conditions as may be

inspector to reproduce such forms on shipping containers or otherwise. 
Any such person may execute and issue the certificate forms, or 
reproductions of such forms, for the interstate movement of regulated 
articles from the premises of such person identified in the compliance 
agreement if such person has treated such regulated articles to destroy 
infestation in accordance with the treatment manual,

[[Page 102]]

and if such regulated articles are eligible for certification for 
movement to any destination under all Federal domestic plant quarantines 
applicable to such articles. Any such person may execute and issue the 
limited permit forms, or reproductions of such forms, for interstate 
movement of regulated articles to specified destinations when the 
inspector has made the determinations specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section. Any such person may execute and issue the restricted 
destination permit forms, or reproductions of such forms, for the 
interstate movement of regulated articles not eligible for certification 
under all Federal domestic plant quarantines applicable to such 
articles, under the conditions specified in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (f) Any certificate or permit which has been issued or authorized 
may be withdrawn by the inspector or the Deputy Administrator if he 
determines that the holder thereof has not complied with any condition 
for the use of such document imposed by this subpart. Prior to such 
withdrawal, the holder of the certificate of permit shall be notified of 
the proposed action and the reason therefor and afforded reasonable 
opportunity to present his views thereon.

agreement shall be a written agreement between the person conducting 
such operations and Plant Protection and Quarantine wherein such person 
agrees to conduct such operations in a manner which, in the judgment of 
the inspector supervising enforcement of the quarantine and regulations, 
will substantially remove the soil from the potatoes.
    (c) Any compliance agreement may be canceled by the inspector who is 
supervising its enforcement whenever he finds, after notice and 
reasonable opportunity to present views has been accorded to the other 
party thereto, that such other party has failed to comply with the 
conditions of the agreement.

    (a) The Administrator will regulate each State or each portion of a 
State that is infected.
    (b) Less than an entire State will be listed as a regulated area 
only if the Administrator:
    (1)(i) Determines that the State has adopted and is enforcing 
restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles listed 
in Sec. 301.89-2 that are equivalent to the movement restrictions 
imposed by this subpart; and
    (ii) Determines that designating less than the entire State as a 
regulated area will prevent the spread of Karnal bunt; or
    (2) Exercises his or her extraordinary emergency authority under 7 
U.S.C. 150dd.
    (c) The Administrator may include noninfected acreage within a 
regulated area due to its proximity to an infestation or inseparability 
from the infected locality for regulatory purposes, as determined by:
    (1) Projections of the spread of Karnal bunt along the periphery of 
the infestation;
    (2) The availability of natural habitats and host materials within 
the noninfected acreage that are suitable for establishment and survival 
of Karnal bunt; and

area when:

[[Page 110]]

    (1) It is a field planted with seed from a lot found to contain a 
bunted wheat kernel; or
    (2) It is a distinct definable area that contains at least one field 
that was found during survey to contain a bunted wheat kernel (the 
distinct definable area may include an area where Karnal bunt is not 
known to exist but where intensive surveys are required because of the 
area's proximity to a field found during survey to contain a bunted 
kernel); or
    (3) It is a distinct definable area that contains at least one field 
that was found during survey to contain spores consistent with Karnal 
bunt and has been determined to be associated with grain at a handling 
facility containing a bunted wheat kernel (the distinct definable area 
may include an area where Karnal bunt is not known to exist but where 
intensive surveys are required because of the area's proximity to a 
field that has been associated with grain at a handling facility 
containing a bunted kernel).

<R05>
Sec. 301.89-14  Compensation for the 1995-1996 crop season.

    The following individuals are eligible to receive compensation from 
the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the 1995-1996 
crop season to mitigate losses or expenses incurred because of the 
Karnal bunt regulations and emergency actions, as follows:
    (a) Growers who have destroyed crops. Growers in New Mexico and 
Texas who have destroyed crops of wheat pursuant to an Emergency Action 
Notification (PPQ Form 523) issued by an inspector are eligible to be 
compensated at the rate of $300 per acre of destroyed crop. Compensation 
payments will be issued by the Farm Service Agency (FSA). To claim 
compensation, the grower must complete and submit to a local FSA county 
office whichever of the following three forms are applicable, as 
determined by FSA: FSA Form 574, FSA Form 578, and FCI Form 73. The 
forms will be furnished by FSA. Claims for compensation must be received 
by FSA on or before May 31, 1997. The Administrator may extend this 
deadline, upon request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen 
circumstances occur which prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting 
compensation on or before May 31, 1997.
    (b) Growers and handlers who sell nonpropagative wheat. Growers and 
handlers in a State where the Secretary has declared an extraordinary 
emergency, and who sell nonpropagative wheat grown in the regulated area 
or in an area for which an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ Form 523) 
has been issued in accordance with Sec. 301.89-3(d), are eligible to be 
compensated for the loss in value of their wheat due to the Karnal bunt 
regulations, as follows:
    (1) Growers who sell nonpropagative wheat. Growers are eligible to 
be compensated for nonpropagative 1995-1996 crop season wheat and for 
nonpropagative wheat inventories in their possession that were unsold as 
of March 1, 1996, as described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (b)(1)(ii), and 
(b)(1)(iii) of this section. However, compensation will not exceed $2.50 
per bushel under any circumstances.
    (i) If the wheat was grown under contract and a price was determined 
in the contract before March 1, 1996, compensation will equal the 
contracted price minus the higher of either the salvage value, as 
described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, or the actual price 
received by the grower.
    (ii) If the wheat was grown under contract and a price was 
determined in the contract on or after March 1, 1996, and on or before 
August 1, 1996, compensation will equal the higher of either the 
contract price or the estimated market price for the relevant class of 
wheat (meaning type of wheat, such as durum or hard red winter)

[[Page 118]]

minus the higher of either the salvage value, as described in paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section, or the actual price received by the grower. The 
estimated market price will be calculated by APHIS for each class of 
wheat, taking into account the prices offered by relevant terminal 
markets (animal feed, milling, or export) for the period between May 1 
and June 30, 1996, with adjustments for transportation and other 
handling costs.
    (iii) If the wheat was not grown under contract or a price was 
determined in the contract after August 1, 1996, compensation will equal 
the estimated market price for the relevant class of wheat (meaning type 
of wheat, such as durum or hard red winter) minus the higher of either 
the salvage value, as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, or 
the actual price received by the grower. The estimated market price will 
be calculated by APHIS for each class of wheat, taking into account the 
prices offered by relevant terminal markets (animal feed, milling, or 
export) for the period between May 1 and June 30, 1996, with adjustments 
for transportation and other handling costs.
    (2) Handlers who sell nonpropagative wheat. Handlers are eligible to 
be compensated for nonpropagative 1995-1996 crop season wheat and for 
nonpropagative wheat inventories in their possession that were unsold as 
of March 1, 1996, only under the circumstances described in paragraphs 
(b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), and (b)(2)(iii) of this section. Compensation for 
the circumstances in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) will equal the 
estimated market price for the relevant class of wheat (meaning type of 
wheat, such as durum or hard red winter) minus the salvage value, as 
described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Compensation for the 
circumstance in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) will equal the estimated market 
price for the relevant class of wheat (meaning type of wheat, such as 
durum or hard red winter) minus the higher of either the salvage value, 
as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, or the actual price 
received by the handler. The estimated market price will be calculated 
by APHIS for each class of wheat, taking into account the prices offered 
by relevant terminal markets (animal feed, milling, or export) for the 
period between May 1 and June 30, 1996, with adjustments for 
transportation and other handling costs. However, compensation will not 
exceed $2.50 per bushel under any circumstances.
    (i) Handlers who honor contracts by paying the grower full contract 
price on wheat grown for nonpropagative purposes in the regulated area 
that was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt;
    (ii) Handlers who purchase contracted or noncontracted wheat grown 
for nonpropagative purposes in the regulated area that was tested by 
APHIS and found negative for Karnal bunt prior to purchase but that was 
tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt after purchase; or
    (iii) Except as explained in this paragraph, handlers who honor 
contracts by paying the grower or another handler full contract price on 
nonpropagative wheat grown in the regulated area that was tested by 
APHIS and found negative for Karnal bunt if a price was determined in 
the contract before March 1, 1996. Handlers who had contracted to sell 
the wheat at a price determined in the contract before March 1, 1996, 
and who received the full contract price, are not eligible for 
compensation.
    (3) Salvage value. Salvage values will be as follows:
    (i) If the wheat is positive for Karnal bunt and is sold for use as 
animal feed, salvage value equals $6.00 per hundredweight or $3.60 per 
bushel for all classes of wheat.
    (ii) If the wheat is positive for Karnal bunt and is sold for a use 
other than animal feed, salvage value equals whichever is higher of the 
following: the average price paid in the region of the regulated area 
where the wheat is sold for the relevant class of wheat (meaning type of 
wheat, such as durum or hard red winter) for the period between May 1 
and June 30, 1996; or, $3.60 per bushel.
    (iii) If the wheat is negative for Karnal bunt and is sold for any 
use, salvage value equals whichever is higher of the following: the 
average price paid in the region of the regulated area where the wheat 
is sold for the relevant class of wheat (meaning type of

[[Page 119]]

wheat, such as durum or hard red winter) for the period between May 1 
and June 30, 1996; or, $3.60 per bushel.
    (4) To claim compensation. Compensation payments will be issued by 
the Farm Service Agency (FSA). Claims for compensation must be received 
by FSA on or before May 31, 1997. The Administrator may extend this 
deadline, upon request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen 
circumstances occur which prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting 
compensation on or before May 31, 1997. To claim compensation, a grower 
or handler must complete and submit to the local FSA county office the 
following documents:
    (i) Both growers and handlers. A grower or handler must submit 
whichever of the following three forms are applicable, as determined by 
FSA: FSA Form 574, FSA Form 578, and FCI Form 73. A grower or a handler 
must also submit a copy of the receipt for the final sale of the wheat, 
showing the intended use for which the wheat was sold, and a copy of the 
Karnal bunt certificate issued by APHIS that shows the Karnal bunt test 
results.
    (ii) Growers. In addition to the documents required in paragraph 
(b)(4)(i), growers must submit a copy of the contract the grower has for 
the wheat, if the wheat was under contract; and a copy of the receipt 
for the final sale of the wheat, showing the intended use for which the 
wheat was sold, total bushels sold, and the total amount paid to the 
grower by the handler.
    (iii) Handlers. In addition to the documents required in paragraph 
(b)(4)(i), handlers must submit a copy of the contract the handler had 
with the grower for the wheat, if the wheat was under contract; a copy 
of the receipt for the purchase of the wheat from the grower or handler, 
showing the total bushels purchased and the amount the handler paid for 
the wheat; and a copy of the receipt for the final sale of the wheat, 
showing the intended use for which the wheat was sold. Handlers who had 
contracted to sell the wheat at a price determined in the contract 
before March 1, 1996, must submit a copy of the contract for the sale of 
the wheat.
    (c) Nonpropagative wheat that is not sold. If a grower or handler of 
nonpropagative wheat grown in the regulated area in a State where the 
Secretary has declared an extraordinary emergency is not able to or 
elects not to sell their wheat, they will be eligible to receive 
compensation at the rate of $2.50 per bushel. Compensation will only be 
paid if the grower or handler has destroyed the wheat by burying it in a 
sanitary landfill or other site that has been approved by APHIS. 
Compensation claims will be issued by the Farm Service Agency (FSA). To 
claim compensation, the grower or handler must complete and submit to 
the local FSA county office whichever of the following three forms are 
applicable, as determined by FSA: FSA Form 574, FSA Form 578, and FCI 
Form 73. In addition, the grower or handler must submit verification of 
how much wheat was buried, in the form of a receipt from the sanitary 
landfill or verification signed by an APHIS inspector. Claims for 
compensation must be received by FSA on or before May 31, 1997. The 
Administrator may extend this deadline, upon request in specific cases, 
when unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur which prevent or hinder 
a claimant from requesting compensation on or before May 31, 1997.
    (d) Growers and seed companies that sold wheat seed. Growers of and 
seed companies with certified wheat seed or wheat grown with the intent 
of producing certified wheat seed are eligible for compensation for the 
loss in value of their seed, in accordance with this section, if the 
seed was grown in a State where the Secretary has declared an 
extraordinary emergency, and if the seed was grown in an area of that 
State that was regulated for Karnal bunt or under Emergency Action 
Notification (PPQ Form 523) for Karnal bunt during the 1995-1996 crop 
season.
    (1) Growers who sold wheat seed under contract. Growers who sold 
1995-1996 crop season certified wheat seed or 1995-1996 crop season 
wheat grown with the intent of producing certified wheat seed are 
eligible to receive compensation as described in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) 
and (d)(1)(ii) of this section if they sold the wheat under contract to 
a seed company. However, compensation will not exceed $2.80 per bushel 
under any circumstances.

[[Page 120]]

    (i) If the wheat was grown under contract and a price was determined 
in the contract on or before March 1, 1996, and the contract price was 
not honored by the seed company, the compensation rate will equal the 
contract price (CP), including the seed premium if specified in the 
contract, minus the higher of either the salvage value (SV), as 
described in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, plus the actual seed 
premium received by the grower (SP)(actual), or the actual price 
received by the grower (AP), including any seed premium specified on the 
receipt for the final sale of the wheat. If the actual seed premium 
received by the grower is not specified on the receipt for the final 
sale of the wheat, the seed premium will be set at $.30 for the 
compensation calculation. In each case, the amount of the actual price 
or the salvage value of the wheat seed will include the value of any 
proceeds accrued through insurance claims, judgments, or from any other 
source. The equation for this compensation is: Compensation rate = CP--
higher of [SV + (SP(actual) or $.30) or [AP].
    (ii) If the wheat was grown under contract and a price was 
determined in the contract after March 1, 1996, the compensation rate 
will equal the estimated market price for grain (EMP) plus the seed 
premium if specified in the contract (SP)(contract) minus the higher of 
either the salvage value (SV), as described in paragraph (d)(6) of this 
section, plus the actual seed premium received by the grower 
(SP)(actual), or the actual price received by the grower (AP), including 
any seed premium specified on the receipt for the final sale of the 
wheat. If a seed premium is not specified in the contract or on the 
receipt for the final sale of the wheat, the seed premium that is added 
to the estimated market price (EMP) and the seed premium that is added 
to the salvage value (SV) will be set at $.30. In each case, the amount 
of the actual price or the salvage value of the wheat seed will include 
the value of any proceeds accrued through insurance claims, judgments, 
or from any other source. The equation for this compensation is: 
Compensation rate = [EMP + (SP(contract) or $.30)]--higher of [SV + 
(SP(actual) or $.30)] or [AP]. The estimated market price will be 
calculated by APHIS for each class of wheat, taking into account the 
prices offered by relevant terminal markets (animal feed, milling, or 
export) for the period between May 1 and June 30, 1996, with adjustments 
for transportation and other handling costs.
    (2) Growers who sold wheat seed for nonpropagative purposes. Growers 
with 1995-1996 crop season certified wheat seed or 1995-1996 crop season 
wheat grown with the intent of producing certified wheat seed are 
eligible to receive compensation in accordance with paragraphs (d)(2)(i) 
and (d)(2)(ii) of this section if they sold the wheat for nonpropagative 
purposes. However, compensation will not exceed $2.80 per bushel under 
any circumstances.
    (i) If the grower has not claimed compensation under paragraph (b) 
of this section, the compensation rate will equal the estimated market 
price for grain (EMP) minus the actual price received by the grower 
(AP), plus the seed premium specified in the contract the grower had 
with a seed company (SP). If a seed premium is not specified in the 
contract, SP will equal $.30. In each case, the amount of the actual 
price of the wheat seed will include the value of any proceeds accrued 
through insurance claims, judgments, or from any other source. The 
equation for this compensation is: Compensation rate = (EMP-AP) + (SP or 
$.30). Growers who claim compensation under this paragraph may not claim 
compensation under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (ii) If the grower has claimed compensation under paragraph (b) of 
this section, the compensation rate will equal the premium specified in 
the contract the grower had with a seed company. If no seed premium is 
specified in the contract, compensation will equal $.30 per bushel.
    (3) Seed companies that sold wheat seed for nonpropagative purposes 
and that have not claimed compensation. Seed companies with 1995-1996 
crop season certified wheat seed or 1995-1996 crop season wheat grown 
with the intent of producing certified wheat seed, and seed companies 
with certified wheat seed inventories in their possession that were 
unsold as of March 1, 1996, are eligible to receive compensation as

[[Page 121]]

described in paragraphs (d)(3)(i) and (d)(3)(ii) of this section if the 
wheat seed was sold for nonpropagative purposes and if the seed company 
has not claimed compensation under paragraph (b) of this section. Seed 
companies that claim compensation under paragraph (d)(3)(i) or 
(d)(3)(ii) of this section may not claim compensation under paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (i) If the wheat was grown in the 1995-1996 crop season, was under 
contract, and the seed company honored the contract by paying the grower 
the full contract price, including the seed premium if a seed premium is 
specified in the contract, the compensation rate will equal the 
estimated market price for grain (EMP) plus the seed margin (SM) minus 
the higher of either the actual price received by the seed company (AP) 
or the salvage value (SV), as described in paragraph (d)(6) of this 
section. The equation for this compensation is: Compensation rate = EMP 
+ SM-higher of AP or SV. The seed margin is $4.50 per bushel for private 
variety seed and $2.40 per bushel for public variety seed. In each case, 
the amount of the actual price or the salvage value of the wheat seed 
will include the value of any proceeds accrued through insurance claims, 
judgments, or from any other source. However, compensation will not 
exceed $7.00 per bushel for private variety seed and $4.90 per bushel 
for public variety seed under any circumstances.
    (ii) If a seed company had wheat inventories from past crop seasons 
that were unsold as of March 1, 1996, the compensation rate will equal 
the estimated market price for grain (EMP) plus the seed margin (SM) 
minus the higher of either the actual price received by the seed company 
(AP) or the salvage value (SV), as described in paragraph (d)(6) of this 
section. The equation for this compensation is: Compensation rate = EMP 
+ SM-higher of AP or SV. The seed margin is $4.50 per bushel for private 
variety seed and $2.40 per bushel for public variety seed. In each case, 
the amount of the actual price or the salvage value of the wheat seed 
will include the value of any proceeds accrued through insurance claims, 
judgments, or from any other source. However, compensation will not 
exceed $7.00 per bushel for private variety seed and $4.90 per bushel 
for public variety seed under any circumstances.
    (4) Seed companies that sold wheat seed for nonpropagative purposes 
and that have claimed compensation. Seed companies with 1995-1996 crop 
season certified wheat seed or 1995-1996 crop season wheat grown with 
the intent of producing certified wheat seed, and seed companies with 
certified wheat seed inventories in their possession that were unsold as 
of March 1, 1996, are eligible to receive compensation as described in 
this paragraph if the wheat seed was sold for nonpropagative purposes 
and if the seed company has claimed compensation under paragraph (b) of 
this section. In addition, for claims on 1995-1996 crop season wheat, 
the wheat must have been grown under contract and the seed company must 
have honored the contract by paying the grower the full contract price, 
including the seed premium if a seed premium is specified in the 
contract. The compensation rate will equal the seed margin. The seed 
margin is $4.50 per bushel for private variety seed and $2.40 per bushel 
for public variety seed.
    (5) Seed companies that sold wheat seed for propagative purposes. 
Seed companies with 1995-1996 crop season certified wheat seed or 1995-
1996 crop season wheat grown with the intent of producing certified 
wheat seed, and seed companies with certified wheat seed inventories in 
their possession that were unsold as of March 1, 1996, are eligible to 
receive compensation as described in this paragraph if the wheat seed 
was sold for propagative purposes. In addition, for claims on 1995-1996 
crop season wheat, the wheat must have been grown under contract and the 
seed company must have honored the contract by paying the grower the 
full contract price, including the seed premium if a seed premium is 
specified in the contract. The compensation rate will equal the 
estimated market price for grain (EMP) plus the seed margin (SM) minus 
the higher of either the actual price received by the seed company (AP) 
or the salvage value (SV), as described in paragraph (d)(6) of this 
section. In each case, the amount of the actual price or the salvage 
value of

[[Page 122]]

the wheat seed will include the value of any proceeds accrued through 
insurance claims, judgments, or from any other source. The equation for 
this compensation is: Compensation rate = EMP + SM-higher of AP or SV. 
The seed margin is $4.50 per bushel for private variety seed and $2.40 
per bushel for public variety seed. However, compensation will not 
exceed $7.00 per bushel for private variety seed and $4.90 per bushel 
for public variety seed under any circumstances.
    (6) Salvage value. Salvage values will be determined as follows:
    (i) If the wheat is positive for Karnal bunt and is sold for use as 
animal feed, salvage value equals $6.00 per hundredweight or $3.60 per 
bushel for all classes of wheat.
    (ii) If the wheat is positive for Karnal bunt and is sold for a use 
other than animal feed, salvage value equals whichever is higher of the 
following: the average price paid in the region of the regulated areas 
where the wheat is sold for the relevant class of wheat (meaning type of 
wheat, such as durum or hard red winter) for the period between May 1 
and June 30, 1996; or, $3.60 per bushel.
    (iii) If the wheat is negative for Karnal bunt and is sold for any 
use, salvage value equals whichever is higher of the following: the 
average price paid in the region of the regulated areas where the wheat 
is sold for the relevant class of wheat (meaning type of wheat, such as 
durum or hard red winter) for the period between May 1 and June 30, 
1996; or, $3.60 per bushel.
    (7) To claim compensation. Compensation payments for claims made 
under paragraph (d) of this section will be issued by the Farm Service 
Agency (FSA). Claims for compensation must be received by FSA on or 
before April 22, 1998. The Administrator may extend this deadline, upon 
request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen circumstances 
occur which prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting compensation on 
or before that date. To claim compensation, a grower or seed company 
must submit to the local FSA county office all of the following that 
apply:
    (i) The grower or seed company must submit a Karnal Bunt 
Compensation Claim form, provided by FSA;
    (ii) The grower or seed company must submit a copy of the receipt 
for the final sale of the wheat, showing the intended use for which the 
wheat was sold, total bushels sold, and the total price received by the 
grower or seed company;
    (iii) The grower or seed company must submit verification as to the 
actual (not estimated) weight of the wheat for which compensation is 
being claimed (such as a copy of a facility weigh ticket, or other 
verification);
    (iv) The grower or seed company must submit documentation showing 
that the wheat is either certified seed or was grown with the intention 
of producing certified seed (this documentation may include one or more 
of the following types of documents: an application to the State seed 
certification agency for field inspection; a bulk sale certificate; 
certification tags or labels issued by the State seed certification 
agency; or a document issued by the State seed certification agency 
verifying that the wheat is certified seed);
    (v) For claims on 1995-1996 crop season wheat, the grower or seed 
company must submit a copy of the contract under which the wheat was 
grown. Seed companies claiming compensation on seed inventories that 
were in their possession as of March 1, 1996, do not have to submit a 
copy of the contract under which the wheat was grown;
    (vi) A seed company that is claiming compensation for seed 
inventories must certify to FSA that the wheat seed was in the seed 
company's possession as of March 1, 1996;
    (vii) The grower or seed company must submit a copy of the Karnal 
bunt certificate issued by APHIS that shows the Karnal bunt test 
results; provided that, if a grower or seed company moved its wheat only 
within the regulated area, and therefore, does not have a corresponding 
Karnal bunt certificate for the wheat for which compensation is being 
claimed, a limited permit stating that the wheat was positive for Karnal 
bunt will be accepted in lieu of a Karnal bunt certificate. Any wheat

[[Page 123]]

that was moved only within the regulated area and that was not moved 
under a limited permit will be considered negative for Karnal bunt;
    (viii) If the wheat was grown in an area that is not a regulated 
area, but for which an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ Form 523) 
(EAN) for Karnal bunt has been issued, the grower or seed company must 
submit a copy of the EAN.
    (e) Other compensation for seed companies. Seed companies are also 
eligible to receive compensation under the following circumstance: If a 
seed company has 1995-1996 crop season certified wheat seed, or 1995-
1996 crop season wheat grown with the intent of producing certified 
wheat seed, that cannot be sold for use as grain or animal feed because 
it was previously cleaned, treated, and bagged, the compensation rate 
will equal $9.40 per bushel for private variety seed and $7.30 per 
bushel for public variety seed. Compensation will only be paid if the 
seed company has destroyed the wheat by burying it in a sanitary 
landfill or other site that has been approved by APHIS. The compensation 
will be issued by the Farm Service Agency (FSA). Claims for compensation 
must be received by FSA on or before April 22, 1998. The Administrator 
may extend this deadline, upon request in specific cases, when unusual 
and unforeseen circumstances occur which prevent or hinder a claimant 
from requesting compensation on or before that date. To claim 
compensation, a seed company must submit to the local FSA county office 
all of the following that apply:
    (1) The seed company must submit a Karnal Bunt Compensation Claim 
form, provided by FSA;
    (2) The seed company must submit verification of how much wheat was 
buried, in the form of a receipt from the sanitary landfill or 
verification signed by an APHIS inspector;
    (3) The seed company must submit documentation showing that the 
wheat is either certified seed or was grown with the intention of 
producing certified seed (this documentation may include one or more of 
the following types of documents: an application to the State seed 
certification agency for field inspection; a bulk sale certificate; 
certification tags or labels issued by the State seed certification 
agency; or a document issued by the State seed certification agency 
verifying that the wheat is certified seed);
    (4) For claims on 1995-1996 crop season wheat that was buried, the 
seed company must submit a copy of the contract under which the wheat 
was grown. Seed companies claiming compensation on buried seed 
inventories that were in their possession as of March 1, 1996, do not 
have to submit a copy of the contract under which the wheat was grown;
    (5) A seed company that is claiming compensation for seed 
inventories that were buried must certify to FSA that the wheat seed was 
in the seed company's possession as of March 1, 1996;
    (6) If the wheat was grown in an area that is not a regulated area, 
but for which an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ Form 523)(EAN) for 
Karnal bunt has been issued, the seed company must submit a copy of the 
EAN.
    (f) Decontamination of grain storage facilities. Owners of grain 
storage facilities that are in States where the Secretary has declared 
an extraordinary emergency, and who have decontaminated their grain 
storage facilities pursuant to an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ 
Form 523) issued by an inspector, are eligible to be compensated, on a 
one time only basis for each facility and each covered crop year wheat, 
for up to 50 percent of the cost of decontamination. However, 
compensation will not exceed $20,000 per grain storage facility (as 
defined in Sec. 301.89-1). General clean-up, repair, and refurbishment 
costs are excluded from compensation. Compensation payments will be 
issued by APHIS. To claim compensation, the owner of the grain storage 
facility must submit to an inspector records demonstrating that 
decontamination was performed on all structures, conveyances, or 
materials ordered to be decontaminated by the Emergency Action 
Notification on the facility. The records must include a copy of the 
Emergency Action Notification, contracts with individuals or companies 
hired to perform the decontamination, receipts for equipment and

[[Page 124]]

materials purchased to perform the decontamination, time sheets for 
employees of the grain storage facility who performed activities 
connected to the decontamination, and any other documentation that helps 
show the cost to the owner and that decontamination has been completed. 
Claims for compensation must be received by APHIS on or before May 31, 
1997. The Administrator may extend this deadline, upon request in 
specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur which 
prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting compensation on or before 
May 31, 1997.
    (g) Flour millers. Flour millers who, in accordance with a 
compliance agreement with APHIS, heat-treat millfeed made from wheat 
produced in regulated areas that require such treatment are eligible to 
be compensated at the rate of $35.00 per short ton of millfeed. The 
amount of millfeed compensated will be calculated by multiplying the 
weight of wheat from the regulated area received by the miller by 25 
percent (the average percent of millfeed derived from a short ton of 
grain). Compensation payments will be issued by APHIS. To claim 
compensation, the miller must submit to an inspector verification as to 
the actual (not estimated) weight of the wheat (such as a copy of the 
limited permit under which the wheat was moved to the mill or a copy of 
the bill of lading for the wheat, if the actual weight appears on those 
documents, or other verification). Flour millers must also submit 
verification that the millfeed was heat treated (such as a copy of the 
limited permit under which the wheat was moved to a treatment facility 
and a copy of the bill of lading accompanying that movement; or a copy 
of PPQ Form 700 (which includes certification of processing) signed by 
the inspector who monitors the mill). Claims for compensation must be 
received by APHIS on or before May 31, 1997. The Administrator may 
extend this deadline, upon request in specific cases, when unusual and 
unforeseen circumstances occur which prevent or hinder a claimant from 
requesting compensation on or before May 31, 1997.
    (h) National Karnal Bunt Survey participants. If a grain storage 
facility participating in the National Karnal Bunt Survey tests positive 
for Karnal bunt spores, the facility will be regulated and may be 
ordered decontaminated pursuant to an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ 
Form 523) issued by an inspector. If a Declaration of Extraordinary 
Emergency has been declared for the State in which the grain storage 
facility is located, the owner of the grain storage facility will be 
eligible for compensation as follows:
    (1) Loss in value of positive wheat. The owner of the grain storage 
facility will be compensated for the loss in value of positive wheat. 
Compensation will equal the estimated market price for the relevant 
class of wheat minus the salvage value, as described in paragraph (b)(3) 
of this section. The estimated market price will be calculated by APHIS 
for each class of wheat, taking into account the prices offered by 
relevant terminal markets (animal feed, milling, or export) for the 
period between October 1 and November 30, 1996, with adjustments for 
transportation and other handling costs. However, compensation will not 
exceed $2.50 per bushel under any circumstances. Compensation payments 
for loss in value of wheat will be issued by the Farm Service Agency 
(FSA). To claim compensation, the owner of the facility must submit to 
the local FSA office a copy of the Emergency Action Notification under 
which the facility is or was quarantined and verification as to the 
actual (not estimated) weight of the wheat (such as a copy of the 
limited permit under which the wheat was moved to a mill or a copy of 
the bill of lading for the wheat, if the actual weight appears on those 
documents, or other verification). Claims for compensation must be 
received by FSA on or before May 31, 1997. The Administrator may extend 
this deadline, upon request in specific cases, when unusual and 
unforeseen circumstances occur which prevent or hinder a claimant from 
requesting compensation on or before May 31, 1997.
    (2) Decontamination of grain storage facilities. The owner of the 
facility will be compensated on a one time only basis for each grain 
storage facility and each covered crop year wheat for the direct

[[Page 125]]

costs of decontamination of the facility at the same rate described 
under paragraph (f) of this section (up to 50 per cent of the direct 
costs of decontamination, not to exceed $20,000 per grain storage 
facility). Compensation payments for decontamination of grain storage 
facilities will be issued by APHIS, and claims for compensation must be 
submitted in accordance with the provisions in paragraph (f) of this 
section. Claims for compensation must be received by APHIS on or before 
May 31, 1997. The Administrator may extend this deadline, upon request 
in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur which 
prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting compensation on or before 
May 31, 1997.
    (i) Wheat straw producers. Producers of wheat straw (either growers 
who bale their own wheat straw or individuals contracted by growers to 
remove wheat straw from the growers' fields) made from wheat grown in 
the regulated areas in the 1995-1996 crop season are eligible to receive 
compensation on a one-time-only basis at the rate of $1.00 per 80-pound 
bale or $1.25 per hundredweight. Producers are eligible for compensation 
regardless of whether or not the straw is sold, but the straw must have 
been produced under contract. Compensation payments will be issued by 
the Farm Service Agency (FSA). To claim compensation, a wheat straw 
producer must submit a Karnal Bunt Compensation Claim form, provided by 
FSA, and a copy of the contract under which the wheat straw was produced 
to the local FSA county office. Claims for compensation must be received 
by FSA on or before April 22, 1998. The Administrator may extend this 
deadline, upon request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen 
circumstances occur which prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting 
compensation prior to that date.

<R05>
Sec. 301.89-15  Compensation for growers, handlers, and seed companies in the 1996-1997 and 1997-1998 crop seasons.

    Growers, handlers, and seed companies are eligible to receive 
compensation from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for 
the 1996-1997 and 1997-1998 crop seasons to mitigate losses or expenses 
incurred because of the Karnal bunt regulations and emergency actions, 
as follows:
    (a) Growers, handlers, and seed companies in areas under first 
regulated crop season. Growers, handlers, and seed companies are 
eligible to receive compensation for the loss in value of their wheat in 
accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section if: the 
wheat was grown in a State where the Secretary has declared an 
extraordinary emergency; and, the wheat was grown in an area of that 
State that became regulated for Karnal bunt after the crop was planted, 
or for which an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ Form 523) was issued 
after the crop was planted; and, the wheat was grown in an area that 
remained regulated or under Emergency Action Notification at the time 
the wheat was sold. Growers, handlers, and seed companies in areas under 
the first regulated crop season are eligible for compensation for 1996-
1997 crop season wheat or 1997-1998 crop season wheat (as appropriate) 
and for wheat inventories in their possession that were unsold at the 
time the area became regulated. The compensation provided in this 
section is for wheat grain, certified wheat seed, and wheat grown with 
the intention of producing certified wheat seed.
    (1) Growers. Growers of wheat in an area under the first regulated 
crop season, who sell wheat that was tested by APHIS and found positive 
for Karnal bunt prior to sale, or that was tested by APHIS and found 
positive for Karnal bunt after sale and the price received by the grower 
is contingent on the test results, are eligible to receive compensation 
as described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) of this section. 
However, compensation for positive-testing wheat will not exceed $1.80 
per bushel under any circumstances.
    (i) If the wheat was grown under contract and a price was determined 
in the contract before the area where the wheat was grown became 
regulated, compensation will equal the contract price minus the actual 
price received by the grower.
    (ii) If the wheat was not grown under contract or a price was 
determined in

[[Page 126]]

the contract after the area where the wheat was grown became regulated, 
compensation will equal the estimated market price for the relevant 
class of wheat (meaning type of wheat, such as durum or hard red winter) 
minus the actual price received by the grower. The estimated market 
price will be calculated by APHIS for each class of wheat, taking into 
account the prices offered by relevant terminal markets (animal feed, 
milling, or export) during the harvest months for the area, with 
adjustments for transportation and other handling costs. Separate 
estimated market prices will be calculated for certified wheat seed and 
wheat grown with the intention of producing certified wheat seed, and 
wheat grain.
    (2) Handlers and seed companies. Handlers and seed companies who 
sell wheat grown in an area under the first regulated crop season are 
eligible to receive compensation only if the wheat was not tested by 
APHIS prior to purchase by the handler or seed company, but was tested 
by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt after purchase by the 
handler or seed company, as long as the price to be paid is not 
contingent on the test results. Compensation will equal the estimated 
market price for the relevant class of wheat (meaning type of wheat, 
such as durum or hard red winter) minus the actual price received by the 
handler or seed company. The estimated market price will be calculated 
by APHIS for each class of wheat, taking into account the prices offered 
by relevant terminal markets (animal feed, milling, or export) during 
the harvest months for the area, with adjustments for transportation and 
other handling costs. Separate estimated market prices will be 
calculated for certified wheat seed and wheat grown with the intention 
of producing certified wheat seed, and wheat grain. However, 
compensation will not exceed $1.80 per bushel under any circumstances.
    (b) Growers, handlers, and seed companies in previously regulated 
areas. Growers, handlers, and seed companies are eligible to receive 
compensation for the loss in value of their wheat in accordance with 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section if: the wheat was grown in 
a State where the Secretary has declared an extraordinary emergency; 
and, the wheat was grown in an area of that State that became regulated 
for Karnal bunt before the crop was planted, or for which an Emergency 
Action Notification (PPQ Form 523) was issued before the crop was 
planted; and, the wheat was grown in an area that remained regulated or 
under Emergency Action Notification at the time the wheat was sold. 
Growers, handlers, and seed companies in previously regulated areas are 
eligible for compensation only for 1996-1997 or 1997-1998 crop season 
wheat. The compensation provided in this section is for wheat grain, 
certified wheat seed, and wheat grown with the intention of producing 
certified wheat seed.
    (1) Growers. Growers of wheat in a previously regulated area who 
sell wheat that was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt 
prior to sale, or that was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal 
bunt after sale and the price received by the grower is contingent on 
the test results, are eligible to receive compensation at the rate of 
$.60 per bushel of positive testing wheat.
    (2) Handlers and seed companies. Handlers and seed companies who 
sell wheat grown in a previously regulated area are eligible to receive 
compensation only if the wheat was not tested by APHIS prior to purchase 
by the handler, but was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal 
bunt after purchase by the handler or seed company, as long as the price 
to be paid by the handler or seed company is not contingent on the test 
results. Compensation will be at the rate of $.60 per bushel of positive 
testing wheat.
    (c) To claim compensation. Compensation payments to growers, 
handlers, and seed companies under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section will be issued by the Farm Service Agency (FSA). Claims for 
compensation for the 1996-1997 crop season must be received by FSA on or 
before October 8, 1998. Claims for compensation for the 1997-1998 crop 
season must be received by FSA on or before October 25, 1999. The 
Administrator may extend the deadline, upon request in specific cases, 
when unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur which prevent or

[[Page 127]]

hinder a claimant from requesting compensation on or before these dates. 
To claim compensation, a grower, handler, or seed company must complete 
and submit to the local FSA county office the following documents:
    (1) Growers, handlers, and seed companies. A grower, handler, or 
seed company must submit a Karnal Bunt Compensation Claim form, provided 
by FSA. If the wheat was grown in an area that is not a regulated area, 
but for which an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ Form 523) (EAN) has 
been issued, the grower, handler, or seed company must submit a copy of 
the EAN. Growers, handlers, and seed companies must also submit a copy 
of the Karnal bunt certificate issued by APHIS that shows the Karnal 
bunt test results, and verification as to the actual (not estimated) 
weight of the wheat that tested positive (such as a copy of a facility 
weigh ticket, or other verification). For compensation claims for wheat 
seed, a grower or seed company must submit documentation showing that 
the wheat is either certified seed or was grown with the intention of 
producing certified seed (this documentation may include one or more of 
the following types of documents: an application to the State seed 
certification agency for field inspection; a bulk sale certificate; 
certification tags or labels issued by the State seed certification 
agency; or a document issued by the State seed certification agency 
verifying that the wheat is certified seed);
    (2) Growers. In addition to the documents required in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section, growers must submit a copy of the receipt for 
the final sale of the wheat, showing the total bushels sold and the 
total price received by the grower. Growers compensated under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section (previously regulated areas) whose wheat was not 
tested prior to sale must submit documentation showing that the price 
paid to the grower was contingent on test results (such as a copy of the 
receipt for the final sale of the wheat or a copy of the contract the 
grower has for the wheat, if this information appears on those 
documents).
    (3) Handlers and seed companies. In addition to the documents 
required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, handlers and seed 
companies must submit a copy of the receipt for the final sale of the 
wheat, showing the total bushels sold and the total price received by 
the handler or seed company. The handler or seed company must also 
submit documentation showing that the price paid or to be paid to the 
grower is not contingent on the test results (such as a copy of the 
receipt for the purchase of the wheat or a copy of the contract the 
handler or seed company has with the grower, if this information appears 
on those documents).

<R05>
Sec. 301.89-16  Compensation for grain storage facilities, flour millers, and National Survey participants for the 1996-1997 and 1997-1998 crop seasons.

    Owners of grain storage facilities, flour millers, and participants 
in the National Karnal Bunt Survey are eligible to receive compensation 
from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the 1996-
1997 and 1997-1998 crop seasons to mitigate losses or expenses incurred 
because of the Karnal bunt regulations and emergency actions, as 
follows:
    (a) Decontamination of grain storage facilities. Owners of grain 
storage facilities that are in States where the Secretary has declared 
an extraordinary emergency, and who have decontaminated their grain 
storage facilities pursuant to either an Emergency Action Notification 
(PPQ Form 523) issued by an inspector or a letter issued by an inspector 
ordering decontamination of the facilities, are eligible to be 
compensated, on a one time only basis for each facility for each covered 
crop year wheat, for up to 50 percent of the direct cost of 
decontamination. However, compensation will not exceed $20,000 per grain 
storage facility (as defined in Sec. 301.89-1). General clean-up, 
repair, and refurbishment costs are excluded from compensation. 
Compensation payments

[[Page 128]]

will be issued by APHIS. To claim compensation, the owner of the grain 
storage facility must submit to an inspector records demonstrating that 
decontamination was performed on all structures, conveyances, or 
materials ordered by APHIS to be decontaminated. The records must 
include a copy of the Emergency Action Notification or the letter from 
an inspector ordering decontamination, contracts with individuals or 
companies hired to perform the decontamination, receipts for equipment 
and materials purchased to perform the decontamination, time sheets for 
employees of the grain storage facility who performed activities 
connected to the decontamination, and any other documentation that helps 
show the cost to the owner and that decontamination has been completed. 
Claims for compensation for the 1996-1997 crop season must be received 
by APHIS on or before October 8, 1998. Claims for compensation for the 
1997-1998 crop season must be received by APHIS on or before October 25, 
1999. The Administrator may extend these deadlines upon written request 
in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur which 
prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting compensation on or before 
these dates.
    (b) Flour millers. Flour millers who, in accordance with a 
compliance agreement with APHIS, heat treat millfeed that is required by 
APHIS to be heat treated are eligible to be compensated at the rate of 
$35.00 per short ton of millfeed. The amount of millfeed compensated 
will be calculated by multiplying the weight of wheat from the regulated 
area received by the miller by 25 percent (the average percent of 
millfeed derived from a short ton of grain). Compensation payments will 
be issued by APHIS. To claim compensation, the miller must submit to an 
inspector verification as to the actual (not estimated) weight of the 
wheat (such as a copy of a facility weigh ticket or a copy of the bill 
of lading for the wheat, if the actual weight appears on those 
documents, or other verification). Flour millers must also submit 
verification that the millfeed was heat treated (such as a copy of the 
limited permit under which the wheat was moved to a treatment facility 
and a copy of the bill of lading accompanying that movement; or a copy 
of PPQ Form 700 (which includes certification of processing) signed by 
the inspector who monitors the mill). Claims for compensation for the 
1996-1997 crop season must be received by APHIS on or before October 8, 
1998. Claims for compensation for the 1997-1998 crop season must be 
received by APHIS on or before October 25, 1999. The Administrator may 
extend these deadlines upon written request in specific cases, when 
unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur which prevent or hinder a 
claimant from requesting compensation on or before these dates.
    (c) National Karnal Bunt Survey participants. If a grain storage 
facility participating in the National Karnal Bunt Survey tests positive 
for Karnal bunt, the facility will be regulated, and may be ordered 
decontaminated, pursuant to either an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ 
Form 523) issued by an inspector or a letter issued by an inspector 
ordering decontamination of the facility. If the Secretary has declared 
an extraordinary emergency in the State in which the grain storage 
facility is located, the owner will be eligible for compensation as 
follows:
    (1) Loss in value of positive wheat. The owner of the grain storage 
facility will be compensated for the loss in value of positive wheat. 
Compensation will equal the estimated market price for the relevant 
class of wheat minus the actual price received for the wheat. The 
estimated market price will be calculated by APHIS for each class of 
wheat, taking into account the prices offered by relevant terminal 
markets (animal feed, milling, or export) during the relevant time 
period for that facility, with adjustments for transportation and other 
handling costs. However, compensation will not exceed $1.80 per bushel 
under any circumstances. Compensation payments for loss in value of 
wheat will be issued by the Farm Service Agency (FSA). To claim 
compensation, the owner of the facility must submit to the local FSA 
office a Karnal Bunt Compensation Claim form, provided by FSA. The owner 
of the facility must also submit

[[Page 129]]

to FSA a copy of the Emergency Action Notification or letter from an 
inspector under which the facility is or was quarantined; verification 
as to the actual (not estimated) weight of the wheat (such as a copy of 
a facility weigh ticket or a copy of the bill of lading for the wheat, 
if the actual weight appears on those documents, or other verification); 
and a copy of the receipt for the final sale of the wheat, showing the 
total bushels sold and the total price received by the owner of the 
grain storage facility. Claims for compensation for the 1996-1997 crop 
season must be received by APHIS on or before October 8, 1998. Claims 
for compensation for the 1997-1998 crop season must be received by APHIS 
on or before October 25, 1999. The Administrator may extend these 
deadlines upon written request in specific cases, when unusual and 
unforeseen circumstances occur which prevent or hinder a claimant from 
requesting compensation on or before these dates.
    (2) Decontamination of grain storage facilities. The owner of the 
facility will be compensated on a one time only basis for each grain 
storage facility for each covered crop year wheat for the direct costs 
of decontamination of the facility at the same rate described under 
paragraph (a) of this section (up to 50 per cent of the direct costs of 
decontamination, not to exceed $20,000 per grain storage facility). 
Compensation payments for decontamination of grain storage facilities 
will be issued by APHIS, and claims for compensation must be submitted 
in accordance with the provisions in paragraph (a) of this section. 
Claims for compensation for the 1996-1997 crop season must be received 
by APHIS on or before October 8, 1998. Claims for compensation for the 
1997-1998 crop season must be received by APHIS on or before October 25, 
1999. The Administrator may extend these deadlines upon written request 
in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur which 
prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting compensation on or before 
these dates.

    (a) A certificate shall be issued by an inspector, except as 
provided in paragraph (c) of this section, for the movement of a 
regulated article if such inspector:
    (1)(i) Determines based on inspection of the premises of origin that 
the premises are free from European larch canker; or
    (ii) Determines that it has been grown, processed, stored, or 
handled in such a manner that the regulated article is free of European 
larch canker; and
    (2) Determines that it is to be moved in compliance with any 
additional

[[Page 132]]

emergency conditions necessary to prevent the spread of the European 
larch canker pursuant to section 105 of the Federal Plant Pest Act (7 
U.S.C. 150dd); <SUP>3</SUP> and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>3</SUP> Section 105 of the Federal Plant Pest Act (7 U.S.C.

may, whenever he deems it necessary as an emergency measure in order to 
prevent the dissemination of any plant pest new to or not theretofore 
known to be widely prevalent or distributed within and throughout the 
United States seize, quarantine, treat, apply other remedial measures 
to, destroy, or otherwise dispose of, in such manner as he deems 
appropriate, any product or article of any character whatsoever, or 
means or conveyance, which is moving into or through the United States 
or interstate, and which he has reason to believe is infested or 
infected by or contains any such plant pest.

regulated article if such inspector:
    (1) Determines, in consultation with the Deputy Administrator, that 
it is to be moved to a specified destination for specified handling, 
utilization, or processing (such destination and other conditions to be 
specified on the limited permit), when, upon evaluation of all of the 
circumstances involved in each case, it is determined that such movement 
will not result in the spread of European larch canker because the 
disease will be destroyed by such specified handling, utilization, or 
processing;
    (2) Determines that it is to be moved in compliance with any 
additional emergency conditions necessary to prevent the spread of the 
European larch canker pursuant to section 105 of the Federal Plant Pest 
Act (7 U.S.C. 150dd)<SUP>3</SUP>; and

engaged in the business of growing, handling, or moving regulated 
articles provided such person has entered into and is operating under a 
compliance agreement. Any such person may execute and issue a 
certificate or limited permit for the interstate movement of a regulated 
article if an inspector has previously made the determination that the 
article is eligible for a certificate in accordance with Sec. 301.91-
5(a) or is eligible for a limited permit in accordance with Sec. 301.91-
5(b).
    (d) Any certificate or limited permit which has been issued or 
authorized may be withdrawn by an inspector if such inspector determines 
that the holder thereof has not complied with any conditions under the 
regulations for the use of such document. The reasons for the withdrawal 
shall be confirmed in writing as promptly as circumstances permit. Any 
person whose certificate or limited permit has been withdrawn may appeal 
the decision in writing to the Deputy Administrator within ten (10) days 
after receiving the written notification of the withdrawal. The appeal 
shall state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to 
show that the certificate or limited permit was wrongfully withdrawn. 
The Deputy Administrator shall grant or deny the appeal, in witing, 
stating the reasons for such decision, as promptly as circmstances 
permit. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing shall 
be held to resolve such conflict. Rules of Practice concerning such a

Sec. 301.93-3  Quarantined areas.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, 
the Administrator will list as a quarantined area in paragraph (c) of 
this section each State, or each portion of a State, in which the 
Oriental fruit fly has been found by an inspector, in which the 
Administrator has reason to believe that the Oriental fruit fly is 
present, or that

[[Page 136]]

the Administrator considers necessary to regulate because of its 
proximity to the Oriental fruit fly or its inseparability for quarantine 
enforcement purposes from localities in which the Oriental fruit fly has 
been found. Less than an entire State will be designated as a 
quarantined area only if the Administrator determines that:
    (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the 
intrastate movement of the regulated articles that are substantially the 
same as those imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of 
regulated articles; and
    (2) The designation of less than the entire State as a quarantined 
area will prevent the interstate spread of the Oriental fruit fly.
    (b) The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any 
nonquarantined area in a State as a quarantined area in accordance with 
the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section for listing 
quarantined areas. The Administrator will give written notice of this 
temporary designation to the owner or person in possession of the 
nonquarantined area; thereafter, the interstate movement of any 
regulated article from an area temporarily designated as a quarantined 
area is subject to this subpart. As soon as practicable, this area will 
be added to the list in paragraph (c) of this section or the designation 
will be terminated by the Administrator or an inspector. The owner or 
person in possession of an area for which designation is terminated will 
be given notice of the termination as soon as practicable.
    (c) The areas described below are designated as quarantined areas:

                               California

    (a) With a certificate or limited permit issued and attached in 
accordance with Secs. 301.93-5 and 301.93-8 of this subpart;
    (b) Without a certificate or limited permit, if:
    (1) The regulated article originated outside of any quarantined area 
and is moved directly through (without stopping except for refueling, or 
for traffic conditions, such as traffic lights or stop signs) the 
quarantined area in an enclosed vehicle or is completely enclosed by a 
covering adequate to prevent access by Oriental fruit flies (such as 
canvas, plastic, or closely woven cloth) while moving through the 
quarantined area; and
    (2) The point of origin of the regulated article is indicated on the

article is moved:
    (1) By the United States Department of Agriculture for experimental 
or scientific purposes;
    (2) Pursuant to a permit issued by the Administrator for the 
regulated article;
    (3) Under conditions specified on the permit and found by the 
Administrator to be adequate to prevent the spread of Oriental fruit 
fly; and
    (4) With a tag or label bearing the number of the permit issued for 
the regulated article attached to the outside of the container of the

Sec. 301.93-5  Issuance and cancellation of certificates and limited permits.

    (a) An inspector \3\ will issue a certificate for the interstate 
movement of a regulated article if the inspector determines that:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Inspectors are assigned to local offices of the Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service, which are listed in telephone directories. 
Information concerning these offices may also be obtained from the 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and 
Quarantine, Domestic and Emergency Operations, 4700 River Road Unit 134, 
Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1236.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) (i) The regulated article has been treated in accordance with 
Sec. 301.93-10 of this subpart; or
    (ii) Based on inspection of the premises of origin, or treatment of 
the premises of origin in accordance with Sec. 301.93-10(c) of this 
subpart, the premises are free from Oriental fruit flies and the 
regulated article has not been exposed to Oriental fruit fly; or
    (iii) Based on inspection of the regulated article, it is free of 
Oriental fruit fly; and
    (2) The regulated article is to be moved in compliance with any 
additional emergency conditions the Administrator may impose, under 
section 105 of the Federal Plant Pest Act (7 U.S.C. 150dd); \4\ to 
prevent the spread of the Oriental fruit fly; and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Section 105 of the Federal Plant Pest Act (7 U.S.C. 150dd) 
provides that the Secretary of Agriculture may--under certain 
conditions--seize, quarantine, treat, destroy, or apply other remedial 
measures to articles that the Administrator has reason to believe are 
infested or infected by or contain plant pests.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) The regulated article is eligible for unrestricted movement 
under all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations 
applicable to the regulated article.
    (b) An inspector will issue a limited permit for the interstate 
movement of a regulated article if the inspector determines that:
    (1) The regulated article is to be moved interstate to a specified 
destination for specified handling, utilization, or processing (the 
destination and other conditions to be listed in the limited permit), 
and this interstate movement will not result in the spread of the 
Oriental fruit fly because life stages of the Oriental fruit fly will be 
destroyed by the specified handling, utilization, or processing.
    (2) The regulated article is to be moved interstate in compliance 
with any additional emergency conditions the Administrator may impose, 
under section 105 of the Federal Plant Pest Act (7 U.S.C. 150dd);\4\ to 
prevent the spread of the Oriental fruit fly; and
    (3) The regulated article is eligible for interstate movement under 
all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable 
to the regulated article.
    (c) Certificates and limited permits for use for interstate movement 
of regulated articles may be issued by an inspector or person engaged in 
growing, handling, or moving regulated articles provided the person is 
operating under a compliance agreement. A person operating under a 
compliance agreement may execute a certificate for the interstate 
movement of a regulated article if an inspector has determined that the 
regulated article is otherwise eligible for a certificate in accordance 
with paragraph (a) of this section. A person operating under a 
compliance agreement may execute a limited permit for interstate 
movement of a regulated article when an inspector has determined that 
the regulated article is eligible for a limited permit in accordance 
with paragraph (b) of this section.

[[Page 138]]

    (d) Any certificate or limited permit that has been issued may be 
withdrawn by an inspector orally or in writing, if the inspector 
determines that the holder of the certificate or limited permit has not 
complied with all conditions under this subpart for the use of the 
certificate or limited permit. If the withdrawal is oral, the withdrawal 
and the reasons for the withdrawal shall be confirmed in writing as 
promptly as circumstances allow. Any person whose certificate or limited 
permit has been withdrawn may appeal the decision in writing to the 
Administrator within 10 days after receiving the written notification of 
the withdrawal. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons upon 
which the person relies to show that the certificate or limited permit 
was wrongfully withdrawn. As promptly as circumstances allow, the 
Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the 
reasons for the decision. A hearing will be held to resolve any conflict 
as to any material fact. Rules of practice concerning a hearing will be 
adopted by the Administrator.

Sec. 318.13  Notice of quarantine.

    (a) Pursuant to section 8 of the Plant Quarantine Act of August 20, 
1912, as amended (7 U.S.C. 161), and after public hearing, it has been 
determined that it is necessary to quarantine Hawaii to prevent the 
spread of dangerous plant diseases and insect infestations, including 
the Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata (Wied.)), the melon fly 
(Dacus cucurbitae Coq.), the oriental fruit fly (Dacus dorsalis Hendl.), 
green coffee scale (Coccus viridis (Green)), the bean pod borer (Maruca 
testulalis (Geyer)), the bean butterfly (Lampides boeticus (L.)), the 
Asiatic rice borer (Chilo suppressalis), the mango weevil (Sternochetus 
mangiferae (F.)), the Chinese rose beetle (Adoretus sinicus Burm.), and 
a cactus borer (Cactoblastis cactorum (Berg.)), which are new to or not 
widely prevalent or distributed within and throughout the United States, 
and Hawaii is therefore quarantined.
    (b) No fruits or vegetables, in the raw or unprocessed state; cut 
flowers; rice straw; mango seeds; or cactus plants or parts thereof 
shall be shipped, offered for shipment to a common carrier, received for 
transportation or transported by a common carrier, or carried, 
transported, moved, or allowed to be moved by any person from Hawaii 
into or through the continental United States, Guam, Puerto Rico, or the 
Virgin Islands of the United States, in manner or method or under 
conditions other than those prescribed in the regulations hereinafter 
made or amendments thereto: Provided, That whenever the Administrator of 
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service shall find that existing 
conditions as to the pest risk involved in the movement of any of the 
articles to which the regulations supplemental hereto apply, make it 
safe to modify, by making less stringent, the restrictions contained in 
any of such regulations, he shall publish such finding in administrative 
instructions specifying the manner in which the restrictions shall be 
made less stringent, whereupon such modification shall become effective; 
or he may, when the public interest will permit, with respect to the 
movement of any of such articles to Guam, upon request in specific cases 
and notification to the person making the request, authorize their 
certification under conditions, specified in the certificate to carry 
out the purposes of this subpart, that are less stringent than those 
contained in the regulations: And provided, further, That no 
restrictions are placed hereby on the movement of cactus plants from 
Hawaii to St. Croix, Virgin

Sec. 318.13-4a  Administrative instructions authorizing the movement from Hawaii of frozen fruits and vegetables.

    (a) The type of treatment designated in this part as freezing shall 
be one of the commercially acceptable methods that involves initial 
freezing at subzero temperatures and subsequent storage at not higher 
than 0 deg. F., with a storage tolerance of plus 20 deg. F. Such 
treatments are commonly known as quick freezing, sharp freezing, frozen-
pack, or cold-pack. Any equivalent freezing method is also included in 
this designation.
    (b) The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Service, pursuant to the authority contained in Secs. 318.13-2(b) and 
318.13-4(b), hereby approves the process of freezing as a treatment for 
all fruits and vegetables described in Sec. 318.13, except as otherwise 
provided in paragraph (d) of this section. Such frozen fruits and 
vegetables may be certified for movement from Hawaii into or through any 
other Territory, State, or District of the United States. \1\ 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Applications for certificates to move frozen fruits and 
vegetables from Hawaii under this subpart may be made to Plant 
Protection and Quarantine Programs, P.O. Box 9067, Honolulu, Hawaii 
96820.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 147]]

    (c) The inspector in Hawaii shall determine that such fruits and 
vegetables are in a satisfactory frozen state before issuing a 
certificate. The inspector on the mainland will release the shipment on 
the basis of the certificate issued in Hawaii.
    (d) The movement from Hawaii of frozen fruits and vegetables is not 
authorized when such fruits and vegetables are subject to attack, in the 
area of origin, by plant pests that may not, in the judgment of the 
Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, be 
destroyed by freezing.
    (e) Freezing of fruits and vegetables as authorized in this section 
is considered necessary for the elimination of pest risk, and no 
liability shall attach to the United States Department of Agriculture or 
to any officer or representative of that Department in the event of 
injury resulting to fruits or vegetables offered for movement in 
accordance with the instructions of this section.

Sec. 318.13-4b  Administrative instructions prescribing methods of vapor-heat treatment of certain fruits and vegetables from Hawaii.

    (a) Approved vapor-heat methods of treatment. (1) Approved vapor-
heat treatment, in accordance with the following procedure, is hereby 
designated as an administratively approved procedure that meets the 
requirements for the certification, in accordance with Sec. 318.13-4(b), 
of papayas, bell peppers, eggplants, pineapples (other than smooth 
Cayenne), Italian squash, and tomatoes for movement from Hawaii:
    (i) In the approved vapor-heat treatment the fruits and vegetables 
are heated by saturated vapor at 110 deg. F. which in condensing on the 
fruits and vegetables gives up its latent heat. This latent heat is 
essential in assuring mortality of eggs and larvae of the oriental fruit 
fly, the Mediterranean fruit fly and the melon fly, and in raising the 
temperature of the fruits and vegetables evenly and quickly so as to 
prevent damage to the treated products. In applying the treatment the 
saturated vapor is accompanied by a fine water mist and air admixture.
    (ii) The fruits and vegetables are cooled immediately after 
treatment and no wax or paraffin, either dry or in solution, may be used 
until after the treatment has been completed. Vapor-heat treatments are 
approved only if the vapor conditions within the heat treating room, the 
manner of stacking the boxes containing the fruits and vegetables in the 
room, and all other conditions affecting the efficacy of the treatment 
are satisfactory to the supervising inspector, to assure mortality of 
eggs and larvae of the oriental fruit fly, the Mediterranean fruit fly, 
and the melon fly.
    (iii) In applying this treatment, in accordance with these 
principles, the temperature of the fruits and vegetables shall be raised 
to 110 deg. F., at the approximate center of the fruits and vegetables, 
within a period designated by the inspector, and shall be held at that 
level during the following 8\3/4\ hours.
    (2) Approved vapor-heat treatment, in accordance with the following 
procedure, is hereby designated as an alternate administratively 
approved procedure that meets the requirements for the certification, in 
accordance with Sec. 318.13-4(b), of papayas for movement from Hawaii:
    (i) In the approved vapor-heat ``quick run-up'' treatment the 
papayas are heated by saturated vapor until the temperature at the 
approximate center of the fruit reaches a minimum of 117 deg. F. The 
cooling and other conditions prescribed in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this 
section apply.
    (ii) The conditioning of the papayas preparatory to the treatment, 
as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, shall be completed within 
a period designated by the inspector.
    (3) The treatments provided for in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of 
this section must be conducted in a heat-treating room approved by the 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and must be conducted under 
the supervision of an inspector of that Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service, who at all times shall have access to

[[Page 148]]

the fruits and vegetables while they are undergoing treatment.
    (4) The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service will approve only 
those rooms which are properly constructed and adequately equipped to 
handle and treat the fruit or vegetables, at locations acceptable to the 
inspector in areas where required supervision can be furnished. 
Hereafter no treating plant will be approved until it is equipped with a 
self-recording temperature and humidity indicator acceptable to the 
inspector.
    (b) Subsequent handling. All handling in Hawaii subsequent to 
treatment of fruits and vegetables intended for shipment elsewhere in 
the United States must be carried out to meet requirements of and under 
the supervision of the inspector.
    (c) Costs. All costs of treatment and prescribed post-treatment 
safeguards, other than the services of the supervising inspector during 
regularly assigned hours of duty and at the usual place of duty, shall, 
as required by Sec. 318.13-4(b), be borne by the owner of the fruits or 
vegetables, or his representative.
    (d) Department not responsible for damage. In the tests and 
experiments so far conducted, fruits and vegetables (other than 
eggplants) have not been injured and the results following treatment 
have been successful. It is however, emphasized that inexactness and 
carelessness in using the approved method of treatment may result in 
injury to the fruit and vegtables treated. In approving this treatment 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture does not accept responsibility for 
fruit or vegetable injury.
    (e) Conditioning. (1) The treatments set forth in paragraph (a) of 
this section are in addition to any other procedure or practice that may 
be found by the shipper to be desirable to condition or otherwise handle 
fruits or vegetables that may be offered for treatment.
    (2) Eggplants require conditioning before they will tolerate the 
approved vapor-heat treatment. Even when conditioned, darkening of their 
seeds usually occurs. In tests of eggplant tolerance to vapor-heat 
treatment, 6 to 8 hours conditioning at 110 deg. F. and approximately 40 
percent relative humidity before the prescribed 8\3/4\-hour holding 
period has been found effective. This conditioning procedure or any 
other that the shipper has developed and found satisfactory may be used 
for eggplants at the shipper's risk.
    (3) Papayas require conditioning before they will tolerate the 
approved vapor-heat ``quick run-up'' treatment and even then some injury 
may result. Any conditioning that the shipper has developed and found 
satisfactory may be used with the ``quick run-up'' treatment for papayas 
at the shipper's risk.

Sec. 318.13-4c  Administrative instructions approving methyl bromide fumigation as a condition for certification of tomatoes for movement from Hawaii.

    The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 
hereby approves methyl bromide fumigation, applied in accordance with 
the provisions of this section, as a treatment for tomatoes from Hawaii. 
Tomatoes treated and handled as provided in this section may be 
certified for movement from Hawaii to other parts of the United States.
    (a) Approved fumigation. (1) The approved fumigation shall consist 
of fumigation with methyl bromide at normal atmospheric pressure, in a 
fumigation chamber which has been approved for that purpose by the 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The dosage shall be applied 
at the rate of 2 pounds per 1,000 cubic feet for 3\1/2\ hours at 70  
deg.F. or above.
    (2) Tomatoes to be fumigated may be individually wrapped in gas-
permeable tissue paper and packed in standard slatted tomato lugs or 
containers similarly vented. The fumigation chamber shall not be loaded 
to more than two-thirds of its capacity. The 3\1/2\-hour exposure period 
shall begin when all the fumigant has been introduced into the chamber 
and volatilized. Good circulation above and below the load, and between 
individual containers, shall be provided as soon as the tomatoes are

[[Page 149]]

loaded in the chamber and shall continue during the full period of 
fumigation and until the tomatoes have been removed to a well-ventilated 
location.
    (b) Supervision of treatments and subsequent handling. The treatment 
approved in this section and the subsequent handling of the tomatoes so 
treated must be under the supervision of a plant quarantine inspector of 
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Such treated tomatoes 
must be safeguarded against reinfestation during the period prior to 
movement from Hawaii in a manner satisfactory to the inspector. 
Certification of tomatoes for such movement will be made only upon 
compliance with the prescribed treatment and posttreatment safeguards.
    (c) Costs. All costs of the treatments and prescribed posttreatment 
safeguards provided for in this section, other than the services of the 
supervising inspector during regularly assigned hours of duty and at the 
usual place of duty, shall, as required by Sec. 318.13-4(b), be borne by 
the owner of the tomatoes, or his representative.
    (d) Department not responsible for damage. (1) This treatment is 
recognized as one which may be marginal as to varietal tolerance of 
tomatoes and the owner or shipper is warned of possible injury. The 
Department of Agriculture and its inspectors assume no responsibility 
for any loss or damage resulting from any treatment prescribed or 
supervised.
    (2) In test fumigations the following varieties of tomatoes 
indicated tolerance to the prescribed treatment when harvested early in 
the season and in the mature stage after some color development: Big 
Boy, Bounty, Break O Day, Burpee Hybrid, Earliana, Hawaii, Homestead, J. 
Moran, Kalohi, Kaulaii, Lanai, Marglobe, Maui, Niihau, N-46, Oahu, 
Pearson, Pritchard, Rutgers, San Malzano, Step 274, Step 278, Step 280, 
Step 281, Step 305, and Step 314. Varieties showing poor tolerance were 
Desert Pride, Kolea C. Manalucie, and Pennheart.

Sec. 318.13-4f  Administrative instructions prescribing methods for irradiation treatment of certain fruits and vegetables from Hawaii.

    (a) Approved irradiation treatment. Irradiation, carried out in 
accordance with the provisions of this section, is approved as a 
treatment for the following fruits and vegetables: Abiu, atemoya, 
carambola, litchi, longan, papaya, rambutan, and sapodilla.

[[Page 150]]

    (b) Conditions of movement. Fruits and vegetables from Hawaii may be 
authorized for movement in accordance with this section only if the 
following conditions are met:
    (1) Location. The irradiation treatment must be carried out at an 
approved facility in Hawaii or on the mainland United States. Fruits and 
vegetables authorized under this section for treatment on the mainland 
may be treated in any State on the mainland United States except 
Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, 
Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina, 
Tennessee, Texas, or Virginia. Prior to treatment, the fruits and 
vegetables may not move into or through Alabama, Arizona, California, 
Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, 
North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, or Virginia, except 
that movement is allowed through Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, as an 
authorized stop for air cargo, or as a transloading location for 
shipments that arrive by air but that are subsequently transloaded into 
trucks for overland movement from Dallas/Fort Worth into an authorized 
State by the shortest route.
    (2) Approved facility. The irradiation treatment facility and 
treatment protocol must be approved by the Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service. In order to be approved, a facility must:
    (i) Be capable of administering a minimum absorbed ionizing 
radiation dose of 250 Gray (25 krad) to the fruits and 
vegetables;<SUP>2</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

of food is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration under 21 CFR 
part 179.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) Be constructed so as to provide physically separate locations 
for treated and untreated fruits and vegetables, except that fruits and 
vegetables traveling by conveyor directly into the irradiation chamber 
may pass through an area that would otherwise be separated. The 
locations must be separated by a permanent physical barrier such as a 
wall or chain link fence six or more feet high to prevent transfer of 
cartons. Untreated fruits and vegetables shipped to the mainland United 
States from Hawaii in accordance with this section may not be packaged 
for shipment in a carton with treated fruits and vegetables;
    (iii) Complete a compliance agreement with the Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service as provided in Sec. 318.13-4(d) of this 
subpart; and
    (iv) Be certified by Plant Protection and Quarantine for initial use 
and annually for subsequent use. Recertification is required in the 
event that an increase or decrease in radioisotope or a major 
modification to equipment that affects the delivered dose. 
Recertification may be required in cases where a significant variance in 
dose delivery is indicated.
    (3) Treatment monitoring. Treatment must be carried out under the 
monitoring of an inspector. This monitoring must include inspection of 
treatment records and unannounced inspectional visits to the facility by 
an inspector. Facilities that carry out continual irradiation operations 
must notify an inspector at least 24 hours before the date of 
operations. Facilities that carry out periodic irradiation operations 
must notify an inspector of scheduled operations at least 24 hours 
before scheduled operations.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Inspectors are assigned to local offices of the Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service, which are listed in telephone directories.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (4) Packaging. (i) Fruits and vegetables that are treated in Hawaii 
must be packaged in the following manner:
    (A) The cartons must have no openings that will allow the entry of 
fruit flies and must be sealed with seals that will visually indicate if 
the cartons have been opened. They may be constructed of any material 
that prevents the entry of fruit flies and prevents oviposition by fruit 
flies into the fruit in the carton.<SUP>4</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ If there is a question as to the adequacy of a carton, send a 
request for approval of the carton, together with a sample carton, to 
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and 
Quarantine, Phytosanitary Issues Management Team, 4700 River Road Unit 
140, Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1236.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 151]]

    (B) The pallet-load of cartons must be wrapped before it leaves the 
irradiation facility in one of the following ways:
    (1) With polyethylene sheet wrap;
    (2) With net wrapping; or
    (3) With strapping so that each carton on an outside row of the 
pallet load is constrained by a metal or plastic strap.
    (C) Packaging must be labeled with treatment lot numbers, packing 
and treatment facility identification and location, and dates of packing 
and treatment.
    (ii) Cartons of untreated fruits and vegetables that are moving to 
the mainland United States for treatment must be shipped in shipping 
containers sealed prior to interstate movement with seals that will 
visually indicate if the shipping containers have been opened.
    (iii) Litchi and longan from Hawaii may not be moved interstate into 
Florida. All cartons in which litchi or longan are packed must be 
stamped ``Not for importation into or distribution in FL.''
    (5) Dosage. The fruits and vegetables must receive a minimum 
absorbed ionizing radiation dose of 250 Gray (25 krad).<SUP>5</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See footnote 2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (6) Dosimetry systems. (i) Dosimetry must demonstrate that the 
absorbed dose, including areas of minimum and maximum dose, is mapped, 
controlled, and recorded.
    (ii) Absorbed dose must be measured using a dosimeter that can 
accurately measure an absorbed dose of 250 Gray (25 krad).
    (iii) The number and placement of dosimeters used must be in 
accordance with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) 
standards.<SUP>6</SUP>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (7)(i) Certification on basis of treatment. A certificate shall be 
issued by an inspector for the movement of fruits and vegetables from 
Hawaii that have been treated and handled in Hawaii in accordance with 
this section. To be certified for interstate movement under this 
section, litchi from Hawaii must be inspected in Hawaii and found free 
of the litchi fruit moth (Cryptophlebia spp.) and other plant pests by 
an inspector before undergoing irradiation treatment in Hawaii for fruit 
flies.
    (ii) Limited permit. A limited permit shall be issued by an 
inspector for the interstate movement of untreated fruits and vegetables 
from Hawaii for treatment on the mainland United States in accordance 
with this section. To be eligible for a limited permit under this 
section, untreated litchi from Hawaii must be inspected in Hawaii and 
found free of the litchi fruit moth (Cryptophlebia spp.) and other plant 
pests by an inspector.
    (8) Records. Records or invoices for each treated lot must be made 
available for inspection by an inspector during normal business hours 
(8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays). An 
irradiation processor must maintain records as specified in this section 
for a period of time that exceeds the shelf life of the irradiated food 
product by 1 year, and must make these records available for inspection 
by an inspector. These records must include the lot identification, 
scheduled process, evidence of compliance with the scheduled process, 
ionizing energy source, source calibration, dosimetry, dose distribution 
in the product, and the date of irradiation.
    (c) Request for approval and inspection of facility. Persons 
requesting approval of an irradiation treatment facility and treatment 
protocol must submit the request for approval in writing to the Animal 
and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, 
Oxford Plant Protection Center, 901 Hillsboro St., Oxford, NC 27565. 
Before the Administrator determines whether an irradiation facility is 
eligible for approval, an inspector will make a personal inspection of 
the facility to determine whether it complies with the standards of 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (d) Denial and withdrawal of approval. (1) The Administrator will 
withdraw the approval of any irradiation treatment facility when the 
irradiation processor requests in writing the withdrawal of approval.

[[Page 152]]

    (2) The Administrator will deny or withdraw approval of an 
irradiation treatment facility when any provision of this section is not 
met. Before withdrawing or denying approval, the Administrator will 
inform the irradiation processor in writing of the reasons for the 
proposed action and provide the irradiation processor with an 
opportunity to respond. The Administrator will give the irradiation 
processor an opportunity for a hearing regarding any dispute of a 
material fact, in accordance with rules of practice that will be adopted 
for the proceeding. However, the Administrator will suspend approval 
pending final determination in the proceeding, if he or she determines 
that suspension is necessary to prevent the spread of any dangerous 
insect infestation. The suspension will be effective upon oral or 
written notification, whichever is earlier, to the irradiation 
processor. In the event of oral notification, written confirmation will 
be given to the irradiation processor within 10 days of the oral 
notification. The suspension will continue in effect pending completion 
of the proceeding and any judicial review of the proceeding.
    (e) Department not responsible for damage. This treatment is 
approved to assure quarantine security against the Trifly complex. From 
the literature available, the fruits and vegetables authorized for 
treatment under this section are believed tolerant to the treatment; 
however, the facility operator and shipper are responsible for 
determination of tolerance. The Department of Agriculture and its 
inspectors assume no responsibility for any loss or damage resulting 
from any treatment prescribed or supervised. Additionally, the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission is responsible for ensuring that irradiation 
facilities are constructed and operated in a safe manner. Further, the 
Food and Drug Administration is responsible for ensuring that irradiated 
foods are safe and wholesome for human consumption.

overland shipments change means of conveyance. An inspector will issue a 
limited permit if the following conditions are met:
    (1) The inspector determines that the specific type and quantity of 
the fruits and vegetables being shipped are accurately described by 
accompanying documentation, such as the accompanying manifest, waybill,

Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and 
Quarantine, Port Operations, Permit Unit, 4700 River Road Unit 136, 
Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1236.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (f) Movement of fruits and vegetables. Transportation through the 
continental United States shall be by the most direct route to the final 
destination of the shipment in the country to which it is exported, as 
determined by APHIS based on commercial shipping routes and timetables 
and set forth in the transit permit. No change in the quantity of the 
original shipment from that described in the limited permit is allowed. 
No remarking is allowed. No diversion or delay of the shipment from the 
itinerary described in the transit permit and limited permit is allowed 
unless authorized by an APHIS inspector upon determination by the 
inspector that the change will not significantly increase the risk of 
plant pests or diseases in the United States, and unless each port to 
which the shipment is diverted is staffed by APHIS inspectors.
    (g) Notification in case of emergency. In the case of an emergency 
such as an accident, a mechanical breakdown of the means of conveyance, 
or an unavoidable deviation from the prescribed route, the person in 
charge of the means of conveyance must, as soon as practicable, notify 
the APHIS office at the port where the cargo arrived in the continental 
United States.
    (h) Shipments by sea. Except as authorized by this paragraph, 
shipments arriving in the continental United States by sea from Hawaii 
may be transloaded once from a ship to another ship or, alternatively, 
once to a truck or railcar at the port of arrival and once from a truck 
or railcar to a ship at the port of export, and must remain in the 
original sealed container, except under extenuating circumstances and 
when authorized by an inspector upon determination by the inspector that 
the transloading would not significantly increase the risk of the 
introduction of plant pests or diseases into the continental United 
States, and provided that APHIS inspectors are available to provide 
supervision. No other transloading of the shipment is allowed, except 
under extenuating circumstances (e.g., equipment breakdown) and when 
authorized by an inspector upon determination by the inspector that the 
transloading would not significantly increase the risk of the 
introduction of plant pests or diseases into the continental United 
States, and provided that APHIS inspectors are available to provide 
supervision.
    (i) Shipments by air. (1) Shipments arriving in the continental 
United States by air from Hawaii may be transloaded only once in the 
continental United States. Transloading of air shipments must be carried 
out in the presence of an APHIS inspector. Shipments arriving by air 
that are transloaded may be transloaded either into another aircraft or 
into a truck trailer for export by the most direct route to the final

[[Page 161]]

destination of the shipment through the designated corridor set forth in 
paragraph (e) of this section. This may be done at either the port of 
arrival in the United States or at the second air stop within the 
designated corridor, as authorized in the transit permit and as provided 
in paragraph (i)(2) of this section. No other transloading of the 
shipment is allowed, except under extenuating circumstances (e.g., 
equipment breakdown) and when authorized by an APHIS inspector upon 
determination by the inspector that the transloading would not 
significantly increase the risk of the introduction of plant pests or 
diseases into the continental United States, and provided that APHIS 
inspectors are available to provide supervision. Transloading of air 
shipments will be authorized only if the following conditions are met:
    (i) The transloading is done into sealable containers;
    (ii) The transloading is carried out within the secure area of the 
airport--i.e., that area of the airport that is open only to personnel 
authorized by the airport security authorities;
    (iii) The area used for any storage is within the secure area of the 
airport; and
    (iv) APHIS inspectors are available to provide the supervision 
required by paragraph (i)(1) of this section.
    (2) Except as authorized by paragraph (f) of this section, shipments 
that continue by air from the port of arrival in the continental United 
States may be authorized by APHIS for only one additional stop in the 
continental United States, provided the second stop is within the 
designated corridor set forth in paragraph (e) of this section and is 
staffed by APHIS inspectors. As an alternative to transloading a 
shipment arriving in the United States into another aircraft, shipments 
that arrive by air may be transloaded into a truck trailer for export by 
the most direct route to the final destination of the shipment through 
the designated corridor set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. This 
may be done at either the port of arrival in the United States or at the 
second authorized air stop within the designated corridor. No other 
transloading of the shipment is allowed, except under extenuating 
circumstances (e.g., equipment breakdown) and when authorized by an 
APHIS inspector upon determination by the inspector that the 
transloading would not significantly increase the risk of the 
introduction of plant pests or diseases into the continental United 
States, and provided that APHIS inspectors are available to provide 
supervision.
    (j) Duration and location of storage. Any storage in the continental 
United States of fruits and vegetables shipped under this section must 
be for a duration and in a location authorized in the transit permit 
required by paragraph (a) of this section. Areas where such fruits and 
vegetables are stored must be either locked or guarded at all times the 
fruits and vegetables are present. Cargo shipped under this section must 
be kept in a sealed container while stored in the continental United 
States.
    (k) Temperature requirement. Except for time spent on aircraft and 
except during storage and transloading of air shipments, the temperature 
in the sealed containers containing fruits and vegetables moved under 
this section must be 60 deg. F or lower from the time the fruits and 
vegetables leave Hawaii until they exit the continental United States.
    (l) Prohibited materials. (1) The person in charge of or in 
possession of a sealed container used for movement into or through the 
continental United States under this section must ensure that the sealed 
container is carrying only those fruits and vegetables authorized by the 
transit permit required under paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (2) The person in charge of or in possession of any means of 
conveyance or container returned to the United States without being 
reloaded after being used to export fruits and vegetables from the 
United States under this section must ensure that the means of 
conveyance or container is free of materials prohibited importation into 
the United States under this chapter.
    (m) Authorization by APHIS of the movement of fruits and vegetables 
into or through the continental United States under this section does 
not imply that the fruits and vegetables are enterable into the 
destination

[[Page 162]]

country. Shipments returned to the United States from the destination 
country shall be subject to all applicable regulations, including 
``Subpart--Fruits and Vegetables'' of part 319 of this chapter, and part 
352 of this chapter.
    (n) Any restrictions and requirements with respect to the arrival, 
temporary stay, unloading, transloading, transiting, exportation, or 
other movement or possession in the United States of any fruits or 
vegetables under this section shall apply to any person who, 
respectively, brings into, maintains, unloads, transloads, transports, 
exports, or otherwise moves or possesses in the United States such 
fruits or vegetables, whether or not that person is the one who was 
required to have a transit permit or limited permit for the fruits or 
vegetables or is a subsequent custodian of the fruits or vegetables. 
Failure to comply with all applicable restrictions and requirements 
under this section by such a person shall be deemed to be a violation of 
this section.

sweetpotato stem borer (Omphisa anastomosalis Guen.), dangerous insect 
infestations new to and not widely prevalent or distributed within or 
throughout the United States, and that it is necessary also to 
quarantine the Virgin Islands of the United States to prevent the spread 
to other parts of the United States of the sweetpotato scarabee.
    (b) Under the authority conferred by section 8 of the Plant 
Quarantine Act of August 20, 1912, as amended (7 U.S.C. 161), and after 
public hearing as required thereunder, the Administrator of the Animal 
and Plant Health Inspection Service therefore has quarantined Hawaii, 
Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States to prevent the 
spread of the sweetpotato scarabee (Euscepes postfasciatus Fairm.) and 
the sweetpotato stem borer (Omphisa anastomosalis Guen.).

Sec. 318.30a  Administrative instructions authorizing movement from Puerto Rico of certain sweetpotatoes grown under specified conditions.

    The Deputy Administrator of the Plant Protection and Quarantine 
Programs hereby finds that facts exist as to the pest risk involved in 
the movement of sweetpotatoes to which Sec. 318.30 applies, making it 
safe to modify by making less stringent the requirements of Sec. 318.30 
with respect to washed sweetpotatoes graded by inspectors of the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in accordance with Puerto Rican standards 
which do not provide a tolerance for insect infestation or evidence of 
insect injury and found by such inspectors to comply with such 
standards. Hereafter, in addition to movement authorized under 
Sec. 318.30(c), such sweetpotatoes will be eligible for inspection by a 
Branch inspector to determine whether they are free of the sweetpotato 
scarabee (Euscepes postfasciatus Fairm.) and for certification for 
movement from Puerto Rico to Baltimore, Maryland, and Atlantic Coast 
ports north thereof if found free of such insect, provided the 
sweetpotatoes are certified by an inspector of the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico as having been so washed and graded and as having been grown 
in accordance with the following procedures:
    (a) Fields in which the sweetpotatoes have been grown shall have 
been given a preplanting treatment with an approved soil insecticide.
    (b) Before planting in such treated fields, the sweetpotoato draws 
and vine cuttings shall have been dipped in an approved insecticidal 
solution.
    (c) During the growing season an approved insecticide shall have 
been applied to the vines at prescribed intervals.

The sweetpotatoes shall be inspected by an inspector of the Plant 
Protection and Quarantine Programs prior to shipment from Puerto Rico.

<R05>
Sec. 318.58  Notice of quarantine.

    (a) Pursuant to section 8 of the Plant Quarantine Act of August 20, 
1912, as amended (7 U.S.C. 161), and after public hearing, it has been 
determined that it is necessary to quarantine Puerto Rico and the Virgin 
Islands of the United States to prevent the spread of certain dangerous 
insect infestations not heretofore widely prevalent or distributed 
within and throughout the United States, including the fruit flies, 
Anastrepha suspensa (Loew), and A. mombinpraeoptans Sein, and the bean 
pod borer, Maruca testulalis (Geyer), and that it is necessary to 
quarantine the said Virgin Islands to prevent the spread of a cactus 
borer, Cactoblastis cactorum (Berg.), not heretofore widely prevalent or 
distributed within and throughout the United States; and Puerto Rico and 
the said Virgin Islands are therefore quarantined.
    (b) No fruits or vegetables, in the raw or unprocessed state, shall 
be shipped, offered for shipment to a common carrier, received for 
transportation or transported by a common carrier, or carried, 
transported, moved, or allowed to be moved, by any person from Puerto 
Rico or the Virgin Islands of the United States into or through Guam, 
Hawaii, or the continental United States, and no cactus plants or parts 
thereof shall be shipped, offered for shipment to a common carrier, 
received for transportation or transported by a common carrier, or 
carried, transported, moved, or allowed to be moved, by any person from 
the Virgin Islands of the United States into or through Guam, Puerto 
Rico, or the continental United States; in any manner or method or under 
conditions other than those prescribed in the regulations hereinafter 
made or amendments thereto: Provided, That whenever the Deputy 
Administrator of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs shall find 
that existing conditions as to the pest risk involved in the movement of 
any of the articles to which the regulations supplemental hereto apply, 
make it safe to modify, by making less stringent, the restrictions 
contained in any of such regulations, he shall publish such finding in 
administrative instructions, specifying the manner in which the 
restrictions shall be made less stringent, whereupon such modification 
shall become effective; or he may, when the public interest will permit, 
with respect to the movement of any of such articles to Guam, upon 
request in specific cases and notification to the person making the 
request, authorize their certification under conditions, specified in 
the certificate to carry out the purposes of this subpart, that are less 
stringent than those contained in the regulations.
    (c) No restrictions are placed hereby on the movement of fruits or 
vegetables in either direction between Puerto Rico and the Virgin 
Islands of the United States.
    (d) This subpart leaves in full force and effect Sec. 318.30 which 
restricts the movement from Hawaii, Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands 
of the United States into or through any other State or certain 
Territories or Districts of the United States of all varieties of 
sweetpotatoes (Ipomoea batatas Poir.). It also leaves in full force and 
effect Sec. 318.60 which restricts the movement from Hawaii, Puerto 
Rico, or the Virgin Islands of the United States into or through any 
other State or certain Territories or Districts of the United States of

    (a) Certification on basis of inspection or nature of lot involved. 
An inspector may issue a certificate for fruits and vegetables 
designated in Sec. 318.58-2(b)(1) after he has inspected them and found 
that they appear free from infestation and infection, or has determined 
without an inspection that the lot for shipment is of such a nature that 
there appears to be no danger of infestation or infection.
    (b) Certification on basis of treatment. Fruits and vegetables 
designated in Sec. 318.58-2(b) may be certified after undergoing an 
approved treatment contained in the Plant Protection and Quarantine 
Treatment Manual under the supervision of an inspector and if the 
articles are handled after treatment in accordance with all conditions 
that the inspector requires. The Plant

Sec. 318.58-4a  Administrative instructions authorizing the movement from Puerto Rico of frozen fruits and vegetables.

    (a) The type of treatment designated in this subpart as freezing 
shall be one of the commercially-acceptable methods that involves 
initial freezing at subzero temperatures and subsequent storage at not 
higher than 0 deg. F., with a storage tolerance of plus 20 deg. F. Such 
treatments are commonly known as quick freezing, sharp freezing, frozen-
pack, or cold-pack. Any equivalent freezing method is also included in 
this designation.
    (b) The Deputy Administrator of the Plant Protection and Quarantine 
Programs is satisfied that the movement of all fruits and vegetables 
specified in Sec. 318.58-2, when frozen, will not result in the 
dissemination of injurious insects. Accordingly, pursuant to the 
authority contained in the proviso of Sec. 318.58-2, all fruits and 
vegetables specified therein, when frozen, are hereby removed from a 
prohibited status and are included in the list for which movement from 
Puerto Rico into or through any other State, Territory, or District is 
authorized in Sec. 318.58-3. Freezing is hereby prescribed as an 
approved treatment meeting the treatment requirements for the movement 
of fruits and vegetables specified in Sec. 318.58-3. <SUP>1

    1</SUP>  Further information concerning the movement of frozen 
fruits and vegetables from Puerto Rico may be obtained from the Plant 
Protection and Quarantine Programs, Room 4, Post Office Bldg., P.O. Box 
3386, San Juan, PR 00901.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) The inspector in Puerto Rico shall determine that such fruits 
and vegetables are in a satisfactory frozen state before issuing a 
certificate. The inspector on the mainland will release the shipment on 
the basis of the certificate issued in Puerto Rico.
    (d) The movement from Puerto Rico of frozen fruits and vegetables is 
not authorized when such fruits and vegetables are subject to attack, in 
the area of origin, by plant pests that may not, in the judgment of the 
Deputy Administrator of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs, be 
destroyed by freezing.
    (e) Freezing of fruits and vegetables as authorized in these 
instructions is considered necessary for the elimination of pest risk, 
and no liability shall attach to the United States Department of 
Agriculture or to any officer or representative of that Department in 
the event of injury resulting to fruits or vegetables offered for 
movement in accordance with these instructions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (f) Movement of fruits and vegetables. Transportation through the 
continental United States shall be by the most direct route to the final 
destination of the shipment in the country to which it is exported, as 
determined by APHIS based on commercial shipping routes and timetables 
and set forth in the transit permit. No change in the quantity of the 
original shipment from that described in the limited permit is allowed. 
No remarking is allowed. No diversion or delay of the shipment from the 
itinerary described in the transit permit and limited permit is allowed 
unless authorized by an APHIS inspector upon determination by the 
inspector that the change will not significantly increase the risk of 
plant pests or diseases in the United States, and unless each port to 
which the shipment is diverted is staffed by APHIS inspectors.
    (g) Notification in case of emergency. In the case of an emergency 
such as an accident, a mechanical breakdown of the

[[Page 176]]

means of conveyance, or an unavoidable deviation from the prescribed 
route, the person in charge of the means of conveyance must, as soon as 
practicable, notify the APHIS office at the port where the cargo arrived 
in the continental United States.
    (h) Shipments by sea. Except as authorized by this paragraph, 
shipments arriving in the continental United States by sea from Puerto 
Rico or the Virgin Islands of the United States may be transloaded once 
from a ship to another ship or, alternatively, once to a truck or 
railcar at the port of arrival and once from a truck or railcar to a 
ship at the port of export, and must remain in the original sealed 
container, except under extenuating circumstances and when authorized by 
an inspector upon determination by the inspector that the transloading 
would not significantly increase the risk of the introduction of plant 
pests or diseases into the continental United States, and provided that 
APHIS inspectors are available to provide supervision. No other 
transloading of the shipment is allowed, except under extenuating 
circumstances (e.g., equipment breakdown) and when authorized by an 
inspector upon determination by the inspector that the transloading 
would not significantly increase the risk of the introduction of plant 
pests or diseases into the continental United States, and provided that 
APHIS inspectors are available to provide supervision.
    (i) Shipments by air. (1) Shipments arriving in the continental 
United States by air from Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands of the 
United States may be transloaded only once in the continental United 
States. Transloading of air shipments must be carried out in the 
presence of an APHIS inspector. Shipments arriving by air that are 
transloaded may be transloaded either into another aircraft or into a 
truck trailer for export by the most direct route to the final 
destination of the shipment through the designated corridor set forth in 
paragraph (e) of this section. This may be done at either the port of 
arrival in the United States or at the second air stop within the 
designated corridor, as authorized in the transit permit and as provided 
in paragraph (i)(2) of this section. No other transloading of the 
shipment is allowed, except under extenuating circumstances (e.g., 
equipment breakdown) and when authorized by an APHIS inspector upon 
determination by the inspector that the transloading would not 
significantly increase the risk of the introduction of plant pests or 
diseases into the continental United States, and provided that APHIS 
inspectors are available to provide supervision. Transloading of air 
shipments will be authorized only if the following conditions are met:
    (i) The transloading is done into sealable containers;
    (ii) The transloading is carried out within the secure area of the 
airport--i.e., that area of the airport that is open only to personnel 
authorized by the airport security authorities;
    (iii) The area used for any storage is within the secure area of the 
airport; and
    (iv) APHIS inspectors are available to provide the supervision 
required by paragraph (i)(1) of this section.
    (2) Except as authorized by paragraph (f) of this section, shipments 
that continue by air from the port of arrival in the continental United 
States may be authorized by APHIS for only one additional stop in the 
continental United States, provided the second stop is within the 
designated corridor set forth in paragraph (e) of this section and is 
staffed by APHIS inspectors. As an alternative to transloading a 
shipment arriving in the United States into another aircraft, shipments 
that arrive by air may be transloaded into a truck trailer for export by 
the most direct route to the final destination of the shipment through 
the designated corridor set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. This 
may be done at either the port of arrival in the United States or at the 
second authorized air stop within the designated corridor. No other 
transloading of the shipment is allowed, except under extenuating 
circumstances (e.g., equipment breakdown) and when authorized by an 
APHIS inspector upon determination by the inspector that the 
transloading would not significantly increase the risk of the 
introduction of plant pests or diseases into the continental United

[[Page 177]]

States, and provided that APHIS inspectors are available to provide 
supervision.
    (j) Duration and location of storage. Any storage in the continental 
United States of fruits and vegetables shipped under this section must 
be for a duration and in a location authorized in the transit permit 
required by paragraph (a) of this section. Areas where such fruits and 
vegetables are stored must be either locked or guarded at all times the 
fruits and vegetables are present. Cargo shipped under this section must 
be kept in a sealed container while stored in the continental United 
States.

Sec. 318.60  Notice of quarantine.

    (a) The Secretary of Agriculture, having previously quarantined 
Hawaii and Puerto Rico to prevent the spread to other parts of the 
United States, by means of sand, soil, or earth about the roots of 
plants, of immature stages of certain dangerous insects, including 
Phyllophaga spp. (White grubs), Phytalus sp., and Adoretus sp., and of 
several species of termites or white ants, new to and not heretofore 
widely prevalent or distributed within and throughout the United States, 
now determines that it is necessary also to quarantine the Virgin 
Islands of the United States to prevent the spread of such dangerous 
insects from said Virgin Islands.
    (b) Under the authority conferred by section 8 of the Plant 
Quarantine Act of August 20, 1912, as amended (7 U.S.C. 161), and having 
given public hearing as required thereunder, the Secretary of 
Agriculture hereby quarantines Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin 
Islands of the United States to prevent the spread of said dangerous 
insects.
    (c) Sand (other than clean ocean sand), soil, or earth around the 
roots of plants shall not be shipped, offered for shipment to a common 
carrier, received for transportation or transported by a common carrier, 
or carried, transported, moved, or allowed to be moved by any person 
from Hawaii, Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands of the United States 
into or through any other State, Territory, or District of the United 
States: Provided, That the prohibitions of this section shall not

[[Page 179]]

apply to the movement of such products in either direction between 
Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands of the United States: Provided 
further, That such prohibitions shall not prohibit the movement of such 
products by the United States Department of Agriculture for scientific 
or experimental purposes, nor prohibit the movement of sand, soil, or 
earth around the roots of plants which are carried, for ornamental 
purposes, on vessels into mainland ports of the United States and which 
are not intended to be landed thereat, when evidence is presented 
satisfactory to the inspector of the Plant Protection and Quarantine 
Programs of the Department of Agriculture that such sand, soil, or earth 
has been so processed or is of such nature that no pest risk is 
involved, or that the plants with sand, soil, or earth around them are 
maintained on board under such safeguards as will preclude pest escape: 
And provided further, That such prohibitions shall not prohibit the 
movement of plant cuttings or plants that have been (1) freed from sand, 
soil, and earth, (2) subsequently potted and established in sphagnum 
moss or other packing material approved under Sec. 319.37-16 that had 
been stored under shelter and had not been previously used for growing 
or packing plants, (3) grown thereafter in a manner satisfactory to an 
inspector of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs to prevent 
infestation through contact with sand, soil, or earth, and (4) certified 
by an inspector of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs as 
meeting the requirements of paragraphs (c) (1), (2), and (3) of this 
section.
    (d) As used in this section, the term State, Territory, or District 
of the United States means ``Guam, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Virgin 
Islands of the United States, or the continental United States.''

amended: Provided, That whenever the Deputy Administrator of the Plant 
Protection and Quarantine Programs shall find that existing conditions 
as to the pest risk involved in the movement from Guam of the articles 
designated herein, make it safe to modify, by making less stringent, the 
restrictions contained in any regulations in this subpart or in any 
other subpart in this chapter made applicable thereto by this subpart, 
he shall publish such findings in administrative instructions, 
specifying the manner in which the regulations should be made less 
stringent with respect to such movement, whereupon such modification

Sec. 319.8  Notice of quarantine.

    (a) Pursuant to sections 5 and 7 of the Plant Quarantine Act of 
1912, as amended (7 U.S.C. 159, 160), and after the public hearing 
required thereunder, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service hereby determines that the unrestricted importation 
into the United States from

[[Page 185]]

all foreign countries and localities of (1) any parts or products of 
plants of the genus Gossypium, including seed cotton; cottonseed; cotton 
lint, linters, and other forms of cotton fiber (not including yarn, 
thread, and cloth); cottonseed hulls, cake, meal, and other cottonseed 
products, except oil; cotton waste, including gin waste and thread 
waste; and any other unmanufactured parts of cotton plants; and (2) 
second-hand burlap and other fabrics, shredded or otherwise, which have 
been used or are of the kinds ordinarily used, for containing cotton, 
grains (including grain products), field seeds, agricultural roots, 
rhizomes, tubers, or other underground crops, may result in the entry 
into the United States of the pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella 
(Saund.)), the golden nematode of potatoes Heterodera rostochiensis 
Wr.), the flag smut disease (Urocystis tritici Koern.), and other 
injurious plant diseases and insect pests, and said Administrator hereby 
further determines, that, in order to prevent the introduction into the 
United States of said plant diseases and insect pests, which are new to 
or not heretofore widely prevalent or distributed within and throughout 
the United States, it is necessary to forbid the importation into the 
United States of the plants and products, including fabrics, specified 
above, except as permitted in the regulations supplemental hereto. 
Hereafter the plants and products specified above shall not be imported 
or offered for entry into the United States from any foreign country or 
locality except as permitted by said regulations, and the plants and 
products permitted by the regulations to be imported or offered for 
entry shall be subject to the provisions of sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 of 
said Plant Quarantine Act (7 U.S.C. 154, 156, 157, and 158): Provided, 
That whenever the Deputy Administrator of the Plant Protection and 
Quarantine Programs shall find the existing conditions as to pest risk 
involved in the importation of the articles to which the regulations 
supplemental hereto apply, make it safe to modify, by making less 
stringent the restrictions contained in any of such regulations, he 
shall publish such findings in the administrative instructions, 
specifying the manner in which the restrictions shall be made less 
stringent, whereupon such modification shall become effective; or he 
may, upon request in specific cases, when the public interests will 
permit, authorize such importation under conditions specified in the 
permit to carry out the purposes of this part that are less stringent 
than those contained in the regulations.
    (b) As used in this section the term ``United States'' shall have 
the meaning ascribed to it in the regulations supplemental hereto.

Sec. 319.8a  Administrative instructions relating to the entry of cotton and covers into Guam.

    The plants and products specified in Sec. 319.8(a) may be imported 
into Guam without further permit, other than the authorization contained 
in this paragraph. Sections 319.8-2 and 319.8-3 shall not be applicable 
to such importations. In addition, such importations need not comply 
with the requirements of Sec. 319.8-4 relating to notice of arrival 
inasmuch as there is available to the inspector the essential 
information normally supplied by the importer at the time of 
importation. Sections 319.8-5 through 319.8-27 shall not be applicable 
to importations into Guam. Inspection of such importations may be made 
under the general authority of Sec. 330.105(a) of this chapter. If an 
importation is found infected, infested, or contaminated with any plant 
pest and is not subject to disposal under this part, disposition may be 
made in accordance with Sec. 330.106 of this chapter.

        Conditions of Importation and Entry of Cotton and Covers


<R05>
Sec. 319.8-2  Permit procedure.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided for in Secs. 319.8-10 and 319.8-18, 
permits shall be obtained for importations into the United States of all 
cotton and covers. Permits will be issued only for cotton and covers 
authorized entry under Secs. 319.8-6 through 319.8-20. Persons desiring 
to import cotton or covers under Secs. 319.8-6 through 319.8-20 shall, 
in advance of departure of such material from a foreign port, submit to 
the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs an application \2\ stating 
the name and address of the importer, the country from which such 
material is to be imported, and the kind of cotton or covers it is 
desired to import. Applications to import cottonseed shall state the 
approximate quantity and the proposed United States port of entry. 
Applications to import lint, linters, or waste shall state whether such 
materials are compressed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Applications for permits should be made to Plant Importations 
Branch, Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs, 209 River Street, 
Hoboken, N.J. 07030.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Applications to import lint, linters, or waste at a port \3\ 
other than one in the North, in California, or on the Mexican Border 
shall also specify whether the commodity is compressed to high density.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     \3\Including ports in Guam, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin 
Islands of the United States.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Applications for permits may be made orally or on forms provided 
for

[[Page 188]]

the purpose by the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs, or may be 
made by a letter or telegram containing all the information required by 
this section.
    (d) Upon receipt and approval of such application by the Plant 
Protection and Quarantine Programs, an individual or continuing permit 
will be issued authorizing the importation and specifying the port of 
entry and the conditions of entry. A copy of the permit will be supplied 
to the importer.
    (e) Upon receipt of an application to import lint, linters, waste, 
or covers, without treatment, for utilization under agreement as defined 
in Sec. 319.8-8(a)(2), an investigation will be made by an inspector to 
determine that the receiving mill or plant is satisfactorily located 
geographically, is equipped with all necessary safeguards, and is 
apparently in a position to fulfill all precautionary conditions to 
which it may agree. Upon determination by the inspector that these 
qualifications are fulfilled, the owner or operator of the mill or plant 
may sign an agreement specifying that the required precautionary 
conditions will be maintained. Such signed agreement will be a necessary 
requisite to the release at the port of entry of any imported lint, 
linters, waste, or covers for forwarding to and utilization at such mill 
or plant in lieu of vacuum fumigation or other treatment otherwise 
required by this subpart. Permits for the importation of such materials 
will be issued in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
    (f) Permits for importation of any cotton or covers are conditioned 
upon compliance with all requirements set forth therein and such 
additional requirements in this subpart as are in terms applicable 
thereto. Failure to comply with any such requirement will be deemed to 
invalidate the permit. Permits may also be cancelled or may be refused 
as provided in Sec. 319.8-3, or entry denied as provided in Secs. 319.8-
11, 319.8-12, and Sec. 319.8-13.
    (g) If through no fault of the importer a shipment of cotton or 
covers arrives at a United States port in advance of the issuance of a 
permit, it may be held, under suitable safeguards prescribed by the 
inspector at the port, in Customs custody at the risk of the importer, 
pending issuance of a permit, for a period not exceeding 20 days.
    (h) Pending development of adequate treating facilities in Guam, any 
cotton or covers that are subject to treatment as a condition of entry 
therein must first be entered and treated in accordance with the 
requirements of this subpart at a U.S. port of arrival where such 
treating facilities are available.

    (a) Permits for entry from the West Coast of Mexico, as authorized 
in Sec. 319.8-12 of lint, linters, waste, cottonseed, and cottonseed 
hulls may be refused and existing permits cancelled by the Deputy 
Administrator if he has determined that the pink bollworm is present in 
the West Coast of Mexico or in Northwest Mexico, or that other 
conditions exist therein that would increase the hazard of pest 
introduction into the United States.
    (b) Permits for entry from Northwest Mexico as authorized in 
Sec. 319.8-13 of lint, linters, waste, cottonseed, cottonseed hulls, and 
covers that have been used for cotton, may be refused and existing 
permits cancelled by the Deputy Administrator if he has determined that 
the pink bollworm is present in Northwest Mexico or in the West Coast of 
Mexico, or that other conditions exist therein that would increase the 
hazard of pest introduction into the United States.

    Immediately upon arrival at a port of entry of any shipment of 
cotton or covers the importer shall submit in duplicate, through the 
United States Collector of Customs, or, in the case of Guam, through the 
Customs officer of the Government of Guam, and for the Plant Protection 
and Quarantine Programs, a notice of such arrival, on a form provided

    Every bale or other container of cotton lint, linters, waste, or 
covers imported or offered for entry shall be plainly marked or tagged 
with a bale number or other mark to distinguish it from other bales or 
containers of similar material. Bales of lint, linters, and waste from 
approved areas of Mexico, the West Coast of Mexico, or Northwest Mexico 
shall be tagged or otherwise marked to show the gin or mill of origin 
unless they are immediately exported.

Sec. 319.8-6  Cottonseed cake and cottonseed meal.

    Entry of cottonseed cake and cottonseed meal will be authorized 
through any port at which the services of an inspector are available, 
subject to examination by an inspector for freedom from contamination. 
If found to be free of contamination, importations of such cottonseed 
cake and cottonseed meal will be released from further plant quarantine 
entry restrictions. If found to be contaminated such importations will 
be refused entry or subjected as a condition of entry to such safeguards 
as the inspector may prescribe, according to a method selected by him 
from administratively authorized procedures known to be effective under 
the conditions under which the safeguards are applied.


<R05>
Sec. 319.8-7  Processed lint, linters, and waste.

    Entry of lint, linters, and waste will be authorized without 
treatment but upon compliance with other applicable requirements of this 
subpart when the inspector can determine that such lint, linters, and 
waste have been so processed by bleaching, dyeing, or other means, as to 
have removed all cottonseed or to have destroyed all insect life.

fumigation by approved methods at any port where approved fumigation 
facilities are available.
    (ii) Importations of such lint, linters, and waste, arriving at a 
northern port where there are no approved fumigation facilities may be 
entered for transportation in bond to another northern port where such 
facilities are available, for the required vacuum fumigation.
    (iii) Such lint, linters, and waste compressed to high density

Sec. 319.8-10  Covers.

    (a) Entry of covers (including bags, slit bags, and parts of bags) 
which have been used as containers for cotton grown or processed in 
countries other than the United States may be authorized either (1) 
through a Mexican border port named in the permit for vacuum fumigation 
by an approved method in that part of the United States within the 
generally infested pink bollworm regulated area; or (2) through a 
northern port or a port in the State of California subject to vacuum 
fumigation by an approved method or without vacuum fumigation when the 
covers are to be moved to an approved mill or plant for utilization. 
When such covers are forwarded from a northern port to a mill or plant 
in California for utilization, or from a California port to another 
California or northern port for vacuum fumigation thereat or for 
movement to a mill or plant for utilization such movement shall be made 
by an all-water route unless the bales are compressed to a density of 20 
pounds or more per cubic foot in which case the bales may be moved 
overland in van-type trucks or box cars if all-water transportation is 
not available. Such overland movement may be made only after approved 
surface treatment or under such other conditions as may be deemed 
necessary and are prescribed by the inspector. When such covers arrive 
at a port other than a northern, California, or Mexican border port they 
will be required to be transported therefrom immediately in bond by an 
all-water route to a northern or California port where approved vacuum 
fumigation facilities are available for vacuum fumigation thereat by an 
approved method or for forwarding therefrom to an approved mill or plant 
for utilization.
    (b) American cotton bagging, commonly known as coarse gunny, which 
has been used to cover only cotton grown or processed in the United 
States, may be authorized entry at any port under permit and upon 
compliance with Secs. 319.8-4 and 319.8-5, without fumigation or other 
treatment. Marking patches of the finer burlaps or other fabrics when 
attached to bales of such bagging may be disregarded if, in the judgment 
of the inspector, they do not present a risk of carrying live pink 
bollworms, golden nematode cysts or flag smut spores.
    (c) Bags, slit bags, parts of bags, and other covers which have been 
used as containers for root crops or are of a kind ordinarily used as 
containers for root crops may be authorized entry subject to immediate 
treatment in such manner and according to such method as the inspector 
may select from administratively authorized procedures known to be 
effective under the conditions under which the treatment is applied, and 
subject to any additional safeguard measures that may be prescribed by 
the inspector pursuant to Sec. 319.8-24, or that he may prescribe in 
regard to the manner of discharge from the carrier and conveyance to the 
place of treatment: Provided, That such covers may be authorized entry 
from Canada without treatment as prescribed in this paragraph unless the 
covers are found to be contaminated.
    (d) Bags, slit bags, parts of bags, and other covers that have been 
used as containers for wheat or wheat products that have not been so 
processed as to have destroyed all flag smut disease spores, or that 
have been used as containers for field seeds separated from wheat during 
the process of screening, and which arrive from a country named in 
Sec. 319.59-2(a)(2) of this part, if intended for reuse in this country 
as grain containers may be authorized entry, subject to immediate 
treatment at the port of arrival. If such covers are not intended to be 
reused in this country as grain containers their entry may be authorized 
subject to movement for utilization to an approved mill or plant

the owner or operator of which has executed an appropriate agreement 
with the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs similar to that 
described in Sec. 319.8-8(a)(2). Covers coming within this paragraph 
only, may be entered without permit other than the authorization 
provided in this paragraph and without other restriction under this 
subpart upon presentation to an inspector of satisfactory evidence that 
they have been used only for grains exported from the United States and 
are being returned empty without use abroad and that while abroad they 
have been handled in a manner to prevent their contamination.
    (e) When upon arrival at a port of entry any shipment of bags, slit 
bags, parts of bags, or other covers, is found to include one or more 
bales containing material the importation of which is regulated by 
paragraph (a), (c), or (d) of this section, the entire shipment, or any 
portion thereof, may be required by the inspector to be treated as 
specified in the applicable paragraph.
    (f) If upon their arrival at a port of entry covers are classified 
by the inspector as coming within more than one paragraph of this 
section, they will be authorized entry only upon compliance with such 
requirements of the applicable paragraphs as the inspector may deem 
necessary to prevent the introduction of plant diseases and insect 
pests.
    (g) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other paragraph of this 
section the entry from any country of bags, slit bags, parts of bags, 
and other covers will be authorized without treatment but upon 
compliance with other applicable sections of this subpart if the 
inspector finds that they have obviously not been used in a manner that 
would contaminate them or when in the inspector's opinion there is 
otherwise no plant pest risk associated with their entry.

    (a)(1) Vacuum fumigation as required in this subpart shall consist 
of fumigation, in a vacuum fumigation plant approved by the Deputy 
Administrator of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs, under the 
supervision of an inspector and to his satisfaction. Continued approval 
of the plant will be contingent upon the granting by the operator 
thereof, to the inspector, of access to all parts of the plant at all 
reasonable hours for the purpose of supervising sanitary and other 
operating conditions, checking the efficacy of the apparatus and 
chemical operations, and determining that wastage has been cleaned up 
and disposed of in a manner satisfactory to the inspector; and upon the 
maintenance at the plant of conditions satisfactory to the inspector.
    (2) After cotton and covers have been vacuum fumigated they shall be 
so marked under the supervision of an inspector. Such material may 
thereafter be distributed, forwarded, or shipped without further plant 
quarantine entry restriction.
    (3) Cotton and covers held by an importer for vacuum fumigation must 
be stored under conditions satisfactory to the inspector.
    (4) Prompt vacuum fumigation of cotton and covers (other than high 
density cotton free of surface contamination) will be required at non-
northern ports. Similar prompt vacuum fumigation will be required at 
Norfolk, Virginia, during the period June 15 to October 15 of each year, 
except for covers which have been used to contain only lint, linters, or 
waste, and the bales of which are compressed to a density of 28 or more 
pounds per cubic foot and are free of surface contamination.
    (b) An inspector may authorize the substitution of processing, 
utilization, or other form of treatment for vacuum fumigation when in 
his opinion such other treatment, selected by him from administratively 
authorized procedures, will be effective in eliminating infestation of 
the pink bollworm.

to the inspector.

[[Page 196]]

    (b) If, in the judgment of an inspector, it is necessary as a 
safeguard against risk of pest dispersal to clean railway cars, 
lighters, trucks, and other vehicles and vessels used for transporting 
such cotton or covers, or to clean piers, warehouses, fumigation plants, 
mills, or other premises used in connection with importation of such 
cotton or covers, the importer or his agent shall perform such cleaning, 
in a manner satisfactory to the inspector.
    (c) All costs incident to such collection, disposal, and cleaning 
other than the services of the inspector during his regular tour of duty 
and at the usual place of duty, shall be borne by the importer or his 
agent.

assume responsibility for any costs or charges, other than those 
indicated in this section, in connection with the entry, inspection, 
treatment, conditioning, storage, forwarding, or any other operation of 
any character incidental to the physical entry of an importation of a 
restricted material.


<R05>
Sec. 319.8-26  Material refused entry.

    Any material refused entry for noncompliance with the requirements 
of this subpart shall be promptly removed from the United States or 
abandoned by the importer for destruction, and pending such action shall 
be subject to the immediate application of such safeguards against 
escape of plant pests as the inspector may prescribe. If such material 
is not promptly safeguarded by the importer, removed from the United 
States, or abandoned for destruction to the satisfaction of the 
inspector it may be seized, destroyed, or otherwise disposed of in 
accordance with section 10 of the Plant Quarantine Act (7 U.S.C. 164a). 
Neither the Department of Agriculture nor the inspector will be 
responsible for any costs accruing for demurrage, shipping charges, 
cartage, labor, chemicals, or other expenses incidental to the 
safeguarding or disposal of material refused entry by the inspector, nor 
will the Department of Agriculture or the inspector assume 
responsibility for the value of material destroyed.

Plant Quarantine Act approved August 20, 1912 (37 Stat. 315; 7 U.S.C. 
151-167), as amended, the importation into the United States of canes of 
sugarcane, or cuttings or parts thereof, sugarcane leaves, the bagasse, 
from all foreign countries and localities, is prohibited: Provided, That 
this prohibition shall not apply to importations by the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture for scientific or experimental purposes, nor to 
importations of specific materials which the Department may authorize 
under permit on condition that they have been or are to be so treated, 
processed, or manufactured that, in the judgment of the Department, 
their entry will involve no pest risk: Provided further, That whenever 
the Deputy Administrator of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs 
shall find that existing conditions as to pest risk involved in the 
importation of bagasse and related sugarcane products into Guam, make it 
safe to modify by making less stringent the restrictions of this section 
with respect to such importation, he shall publish such finding in 
administrative instructions, specifying the manner in which the 
restrictions shall be made less stringent and imposing such conditions 
on such importation as he deems necessary to carry out the purposes of 
this section, whereupon such modification shall become effective.
    (b) As used in this subpart, unless the context otherwise requires, 
the term ``United States'' means the States, the District of Columbia, 
Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States.

[[Page 223]]

    (i) The following States have entered into a postentry quarantine 
agreement in accordance with this paragraph:
    [Reserved]
    (2) In any such written agreement, the State shall agree to:
    (i) Establish State regulations and requirements prior to the 
effective date of the agreement and enforce such regulations and 
requirements necessary to inspect sites and plants growing in postentry 
quarantine and to monitor and enforce compliance with postentry 
quarantine growing in accordance with this section;
    (ii) Review pending permit applications for articles to be grown 
under postentry quarantine conditions in the State, upon request of 
Plant Protection and Quarantine, and report to the Postentry Quarantine 
Unit of Plant Protection and Quarantine whether the State would be able 
to provide inspection and monitoring services for the proposed postentry 
quarantine;
    (iii) Provide the services of State inspectors to: inspect sites to 
be used for postentry quarantine; report to the Postentry Quarantine 
Unit of Plant Protection and Quarantine whether the site is of adequate 
size to contain the number of plants proposed for importation, including 
potential increase if increase is allowed; inspect plants for evidence 
of exotic pests at least once during the first year and once during the 
second year for plants required to be grown in postentry quarantine for 
2 years, and at least once for plants required to be grown in quarantine 
for less than 2 years; and monitor and enforce compliance with the 
requirements of this section during the use of the sites for postentry 
quarantine;
    (iv) Report to the Postentry Quarantine Unit of Plant Protection and 
Quarantine any evidence of plant pests that are now know to exist in the 
United States and that are found at a postentry quarantine site by State 
inspectors; recommend to Plant Protection and Quarantine safeguards or 
mitigation measures to control the pests; and supervise the application 
of safeguards or mitigation measures approved by Plant Protection and 
Quarantine; and
    (v) Report to the Postentry Quarantine Unit of Plant Protection and 
Quarantine any propagation or increase in the number of plants that 
occurs during postentry quarantine.
    (3) In any such written agreement, the Administrator shall agree to:
    (i) Seek State review of permit applications for postentry 
quarantine material in that State, and issue permits only after 
determining that State services are available to monitor the postentry 
quarantine;
    (ii) Upon request of the State, provide training, technical advice, 
and pest identification services to State officials involved in 
providing postentry quarantine services in accordance with this section;
    (iii) Notify State officials, in writing and within ten days of the

State arrives in the United States, and notify State officials in 
writing when materials in postentry quarantine may be released from 
quarantine in their State.
    (4) Termination of State postentry quarantine agreement. A State 
postentry quarantine agreement may be terminated by either the 
Administrator or the State Plant Regulatory Official by giving written 
notice of termination to the other party. The effective date of the 
termination will be 60 days after the date of actual receipt of notice, 
with regard to future importation to that State of articles requiring 
postentry quarantine in accordance with this section. When a postentry 
quarantine agreement is terminated by either the State Plant Regulatory 
Official or the Administrator, APHIS and the affected State shall 
continue to provide postentry quarantine services in accordance with the 
postentry quarantine agreement, until the time the plant material is 
eligible to be released from quarantine, for all postentry quarantine 
material already in the State, and for all postentry quarantine material 
that arrives in the State prior to the effective date of termination.

quarantine

[[Page 224]]

growing agreement signed by the person (the importer) applying for a 
written permit in accordance with Sec. 319.37-3 for importation of the 
article and submitted to Plant Protection and Quarantine. On each 
postentry quarantine growing agreement, APHIS shall also obtain the 
signature of the State Plant Regulatory Official for the State in which 
regulated articles covered by the agreement will be grown. The postentry 
quarantine growing agreement shall specify the kind, number, and origin 
of plants to be imported, and shall certify to APHIS and to the State in 
which the articles are grown that the signer of the agreement will 
comply with the following conditions for the period of time specified 
below:
    (1) To grow such article or increase therefrom only on specified 
premises owned, rented, or otherwise in possession of the importer, 
within a space of dimensions designated by an inspector, and to move, 
propagate, or allow propagation of the article or increase therefrom or 
parts thereof only with the written permission of an inspector and only 
to the extent prescribed by the inspector;
    (2) To permit an inspector to have access to the specified premises 
for inspection of such article during regular business hours;

    (4) To keep the article separated from any domestic plant or plant 
product of the same genus by no less than 3 meters (approximately 10 
feet); and from any other imported plant or plant product by the same 
distance;
    (5) To allow or apply remedial measures (including destruction) 
determined by an inspector to be necessary to prevent the spread of an 
injurious plant disease, injurious insect pest, or other plant pest;
    (6) To notify an inspector, orally or in writing, within 30 days of 
the time the importer or the person in charge of the growing site finds 
any abnormality of the article, or the article dies or is killed by the 
importer, the person in charge of the growing site, or any other person; 
to retain the abnormal or dead article for at least 60 days following 
that date of notification; and to give the abnormal or dead article to 
an inspector upon request;
    (7) To grow the article or increase therefrom, if an article of 
Rubus spp. (cloudberry, blackberry, boysenberry, dewberry, loganberry, 
raspberry) from Europe, only in a screenhouse with screening of a 
minimum of 16 mesh per inch;
    (8) To grow the article or increase therefrom, if an article of 
Chrysanthemum spp. (chrysanthemum) or Dianthus spp. (carnation, sweet-
william), only in a greenhouse or other enclosed building; and
    (9) To comply with the above conditions for a period of 6 months 
after importation for an article of Chrysanthemum spp. (chrysanthemum), 
for a period of 1 year after importation for an article of Dianthus spp. 
(carnation, sweet-william), and for a period of 2 years after

    (f) Inspector-ordered disposal, movement, or safeguarding of 
restricted articles; costs and charges, civil and criminal liabilities.
    (1) Growing at unauthorized sites. If an inspector determines that 
any article subject to the postentry quarantine growing requirements of 
this section, or any increase therefrom, is being grown at an 
unauthorized site, the inspector may file an emergency action 
notification (PPQ form 523) with the owner of the article or the person 
who owns or is in possession of the site on which the article is being 
grown. The person named in the form 523 must, within the time specified 
in form 523, sign a postentry quarantine growing

agreement, destroy, ship to a point outside the United States, move to 
an authorized postentry quarantine site, and/or apply treatments or 
other safeguards to the article, the increase therefrom, or any portion 
of the article or the increase therefrom, as prescribed by an inspector 
to prevent the introduction of plant pests into the United States. In 
choosing which action to order and in setting the time limit for the 
action, the inspector shall consider the degree of pest risk presented 
by the plant pest(s) associated with the kind of article (including 
increase therefrom), the types of other host materials for the pest in 
or near the growing site, the climate and season at the site in relation 
to the pest's survival, and the availability of treatment facilities.
    (2) Growing at authorized sites. If an inspector determines that any 
article, or any increase therefrom, grown at a site specified in an 
authorized postentry quarantine growing agreement is being grown 
contrary to the provisions of this section, including in numbers greater 
than the number approved by the postentry quarantine growing agreement, 
or in a manner that otherwise presents a risk of introducing plant pests 
into the United States, the inspector shall issue an emergency action 
notification (PPQ form 523) to the person who signed the postentry 
quarantine growing agreement. That person shall be responsible for 
carrying out all actions specified in the emergency action notification. 
The emergency action notification may extend the time for which the 
articles and the increase therefrom must be grown under the postentry 
quarantine conditions specified in the authorized postentry quarantine 
growing agreement, or may require that the person named in the 
notification must destroy, ship to a point outside the United States, or 
apply treatments or other safeguards to the article, the increase 
therefrom, or any portion of the article or the increase therefrom, 
within the time specified in the emergency action notification. In 
choosing which action to order and in setting the time limit for the 
action, the inspector shall consider the degree of pest risk presented 
by the plant pest(s) associated with the kind of article (including 
increase therefrom), the types of other host materials for the pest in 
or near the growing site, the climate and season at the site in relation 
to the pest's survival, and the availability of treatment facilities.
    (3) Costs and charges. All costs pursuant to any action ordered by 
an inspector in accordance with this section shall be borne by the 
person who signed the postentry quarantine growing agreement covering 
the site where the articles were grown, or if no such agreement was 
signed, by the owner of the articles at the growing site.
    (4) Civil and criminal liabilities. Any person who moves an article 
subject to postentry quarantine growing requirements from the site 
specified for that article in an authorized postentry quarantine growing 
agreement, or who otherwise handles such an article contrary to the 
requirements of this section, shall be subject to such civil penalties 
and such criminal liabilities as are provided by 18 U.S.C. 1001, 7 
U.S.C. 150gg and 163, or other applicable Federal statutes.
    (g) State. As used in this section, ``State'' means each of the 50 
States of the United States, the District of Columbia, Guam, Northern 
Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands of the United States, 
and all other territories and possessions of the United States.

service of the country in which grown that the article meets conditions 
of growing, storing, and shipping in compliance with 7 CFR 319.37-8(f); 
and
    (6) If the accompanying phytosanitary certificate of inspection is 
endorsed by a Plant Protection and Quarantine inspector in the country 
of origin or at the time of offer for importation, representing a 
finding based on monitoring inspections that the conditions listed above 
are being met.
    (g) Pest risk evaluation standards for plants established in growing 
media. When evaluating a request to allow importation of additional taxa 
of plants established in growing media, the Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service will conduct the following analysis in determining 
the pest risks associated with each requested plant article and in 
determining whether or not to propose allowing importation into the 
United States of the requested plant article.
    (1) Collect commodity information. (i) Determine the kind of growing 
medium, origin and taxon of the regulated article.
    (ii) Collect information on the method of preparing the regulated 
article for importation.
    (iii) Evaluate history of past plant pest interceptions or 
introductions (including data from plant protection services of foreign 
countries) associated with each regulated article.
    (2) Catalog quarantine pests. For the regulated article specified in 
an application, determine what plant pests or potential plant pests are 
associated with the type of plant from which the regulated article was 
derived, in the country and locality of origin. A plant pest that meets 
one of the following criteria is a quarantine pest and will be further 
evaluated in accordance with paragraph (g)(3) of this section:
    (i) Non-indigenous plant pest not present in the United States;
    (ii) Non-indigenous plant pest, present in the United States and 
capable of further dissemination in the United States;
    (iii) Non-indigenous plant pest that is present in the United States 
and has reached probable limits of its ecological range, but differs 
genetically from the plant pest in the United States in a way that 
demonstrates a potential for greater damage potential in the United 
States;
    (iv) Native species of the United States that has reached probable 
limits of its ecological range, but differs genetically from the plant 
pest in the United States in a way that demonstrates a potential for 
greater damage potential in the United States; or
    (v) Non-indigenous or native plant pest that may be able to vector 
another plant pest that meets one of the criteria in (g)(2)(i) through 
(iv) of this section.
    (3) Conduct individual pest risk assessments. Each of the quarantine 
pests identified by application of the criteria in paragraph (g)(2) of 
this section will be evaluated based on the following estimates:
    (i) Estimate the probability the quarantine pest will be on, with, 
or in the regulated article at the time of importation;
    (ii) Estimate the probability the quarantine pest will survive in 
transit on the regulated article and enter the United States undetected;
    (iii) Estimate the probability of the quarantine pest colonizing 
once entered into the United States;
    (iv) Estimate the probability of the quarantine pest spreading 
beyond the colonized area; and
    (v) Estimate the actual and perceived economic, environmental and 
social damage that would occur if the quarantine pest is introduced, 
colonizes, and spreads.

[[Page 229]]

    (4) Determine overall estimation of risk based on compilation of 
component estimates. This step will evaluate whether the pest risk of 
importing a regulated article established in growing media, as developed 
through the estimates of paragraph (g)(3) of this section, is greater 
than the pest risk of importing the regulated article with bare roots as 
allowed by Sec. 319.37-8(a).
    (i) If the pest risk is determined to be the same or less, the 
regulated article established in growing media will be allowed 
importation under the same conditions as the same regulated article with 
bare roots.
    (ii) If the pest risk is determined to be greater for the regulated 
article established in growing media, APHIS will evaluate available 
mitigation measures to determine whether they would allow safe 
importation of the regulated article. Mitigation measures currently in 
use as requirements of this subsection, and any other mitigation methods 
relevant to the regulated article and plant pests involved, will be 
compared with the individual pest risk assessments in order to determine 
whether requiring particular mitigation measures in connection with 
importation of the regulated article would reduce the pest risk to a 
level equal to or less than the risk associated with importing the 
regulated article with bare roots as allowed by Sec. 319.37-8(a). If 
APHIS determines that use of particular mitigation measures could reduce 
the pest risk to this level, and determines that sufficient APHIS 
resources are available to implement or ensure implementation of the 
appropriate mitigation measures, APHIS will propose to allow importation 
into the United States of the requested regulated article if the 
appropriate mitigation measures are employed.

Sec. 319.40-2  General prohibitions and restrictions; relation to other regulations.

    (a) Permit required. Except for regulated articles exempted from 
this requirement by paragraph (c) of this section or Sec. 319.40-3, no 
regulated article may be imported unless a specific permit has been 
issued for importation of the regulated article in accordance with 
Sec. 319.40-4, and unless the regulated article meets all other 
applicable requirements of this subpart and any requirements specified 
by APHIS in the specific permit.
    (b) Importer document; documentation of type, quantity, and origin 
of regulated articles. Except for regulated articles exempted from this 
requirement by paragraph (c) of this section or Sec. 319.40-3, no 
regulated article may be imported unless it is accompanied by an 
importer document stating the following information. A certificate that 
contains this information may be used in lieu of an importer document at 
the option of the importer:
    (1) The genus and species of the tree from which the regulated 
article was derived;
    (2) The country, and locality if known, where the tree from which 
the regulated article was derived was harvested;
    (3) The quantity of the regulated article to be imported;
    (4) The use for which the regulated article is imported; and
    (5) Any treatments or handling of the regulated article required by 
this subpart that were performed prior to arrival at the port of first 
arrival.
    (c) Regulation of articles imported for propagation or human 
consumption. The requirements of this subpart do not apply to regulated 
articles that are allowed importation in accordance with Sec. 319.19, 
``Subpart--Citrus Canker and Other Citrus Diseases'', or Secs. 319.37 
through 319.37-14, ``Subpart--Nursery Stock, Plants, Roots, Bulbs, 
Seeds, and Other Plant Products''; or to regulated articles imported for 
human consumption that are allowed importation in accordance with 
Secs. 319.56 through 319.56-8, ``Subpart--Fruits and Vegetables.''
    (d) Regulated articles imported for experimental, scientific or 
educational purposes. Any regulated article may be imported without 
further restriction under this subpart if:
    (1) Imported by the United States Department of Agriculture for 
experimental, scientific, or educational purposes;
    (2) Imported pursuant to a Departmental permit issued by APHIS for 
the regulated article prior to its importation and kept on file at the 
port of first arrival; and
    (3) Imported under conditions specified on the Departmental permit 
and found by the Administrator to be adequate to prevent the 
introduction into the United States of plant pests.
    (e) Designation of additional regulated articles. An inspector may 
designate any article as a regulated article by giving written notice of 
the designation to the owner or person in possession or control of the 
article. APHIS will implement rulemaking to add articles designated as 
regulated articles to the definition of regulated article in 
Sec. 319.40-1 if importation of the article appears to present a 
recurring significant risk of introducing plant pests. Inspectors may 
designate an article as a regulated article after determining that:
    (1) The article was imported in the same container or hold as a 
regulated article;
    (2) Other articles of the same type imported from the same country 
have been found to carry plant pests; or
    (3) The article appears to be contaminated with regulated articles 
or soil.
    (f) In addition to meeting the requirements of this subpart, logs 
and pulpwood with bark attached imported from Canada are subject to the 
inspection and certification requirements for gypsy moth in Sec. 319.77-
4 of this part.

Sec. 319.40-4  Application for a permit to import regulated articles; issuance and withdrawal of permits.

    (a) Application procedure. A written application for a permit 
<SUP>1</SUP> must be submitted to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Port Operations Permit Unit, 
4700 River Road Unit 136, Riverdale, MD 20737-1236. The completed 
application must include the following information:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Application forms for permits are available without charge from 
the Administrator, c/o the Permit Unit, Plant Protection and Quarantine, 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, 4700 River Road, Riverdale, MD 20737, or local offices of 
Plant Protection and Quarantine, which are listed in telephone 
directories.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) The specific type of regulated article to be imported, including 
the genus and species name of the tree from which the regulated article 
was derived;
    (2) Country, and locality if known, where the tree from which the 
regulated article was derived was harvested;
    (3) The quantity of the regulated article to be imported;
    (4) A description of any processing, treatment or handling of the 
regulated article to be performed prior to importation, including the 
location where any processing or treatment was or will be performed and 
the names and dosage of any chemicals employed in treatments;
    (5) A description of any processing, treatment, or handling of the 
regulated article intended to be performed following importation, 
including the location where any processing or treatment will be 
performed and the names and dosage of any chemicals employed in 
treatments;
    (6) Whether the regulated article will or will not be imported in a 
sealed container or in a hold;
    (7) The means of conveyance to be used to import the regulated 
article;
    (8) The intended port of first arrival in the United States of the 
regulated article, and any subsequent ports in the United States at 
which regulated articles may be unloaded;
    (9) The destination and general intended use of the regulated 
article;
    (10) The name and address of the applicant and, if the applicant's 
address is not within the United States, the name and address of an 
agent in the United States whom the applicant names for acceptance of 
service of process; and
    (11) A statement certifying the applicant as the importer of record.
    (b) Review of application and issuance of permit. After receipt and 
review of the application, APHIS shall determine whether it appears that 
the regulated article at the time of importation will meet either the 
specific importation

[[Page 240]]

requirements in Sec. 319.40-5 or the universal importation requirements 
in Sec. 319.40-6.
    (1) If it appears that the regulated article proposed for 
importation will meet the requirements of either Sec. 319.40-5 or 
Sec. 319.40-6, a permit stating the applicable conditions for 
importation under this subpart shall be issued for the importation of 
the regulated article identified in the application.
    (2) If it appears that the regulated article proposed for 
importation will not meet the requirements of either Sec. 319.40-5 or 
Sec. 319.40-6 because these sections do not address the particular 
regulated article identified in the application, APHIS shall review the 
application by applying the plant pest risk assessment standards 
specified in Sec. 319.40-11.
    (i) If this review reveals that importation of the regulated article 
under a permit and subject to the inspection and other requirements in 
Sec. 319.40-9, but without any further conditions, will not result in 
the introduction of plant pests into the United States, a permit for 
importation of the regulated article shall be issued. The permit may 
only be issued in unique and unforeseen circumstances when the 
importation of the regulated article is not expected to recur.
    (ii) If this review reveals that the regulated article may be 
imported under conditions that would reduce the plant pest risk to an 
insignificant level, APHIS may implement rulemaking to add the 
additional conditions to this subpart, and after the regulations are 
effective, may issue a permit for importation of the regulated article.
    (3) No permit will be issued to an applicant who has had a permit 
withdrawn under paragraph (d) of this section during the 12 months prior 
to receipt of the permit application by APHIS, unless the withdrawn 
permit has been reinstated upon appeal.
    (c) Permit does not guarantee eligibility for import. Even if a 
permit has been issued for the importation of a regulated article, the 
regulated article may be imported only if all applicable requirements of 
this subpart are met and only if an inspector at the port of first 
arrival determines that no emergency measures pursuant to the Federal 
Plant Pest Act or other measures pursuant to the Plant Quarantine Act 
are necessary with respect to the regulated article.<SUP>2</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Section 105(a) of the Federal Plant Pest Act (7 U.S.C. 150dd(a)) 
provides, among other things, that the Secretary of Agriculture may, 
whenever he deems it necessary as an emergency measure in order to 
prevent the dissemination of any plant pest new to or not theretofore 
known to be widely prevalent or distributed within and throughout the 
United States, seize, quarantine, treat, apply other remedial measures 
to, destroy, or dispose of, in such manner as he deems appropriate, 
subject to section 105(d) of the Federal Plant Pest Act (7 U.S.C. 
150dd(d)), any product or article, including any article subject to this 
subpart, which is moving into or through the United States, and which he 
has reason to believe is infested with any such plant pest at the time 
of the movement, or which has moved into the United States, and which he 
has reason to believe was infested with any such plant pest at the time 
of the movement. Section 10 of the Plant Quarantine Act (7 U.S.C. 164a) 
and section 107 of the Federal Plant Pest Act (7 U.S.C. 150ff) also 
authorize measures against regulated articles which are not in 
compliance with this subpart.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) Denial and withdrawal of permits. Any permit which has been 
issued may be withdrawn by an inspector or the Administrator if he or 
she determines that the person to whom the permit was issued has 
violated any requirement of this subpart. If the withdrawal is oral, the 
decision to withdraw the permit and the reasons for the withdrawal of 
the permit shall be confirmed in writing as promptly as circumstances 
permit. Any person whose permit has been denied or withdrawn may appeal 
the decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after 
receiving the written notification of the withdrawal. The appeal shall 
state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show 
that the permit was wrongfully denied or withdrawn. The Administrator 
shall grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for 
granting or denying the appeal as promptly as circumstances permit. If 
there is a conflict as to any material fact and the person from whom the 
permit is withdrawn requests a hearing, a hearing shall be held to 
resolve the conflict. Rules of

[[Page 241]]

practice concerning the hearing shall be adopted by the Administrator.

    (g) Solid wood packing material and merchandise from the Peoples 
Republic of China including Hong Kong. This paragraph does not apply to 
shipments transitting the Peoples Republic of China including Hong Kong 
from other countries en route to the United States, unless merchandise 
or solid wood packing material is added to such shipments while in the 
Peoples Republic of China including Hong Kong. Otherwise, merchandise 
exported from the Peoples Republic of China including Hong Kong that is 
accompanied by solid wood packing material may only be entered into the 
United States in accordance with this paragraph (g) and paragraph (i) of 
this section. This restriction applies to both merchandise that 
originated in the Peoples Republic

[[Page 243]]

of China including Hong Kong and merchandise that entered the Peoples 
Republic of China including Hong Kong for further processing or 
packaging, regardless of whether the merchandise moves directly from the 
Peoples Republic of China including Hong Kong to the United States or 
transits other countries en route to the United States.
    (1) Prior to exportation from the Peoples Republic of China 
including Hong Kong, any solid wood packing material must be heat 
treated, fumigated and aerated, or treated with preservatives, using a 
treatment schedule contained in Sec. 319.40-7 or in the Plant Protection 
and Quarantine Treatment Manual, which is incorporated by reference at 
Sec. 300.1 of this chapter. During the entire interval between treatment 
and export the solid wood packing material must be stored, handled, or 
safeguarded in a manner which excludes any infestation of the solid wood 
packing material by plant pests.
    (2) Any merchandise accompanied by solid wood packing material 
exported from the Peoples Republic of China including Hong Kong may only 
be entered if the importer has on file at its office, and retains there 
for a period of one year following the date of importation, the 
following documents:
    (i) A certificate signed by an official of the applicable government 
agency authorized by the government of the Peoples Republic of China or 
the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, stating 
that the solid wood packing material, prior to export from the Peoples 
Republic of China including Hong Kong, has been heat treated, fumigated 
and aerated, or treated with preservatives using a treatment schedule 
contained in Sec. 319.40-7 or in the Plant Protection and Quarantine 
Treatment Manual, and
    (ii) An importer statement (a written statement by the importer 
affirming that the importer has on file at his or her office the 
certificate required under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section).
    (3) In addition to the document requirements of paragraph (g)(2) of 
this section, a copy of the certificate must accompany all shipments 
that do not enter using the United States Customs Service's electronic 
entry filing and Automated Broker Interface.
    (4) Upon the request of an APHIS inspector or a United States 
Customs Service officer, the importer must produce a copy of the 
certificate and importer statement issued for any shipment.
    (5) At their option, in order to expedite release of a shipment, an 
importer may provide a certificate to the APHIS inspector at the port of 
first arrival prior to the arrival of the shipment. Exporters may also 
at their option, in order to expedite release of their shipment at the 
port of first arrival, arrange to have each article of solid wood 
packing material that has been treated marked at the treatment facility 
with a stamp or weatherproof label that reads CHINA TREATED. This type 
of marking, however, is not a substitute for the required certificate.
    (6) If an APHIS inspector determines that a shipment imported from 
the Peoples Republic of China including Hong Kong contains plant pests, 
or contains solid wood packing material that was not heat treated, 
fumigated and aerated, or treated with preservatives, the APHIS 
inspector may refuse entry of the entire shipment (merchandise and solid 
wood packing material). If an importer does not produce upon request by 
an APHIS inspector the certificate required for a shipment imported from 
the Peoples Republic of China including Hong Kong containing solid wood 
packing material, the APHIS inspector may refuse entry into the United 
States of the entire shipment (merchandise and solid wood packing 
material) until the certificate is produced. For any shipment refused 
entry, if the APHIS inspector determines that the merchandise may be 
separated from the solid wood packing material and that the solid wood 
packing material may be destroyed or reexported without risk of 
spreading plant pests, the inspector may allow the importer to separate 
the merchandise from the solid wood packing material at a location and 
within a time period specified by the inspector to prevent the 
dissemination of plant pests, and destroy or reexport the solid wood 
packing material under supervision of

[[Page 244]]

an inspector. The means used to destroy solid wood packing material 
under this section must be incineration, or chipping followed by 
incineration. The importer shall be responsible for all costs associated 
with inspection, separation, and destruction or reexportation of any 
solid wood packing material, including costs of the services of an 
inspector to monitor such activities, in accordance with Sec. 354.3(j) 
of this chapter. Any such costs may be charged to the importer's customs 
bond.
    (h) Cargo from the Peoples Republic of China including Hong Kong 
that does not contain solid wood packing material. Merchandise exported 
from the Peoples Republic of China including Hong Kong that is not 
accompanied by any solid wood packing material must have attached to the 
commercial invoice, the bill of lading, or the airway bill, an exporter 
statement stating that the shipment contains no solid wood packing 
material. As an alternative to attaching the exporter statement to the 
paperwork presented at entry, the importer may provide the exporter 
statement to the APHIS inspector at the port of entry prior to arrival 
of the shipment. Any shipment is subject to inspection for solid wood 
packing material, and if such inspection is ordered by an inspector, the 
shipment will not be granted entry into the United States prior to 
completion of the inspection. If the inspection reveals solid wood 
packing material, the inspector may refuse entry into the United States 
of the entire shipment (merchandise and solid wood packing material). 
Any shipment refused entry will be handled in accordance with the 
procedures in paragraph (g)(6) of this section. The importer shall be 
responsible for all costs associated with inspection, separation, and 
destruction or reexportation of any solid wood packing material, 
including costs of the services of an inspector to monitor such 
activities in accordance with Sec. 354.3(j) of this chapter. Any such 
costs may be charged to the importer's customs bond.
    (i) Special provisions for air overnight couriers and air express 
delivery companies. Overnight couriers and express delivery companies 
must present to an APHIS inspector at the port of first arrival, at or 
prior to the time of entry, one or more certificates for each arriving 
aircraft that carries packages employing solid wood packing material. 
The company may present one certificate in cases where the company has 
arranged treatment of all solid wood packing material on the flight, and 
may present multiple certificates in cases where packages with solid 
wood packing material were accepted for delivery by the company from 
multiple customers, each of whom arranged for treatment and 
certification of their respective packages. The certificates must be 
signed by an official of the applicable government agency authorized by 
the government of the Peoples Republic of China or the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region, and must state that the solid wood packing 
material, prior to export from the Peoples Republic of China including 
Hong Kong, has been heat treated, fumigated and aerated, or treated with 
preservatives using a treatment schedule contained in Sec. 319.40-7 or 
in the Plant Protection and Quarantine Treatment Manual. If the aircraft 
contains no packages that employ solid wood packing material, or 
contains both packages that do and do not employ solid wood packing 
material, the overnight courier or express delivery company must also 
present to an APHIS inspector at the port of first arrival, at or prior 
to the time of entry, one or more exporter statements stating that the 
packages on the aircraft not covered by a certificate contain no solid 
wood packing material.
    (j) Customs entry or entry summary filing requirements. By 
instruction, the United States Customs Service will inform importers of 
any information that may be required on entry or entry summary 
documentation under the Automated Broker Interface or other entry filing 
systems, electronic or otherwise, with regard to recording the existence 
of certificates, importer statements affirming that the importer has on 
file at his or her office any certificate required, and exporter 
statements that there is no solid wood packing material in a shipment.
    (k) Liability under the Customs import bond and international 
carrier bond. Any

[[Page 245]]

failure of an importer to comply with any of the provisions regarding 
the maintenance or presentation of records or information as prescribed 
in this subpart may result in liability under the Customs basic import 
bond. Any failure of a carrier to comply with any of the provisions 
regarding the maintenance or presentation of records or information as 
prescribed in this subpart may result in liability under the 
international carrier bond.

Sec. 319.40-7  Treatments and safeguards.

    (a) Certification of treatments or safeguards. If APHIS determines 
that a document required for the importation of regulated articles is 
inaccurate, the regulated articles which are the subject of the 
certificate or other document shall be refused entry into the United 
States. In addition, APHIS may determine not to accept any further 
certificates for the importation of regulated articles in accordance 
with this subpart from a country in which an inaccurate certificate is 
issued, and APHIS may determine not to allow the importation of any or 
all regulated articles from any such country, until corrective action 
acceptable to APHIS establishes that certificates issued in that country 
will be accurate.
    (b) Debarking. Except for raw lumber, no more than 2 percent of the 
surface of all regulated articles in a lot may retain bark, with no 
single regulated article retaining bark on more than 5 percent of its 
surface. For raw lumber, debarking must remove 100 percent of the bark.
    (c) Heat treatment. Heat treatment must be performed only at a 
facility where APHIS or an inspector authorized by the Administrator and 
the national government of the country in which the facility is located

Sec. 319.40-8  Processing at facilities operating under compliance agreements.

    (a) Any person who operates a facility in which imported regulated 
articles are processed may enter into a compliance agreement to 
facilitate the importation of regulated articles under this subpart. The 
compliance agreement shall specify the requirements necessary to prevent 
spread of plant pests from the facility, requirements to ensure the 
processing method effectively destroys plant pests, and the requirements 
for the application of chemical materials in accordance with the 
Treatment Manual. The compliance agreement shall also state that 
inspectors must be allowed access to the facility to monitor compliance 
with the requirements of the compliance agreement and of this subpart. 
Compliance agreement forms may be obtained from the Administrator or an 
inspector.
    (b) Any compliance agreement may be canceled by the inspector who is 
supervising its enforcement, orally or in writing, whenever the 
inspector finds that the person who entered into the compliance 
agreement has failed to comply with the conditions of the compliance 
agreement. If the cancellation is oral, the decision to cancel the 
compliance agreement and the reasons for cancellation of the compliance 
agreement shall be confirmed in writing, as promptly as circumstances 
permit. Any person whose compliance agreement has been canceled may 
appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after 
receiving written notification of the cancellation. The appeal shall 
state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show 
that the compliance agreement was wrongfully canceled. The Administrator 
shall grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for 
granting or denying the appeal, as promptly as circumstances permit. If 
there is a conflict as to any material fact and the person whose 
compliance agreement has been canceled requests a hearing, a hearing 
shall be held to resolve the conflict. Rules of practice concerning the 
hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.

Sec. 319.40-9  Inspection and other requirements at port of first arrival.

    (a) Procedures for all regulated articles. (1) All imported 
regulated articles shall be inspected at the port of first arrival. If 
the inspector finds signs of plant pests on or in the regulated article, 
or finds that the regulated article may have been associated with other 
articles infested with plant pests, the regulated article shall be 
cleaned or

[[Page 249]]

treated as required by an inspector, and the regulated article and any 
products of the regulated article shall also be subject to reinspection, 
cleaning, and treatment at the option of an inspector at any time and 
place before all applicable requirements of this subpart have been 
accomplished.
    (2) Regulated articles shall be assembled for inspection at the port 
of first arrival, or at any other place prescribed by an inspector, at a 
place and time and in a manner designated by an inspector.
    (3) If an inspector finds that an imported regulated article is so 
infested with a plant pest that, in the judgment of the inspector, the 
regulated article cannot be cleaned or treated, or contains soil or 
other prohibited contaminants, the entire lot may be refused entry into 
the United States.
    (4) No person shall move any imported regulated article from the 
port of first arrival unless and until an inspector notifies the person, 
in writing or through an electronic database, that the regulated 
article:
    (i) Is in compliance with all applicable regulations and has been 
inspected and found to be apparently free of plant pests; \3\ or,
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Certain regulated articles may also be subject to Secs. 319.56 
through 319.56-8, ``Subpart--Fruits and Vegetables,'' or to Noxious Weed 
Act regulations under part 360 of this chapter, or to Endangered Species 
Act regulations under parts 355 and 356 of this chapter and 50 CFR parts 
17 and 23.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) Has been inspected and the inspector requires reinspection, 
cleaning, or treatment of the regulated article at a place other than 
the port of first arrival.
    (b) Notice of arrival; visual examination of regulated articles at 
port of first arrival. (1) At least 7 days prior to the expected date of 
arrival in the United States of a shipment of regulated articles 
imported in accordance with this subpart, the permittee or his or her 
agent must notify the APHIS Officer in Charge at the port of arrival of 
the date of expected arrival. The address and telephone number of the 
APHIS Officer in Charge will be specified in any specific permit issued 
by APHIS \4\. This notice may be in writing or by telephone. The notice 
must include the number of any specific permit issued for the regulated 
articles; the name, if any, of the means of conveyance carrying the 
regulated articles; the type and quantity of the regulated articles; the 
expected date of arrival; the country of origin of the regulated 
articles; the name and the number, if any, of the dock or area where the 
regulated articles are to be unloaded; and the name of the importer or 
broker at the port of arrival.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ A list of APHIS Officers in Charge may be obtained from the 
Administrator, c/o Port Operations, Plant Protection and Quarantine, 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, 4700 River Road, Riverdale, 
MD 20737.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Imported regulated articles which have been debarked in 
accordance with Sec. 319.40-7(b) and can be safely and practically 
inspected will be visually examined for plant pests by an inspector at 
the port of first arrival. If plant pests are found on or in the 
regulated articles or if the regulated article cannot be safely and 
practically inspected, the regulated articles must be treated in 
accordance with the Treatment Manual.
    (c) Marking and identity of regulated articles. Any regulated 
article, at the time of importation shall bear on the outer container 
(if in a container), on the regulated article (if not in a container), 
or on a document accompanying the regulated article the following 
information:
    (1) General nature and quantity of the regulated articles;
    (2) Country and locality, if known, where the tree from which the 
regulated article was derived was harvested;
    (3) Name and address of the person importing the regulated article;
    (4) Name and address of consignee of the regulated article;
    (5) Identifying shipper's mark and number; and
    (6) Number of the permit (if one was issued) authorizing the 
importation of the regulated article into the United States.
    (d) Sampling for plant pests at port of first arrival. Any imported 
regulated article may be sampled for plant pests at the port of first 
arrival. If an inspector finds it necessary to order treatment of

[[Page 250]]

a regulated article at the port of first arrival, any sampling will be 
done prior to treatment.


<R05>
Sec. 319.40-10  Costs and charges.

    The services of an inspector during regularly assigned hours of duty 
and at the usual places of duty shall be furnished without cost to the 
importer.\5\ The inspector may require the importer to furnish any 
labor, chemicals, packing materials, or other supplies required in 
handling regulated articles under this subpart. APHIS will not be 
responsible for any costs or charges, other than those identified in 
this section.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Provisions relating to costs for other services of an inspector, 
including services related to extra inspection and separation of cargo 
from packing material for shipments that arrive without a complete 
certificate or exporter statement as required, are contained in part 354

<R05>
Sec. 319.40-11  Plant pest risk assessment standards.

    When evaluating a request to import a regulated article not allowed 
importation under this subpart, or a request to import a regulated 
article under conditions other than those prescribed by this subpart, 
APHIS will conduct the following analysis to determine the plant pest 
risks associated with each requested importation in order to determine 
whether or not to issue a permit under this subpart or to propose 
regulations establishing conditions for the importation into the United 
States of the regulated article.
    (a) Collecting commodity information. (1) APHIS will evaluate the 
application for information describing the regulated article and the 
origin, processing, treatment, and handling of the regulated article; 
and
    (2) APHIS will evaluate history of past plant pest interceptions or 
introductions (including data from foreign countries) associated with 
the regulated article.
    (b) Cataloging quarantine pests. For the regulated article specified 
in an application, APHIS will determine what plant pests or potential 
plant pests are associated with the type of tree from which the 
regulated article was derived, in the country and locality from which 
the regulated article is to be exported. A plant pest that meets one of 
the following criteria is a quarantine pest and will be further 
evaluated in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section:
    (1) Non-indigenous plant pest not present in the United States;
    (2) Non-indigenous plant pest, present in the United States and 
capable of further dissemination in the United States;
    (3) Non-indigenous plant pest that is present in the United States 
and has reached probable limits of its ecological range, but differs 
genetically from the plant pest in the United States in a way that 
demonstrates a potential for greater damage potential in the United 
States;
    (4) Native species of the United States that has reached probable 
limits of its ecological range, but differs genetically from the plant 
pest in the United States in a way that demonstrates a potential for 
greater damage potential in the United States; or
    (5) Non-indigenous or native plant pest that may be able to vector 
another plant pest that meets one of the criteria in paragraphs (b)(1) 
through (4) of this section.
    (c) Determining which quarantine pests to assess. (1) APHIS will 
divide quarantine pests identified in paragraph (b) of this section into 
groups depending upon where the plant pest is most likely to be found. 
The plant pests would be grouped as follows:
    (i) Plant pests found on the bark;
    (ii) Plant pests found under the bark; and
    (iii) Plant pests found in the wood.
    (2) APHIS will subdivide each of the groups in paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section into associated taxa.
    (3) APHIS will rank the plant pests in each group in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section according to plant pest risk, based on the 
available biological information and demonstrated plant pest importance.
    (4) APHIS will identify any plant pests ranked in paragraph (c)(3) 
of this

[[Page 251]]

section for which plant pest risk assessments have previously been 
performed in accordance with this section. APHIS will conduct individual 
plant pest risk assessments for the remaining plant pests, starting with 
the highest ranked plant pest(s) in each group.
    (5) The number of plant pests in each group to be evaluated through 
individual plant pest risk assessment will be based on biological 
similarities of members of the group as they relate to measures taken in 
connection with the importation of the regulated article to mitigate the 
plant pest risk associated with the regulated article. For example, if 
the plant pest risk assessment for the highest ranked plant pest 
indicates a need for a mitigation measure that would result in the same 
reduction of risk for other plant pests ranked in the group, the other 
members need not be subjected to individual plant pest risk assessment.
    (d) Conducting individual plant pest risk assessments. APHIS will 
evaluate each of the plant pests identified in paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section by:
    (1) Estimation of the probability of the plant pest being on, with, 
or in the regulated article at the time of importation;
    (2) Estimation of the probability of the plant pest surviving in 
transit on the regulated article and entering the United States 
undetected;
    (3) Estimation of the probability of the plant pest colonizing once 
it has entered into the United States;
    (4) Estimation of the probability of the plant pest spreading beyond 
any colonized area; and
    (5) Estimation of the damage to plants that could be expected upon 
introduction and dissemination within the United States of the plant 
pest.
    (e) Estimating unmitigated overall plant pest risk. APHIS will 
develop an estimation of the overall plant pest risk associated with 
importing the regulated article based on compilation of individual plant 
pest risk assessments performed in accordance with paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (f) Evaluating available requirements to determine whether they 
would allow safe importation of the regulated article. The requirements 
of this subpart, and any other requirements relevant to the regulated 
article and plant pests involved, will be compared with the individual 
plant pest risk assessments in order to determine whether particular 
conditions on the importation of the regulated article would reduce the 
plant pest risk to an insignificant level. If APHIS determines that the 
imposition of particular conditions on the importation of the regulated 
article could reduce the plant pest risk to an insignificant level, and 
determines that sufficient APHIS resources are available to implement or 
ensure implementation of the conditions, APHIS will implement rulemaking 
to allow importation of the requested regulated article under the 
conditions identified by the plant pest risk assessment process.

      Subpart--Indian Corn or Maize, Broomcorn, and Related Plants

                               Quarantine


<R05>
Sec. 319.41  Notice of quarantine.

    (a) The fact has been determined by the Secretary of Agriculture, 
and notice given, that dangerous plant pests, including the so-called 
European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis Hubn.), and also other dangerous 
insects, as well as plant diseases not heretofore widely prevalent or 
distributed within and throughout the United States, exist, as to one or 
more of such pests, in Europe, Asia, Africa, Dominion of Canada, Mexico, 
Central and South America, and other foreign countries and localities, 
and may be introduced into this country through importations of the 
stalks or other parts of Indian corn or maize, broomcorn, and related 
plants.
    (b) The Secretary of Agriculture, under the authority conferred by 
the act of Congress approved August 20, 1912, known as the Plant 
Quarantine Act (37 Stat. 315; 7 U.S.C. 151-167), determined that it was 
necessary, in order to prevent the further introduction of the dangerous 
plant pests mentioned above, to forbid, except as provided in the rules 
and regulations supplemental hereto, the importation into the United 
States from all foreign countries and localities of the stalk and all 
other parts, whether used for packing or other purposes, in the raw or 
unmanufactured state, of Indian

[[Page 252]]

corn or maize (Zea mays L.), broomcorn (Andropogon sorghum var. 
technicus), sweet sorghums (Andropogon sorghum), grain sorghums 
(Andropogon sorghum), Sudan grass (Andropogon sorghum sudanensis), 
Johnson grass (Andropogon halepensis), sugarcane (Saccharum 
officinarum), including Japanese varieties, pearl millet (Pennisetum 
glaucum), napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum), teosinte (Euchlaena 
luxurians), and jobs-tears (Coix lachryma-Jobi).
    (c) Hereafter, and until further notice, by virtue of said act of 
Congress approved August 20, 1912, the importation into the United 
States of the stalk and all other parts of the plants enumerated above 
from all foreign countries and localities except as provided in the 
rules and regulations supplemental hereto, is prohibited: Provided, That 
whenever the Deputy Administrator of the Plant Protection and Quarantine 
Programs shall find that existing conditions as to pest risk involved in 
the importation of the articles to which the regulations supplemental 
hereto apply, make it safe to modify, by making less stringent, the 
restrictions contained in any of such regulations, he shall publish such 
findings in administrative instructions, specifying the manner in which 
the regulations shall be made less stringent, whereupon such 
modification shall become effective; or he may, when the public 
interests will permit, with respect to the importation of such articles 
into Guam, upon request in specific cases, authorize such importation 
under conditions, specified in the permit to carry out the purposes of 
this subpart, that are less stringent than those contained in the 
regulations.
    (d) As used in this subpart, unless the context otherwise requires, 
the term ``United States'' means the States, the District of Columbia, 
Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 319.41a  Administrative instructions relating to entry into Guam of broomcorn, brooms, and similar articles.

    (a) Broomcorn for manufacturing purposes, and brooms and similar 
articles made of broomcorn may be imported into Guam without further 
permit, other than the authorization contained in this section, and 
without other restriction under this subpart. Notice of arrival for such 
importations is not necessary inasmuch as there is available to the 
inspector the essential information normally supplied by the importer at 
time of importation. Inspection of such importations may be made under 
the general authority of Sec. 330.105(a) of this chapter. If an 
importation is found infected, infested, or contaminated with any plant 
pest and is not subject to disposal under this part 319, disposition may 
be made in accordance with Sec. 330.106 of this chapter.
    (b) Shelled corn and seeds of other plants listed in Sec. 319.41, 
and mature corn on the cob, may be imported into Guam without further 
permit, other than the authorization contained in this section and 
without other restriction under this subpart, but such importations are 
subject to the requirements of Sec. 319.37-4(a).
    (c) Green corn on the cob may be imported into Guam without 
restriction under this subpart, but such importations are subject to the 
requirements of Sec. 319.56-2.


<R05>
Sec. 319.41b  Administrative instructions prescribing conditions for entry of broomstraw without treatment.

    Broomstraw, sometimes referred to as ``combed stalkless'', when 
consisting of individual straws entirely free from stems, stalks, stubs 
of stalks, and leaves, may be imported from all countries without 
seasonal limitation through ports of entry designated in the permit, 
provided it is bundled and baled to prevent breakage and scattering and 
to facilitate inspection, in the following manner:
    (a) The broomstraw shall be assembled into bundles with the base of 
the

[[Page 253]]

individual straws at the same end, no alternating of layers being 
permitted.
    (b) Each bundle shall be securely tied to prevent breakage.
    (c) Individual bundles shall be compacted, grouped into bales, and 
so arranged that the butt of each bundle is exposed on the outside of 
the bale.
    (d) Each bale shall be securely bound to prevent shifting or 
loosening of the bundles in transit.
    (e) Broomstraw found upon inspection at the port of entry to contain 
stems, stalks, stubs of stalks, or leaves shall be sterilized under the 
supervision of an inspector. Broomstraw contaminated in the aforesaid 
manner, from countries other than those on the North or South American 
Continents or the West Indies, shall be considered as broomcorn and 
shall be subject to compliance with Sec. 319.41-3(b).

<R05>
Sec. 319.41-5  Condition of entry.

    (a) The entry of the articles covered by Sec. 319.41-1 is 
conditioned on their freedom from the European corn borer and other 
injurious insects and plant diseases, and upon their freedom from 
contamination with plant materials prohibited entry under other 
quarantines. All shipments of these articles shall be subject to 
inspection at the port of arrival by an inspector of the Plant 
Protection and Quarantine Programs, in order to determine their freedom 
from such insects and diseases and from contaminating materials, and to 
such sterilization, grinding, or other

[[Page 255]]

necessary treatment as the inspector may prescribe. Should an 
importation be found on inspection to be so infested or infected or 
contaminated that, in the judgment of the inspector, it can not be made 
safe by sterilization or other treatment, the entire shipment may be 
refused entry.
    (b) When entry under sterilization or other treatment is permitted, 
the importation will be released to the permittee for such treatment, 
upon the filing with the appropriate customs official of a bond in the 
amount of $5,000, or in an amount equal to the invoice value, if such 
value be less than $5,000, with approved sureties, and conditioned that 
the importation shall be sterilized or otherwise treated under the 
supervision of the inspector; that no bale or container shall be broken, 
opened, or removed from the port of arrival unless and until a written 
notice is given to said customs official by an inspector that the 
importation has been properly sterilized or treated; and that the 
importation shall be redelivered to said customs official within 30 days 
after its arrival.
    (c) Should a shipment requiring sterilization or other treatment 
under the provisions of the regulation in this subpart arrive at a port 
where facilities for such sterilization or other treatment are not 
maintained, such shipment shall either be promptly shipped under 
safeguards and by routing prescribed by the inspector to an approved 
port where facilities for sterilization or other treatment are 
available, or it shall be refused entry.
    (d) Other conditions of entry as applying to the certain classes of 
articles enumerated in Sec. 319.41-1 are:
    (1) Broomcorn. All importations of broomcorn shall be so baled as to 
prevent breakage and scattering in connection with the necessary 
handling and sterilization; if in the judgment of the inspector they are 
not so baled, entry may be refused. All importations of broomcorn shall 
be subject to such sterilization or other treatment as the inspector may 
require.
    (2) Articles made of broomcorn. Brooms or similar articles made of 
broomcorn shall be subject to sterilization unless their manufacture 
involves the substantial elimination of stems or such treatment of the 
included stems as in the judgment of the inspector shall preclude such 
articles from being the means of carriage of the European corn borer and 
of other injurious insects and plant diseases.

<R05>
Sec. 319.55  Notice of quarantine.

    (a) The fact has been determined by the Secretary of Agriculture, 
and notice is hereby given, (1) that injurious fungous diseases of rice, 
including downy, mildew (Sclerospora macrospora), leaf smut (Entyloma 
oryzae), blight (Oospora oryzetorum), and glume blotch (Melanomma 
glumarum), as well as dangerous insect pests, new to and not heretofore 
widely prevalent or distributed within and throughout the United States, 
exist, as to one or more of such diseases and pests, in Europe, Asia, 
Africa, Central America, South America, and other foreign countries and 
localities, and may be introduced into this country through importations 
of seed or paddy rice, rice straw, and rice hulls, and (2) that the 
unrestricted importation of seed or paddy rice from the Republic of 
Mexico and of rice straw and rice hulls from all foreign countries and 
localities may result in the entry into the United States of the 
injurious plant diseases heretofore enumerated, as well as insect pests.
    (b) Under authority conferred by the act of Congress approved August 
20, 1912, known as ``The Plant Quarantine Act'' (37 Stat. 315; 7 U.S.C. 
151-167), as amended, the Secretary of Agriculture does hereby declare 
that it is necessary, in order to prevent the introduction into the 
United States of the insect pests and plant diseases referred to, to 
forbid the importation into the United States of seed or paddy rice from 
all foreign countries and localities except the Republic of Mexico, and 
to restrict the importation of seed or paddy rice from the Republic of 
Mexico, and of rice straw and rice hulls from all foreign countries and 
localities.
    (c) On and after November 23, 1933, by virtue of the said act of 
Congress, the importation of seed or paddy rice into the United States 
from all foreign countries and localities except the Republic of Mexico 
is prohibited, and the importation of seed or paddy rice from the 
Republic of Mexico and of rice straw and rice hulls from all foreign 
countries and localities is forbidden except in accordance with the 
rules and regulations supplemental hereto: Provided, That whenever the 
Deputy Administrator of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs 
shall find that existing conditions as to pest risk involved in the 
importation of the articles to which the regulations supplemental hereto 
apply, make it safe to modify, by making less stringent, the 
restrictions contained in any of such regulations, he shall publish such 
findings in administrative instructions, specifying the manner in which 
the regulations shall be made less stringent, whereupon such 
modification shall become effective; or he may, when the public 
interests will permit, with respect to the importation of such articles 
into Guam, upon request in specific cases, authorize such importation 
under conditions, specified in the

[[Page 257]]

permit to carry out the purposes of this subpart, that are less 
stringent than those contained in the regulations.

the inspector, and to the delivery to the collector of customs by the 
inspector of a written notice that the seed or paddy rice has been 
inspected and found to be apparently free from plant diseases and insect 
pests or that the required treatment has been given. Should any shipment 
of such seed or paddy rice be found to be so infested with insect pests 
or infected with plant diseases that, in the judgment of the inspector, 
it cannot be cleaned by disinfection or other treatment, the entire 
shipment may be refused entry.

the collector of customs by the inspector, demand will be made by the 
collector for redelivery of the shipment into customs custody under the 
terms of the entry bond, and, if such redelivery is not made, the 
shipment shall be removed from the country or destroyed.

prevent scattering or wastage. If, in the judgment of the inspector, a 
shipment is not so bagged, baled, or wrapped, it shall be reconditioned

throughout the United States, which affect and may be carried by fruits 
and vegetables commercially imported into the United States or brought 
to the ports of the United States as ships' stores or casually by 
passengers or others, and
    (2) That the unrestricted importation of fruits and vegetables from 
the countries and localities enumerated may result in the entry into the 
United States of injurious insects, including fruit and melon flies 
(Tephritidae).
    (b) The Secretary of Agriculture, under authority conferred by the 
act of Congress approved August 20, 1912 (37 Stat. 315; 7 U.S.C. 151-

hereto, is prohibited: Provided, That whenever the Deputy Administrator 
for the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs shall find that 
existing conditions as to pest risk involved in the importation of the 
articles to which the regulations supplemental hereto apply, make it 
safe to modify, by making less stringent, the restrictions contained in 
any of such regulations, he shall publish such findings in 
administrative instructions, specifying the manner in which the 
regulations shall be made less stringent, whereupon such modification 
shall become effective; or he may, when the public interests will 
permit, with respect to the importation of such articles into Guam, upon 
request in specific cases, authorize such importation under conditions, 
specified in the permit to carry out the purposes of this subpart, that 
are less stringent than those contained in the regulations.

vegetable, its importation can be authorized without risk, and its 
importation is in compliance with the criteria of paragraph (f) of this 
section; or
    (4) Is imported from a definite area or district of the country of 
origin that is free from certain injurious insects that attack the fruit 
or vegetable, its importation can be authorized without risk, and the 
criteria of paragraph (f) of this section are met with regard to those 
certain insects, provided that all other injurious insects that attack 
the fruit or vegetable in the area or district of the country of origin 
have been eliminated from the fruit or vegetable by treatment or any 
other procedures that may be prescribed by the Administrator.
    (f) Before the Administrator may authorize importation of a fruit or 
vegetable under Sec. 319.56-2(e) (3) or (4), he or she must determine 
that the following criteria have been met:
    (1) Within the past 12 months, the plant protection service of the 
country of origin has established the absence of infestations of 
injurious insects known to attack fruits or vegetables in the definite 
area or district based on surveys performed in accordance with 
requirements approved by the Administrator as adequate to detect these 
infestations;
    (2) The country of origin has adopted and is enforcing requirements 
to prevent the introduction of injurious insects known to attack fruits 
and vegetables into the definite area or district of the country of 
origin that are deemed by the Administrator to be at least equivalent to 
those requirements imposed under this chapter to prevent the 
introduction into the United States and interstate spread of injurious 
insects; and
    (3) The plant protection service of the country of origin has 
submitted to the Administrator written detailed procedures for the 
conduct of surveys and the enforcement of requirements under this 
paragraph to prevent the introduction of injurious insects.

When used to authorize importation under Sec. 319.56-2(e)(3), the 
criteria must be applied to all injurious insects that attack the fruit 
or vegetable; when used to authorize importation under Sec. 319.56-
2(e)(4), the criteria must be applied to those particular injurious 
insects from which the area or district is to be considered free.
    (g) Each box of fruit or vegetables imported into the United States 
in accordance with Sec. 319.56-2(e) (3) or (4) and Sec. 319.56-2(f) must 
be clearly labelled with:
    (1) The name of the orchard or grove of origin, or the name of the 
grower, and

[[Page 263]]

    (2) The name of the municipality and state in which it was produced, 
and
    (3) The type and amount of fruit it contains.
    (h) The Administrator has determined that the following 
municipalities in Mexico meet the criteria of paragraphs (e) and (f) of 
this section with regard to the plant pests Ceratitis capitata, 
Anastrepha ludens, A. serpentina, A. obliqua, and A. fraterculus: 
Comondu, Loreto, and Mulege in the State of Baja California Sur; 
Bachiniva, Casas Grandes, Cuahutemoc, Guerrero, Namiquipa, and Nuevo 
Casas Grandes in the State of Chihuahua; and Altar, Atil, Bacum, Benito 
Juarez, Caborca, Cajeme, Carbo, Empalme, Etchojoa, Guaymas, Hermosillo, 
Huatabampo, Navajoa, Pitiquito, Plutarco Elias Calles, Puerto Penasco, 
San Luis Rio Colorado, San Miguel, and San Rio Muerto in the State of 
Sonora. Apples, apricots, grapefruit, oranges, peaches, persimmons, 
pomegranates, and tangerines may be imported from these areas without 
treatment for the pests named in this paragraph.
    (i) Pending development of adequate treating facilities in Guam, 
fruits and vegetables that are subject to treatment as a condition of 
entry therein must first be entered and treated in accordance with the 
requirements of this subpart at a U.S. port of arrival where such 
treating facilities are available.
    (j) The Administrator has determined that all Provinces in Chile 
meet the criteria of Sec. 319.56-2 (e) and (f) with regard to the insect 
pest Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly) (Ceratitis capitata) (Wiedemann). 
Fruits and vegetables from Chile otherwise eligible for importation 
under this subpart may be imported from these areas without treatment 
for Medfly.

Sec. 319.56-2a  Permits required for entry of chestnuts and acorns and certain coconuts.

    It has been determined that the drying and processing of chestnuts 
and acorns, and of coconuts imported into Guam from the Trust Territory, 
may not entirely eliminate risk of spread of injurious insects. 
Therefore, notice is hereby given that chestnuts and acorns of all 
varieties and species may be imported into any part of the United States 
from any foreign country and coconuts may be imported into Guam from the 
Trust Territory, only under permit and upon compliance with the 
safeguards prescribed therein pursuant to Sec. 319.56-2.


<R05>
Sec. 319.56-2b  Administrative instructions; conditions governing the entry of acorns and chestnuts.

    (a) Countries other than Canada and Mexico. Except for importations 
of acorns and chestnuts grown in and shipped from Canada and Mexico, 
acorns and chestnuts are permitted entry into the United States under 
permit, for purposes other than propagation, under the provisions of 
Sec. 319.56 as follows:
    (1) Condition of entry. Notwithstanding Sec. 319.56-2(e) (1) and 
(2), all shipments of acorns and chestnuts are required to be treated as 
a condition of entry. Fumigation with methyl bromide in accordance with 
procedures described in this section is effective against the chestnut 
and acorn weevils, Curculio elephas (Cyllenhal) and C. nucum Linnaeus; 
the nut fruit tortrix, et al., Laspeyresia splendana (Hubner), 
Laspeyresia spp., and Hemimene juliana (Curtis); and other insect pests 
of chestnuts and acorns. Accordingly, this treatment is approved as a 
condition of entry in connection with the issuance of permits under 
Sec. 319.56-4 for the importation of chestnuts and acorns from any 
country except Canada and Mexico.
    (2) Ports of entry. Acorns and chestnuts to be offered for entry may 
be shipped from the country of origin to United States ports which are 
named in the permit.
    (3) Approved fumigation. The approved treatment shall consist of 
fumigation with methyl bromide. The acorns and

[[Page 264]]

chestnuts may be fumigated in vacuum or normal atmospheric chambers, van 
containers, or tarpaulins that have been approved for that purpose by 
the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs. When the fumigation is 
carried out under tarpaulins or in van containers, it must be 
accomplished in a manner satisfactory to the inspector by insuring 
adequate air and commodity temperatures, and proper volatilization, 
distribution, and concentration of the fumigant. Fumigation with methyl 
bromide shall be in accordance with the following schedules:
    (i) In chamber at normal atmospheric pressure (NAP):

------------------------------------------------------------------------


The fumigation temperatures used in these treatment schedules shall be 
that of the nut kernels. Acorns and chestnuts fumigated in van 
containers or under tarpaulins must be stacked in the container to 
provide for circulation of the fumigant under the load. Refrigerated van 
containers fitted with floor grooves meet this requirement. Van 
containers not fitted with floor grooves and tarpaulins should have 
provision for air circulation under the load by use of dunnage or 
pallets. Minimum concentrations of fumigant during the exposure period 
shall be maintained as specified in the treatment schedules. Because of 
the presence of various gases emitted by the nuts, special filtering 
procedures will be necessary for determination of the actual fumigant 
concentrations. At the end of the treatment exposure period the nuts 
shall be aerated for a minimum of one-half hour.
    (4) Supervision of treatment. The treatment approved in this section 
must be conducted under the supervision of an inspector of the Plant 
Protection and

[[Page 265]]

Quarantine Programs. The inspector shall require such safeguards in each 
specific case for unloading and handling of the nuts at the port of 
entry, transportation of the nuts from the place of unloading to the 
treatment facilities, and their handling during fumigation and aeration 
as required by paragraph (a)(3) of this section, as he deems necessary 
to prevent the spread of plant pests and assure compliance with the 
provisions of this subpart. If any part of the treatment is conducted in 
the country of origin, the person or organization requesting the service 
must enter into a formal agreement with the Plant Protection and 
Quarantine Programs to secure the services of an inspector.
    (5) Costs. All costs of treatment, required safeguards, and 
supervision, other than the services of the supervising inspector during 
regularly assigned hours of duty and at the usual place of duty, shall 
be borne by the owner of the commodity or his representative.
    (6) Department not responsible for damages. The treatment prescribed 
in paragraph (a)(3) of this section is judged from experimental tests to 
be safe for use with acorns and chestnuts. However, the Department 
assumes no responsibility for any damage sustained through or in the 
course of the treatment, or because of safeguards required under 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
    (b) Canada and Mexico. Acorns and chestnuts grown in and shipped 
from Canada and Mexico for purposes other than propagation are enterable 
without permit or further restriction under this subpart.
    (c) Nuts for propagation. Acorns and chestnuts from any country may 
be imported for purposes of propagation only in accordance with 
Sec. 319.37.

<R05>
Sec. 319.56-2c  Administrative instructions authorizing the importation of frozen fruits and vegetables.

    (a) The type of treatment designated in this subpart as freezing 
shall be one of those treatments commonly known as quick freezing, sharp 
freezing, or frozen pack. In general this involves an initial quick 
freezing at subzero temperatures with subsequent storage and 
transportation handling at not higher than 20 deg. F. Any equivalent 
freezing method is also included in this designation.
    (b) The Deputy Administrator of the Plant Protection and Quarantine 
Programs, under authority contained in Sec. 319.56-2, hereby prescribes 
freezing as a satisfactory treatment for all fruits and vegetables 
enterable under permit under Sec. 319.56. Such frozen fruits and 
vegetables may be imported from any country under permit, on compliance 
with Secs. 319.56-1 through 319.56-7 (exclusive of non-related 
administrative instructions), at such ports as shall be authorized in 
the permits.
    (c) Such fruits and vegetables may not be removed from the vessel or 
vehicle transporting them until it has been determined by an inspector 
of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs that they are in a 
satisfactory frozen state on arrival in this country.
    (d) If the temperature of the fruits or vegetables in any part of 
such an importation is found to be above 20 deg. F. at the time of 
inspection upon arrival, the entire shipment shall remain on board the 
vessel or vehicle under such safeguards as may be prescribed by the 
inspector of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs until the 
temperature of the shipment is below 20 deg. F., or the shipment is 
transported outside the United States or its territorial waters, or is 
otherwise disposed of to the satisfaction of the inspector.
    (e) The importation from foreign countries of frozen fruits and 
vegetables is not authorized when such fruits and vegetables are subject 
to attack in the area of origin, by plant pests that may not, in the 
judgment of the Deputy Administrator of the Plant Protection and 
Quarantine Programs, be destroyed by freezing.
    (f) Freezing of fruits and vegetables as authorized in the 
instructions in this section is considered necessary for the elimination 
of pest risk, and no liability shall attach to the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture or to any officer or representative of that Department in 
the event of injury resulting to fruits or vegetables offered for entry 
in accordance with the instructions in this section.

<R05>
Sec. 319.56-2d  Administrative instructions for cold treatments of certain imported fruits.

    (a) Treatments authorized. Fresh fruits imported in accordance with 
this subpart and required under this subpart to receive cold treatment 
as a condition of entry must be cold treated in accordance with the 
Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) Treatment Manual, which is 
incorporated by reference at Sec. 300.1 of this chapter. The cold 
treatments listed in the PPQ Treatment Manual are authorized for any 
fruit required to be cold treated under this subpart.
    (b) Place and manner of treatments--(1) Places of precooling and 
refrigeration. Refrigeration may be conducted while the fruit is on 
shipboard in transit to the United States. If not so refrigerated, the 
fruit must be both precooled and refrigerated after arrival only in cold 
storage warehouses approved by the Deputy Administrator and located at 
the following ports: Atlantic ports north of, and including, Baltimore, 
MD; ports on the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway; Canadian border 
ports on the North Dakota border and east of North Dakota; the maritime 
ports of Wilmington, NC, Seattle, WA, and Gulfport, MS; Seattle-Tacoma 
International Airport, Seattle, WA; Hartsfield-Atlanta International 
Airport, Atlanta, GA; and Baltimore-Washington International and Dulles 
International airports, Washington, DC. Fruit which is to be 
refrigerated in transit shall be precooled either at a dockside 
refrigeration plant prior to loading aboard the carrying vessel, or 
aboard the carrying vessel. Refrigeration shall be completed in the 
compartment or room in which it is begun.
    (2) Precooling of fruit before departure. Fruit which is to be 
refrigerated in transit must be precooled to the temperature designated 
in or under paragraph (a) of this section. The precooling may be 
conducted in accordance with either paragraph (b)(2) (i) or (ii) of this 
section:
    (i) Fruit may be precooled at a dockside refrigeration plant prior 
to loading aboard the carrying vessel. Such fruit shall be precooled to 
a temperature at which it can be transferred to the refrigerated 
compartments on such vessel without a rise above the maximum temperature 
prescribed in or under paragraph (a) of this section. A responsible 
official of the Department of Agriculture of the country of origin shall 
sample fruit temperatures in all sections of the lot of fruit until he 
is satisfied that complete precooling has been accomplished in 
accordance with this section and shall issue a certificate to that 
effect. As the loading proceeds the certifying official shall take 
frequent temperature readings of individual boxes of fruit. A record of 
such temperature readings shall accompany the certificate.
    (ii) Fruit may be precooled aboard the carrying vessel. Such fruit 
shall be precooled in the same refrigerated compartments in which it is 
to be refrigerated. The boxes of the fruit shall be spaced by horizontal 
wooden strips, so that each has at least 1 inch of clearance above and 
below to allow free circulation of the cooling air. At least 2 inches of 
clearance shall be allowed between stacks of the fruit. Carriers 
desiring consideration of alternate spacing arrangements may apply to 
the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs.
    (3) Refrigeration in transit. (i) Refrigeration in transit shall 
consist of holding the fruit temperature at or below the maximum 
temperature level for the number of days prescribed in or under 
paragraph (a) of this section. A continuous, automatic temperature 
record under lock shall be maintained from at least four locations to be 
designated in each refrigerated compartment by an inspector of the Plant 
Protection and Quarantine Programs. In large refrigerated compartments 
additional temperature elements may be required. Charts from the 
temperature recording apparatus shall be made readily available to an 
inspector of such Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs at the port 
of arrival.
    (ii) Refrigeration shall begin when the loading of precooled fruit 
has been completed or when precooling aboard the vessel has been 
completed. Refrigeration shall continue until the vessel arrives at the 
port of destination and the fruit is released for unloading by an 
inspector of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs, even though

[[Page 267]]

this may prolong the refrigeration beyond the required period. At least 
once during every 24-hour period, the responsible ship's officer shall 
sign the temperature chart, noting thereon the date and time.
    (4) Safeguarding untreated fruit. Whenever fruit is offered for 
entry as cold treated in transit and it cannot be established to the 
satisfaction of such inspector that the fruit has received the required 
cold treatment, such safeguards against the spread of fruitfly 
infestation as the inspector may prescribe shall be immediately applied.
    (5) Cold treatment after arrival--(i) Delivery. Fruit to be both 
precooled and refrigerated after arrival in the United States shall be 
delivered under the supervision of an inspector of the Plant Protection 
and Quarantine Programs to the approved cold storage warehouse where 
such treatment is to be conducted.
    (ii) Precooling and refrigeration. The fruit must arrive at a 
temperature sufficiently low to prevent insect activity and shall be 
promptly precooled and refrigerated. An automatic, continuous 
temperature record is required of each refrigeration, like that 
prescribed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section for refrigeration in 
transit. The number of records required will be designated by the 
inspector for each refrigeration, depending upon the circumstances of 
each operation.
    (iii) Customs. Shipments offered for entry before cold treatment may 
be allowed to leave customs custody under redelivery bond for cold 
treatment. Final release of the shipment by the U.S. Collector of 
Customs, or, in the case of Guam, by the Customs officer of the 
Government of Guam, will be effected after the inspector has notified 
the said Customs official that the required cold treatment has been 
given.
    (iv) Special requirements for the maritime port of Wilmington, NC. 
Shipments of fruit arriving at the maritime port of Wilmington, NC, for 
cold treatment, in addition to meeting all of the requirements in

eugenol and McPhail traps, must be used within the 4 square miles 
surrounding the cold treatment facility.
    (I) During cold treatment, a backup system must be available to cold 
treat the shipments of fruit should the primary system malfunction. The 
facility must also have one or more reefers (cold holding rooms) and 
methods of

[[Page 269]]

identifying lots of treated and untreated fruits.
    (J) The cold treatment facility must have the ability to conduct 
methyl bromide fumigations on-site.
    (K) The cold treatment facility must have contingency plans, 
approved by the Deputy Administrator, for safely destroying or disposing 
of fruit.
    (6) Containers and season of arrival. Containers should be uniform 
and suitably constructed to maintain firm stacking in the compartment 
throughout the voyage. Shipments may be made during any season of the 
year. Untreated fruit arriving in broken containers must be immediately 
repacked under the supervision of an inspector or the contents must be 
immediately destroyed in a manner satisfactory to the inspector.
    (7) Procedures in country of origin. (i) By arrangement between the 
Deputy Administrator of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs and 
the equivalent official in the country of origin, certifying officials 
will be designated by the country of origin. Their signatures shall be 
filed with the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs.
    (ii) Each container of fruit intended for intransit refrigeration 
shall be stamped or marked as it is loaded on the carrying vessel so 
that it can be readily identified as such. Fruit being shipped under 
permit to be completely cold treated at the Port of New York or other 
subsequently designated northern ports shall not be so marked.
    (iii) Fruit precooled at a dockside refrigeration plant shall be 
transferred to the refrigerated compartments on the carrying vessel 
without a rise in temperature above the maximum for the desired 
refrigeration. When this transfer has been accomplished, the certifying 
official shall issue a certificate of precooling.
    (iv) Fruit to be precooled on the carrying vessel in the 
refrigerated compartments shall be loaded under supervision of the 
certifying official to assure that all packages have the proper 
clearance on all sides.
    (v) Fruit in transit for cold treatment after arrival shall be 
loaded in a separate compartment and segregated from any fruit that is 
being refrigerated in transit.
    (vi) Fruit not intended for any phase of cold treatment shall not be 
loaded in the same refrigerated compartment with fruit to be given such 
cold treatment.
    (vii) The certifying official shall calibrate the elements of the 
temperature recording instruments not more than 3 days prior to the 
loading of fruit, by immersing them in a 32 deg. F. mixture of crushed 
ice and fresh water, and recording their deviation from 32 deg. F. He 
shall also supervise the placement of the temperature elements in the 
proper places in the cargo of fruit.
    (viii) The certifying official shall record the following data, 
noting the date and time, on the temperature chart: (a) Commencement of 
loading of each compartment, (b) insertion of the sensing elements into 
the fruit, and (c) completion of loading of each compartment.
    (ix) The certificate of precooling, when required, shall be issued 
in quadruplicate, to cover the cargo of one vessel. The original 
certificate shall be airmailed to the inspector of the Plant Protection 
and Quarantine Programs in charge at the port of destination. One copy 
shall accompany the carrying vessel. The third copy shall be mailed to 
the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs, Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 
20520. A record showing calibration of the elements of the temperature 
recording instruments, as required in paragraph (b)(7)(vii) of this 
section shall be attached to each certificate, along with any record of 
the fruit temperature readings required in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this 
section. The certificate shall also show the identifying stamp or mark 
placed on all containers of fruit undergoing intransit refrigeration.
    (c) Approval of precooling plants, refrigerated compartments, 
warehouses. All precooling plants in the country of origin, the 
refrigerated compartments on the carrying vessels, and cold storage 
warehouses at the Port of New York or subsequently designated northern 
ports must have prior approval of the Deputy Administrator of the Plant 
Protection and Quarantine Programs before any

[[Page 270]]

phase of cold treatment is begun. Requests for such approval shall be 
made to the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs, Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, 
DC 20250. \1\ Hereafter before a shipboard refrigeration installation 
will be approved it must first be certified by the American Bureau of 
Shipping or a comparable agency as in good order, with the insulated 
spaces clean and otherwise in satisfactory condition.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Applications for permits to import fruit under this subpart may 
be made to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant 
Protection and Quarantine, Port Operations, Permit Unit, 4700 River Road 
Unit 136, Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1236.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) Caution and disclaimer. The cold treatments required for the 
entry of fruit are considered necessary for the elimination of plant 
pests, and no liability shall attach to the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture or to any officer or representative of that Department in 
the event injury results to fruit offered for entry in accordance with 
these instructions. In prescribing cold treatments of certain fruits, it 
should be emphasized that inexactness and carelessness in applying the 
treatments may result in injury to the fruit, or its rejection for 
entry. Oranges have been successfully cold treated for the false codling 
moth in commercial shipments at the temperature prescribed in paragraph 
(a)(2)(v) of this section. Since commercial varieties of oranges show a 
wide variation in acceptable refrigeration temperatures, it is 
recommended that extensive tests be made with each variety in the 
country of origin before shipping in commercial quantities.

Sec. 319.56-2e  Administrative instructions; conditions governing the entry of cipollini from Morocco.

    (a) Shipments of cipollini (Muscari comosum) from Morocco have 
frequently been found infested at time of entry with an injurious 
insect, Exosoma lusitanica, not known to occur in the United States. The 
limited type of inspection at our disposal is not considered adequate to 
detect all cases of infestation and, since the effectiveness of methyl 
bromide fumigation in freeing this product from the insect in question 
is now well established, it has been decided to require this fumigation 
as a condition of entry for future shipments.
    (b) On and after December 7, 1939, therefore, fumigation with methyl 
bromide will be a condition of entry for all shipments of cipollini from 
Morocco. This treatment shall be carried out under the supervision of a 
plant quarantine inspector at the expense of the importer, and release 
of the shipment will be withheld until the treatment has been completed. 
In addition to fumigation only such inspection will be given as the 
inspector may judge necessary from time to time to determine pest 
conditions on arrival or to assure himself of the effectiveness of the 
treatment.
    (c) The entry of cipollini from Morocco may be made only through the 
ports of New York and Boston at which ports facilities for vacuum 
fumigation with methyl bromide, as herein required, are available.

Sec. 319.56-2g  Administrative instructions prescribing method of treatment of garlic from specified countries.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in these administrative 
instructions, fumigation with methyl bromide in vacuum fumigation 
chambers, in accordance with the Plant Protection and Quarantine 
Treatment Manual, which is incorporated by reference at Sec. 300.1 of 
this chapter, is a condition of entry under permit for all shipments of 
garlic (Allium sativum) from Algeria, Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, 
Czech Republic, Egypt, Estonia, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, 
Hungary, Iran, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Morocco, 
Portugal, Romania, the area of the Russian Federation west of the Ural 
Mountains, Slovakia, South Africa (Republic of), Spain, Switzerland,

[[Page 271]]

Syria, Turkey, Ukraine, and the area of the former Yugoslavia. 
Fumigation is to be carried out under the supervision of a plant 
quarantine inspector and at the expense of the importer. While it is 
believed that the garlic will be unaffected by the fumigation, the 
treatment will be at the importer's risk. Such entry will be limited to 
ports named in the permits, where approved facilities for vacuum 
fumigation with methyl bromide are available.
    (b)(1) The following alternate procedure is approved by the Deputy 
Administrator of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs as a 
condition of entry under permit for shipments of garlic (Allium sativum) 
from Italy and Spain:
    (i) A certificate shall be obtained from the appropriate 
phytosanitary official of the country of origin to the effect that such 
garlic is free of living stages of Brachycerus spp. and Dyspessa ulula 
(Bkh.), said certification to be based on field inspection and 
certification and subsequent reexamination at the port of departure 
prior to exportation. The phytosanitary certificate to be issued by such 
official shall show the shipment to be either initially free from these 
pests or to have been fumigated.
    (ii) The original copy of the phytosanitary certificate shall be 
attached to the manifest accompanying the shipment. However, with the 
consent of the Plant Quarantine inspector, the importer may arrange to 
have the original phytosanitary certificate mailed direct to the 
Inspector in Charge, Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs, at the 
port of entry, if this will expedite inspection and release of certified 
shipments. If such an arrangement is made, a copy of the phytosanitary 
certificate shall be attached to the manifest accompanying the shipment.
    (iii) Shipments of certified Italian or Spanish garlic will be 
subject to inspection upon arrival in the United States and if found 
infested with living stages of Brachycerus spp. or Dyspessa ulula (Bkh.) 
shall be fumigated in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) The entry of certified garlic under the alternate procedure 
provided for in paragraph (b)(1) of this section will be limited to the 
ports named in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or such other ports as 
may subsequently be named in the permits.
    (3) Continuance of the alternate procedure provided for in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section for the importation of Italian or Spanish garlic 
is contingent upon the satisfactory observance of such procedure by the 
respective countries of origin.

Sec. 319.56-2h  Regulations governing the entry of grapes from Australia.

    (a) Importations allowed. (1) Grapes from Australia may be imported 
into the United States only if they are inspected by an inspector of the 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service [APHIS], either in Australia 
or the United States, and treated with an authorized treatment under the 
supervision of an APHIS inspector for the following pests: the 
Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata), the Queensland fruit fly 
(Dacus tryoni), and the light brown apple moth (Epiphyas postvittana).
    (2) If an APHIS inspector finds evidence of any other insect pests 
for which a treatment authorized in the Plant Protection and Quarantine 
Treatment Manual is available, the grapes will remain eligible for 
importation into the United States only if they are treated for the 
pests in Australia, or at their first port of arrival in the United 
States, under the supervision of an APHIS inspector.
    (b) Authorized treatments. Authorized treatments are listed in the 
Plant Protection and Quarantine Treatment Manual, which is incorporated 
by reference. For the full identification of this standard, see 
Sec. 300.1 of this chapter, ``Materials incorporated by reference.''
    (c) Trust Fund Agreement. Grapes that undergo the fumigation phase 
of their treatment in Australia may be imported into the United States 
only if the national plant protection service of

[[Page 272]]

Australia has entered into a trust fund agreement with APHIS. This 
agreement requires the national plant protection service of Australia to 
pay in advance all costs that APHIS estimates it will incur in providing 
services in Australia. These costs include administrative expenses and 
all salaries (including overtime and the Federal share of employee 
benefits), travel expenses, and other incidental expenses incurred by 
APHIS inspectors in performing these services. The agreement requires 
the national plant protection service of Australia to deposit a 
certified or cashier's check with APHIS for the amount of these costs, 
as estimated by APHIS. If the deposit is not sufficient to meet all 
costs incurred by APHIS, the agreement further requires the national 
plant protection service of Australia to deposit with APHIS a certified 
or cashier's check for the amount of the remaining costs, as determined 
by APHIS, before the grapes may be imported. After a final audit at the 
conclusion of each shipping season, any overpayment of funds would be 
returned to the national plant protection service of Australia, or held 
on account until needed.
    (d) Department not responsible for damage. The treatment for grapes 
from Australia prescribed in the Plant Protection and Quarantine 
Treatment Manual is judged from experimental tests to be safe. However, 
the Department assumes no responsibility for any damage sustained 
through or in the course of such treatment.

    (2) Treatment with an authorized treatment listed in the Plant 
Protection and Quarantine Treatment Manual will meet the treatment 
requirements imposed under Sec. 319.56-2 as a condition for the 
importation into the United States of mangoes from Mexico. Manila 
mangoes from Mexico may also be imported into the United States in 
accordance with Sec. 319.56-2f of this subpart. The Plant Protection and 
Quarantine Treatment Manual is incorporated by reference. For the full 
identification of this standard, see Sec. 300.1 of this chapter 
``Materials incorporated by reference.''
    (b) Department not responsible for damage. The treatments for 
mangoes prescribed in Sec. 319.56-2f of this subpart and in the Plant 
Protection and Quarantine Treatment Manual are judged from experimental 
tests to be safe. However, the Department assumes no responsibility for 
any damage sustained through or in the course of such treatment.

Sec. 319.56-2j  Conditions governing the entry of apples and pears from Australia (including Tasmania) and New Zealand. \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Apples and pears from Australia (excluding Tasmania) where 
certain tropical fruit flies occur are also subject to the cold 
treatment requirements of Sec. 319.56-2d.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Apples and pears from Australia (including Tasmania) and New Zealand 
may be imported only in accordance with Sec. 319.56-2(e) (2) or (3) and 
under permit and in compliance with this section and the other 
requirements of this subpart.
    (a) Conditions of entry--(1) Statistical sample inspection. A 
biometrically designed statistical sample will be taken under 
Sec. 319.56-6 by the inspector of the plant protection and quarantine 
programs from each shipment \3\ of apples and each shipment of pears 
moved from New Zealand or Australia (including

[[Page 273]]

Tasmania), that are offered for entry into the United States and, if 
inspection of such sample discloses that pests of the family Tortricidae 
(fruit-leaf roller complex) which are dangerous and destructive pests of 
apples and pears are not present in the shipment sampled and the 
shipment therefore does not present a risk of introducing such pest, 
such fruit may be imported under Sec. 319.56-2(e)(2) without treatment 
as prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. If any such pests are 
found on such inspection the shipment must be treated as prescribed in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     \3\A shipment is defined as all of a type (genus) of fruit from the 
same country of origin offered at a U.S. port and from a single carrier, 
regardless of marks and numbers, growers' lots, Customs entries, or 
numbers of importers involved.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Approved fumigation. Fumigation with methyl bromide in 
accordance with procedures described in this section is effective 
against certain insect pests of the family Tortricidae found in 
Australia (including Tasmania) and New Zealand. Accordingly, this 
treatment is required as a condition of entry under Sec. 319.56-2(e)(3) 
for any shipment of apples or pears required to be treated under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

The fruit may be fumigated in normal atmospheric chambers, under 
tarpaulins, in van trucks or other enclosures that have been approved 
for that purpose by an inspector of the plant protection and quarantine 
programs. When the fumigation is carried out, it must be accomplished in 
a manner satisfactory to the inspector to insure adequate air and 
commodity temperatures, and proper volatilization, distribution, and 
concentration of the fumigant, for effective destruction of all such 
pests present. Apples and pears to be fumigated may be packed in wooden 
crates, fiberboard cartons, or other gas-permeable containers. The fruit 
must be packed so as to provide for maximum distribution of the 
fumigant. If the fruit is packed in a gas-impervious liner, the liner 
must be perforated to provide for the entry and aeration of the methyl 
bromide gas. The individual fruit may be wrapped with tissue paper. 
Cubic feet of space under fumigation shall include the load of fruit to 
be fumigated. The exposure period shall begin when all the fumigant 
which has been introduced into the chamber or enclosure has been 
volatilized. The fumigation temperatures required in these treatments 
shall be that of the pulp temperatures of the fruit. Fumigation with 
methyl bromide shall be in accordance with the following schedules:

located and which are named in the permit.
    (4) Supervision of treatment. The treatment approved in this section 
must be conducted under the supervision of an inspector of the plant 
protection and quarantine programs. The inspector shall require such 
safeguards in each specific case for unloading and handling of the fruit 
at the port of entry, transportation of the fruit from the place of 
unloading to the treatment facilities, and its handling during 
fumigation and aeration as required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section, 
as he deems necessary to prevent the spread of insect pests and assure 
compliance with the provisions of this subpart.
    (5) Costs. All costs of treatment, required safeguards, and 
supervision,

other than the services of the supervising inspector during regularly 
assigned hours of duty and at the usual place of duty, shall be borne by 
the owner of the fruit or his representative.
    (6) Department not responsible for damages. The treatment prescribed 
in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is judged from experimental tests 
and uses for quarantine purposes to be safe for fumigation of apples and 
pears. However, the Department assumes no responsibility for any damage 
sustained through or in the course of the treatment or because of 
safeguards required under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

Sec. 319.56-2l  Administrative instructions prescribing method of treatment of imported yams.

    (a) Fumigation upon arrival. Except as otherwise provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section, approved fumigation with methyl bromide 
at normal atmospheric pressure, in accordance with the following 
procedure, upon arrival at the port of entry, is hereby prescribed as a 
condition of importation under permit under Sec. 319.56-2 for shipments 
of yams from all foreign countries.
    (1) Ports of entry. Yams to be offered for entry may be shipped, 
under permit under Sec. 319.56-2, direct from the country of origin to 
ports in the United States where approved fumigation facilities are 
available.
    (2) Approved fumigation. (i) The approved fumigation shall consist 
of fumigation with methyl bromide at normal atmospheric pressure, in a 
fumigation chamber that has been approved for that purpose by the Plant 
Protection and Quarantine Programs. The dosage shall be applied at the 
following rates:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                         Dosage (pounds of     Exposure
        Temperature, ( deg. F.)          methyl bromide per     period
                                         1,000 cubic feet)     (hours)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
90-96.................................           2.5              4
80-89.................................           3.0              4
70-79.................................           3.5              4
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) Yams to be fumigated may be packed in slatted crates or other 
gas-permeable containers. The fumigation chamber shall not be loaded to 
more than two-thirds of its capacity. The four-hour exposure period 
shall begin when all the fumigant has been introduced into the chamber 
and volatilized. Cubic feet of space shall include the load of yams to 
be fumigated. The required temperatures apply to both the air and the 
yams. Good circulation above and below the load shall be provided as 
soon as the yams are loaded in the chamber and shall continue during the 
full period of fumigation and until the yams have been removed to a 
well-ventilated location. Fumigation of yams below the minimum 
temperature prescribed in the fumigation schedule may result in injury 
to the yams and should be avoided. Yams are sensitive to bruising and 
should be carefully packed to prevent this. At the same time they should 
be given as much aeration as possible.
    (3) Other conditions. (i) Inspectors of the Plant Protection and 
Quarantine Programs will supervise the fumigation of yams and will 
specify such safeguards as may be necessary for their handling and 
transportation before and after fumigation, if, in the opinion of the 
inspector, this is necessary to assure there will be no pest risk 
associated with the importation and treatment. Final release of the yams 
for entry into the United States will be conditioned upon compliance 
with the specified safeguards.
    (ii) Supervision of approved fumigation chambers will, if 
practicable, be carried on as a part of normal port inspection 
activities. When so available such supervision will be furnished without 
cost to the owner of the yams or his representative.
    (4) Costs. All costs of treatment and required safeguards and 
supervision, other than the services of the supervising inspector during 
regularly assigned hours of duty and at the usual place of duty, shall 
be borne by the owner of the yams, or his representative.
    (5) Department not responsible for damage. While the prescribed 
treatment is judged from experimental tests to be safe for use with 
yams, the Department assumes no responsibility for any damage sustained 
through or in the course of treatment or because of pretreatment or 
posttreatment safeguards.
    (b) Alternate procedures. (1) Yams produced in Japan and offered for 
entry under a permit issued in accordance

[[Page 276]]

with Sec. 319.56-2 shall be subject to examination by an inspector at 
the port of entry. If this examination shows the yams to be free of 
plant pests, they may be imported without the fumigation required by 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) Yams produced in Cuba, if satisfactorily treated in Cuba and 
otherwise handled and certified as provided in this subparagraph will be 
eligible for entry under permit under Sec. 319.56-2.
    (i) Approved fumigation. The yams shall be fumigated at approved 
plants in Cuba in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (ii) Approval of fumigation plants; costs of supervision. Fumigation 
in Cuba will be contingent upon the availability of a fumigation plant, 
approved by the Deputy Administrator of the Plant Protection and 
Quarantine Programs, to apply the treatment prescribed in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section and upon the availability of qualified personnel 
for assignment to approve the plant and to supervise the treatment and 
posttreatment handling of the yams in Cuba. Those in interest must make 
advance arrangements for approval of the fumigation plant and for 
supervision, and furnish the Deputy Administrator of the Plant 
Protection and Quarantine Programs with acceptable assurances that they 
will provide, without cost to the United States Department of 
Agriculture, for all transportation, per diem, and other incidental 
expenses of such personnel and compensation for such personnel for their 
services in excess of 40 hours weekly, in connection with such approval 
and supervision, according to the rates established for the payment of 
inspectors of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs.
    (iii) Supervision of fumigation and subsequent handling. The 
fumigation prescribed in this paragraph and the subsequent handling of 
the yams so fumigated must be under the supervision of a representative 
of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs. The treated yams must 
be safeguarded against insect infestation during the period prior to 
shipment from Cuba, in a manner required by such representative.
    (iv) Certification. Yams will be certified by a representative of 
the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs in Cuba for entry into the 
United States upon the basis of treatment under this subparagraph and 
compliance with the posttreatment safeguard requirements imposed by such 
representative. The final release of the yams for entry into the United 
States will be conditioned upon compliance with such requirements and 
upon satisfactory inspection on arrival to determine efficacy of 
treatment.
    (v) Costs. All costs incident to fumigation, including those for 
construction, equipping, maintaining and operating fumigation plants and 
facilities, and carrying out requirements of posttreatment safeguards, 
and all costs as indicated in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section 
incident to plant approval and supervision of treatment and subsequent 
handling of the yams in Cuba shall be borne by the owner of the yams or 
his representative.
    (vi) Department not responsible for damage. The treatment prescribed 
in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is judged from experimental tests to 
be safe for use with yams. However, the Department assumes no 
responsibility for any damage sustained through or in the course of 
treatment, or because of posttreatment safeguards.
    (vii) Ports of entry. Yams to be offered for entry in accordance 
with the alternate procedure provided for in this subparagraph may be 
entered under permit under Sec. 319.56-2 at any United States port where 
an inspector is stationed.
    (viii) Ineligible shipments. Any shipments of yams produced in Cuba 
that are not eligible for certification under the alternate procedure 
provided for in this paragraph may enter only upon compliance with 
paragraph (a) of this section.

    (1) Fumigation and aeration. The approved fumigation shall consist 
of fumigation with methyl bromide at 70 deg. F. or above at normal 
atmospheric pressure in a fumigation chamber that has been approved for 
that purpose by the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs. The 
fumigation may also be accomplished under tarpaulins, in a manner 
satisfactory to the inspector, that will insure adequate air circulation 
and proper volatilization, distribution, and concentration of the 
fumigant. The fruit may be packed in field boxes, slatted crates, or 
well-perforated, unwaxed cardboard cartons with approved packing 
material such as wood excelsior or cardboard dividers. The fruit may be 
individually wrapped with conventional tissue which is gas permeable. 
When stacking the fruit for fumigation, spacing must be provided to 
insure adequate gas circulation. The load shall not exceed 80 percent of 
the volume of the area under fumigation. Following the fumigation, an 
aeration period of 2 hours is required.
    (2) Precooling and refrigeration period. At the conclusion of the 
aeration period, the fruit shall be precooled and refrigerated in 
approved facilities for any one of the periods designated in the table 
in this section. Cooling shall begin as soon as possible after the 
aeration period, but in no event may the time lapse between the 
termination of fumigation and the beginning of the precooling exceed 24 
hours. Cooling to the required refrigeration temperature shall be 
effected as soon as possible. The refrigeration period shall not 
commence until the fruit pulp temperatures indicate the prescribed 
temperature range has been reached.
    (c) Supervision of treatment and subsequent handling. The treatment 
approved in this section and the subsequent handling of the fruit so 
treated must be conducted under the supervision of an inspector of the 
Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs. If any part of the treatment 
is conducted in the country of origin, the organization requesting the 
service must enter into a formal agreement with this Plant Protection 
and Quarantine Programs to secure the services of an inspector.
    (d) Costs. All costs of treatment, required safeguards, and 
supervision of treatments by the inspector shall be borne by the owner 
of the fruit, or his representative, when the treatment is given in 
foreign countries. There is no charge for supervision of treatments 
given at authorized U.S. ports of entry during regularly scheduled hours 
of duty.
    (e) Department not responsible for damage. The treatment prescribed 
in paragraph (b) of this section is judged from limited experimental 
tests to be safe for use with fruits likely to be infested with the 
Mediterranean fruit fly or the oriental fruit fly, or with the grape 
vine moth or other pests of grapes or other fruits from Chile. However, 
the Department assumes no responsibility for any damage sustained 
through or in the course of the treatment. There has not been an 
opportunity to test the treatment on all varieties of fruits that may be 
offered for entry from various countries. It is recommended that the 
phytotoxicity of the treatment to the variety to be shipped shall be 
tested by exporters in the country of origin or by means of test 
shipments sent to this country.

Sec. 319.56-2o  Administrative instructions prescribing method of treatment of avocados for the Mediterranean fruit fly, the melon fly, and the oriental fruit 
          fly.

    Fumigation with methyl bromide at normal atmospheric pressure 
followed by refrigerated storage in accordance with the procedures 
described in this section is effective against the Mediterranean fruit 
fly, the melon fly, and the oriental fruit fly in avocados but is not 
effective against other dangerous pests of this fruit. Accordingly, this 
treatment will be approved for treatment of avocados in connection with 
the issuance of permits under Sec. 319.56-4 for the importation of 
avocados from any country when it is determined that the pest risk 
involved in the proposed importation is such that it will be eliminated 
by this treatment.

[[Page 281]]

    (a) Ports of entry. Avocados offered for entry will be regulated by 
one of the following provisions:
    (1) Avocados certified as having received the combined fumigation-
refrigeration treatment in the country of origin immediately prior to 
shipment are enterable at all ports under permit.
    (2) Avocados certified as having been fumigated in the country of 
origin and which are receiving the refrigeration storage on board 
approved transiting vessels are enterable at the U.S. ports named in the 
permit upon completion of the refrigerated storage period.
    (3) Avocados which have not been treated are enterable at the ports 
named in the permit for treatment upon arrival.
    (b) Approved treatment. The phases of the combination treatment 
shall consist of fumigation and aeration; and a precooling and 
refrigeration period.
    (1) The fumigant shall be methyl bromide applied at normal 
atmospheric pressure in an enclosure which has been approved for that 
purpose by the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs. The dosage 
shall be two pounds per 1,000 cubic feet for 2\1/2\ hours at 70 deg. F. 
or above. At the conclusion of the 2\1/2\-hour exposure period, the 
avocados shall be aerated for minimum of 30 minutes. Avocados to be 
fumigated shall be restricted to fruit at the mature green stage of 
development and be arranged in ventilated wooden boxes, without packing 
material or wrappings. Fumigation chambers should not be loaded to more 
than two-thirds of their capacity. Tarpaulin enclosures should not be 
loaded to more than 80 percent of their capacity. The 2\1/2\-hour 
exposure period shall begin when all the fumigant has been volatilized 
and introduced into the enclosure. Forced circulation above and below 
the load, and between individual containers, shall be provided as soon 
as the avocados are loaded in the chamber and shall continue during the 
full period of fumigation and until the avocados have been removed to a 
well ventilated location.
    (2) The refrigerated phase of the treatment shall consist of 
refrigeration for 7 days at 45 deg. F. or below. Cooling of the fruit 
must begin within 24 hours following the fumigation. The refrigerated 
storage shall consist of 7 days at fruit pulp temperature of 45 deg. F. 
or below. The time required to cool the pulp temperature to 45 deg. F. 
or below may be included in the 7-day period provided the cooling is 
accomplished in 24 hours or less. Temperature sensors inserted in the 
avocados will determine when pulp temperatures have reached 45 deg. F. 
or below.
    (c) Supervision of treatments and subsequent handling. The treatment 
approved in this section and the subsequent handling of the avocados so 
treated must be conducted under the supervision of an Inspector of the 
Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs. If any part of the treatment 
is conducted in the country of origin, the organization requesting the 
service must enter into a formal agreement with this Plant Protection 
and Quarantine Programs to secure the services of an inspector.
    (d) Costs. All costs of treatment, required safeguards, and 
supervision of treatments by the inspector shall be borne by the owner 
of the avocados or his representative when the treatment is given in 
foreign countries. There is no charge for supervision of treatments 
given at authorized U.S. ports of entry during regularly scheduled hours 
of duty.
    (e) Department not responsible for damage. The treatment prescribed 
in paragraph (b) of this section is judged from experimental tests to be 
safe for use on avocados at the mature green stage of development. 
However, the Department of Agriculture assumes no responsibility for any 
damage sustained through or in the course of treatment. There has not 
been an opportunity to test the treatment on all varieties of avocados 
that may be offered for entry from various countries. It is recommended 
that the phytotoxicity of the treatment to the variety to be shipped 
shall be tested by exporters in the country of origin or by means of 
test shipments sent to this country.

purpose, as prescribed in this section. This treatment is specific for 
the pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) which is known to 
occur in Mexico, the West Indies, and South America. Under certain 
cultural conditions this pest will infest okra.
    (2) Approval of fumigation chambers. (i) Fumigation chambers in the 
United States or elsewhere will be approved only if they are properly 
constructed and adequately equipped to handle and treat okra. Within the 
United States the chambers must be located within the practicable 
supervisory range of inspectors of the Plant Protection and Quarantine 
Programs stationed at the ports of entry authorized in permits for the 
importation of okra. Approval of fumigation chambers outside the United 
States will depend upon the availability of qualified inspectors for 
assignment to supervise the treatment and posttreatment handling of 
okra.
    (ii) Determination of eligibility for approval under this section of 
fumigation plants will be made by an inspector of the Plant Protection 
and Quarantine Programs.
    (3) Fumigation schedule. Such fumigation shall be in accordance with 
the following fumigation schedule:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                       Dosage (pounds of      Exposure
       Temperature ( deg. F.)          methyl bromide per      period
                                       1,000 cubic feet)      (hours)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
90-96...............................           1.0               2
80-89...............................           1.5               2
70-79...............................           2.0               2
60-69...............................           2.5               2
50-59...............................           3.0               2
40-49...............................           3.5               2
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (4) Fumigation procedure. Okra to be fumigated may be packed in 
slatted crates or other gas-permeable containers. The fumigation chamber 
shall

[[Page 283]]

not be loaded to more than two-thirds of its capacity. The containers 
may be stacked one on top of another, but a 3- to 4-inch space must be 
provided between all containers throughout the load. Good air 
circulation above and below the load shall be provided as soon as the 
okra is loaded and must be continued during the full period of 
fumigation and until the okra has been removed to a well-ventilated 
location. Strong blasts of air should not be directed against the okra. 
Fumigation at temperatures in excess of 90 deg. F. may result in injury 
to okra and should be avoided if possible. Past experience indicates 
that injury may also result from excess moisture, such as residual 
moisture from harvesting when dew-covered.
    (5) Supervision of fumigation--(i) Other than interior of Mexico. 
Inspectors will supervise the fumigation of okra at approved fumigation 
plants in locations other than those in the interior of Mexico and will 
specify safeguards in specific cases for the packing, other handling and 
transportation of the okra before and subsequent to fumigation, if, in 
the opinion of the inspector, this is necessary to assure that there 
will be no risk of introducing plant pests into the United States 
associated with the treatment and importation of the okra. The final 
release of the okra for entry into the United States will be conditioned 
upon compliance with the specified safeguards. Such supervision at 
plants within the United States will be carried on as a part of normal 
port inspection activities.
    (ii) Interior of Mexico. Inspectors will supervise the fumigation of 
okra at approved fumigation plants in the interior of Mexico and will 
prescribe safeguards in specific cases for the packing and other 
handling of the okra at the treating plant and the transportation of the 
okra from the time it leaves the treating plant until it reaches the 
U.S. port of entry, if in the opinion of the inspector this is necessary 
to assure that there will be no risk of introducing plant pests into the 
United States associated with the treatment and importation of the okra. 
The final release of the okra for entry into the United States will be 
conditioned upon compliance with the prescribed safeguards.
    (6) Ports of entry. Okra required to be treated for the pink 
bollworm may be imported into the United States only at New Orleans or 
such other South Atlantic or gulf ports with approved treatment 
facilities as may be named in the permit, except that, in addition, 
Mexican okra required to be treated for the pink bollworm may be 
imported into the United States at Mexican Border ports named in the 
permit.
    (7) Costs. Persons desiring to import okra required to be treated 
under this section must make advance arrangements for approval of the 
fumigation plant and for supervision of the fumigation by an authorized 
inspector. All costs of constructing, maintaining, and operating 
fumigation plants and facilities, and carrying out specified 
pretreatment and posttreatment safeguards, and all additional costs to 
the Department arising from supervision under this section, by an 
inspector away from his regular place of official duty or outside of his 
regular hours of official duty (including as appropriate, base salary, 
overtime and holiday pay, travel subsistence, transportation, employee 
benefits, and incidental expenses) shall be borne by the owner of the 
okra or his representative. Where normal inspection activities preclude 
the furnishing of supervision during regularly assigned hours of duty, 
supervision will be furnished on a reimbursable basis. The owner of the 
okra or his representative must furnish the Deputy Administrator of the 
Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs with acceptable assurances that 
he will provide funds to the U.S. Department of Agriculture to cover all 
costs of supervision, in accordance with Secs. 354.1 and 354.2 of this 
chapter and this paragraph.
    (8) Department not responsible for damage. While the prescribed 
treatment is judged from experimental tests to be safe for use with 
okra, the Department assumes no responsibility for any damage sustained 
through or in the course of treatment or because of pretreatment or 
posttreatment safeguards. There has not been an opportunity to test 
these treatments under

[[Page 284]]

all conditions or on all okra varieties or on okra from all areas 
involved.
    (c) Importations of okra without treatment from the Dominican 
Republic, Mexico, and Suriname Okra produced in the Dominican Republic, 
Mexico, or Suriname, may be entered into the United States without 
treatment for the pink bollworm only if:
    (1) The okra is imported from the Dominican Republic, Mexico, or 
Suriname under permit;
    (2) The okra is made available for examination by an inspector at 
the port of arrival and remains at the port of arrival until released by 
an inspector;
    (3) During March 16 through December 31, inclusive, the okra is not 
moved into California; and
    (4) During May 16 through November 30, inclusive, the okra is not 
moved into Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, 
Nevada, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, or any part of 
Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, or Virginia south of the 38th parallel.
    (d) Importation of okra without treatment from the West Indies and 
certain countries in South America. Okra produced in the West Indies, 
Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, or other South American country, 
designated in accordance with Sec. 319.56-2 in a permit to import okra, 
may be imported into the United States through any North Atlantic port 
with approved treatment facilities, under permit and subject to 
inspection at the port of arrival but without treatment for the pink 
bollworm in paragraph (d)(2) of this section if destined to: Alaska, 
Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, 
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, 
New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, 
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Washington, 
West Virginia, Wisconsin, or Wyoming, or the District of Columbia, or 
any part of Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, or Virginia, north of the 38th 
parallel.
    (e) Importation of okra without treatment from Andros Island of the 
Bahamas; and okra without treatment from the West Indies for importation 
into the American Virgin Islands. Okra produced in Andros Island, 
Bahamas, may be imported into the United States under permit through any 
port named in the permit, without treatment but subject to inspection at 
the port of arrival. Okra produced in the West Indies may be imported 
into the American Virgin Islands without treatment but subject to 
inspection at the port of arrival.
    (f) Treatment of okra for pests other than pink bollworm. If, upon 
examination of okra imported in accordance with paragraphs (c), (d), or 
(e) of this section, an inspector at the port of arrival finds injurious 
insects, other than the pink bollworm, that do not exist in the United 
States or are not widespread in the United States, the okra will remain 
eligible for entry into the United States only if it is treated for the 
injurious insects in the physical presence of an inspector in accordance 
with the Plant Protection and Quarantine Treatment Manual. The Plant 
Protection and Quarantine Treatment Manual is incorporated by reference. 
See Sec. 300.1 of this chapter, Materials incorporated by reference.'' 
If the treatment authorized by the Plant Protection and Quarantine 
Treatment Manual is not available, or if no authorized treatment exists, 
the okra may not be entered into the United States.

Sec. 319.56-2r  Administrative instructions governing the entry of apples and pears from certain countries in Europe.

    (a) Importations allowed. Pursuant to Sec. 319.56(c), the 
Administrator has determined that the following fruits may be imported 
into the United States in accordance with this section and other 
applicable provisions of this subpart:
    (1) Apples from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, 
Italy, The Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Norway, Portugal, the Republic 
of Ireland, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland;
    (2) Pears from Belgium, France, Great Britain, Italy, The 
Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain.
    (b) Trust fund agreement. Except as provided in paragraph (h) of 
this section, the apples or pears may be imported only if the national 
plant protection service of the exporting country (referred to in this 
section as the plant protection service) has entered into a trust fund 
agreement with Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) for that shipping 
season. This agreement requires the plant protection service to pay in 
advance all estimated costs incurred by PPQ in providing the 
preclearance inspections prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section. 
These costs will include administrative expenses incurred in conducting 
the inspection services; and all salaries (including overtime and the 
federal share of employee benefits), travel expenses (including per diem 
expenses), and other incidental expenses incurred by the inspectors in 
performing these services. The agreement requires the plant protection 
service to deposit a certified or cashier's check with the Animal and 
Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) for the amount of these costs, 
as estimated by PPQ. If the deposit is not sufficient to meet all costs 
incurred by PPQ, the agreement further requires the plant protection 
service to deposit with APHIS a certified or cashier's check for the 
amount of the remaining costs, as determined by PPQ, before the 
inspection will be completed.
    (c) Responsibilities of the exporting country. The apples or pears 
may be imported in any single shipping season only if all of the 
following conditions are met:
    (1) Officials of the plant protection service must survey each 
orchard producing apples or pears for shipment to the United States at 
least two times between the time of spring blossoming and harvest. If 
the officials find any leaf mines that suggest the presence of 
Leucoptera malifoliella in an orchard, the officials must reject any 
fruit harvested from that orchard during that growing season for 
shipment to the United States. If the officials find evidence in an 
orchard of any other plant pest referred to in paragraph (g) of this 
section, they must ensure that the orchard and all other orchards within 
1 kilometer of that orchard will be treated for that pest with a 
pesticide approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in 
accordance with label directions and under the direction of the plant 
protection service. If the officials determine that the treatment 
program has not been applied as required or is not controlling the plant 
pest in the orchard, they must reject any fruit harvested from that 
orchard during that growing season for shipment to the United States.
    (2) The apples or pears must be identified with the orchard from 
which

[[Page 286]]

they are harvested (the producing orchard) until the fruit arrives in 
the United States.
    (3) The apples or pears must be processed and inspected in the 
approved packing sheds as follows:
    (i) Upon arrival at the packing shed, the apples or pears must be 
inspected for insect pests as follows: For each grower lot (all fruit 
delivered for processing from a single orchard at a given time), packing 
shed technicians must examine all fruit in one carton on every third 
pallet (there are approximately 42 cartons to a pallet), or at least 80 
apples or pears in every third bin (if the fruit is not in cartons on 
pallets). If they find any live larva or pupa of Leucoptera 
malifoliella, they must reject the entire grower lot for shipment to the 
United States, and the plant protection service must reject for shipment 
any additional fruit from the producing orchard for the remainder of the 
shipping season.
    (ii) The apples or pears must be sorted, sized, packed, and 
otherwise handled in the packing sheds on grading and packing lines used 
solely for fruit intended for shipment to the United States, or, if on 
grading and packing lines used previously for other fruit, only after 
the lines have been washed with water.
    (iii) During packing operations, apples and pears must be inspected 
for insect pests as follows: All fruit in each grower lot must be 
inspected at each of two inspection stations on the packing line by 
packing shed technicians. In addition, one carton from every pallet in 
each grower lot must be inspected by officials of the plant protection 
service. If the inspections reveal any live larva or pupa of Leucoptera 
malifoliella, the entire grower lot must be rejected for shipment to the 
United States, and the plant protection service must reject for shipment 
any additional fruit from the producing orchard for the remainder of 
that shipping season. If the inspections reveal any other insect pest 
referred to in paragraph (g) of this section, and a treatment authorized 
in the Plant Protection and Quarantine Treatment Manual is available, 
the fruit will remain eligible for shipment to the United States if the 
entire grower lot is treated for the pest under the supervision of a PPQ 
inspector. However, if the entire grower lot is not treated in this 
manner, or if a plant pest is found for which no treatment authorized in 
the Plant Protection and Quarantine Treatment Manual is available, the 
entire grower lot will be rejected for shipment to the United States.
    (4) Apples or pears that pass inspection at approved packing sheds 
must be presented to PPQ inspectors for preclearance inspection as 
prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section or for inspection in the 
United States as prescribed in paragraph (h) of this section.
    (5) Apples and pears presented for preclearance inspection must be 
identified with the packing shed where they were processed, as well as 
with the producing orchard, and this identity must be maintained until 
the apples or pears arrive in the United States.
    (6) Facilities for the preclearance inspections prescribed in 
paragraph (d) of this section must be provided in the exporting country 
at a site acceptable to PPQ.
    (7) Any apples or pears rejected for shipment into the United States 
may not, under any circumstance, be presented again for shipment to the 
United States.
    (d) Preclearance inspection. Preclearance inspection will be 
conducted in the exporting country by PPQ inspectors. Preclearance 
inspection will be conducted for a minimum of 6,000 cartons of apples or 
pears, which may represent multiple grower lots from different packing 
sheds. The cartons examined during any given preclearance inspection 
will be known as an inspection unit. Apples or pears in any inspection 
unit may be shipped to the United States only if the inspection unit 
passes inspection as follows:
    (1) Inspectors will examine, fruit by fruit, a biometrically 
designed statistical sample of 300 cartons drawn from each inspection 
unit.
    (i) If inspectors find any live larva or pupa of Leucoptera 
malifoliella, they will reject the entire inspection unit for shipment 
to the United States. The inspectors also will reject for shipment any 
additional fruit from the producing orchard for the remainder of the 
shipping season. However, other orchards

[[Page 287]]

represented in the rejected inspection unit will not be affected for the 
remainder of the shipping season because of that rejection. 
Additionally, if inspectors reject any three inspection units in a 
single shipping season because of Leucoptera malifoliella on fruit 
processed by a single packing shed, no additional fruit from that 
packing shed will be accepted for shipment to the United States for the 
remainder of that shipping season.
    (ii) If the inspectors find evidence of any other plant pest 
referred to in paragraph (g) of this section, and a treatment authorized 
in the Plant Protection and Quarantine Treatment Manual is available, 
fruit in the inspection unit will remain eligible for shipment to the 
United States if the entire inspection unit is treated for the pest 
under the supervision of a PPQ inspector. However, if the entire 
inspectional unit is not treated in this manner, or if a plant pest is 
found for which no treatment authorized in the Plant Protection and 
Quarantine Treatment Manual is available, the inspectors will reject the 
entire inspection unit for shipment to the United States. Rejection of 
an inspection unit because of pests other than Leucoptera malifoliella 
will not be cause for rejecting additional fruit from an orchard or 
packing shed.
    (iii) Apples and pears precleared for shipment to the United States 
as prescribed in this paragraph will not be inspected again in the 
United States (except as necessary to ensure that the fruit has been 
precleared) unless the preclearance program with the exporting country 
is terminated in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. If the 
preclearance program is terminated with any country, precleared fruit in 
transit to the United States at the time of termination will be spot-
checked by PPQ inspectors upon arrival in the United States for evidence 
of plant pests referred to in paragraph (g) of this section. If any live 
larva or pupa of Leucoptera malifoliella is found in any carton of 
fruit, inspectors will reject that carton and all other cartons in that 
shipment that are from the same producing orchard. In addition, the 
remaining cartons of fruit in that shipment will be reinspected as an 
inspection unit in accordance with the preclearance procedures 
prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (e) Termination of preclearance programs. The Administrator may 
terminate the preclearance program in a country if he determines that 
any of the conditions specified in paragraph (c) of this section are not 
met or because of pests found during preclearance inspections. 
Termination of the preclearance program will stop shipments of apples or 
pears from that country for the remainder of that shipping season. 
Termination of the preclearance program for findings of Leucoptera 
malifoliella in preclearance inspections in any country will be based on 
rates of rejection of inspection units as follows:
    (1) Termination because of findings of Leucoptera malifoliella. The 
pre-clearance program will be terminated with a country when, in one 
shipping season, inspection units are rejected because of Leucoptera 
malifoliella as follows:
    (i) 5 inspection units in sequence among inspection units 1-20, or a 
total of 8 or more of the inspection units 1-20;
    (ii) 5 inspection units in sequence among inspection units 21-40, or 
a total of 10 or more of the inspection units 1-40;
    (iii) 5 inspection units in sequence among inspection units 41-60, 
or a total of 12 or more of the inspection units 1-60;
    (iv) 5 inspection units in sequence among inspection units 61-80, or 
a total of 14 or more of the inspection units 1-80;
    (v) 5 inspection units in sequence among inspection units 81-100, or 
a total of 16 or more of the inspection units 1-100;
    (vi) 5 inspection units in sequence among inspection units 101-120, 
or a total of 18 or more of the inspection units 1-120.

(Sequence can be continued in increments of 20 inspection units by 
increasing the number of rejected inspection units by 2.)
    (2) Termination because of findings of other plant pests. The 
preclearance program will be terminated with a country when, in one 
shipping season,

[[Page 288]]

inspection units are rejected because of other insect pests as follows:
    (i) 10 or more of the inspection units 1-20;
    (ii) 15 or more of the inspection units 1-40;
    (iii) 20 or more of the inspection units 1-60;
    (iv) 25 or more of the inspection units 1-80;
    (v) 30 or more of the inspection units 1-100; or
    (vi) 35 or more of the inspection units 1-120.

(Sequence can be continued in increments of 20 inspection units by 
increasing the number of rejected inspection units by 5.)
    (f) Cold treatment. In addition to all other requirements of this 
section, apples or pears may be imported into the United States from 
France, Italy, Portugal, or Spain only if the fruit is cold treated for 
the Mediterranean fruit fly in accordance with Sec. 319.56-2d of this 
subpart.
    (g) Plant pests; authorized treatments. (1) Apples from Belgium, 
Denmark, France, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Northern 
Ireland, Norway, Portugal, the Republic of Ireland, Spain, Sweden, 
Switzerland, and West Germany; and pears from Belgium, France, Great 
Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain may be imported 
into the United States only if they are found free of the following 
pests or, if an authorized treatment is available, they are treated for 
the pest under the supervision of a PPQ inspector: the pear leaf blister 
moth (Leucoptera malifoliella (O.G. Costa) (Lyonetiidae)), the plum 
fruit moth (Cydia funebrana (Treitschke) (Tortricidae)), the summer 
fruit tortrix moth (Adoxophyes orana (Fischer von Rosslertamm) 
(Tortricidae)), a leaf roller (Argyrotaenia pulchellana (Haworth) 
(Tortricidae)), and other insect pests that do not exist in the United 
States or that are not widespread in the United States.
    (2) Authorized treatments are listed in the Plant Protection and 
Quarantine Treatment Manual. The Plant Protection and Quarantine 
Treatment Manual is incorporated by reference. For the full 
identification of this standard, see Sec. 300.1 of this chapter, 
``Materials incorporated by reference.''
    (h) Inspection in the United States. Notwithstanding provisions to 
the contrary in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the 
Administrator may allow apples or pears imported under this section to 
be inspected at a port of arrival in the United States, in lieu of a 
preclearance inspection, under the following conditions:
    (1) The Administrator has determined that inspection can be 
accomplished at the port of arrival without increasing the risk of 
introducing insect pests into the United States;
    (2) Each pallet of apples or pears must be completely enclosed in 
plastic, to prevent the escape of insects, before it is offloaded at the 
port of arrival;
    (3) The entire shipment of apples or pears must be offloaded and 
moved to an enclosed warehouse, where adequate inspection facilities are 
available, under the supervision of PPQ inspectors.
    (4) The Administrator must determine that a sufficient number of 
inspectors are available at the port of arrival to perform the services 
required.
    (5) The method of inspection will be the same as prescribed in 
paragraph (d) of this section for preclearance inspections.

Sec. 319.56-2s  Administrative instructions governing the entry of apricots, nectarines, peaches, plumcot, and plums from Chile.

    (a) Importations allowed. Pursuant to Sec. 319.56(c), the 
Administrator has determined that apricots, nectarines, peaches, 
plumcot, and plums may be imported into the United States from Chile in 
accordance with this section and other applicable provisions of this 
subpart, as an alternative to importation in accordance with 
Sec. 319.56-2m.
    (b) Trust fund agreement. Except as provided in Sec. 319.56-2m or in 
paragraph (g) of this section, apricots, nectarines, peaches, plumcot, 
and plums may be imported only if the plant protection service of Chile 
(Servicio Agricola Y Ganadero, referred to in this section as SAG), has 
entered into a trust fund

[[Page 289]]

agreement with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) 
for that shipping season. This agreement requires SAG to pay in advance 
all estimated costs incurred by APHIS in providing the preclearance 
prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section. Payment of costs will be 
made on a monthly or other schedule designated by APHIS, but payment 
must be made for each preclearance service before APHIS provides the 
service. These costs will include administrative expenses incurred in 
conducting the preclearance services; and all salaries (including 
overtime and the federal share of employee benefits), travel expenses 
(including per diem expenses), and other incidental expenses incurred by 
the inspectors in providing these services. The agreement requires SAG 
to deposit certified or cashier's checks with APHIS for the amount of 
these costs, as estimated by APHIS based on projected shipment volumes 
and cost figures from previous inspections. The agreement further 
requires that, if the deposit is not sufficient to meet all costs 
incurred by APHIS, SAG must deposit with APHIS a certified or cashier's 
check for the amount of the remaining costs, as determined by APHIS, 
before the inspections will be completed. The agreement also requires 
that, in the event of unexpected end-of-season costs, SAG must deposit 
with APHIS a certified cashier's check sufficient to meet such costs as 
estimated by APHIS, before any further preclearance services will be 
provided. If the amount SAG deposits during the shipping season exceeds 
the total costs incurred by APHIS in providing preclearance services, 
the difference will be returned to SAG by APHIS at the end of the 
shipping season upon request, or otherwise will be applied to 
preclearance services for the next shipping season.
    (c) Responsibilities of Servicio Agricola Y Ganadero. SAG will 
ensure that:
    (1) Apricots, nectarines, peaches, plumcot, or plums are presented 
to APHIS inspectors for preclearance in their shipping containers at the 
shipping site for preclearance as prescribed in paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (2) Apricots, nectarines, peaches, plumcot, and plums presented for 
inspection are identified in shipping documents accompanying each load 
of fruit that identify the packing shed where they were processed and 
the orchards where they were produced; and this identity is maintained 
until the apricots, nectarines, peaches, or plums are released for entry 
into the United States.
    (3) Facilities for the inspections prescribed in paragraph (d) of 
this section are provided in Chile at an inspection site acceptable to 
APHIS.
    (d) Preclearance inspection. Preclearance inspection will be 
conducted in Chile under the direction of APHIS inspectors. An 
inspection unit will consist of a lot or shipment from which a 
statistical sample is drawn and examined. An inspection unit may 
represent multiple grower lots from different packing sheds. Apricots, 
nectarines, peaches, plumcot, or plums in any inspection unit may be 
shipped to the United Sates only if the inspection unit passes 
inspection as follows:
    (1) Inspectors will examine, fruit by fruit, the contents of the 
cartons which were selected based on a sampling scheme established for 
each inspection unit. An APHIS inspector will designate which cartons to 
inspect in each inspection unit to ensure that units infested at a level 
of 3 percent or more will be identified with a confidence level of 95 
percent.
    (i) If the inspectors find evidence of any plant pest for which a 
treatment authorized in the Plant Protection and Quarantine Treatment 
Manual is available, fruit in the inspection unit will remain eligible 
for shipment to the United States if the entire inspection unit is 
treated for the pest in Chile. However, if the entire inspection unit is 
not treated in this manner, or if a plant pest is found for which no 
treatment authorized in the Plant Protection and Quarantine Treatment 
Manual is available, the entire inspection unit will not be eligible for 
shipment to the United States.
    (ii) Apricots, nectarines, peaches, plumcot, and plums precleared 
for shipment to the United States as prescribed in this paragraph will 
not be inspected again in the United States except as necessary to 
ensure that the

[[Page 290]]

fruit has been precleared and for occasional monitoring purposes.
    (e) Termination of preclearance programs. Shipments of apricots, 
nectarines, peaches, plumcot, and plums will be individually evaluated 
regarding the rates of infestation of inspection units of these articles 
presented for preclearance. The inspection program for an article will 
be terminated when inspections determine that the rate of infestation of 
inspection units of the article by pests listed in paragraph (f) of this 
section exceeds 20 percent calculated on any consecutive 14 days of 
actual inspections (not counting days on which inspections are not 
conducted). Termination of the inspection program for an article will 
require mandatory treatment in Chile, prior to shipment to the United 
States, of shipments of the article for the remainder of that shipping 
season. If a preclearance inspection program is terminated with Chile, 
precleared fruit in transit to the United States at the time of 
termination will be spot-checked by APHIS inspectors upon arrival in the 
United States for evidence of plant pests referred to in paragraph (f) 
of this section.
    (f) Plant pests; authorized treatments.
    (1) Apricots, nectarines, peaches, plumcot, or plums from Chile may 
be imported into the United States only if they are found free of the 
following pests or, if an authorized treatment is available, they are 
treated for the pest under the supervision of an APHIS inspector: 
Proeulia spp., Leptoglossus chilensis, Megalometis chilensis, Naupactus 
xanthographus, Listroderes subcinctus, and Conoderus rufangulus, and 
other insect pests that the Administrator has determined do not exist, 
or are not widespread, in the United States.
    (2) Authorized treatments are listed in the Plant Protection and 
Quarantine Treatment Manual. The Plant Protection and Quarantine 
Treatment Manual is incorporated by reference. For the full 
identification of this standard, see Sec. 300.1 of this chapter. 
``Materials incorporated by reference.''
    (g) Inspection in the United States. Notwithstanding provisions to 
the contrary in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the 
Administrator may, in emergency or extraordinary situations, allow 
apricots, nectarines, peaches, plumcot, or plums imported under this 
section to be inspected at a port of arrival in the United States, in 
lieu of a preclearance inspection of fumigation in Chile, under the 
following conditions:
    (1) The Administrator is satisfied that a unique situation exists 
which justifies a limited exception to mandatory preclearance;
    (2) The Administrator has determined that inspection and/or 
treatment can be accomplished at the intended port of arrival without 
increasing the risk of introducing insect pests into the United States;
    (3) The entire shipment of apricots, nectarines, peaches, plumcot, 
or plums must be offloaded and moved, under the supervision of APHIS 
inspectors, to an enclosed warehouse, where inspection and treatment 
facilities are available.
    (4) The Administrator must determine that a sufficient number of 
inspectors are available at the port of arrival to perform the services 
required.
    (5) The method of sampling and inspection will be the same as 
prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section for preclearance 
inspections.

Sec. 319.56-2w  Administrative instruction; conditions governing the entry of papayas from Brazil and Costa Rica.

    The Solo type of papaya may be imported into the continental United 
States, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands from the State 
of Espirito Santo, Brazil, and the provinces of Guanacaste, San Jose, 
and Puntarenas, Costa Rica, only under the following conditions:
    (a) The papayas were grown and packed for shipment to the United 
States in the State of Espirito Santo, Brazil, or in the provinces of 
Guanacaste, San Jose, and Puntarenas, Costa Rica.
    (b) Beginning at least 30 days before harvest began and continuing 
through the completion of harvest, all trees in the field where the 
papayas were grown were kept free of papayas that were \1/2\ or more 
ripe (more than \1/4\ of the shell surface yellow), and all culled and 
fallen fruits were buried, destroyed, or removed from the farm at least 
twice a week.
    (c) The papayas were treated with a hot water treatment consisting 
of 20 minutes in water at 49  deg.C (120.2  deg.F).
    (d) When packed, the papayas were less than \1/2\ ripe (the shell 
surface was no more than \1/4\ yellow, surrounded by light green), and 
appeared to be free of all injurious insect pests.
    (e) The papayas were safeguarded from exposure to fruit flies from 
harvest to export, including being packaged so as to prevent access by 
fruit flies and other injurious insect pests. The package containing the 
papayas does not contain any other fruit, including papayas not 
qualified for importation into the United States.
    (f) All cartons in which papayas are packed must be stamped ``Not 
for importation into or distribution in HI.''
    (g) All activities described in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this 
section were carried out under the supervision and direction of plant 
health officials of the national Ministry of Agriculture.
    (h) Beginning at least 1 year before harvest begins and continuing 
through the completion of harvest, fruit fly traps were maintained in 
the field where the papayas were grown. The traps were placed at a rate 
of 1 trap per hectare and were checked for fruit flies at least once 
weekly by plant health officials of the national Ministry of 
Agriculture. Fifty percent of the traps were of the McPhail type, and 
fifty percent of the traps were of the Jackson type. If the average 
Jackson trap catch was greater than 7 Medflies per trap per week, 
measures were taken to control the Medfly population in the production 
area. The national Ministry of Agriculture kept records of fruit fly 
finds for each trap, updated the records each time the traps were 
checked, and made the records available to APHIS inspectors upon 
request. The records were maintained for at least 1 year.
    (i) If the average Jackson trap catch exceeds 14 Medflies per trap 
per week, importations of papayas from that production area must be 
halted until the rate of capture drops to an average of 7 or fewer 
Medflies per trap per week.
    (j) In the State of Espirito Santo, Brazil, if the average McPhail 
trap catch was greater than 7 South American fruit flies (Anastrepha 
fraterculus) per trap per week, measures were taken to control the South 
American fruit fly population in the production area. If the average 
McPhail trap catch exceeds 14 South American fruit flies per trap per 
week, importations of papayas from that production area must be halted 
until the rate of capture

[[Page 299]]

drops to an average of 7 or fewer South American fruit flies per trap 
per week.
    (k) All shipments must be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate 
issued by the national Ministry of Agriculture stating that the papayas 
were grown, packed, and shipped in accordance with the provisions of 
this section.

    (2) Soapy water and wax. The cherimoyas must be immersed in a soapy 
water bath consisting of 1 part soap solution (such as Deterfrut) to 
3,000 parts water for a minimum of 20 seconds, followed by a pressure 
shower rinse to remove soapy excess, and then followed by immersion for 
a minimum of 20 seconds in an undiluted wax coating (such as Johnson Wax 
Primafresh 31 Kosher fruit coating).
    (b) APHIS inspection. Cherimoyas from Chile are subject to 
inspection under the direction of an inspector, either in Chile or at 
the port of arrival in the United States. Imported cherimoyas inspected 
in Chile are subject to reinspection at the port of arrival as provided 
for in Sec. 319.56-6.
    (c) Trust Fund Agreement. Cherimoyas that are treated or inspected 
in Chile may be imported into the United States only if the plant 
protection service of Chile (Servicio Agricola Y Ganadero, referred to 
in this section as SAG) has entered into a trust fund agreement with 
APHIS. This agreement requires SAG to pay in advance of each shipping 
season all costs that APHIS estimates it will incur in providing 
inspection services in Chile during that shipping season. These costs 
include administrative expenses and all salaries (including overtime and 
the Federal share of employee benefits), travel expenses (including per 
diem expenses), and other incidental expenses incurred by APHIS in 
performing these services. The agreement requires SAG to deposit a 
certified or cashier's check with APHIS for the amount of these costs, 
as estimated by APHIS. If the deposit is not sufficient to meet all 
costs incurred by APHIS, the agreement further requires SAG to deposit 
with APHIS a certified or cashier's check for the amount of the 
remaining costs, as determined by APHIS, before any more cherimoyas will 
be treated or inspected in Chile. After a final audit at the conclusions 
of each shipping season, any overpayment of funds would be returned to 
SAG, or held on account until needed, at SAG's option.
    (d) Costs for services in the United States. All costs of treatment 
and required safeguards and supervision, other than the services of the 
supervising inspector during regularly assigned hours of duty and at the 
usual place of duty, shall be borne by the owner of the fruits or a 
representative of the owner.
    (e) Limitation of origin. The cherimoyas must have been grown in a 
province of Chile that is free from the Mediterranean fruit fly (see 
Sec. 319.56-2(j)).
    (f) Ports of entry. Cherimoyas from Chile may be imported through 
all ports staffed by an inspector.\1\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (g) Department not responsible for damage. The treatments prescribed 
in paragraph (a) of this section are judged from experimental tests to 
be safe for use with cherimoyas from Chile. However, the Department 
assumes no responsibility for any damage sustained through or in the 
course of such treatment or by compliance with requirements under 
paragraph (a) of this section.

in facilities registered with the Servicio Agricola y Ganadero (SAG) and 
with APHIS personnel monitoring the treatments;
    (2) The tomatoes must be treated and packed within 24 hours of 
harvest. Once treated, the tomatoes must be safeguarded by a fruit fly-
proof mesh screen or plastic tarpaulin while in transit to the packing 
house and while awaiting packing, and be packed in fruit fly-proof 
containers under APHIS monitoring for transit to the airport and 
subsequent shipping to the United States; and
    (3) Tomatoes may be imported into the United States from Chile only 
if SAG has entered into a trust fund agreement with APHIS for that 
shipping season. This agreement requires SAG to pay in advance all costs 
that APHIS estimates it will incur in providing the preclearance 
services prescribed in this section for that shipping season. These 
costs will include administrative expenses incurred in conducting the 
preclearance services; and all salaries (including overtime and the 
Federal share of employee benefits), travel expenses (including per diem 
expenses), and other incidental expenses incurred by the inspectors in 
providing these services. The agreement requires SAG to deposit a 
certified or cashier's check with APHIS for the amount of these costs 
for the entire shipping season, as estimated by APHIS based on projected 
shipment volumes and cost figures from previous inspections. The 
agreement further requires that, if the initial deposit is not 
sufficient to meet all costs incurred by APHIS, SAG must deposit with 
APHIS another certified or cashier's check for the amount of the 
remaining costs, as determined by APHIS, before the inspections will be 
completed. The agreement also requires that, in the event of unexpected 
end-of-season costs, SAG must deposit with APHIS a certified cashier's 
check sufficient to meet such costs as estimated by APHIS, before any 
further preclearance services will be provided. If the amount SAG 
deposits during a shipping season exceeds the total cost incurred by 
APHIS in providing preclearance services, the difference will be 
returned to SAG by APHIS at the end of the shipping season.

Agricultura, Ganaderia y Desarrollo Rural (SAGDR).
    (1) Municipality requirements. (i) The municipality must be listed 
as an approved municipality in the annual work plan provided to APHIS by 
Sanidad Vegetal.
    (ii) The municipality must be surveyed at least annually and found 
to be free from the large avocado seed weevil Heilipus lauri, the 
avocado seed moth Stenoma catenifer, and the small avocado seed weevils 
Conotrachelus aguacatae and C. perseae. The survey must cover at least 
300 hectares in the municipality and include randomly selected portions 
of each registered orchard and areas with wild or backyard avocado 
trees. The survey must be conducted during the growing season and 
completed prior to the harvest of the avocados.
    (iii) Trapping must be conducted in the municipality for 
Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly) (Ceratitis capitata) at the rate of 1 
trap per 1 to 4 square miles. Any findings of Medfly must be reported to 
APHIS.
    (2) Orchard and grower requirements. The orchard and the grower must 
be registered with Sanidad Vegetal's avocado export program and must be 
listed as an approved orchard or an approved grower in the annual work 
plan provided to APHIS by Sanidad Vegetal. The operations of the orchard 
must meet the following conditions:
    (i) The orchard and all contiguous orchards and properties must be 
surveyed annually and found to be free from the avocado stem weevil 
Copturus aguacatae. The survey must be conducted during the growing 
season and completed prior to the harvest of the avocados.
    (ii) Trapping must be conducted in the orchard for the fruit flies 
Anastrepha ludens, A. serpentina, and A. striata at the rate of one trap 
per 10 hectares. If one of those fruit flies is trapped, at least 10 
additional traps must be deployed in a 50-hectare area immediately 
surrounding the trap in which the fruit fly was found. If within 30 days 
of the first finding any additional fruit flies are trapped within the 
260-hectare area surrounding the first finding, malathion bait 
treatments must be applied in the affected orchard in order for the 
orchard to remain eligible to export avocados.
    (iii) Avocado fruit that has fallen from the trees must be removed 
from the orchard at least once every 7 days and may not be included in 
field boxes of fruit to be packed for export.
    (iv) Dead branches on avocado trees in the orchard must be pruned 
and removed from the orchard.
    (v) Harvested avocados must be placed in field boxes or containers 
of field boxes that are marked to show the Sanidad Vegetal registration 
number of the orchard. The avocados must be moved from the orchard to 
the packinghouse within 3 hours of harvest or they must be protected 
from fruit fly infestation until moved.
    (vi) The avocados must be protected from fruit fly infestation 
during their movement from the orchard to the packinghouse and must be 
accompanied by a field record indicating that the avocados originated 
from a certified orchard.
    (3) Packinghouse requirements. The packinghouse must be registered 
with Sanidad Vegetal's avocado export program and must be listed as an 
approved packinghouse in the annual work plan provided to APHIS by 
Sanidad Vegetal. The operations of the packinghouse must meet the 
following conditions:
    (i) During the time the packinghouse is used to prepare avocados for 
export to the United States, the packinghouse may accept fruit only from 
orchards certified by Sanidad Vegetal for participation in the avocado 
export program.
    (ii) All openings to the outside must be covered by screening with 
openings

[[Page 311]]

of not more than 1.6 mm or by some other barrier that prevents insects 
from entering the packinghouse.
    (iii) The packinghouse must have double doors at the entrance to the 
facility and at the interior entrance to the area where the avocados are 
packed.
    (iv) Prior to the culling process, a sample of 300 avocados per 
shipment must be selected, cut, and inspected by Sanidad Vegetal and 
found free from pests.
    (v) The identity of the avocados must be maintained from field boxes 
or containers to the shipping boxes so the avocados can be traced back 
to the orchard in which they were grown if pests are found at the 
packinghouse or the port of first arrival in the United States.
    (vi) Prior to being packed in boxes, each avocado fruit must be 
cleaned of all stems, leaves, and other portions of plants and labeled 
with a sticker that bears the Sanidad Vegetal registration number of the 
packinghouse.
    (vii) The avocados must be packed in clean, new boxes. The boxes 
must be clearly marked with the identity of the grower, packinghouse, 
and exporter, and the statement ``Distribution limited to the following 
States: CT, DC, DE, IL, IN, KY, ME, MD, MA, MI, NH, NJ, NY, OH, PA, RI, 
VA, VT, WV, and WI.''
    (viii) The boxes must be placed in a refrigerated truck or 
refrigerated container and remain in that truck or container while in 
transit through Mexico to the port of first arrival in the United 
States. Prior to leaving the packinghouse, the truck or container must 
be secured by Sanidad Vegetal with a seal that will be broken when the 
truck or container is opened. Once sealed, the refrigerated truck or 
refrigerated container must remain unopened until it reaches the port of 
first arrival in the United States.
    (ix) Any avocados that have not been packed or loaded into a 
refrigerated truck or refrigerated container by the end of the work day 
must be kept in the screened packing area.
    (d) Certification. All shipments of avocados must be accompanied by 
a phytosanitary certificate issued by Sanidad Vegetal certifying that 
the conditions specified in this section have been met.
    (e) Pest detection. (1) If any of the avocado seed pests Heilipus 
lauri, Conotrachelus aquacatae, C. perseae, or Stenoma catenifer are 
discovered in a municipality during an annual pest survey, orchard 
survey, packinghouse inspection, or other monitoring or inspection 
activity in the municipality, Sanidad Vegetal must immediately initiate 
an investigation and take measures to isolate and eradicate the pests. 
Sanidad Vegetal must also provide APHIS with information regarding the 
circumstances of the infestation and the pest risk mitigation measures 
taken. The municipality in which the pests are discovered will lose its 
pest-free certification and avocado exports from that municipality will 
be suspended until APHIS and Sanidad Vegetal agree that the pest 
eradication measures taken have been effective and that the pest risk 
within that municipality has been eliminated.
    (2) If Sanidad Vegetal discovers the stem weevil Copturus aguacatae 
in an orchard during an orchard survey or other monitoring or inspection 
activity in the orchard, Sanidad Vegetal must provide APHIS with 
information regarding the circumstances of the infestation and the pest 
risk mitigation measures taken. The orchard in which the pest was found 
will lose its export certification immediately and will be denied export 
certification for the entire shipping season of November through 
February.
    (3) If Sanidad Vegetal discovers the stem weevil Copturus aguacatae 
in fruit at a packinghouse, Sanidad Vegetal must investigate the origin 
of the infested fruit and provide APHIS with information regarding the 
circumstances of the infestation and the pest risk mitigation measures 
taken. The orchard where the infested fruit originated will lose its 
export certification immediately and will be denied export certification 
for the entire shipping season of November through February.
    (f) Ports. The avocados may enter the United States at:
    (1) Any port located in the northeastern States specified in 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section;

[[Page 312]]

    (2) The ports of Galveston or Houston, TX, or the border ports of 
Nogales, AZ, or Brownsville, Eagle Pass, El Paso, Hidalgo, or Laredo, 
TX; or
    (3) Other ports within that area of the United States specified in 
paragraph (g) of this section.
    (g) Shipping areas. Except as explained below in this paragraph for 
avocados that enter the United States at Nogales, AZ, avocados moved by 
truck or rail car may transit only that area of the United States 
bounded on the west by a line extending from El Paso, TX, to Denver, CO, 
and due north from Denver; and on the east and south by a line extending 
from Brownsville, TX, to Galveston, TX, to Kinder, LA, to Memphis, TN, 
to Knoxville, TN, following Interstate 40 to Raleigh, NC, and due east 
from Raleigh. All cities on these boundary lines are included in this 
area. If the avocados are moved by air, the aircraft may not land 
outside this area. Avocados that enter the United States at Nogales, AZ, 
must be moved to El Paso, TX, by the route specified on the permit, and 
then must remain within the shipping area described above in this 
paragraph.
    (h) Shipping requirements. The avocados must be moved through the 
United States either by air or in a refrigerated truck or refrigerated 
rail car or in a refrigerated container on a truck or rail car. If the 
avocados are moved in a refrigerated container on a truck or rail car, 
an inspector must seal the container with a serially numbered seal at 
the port of first arrival in the United States. If the avocados are 
moved in a refrigerated truck or a refrigerated rail car, an inspector 
must seal the truck or rail car with a serially numbered seal at the 
port of first arrival in the United States. If the avocados are 
transferred to another vehicle or container in the United States, an 
inspector must be present to supervise the transfer and must apply a new 
serially numbered seal. The avocados must be moved through the United 
States under Customs bond.
    (i) Inspection. The avocados are subject to inspection by an 
inspector at the port of first arrival, at any stops in the United 
States en route to the northeastern States, and upon arrival at the 
terminal market in the northeastern States. At the port of first 
arrival, an inspector will sample and cut avocados from each shipment to 
detect pest infestation.
    (j) Repackaging. If any avocados are removed from their original 
shipping boxes and repackaged, the stickers required by paragraph 
(c)(3)(vi) of this section may not be removed or obscured and the new 
boxes must be clearly marked with all the information required by 
paragraph (c)(3)(vii) of this section.
    (k) Compliance agreements. (1) Any person, other than the permittee, 
who moves or distributes the avocados following their importation into 
the United States (i.e., a second-party or subsequent handler) must 
enter into a compliance agreement with APHIS. In the compliance 
agreement, the person must acknowledge, and agree to observe, the 
requirements of paragraph (a) and paragraphs (f) through (k) of this 
section. Compliance agreement forms are available, free of charge, from 
local offices of Plant Protection and Quarantine, which are listed in 
local telephone directories. A compliance agreement will not be required 
for an individual place of business that only offers the avocados for 
sale directly to consumers.
    (2) Before transferring the avocados to any person (i.e., a second-
party handler) for movement or distribution, the permittee must confirm 
that the second-party handler has entered into a compliance agreement 
with APHIS as required by paragraph (k)(1) of this section. If the 
permittee transfers the avocados to a second-party handler who has not 
entered into a compliance agreement, APHIS may revoke the permittee's 
import permit for the remainder of the current shipping season.
    (3) Any second-party or subsequent handler who transfers the 
avocados to another person for movement or distribution must confirm 
that the person receiving the avocados has entered into a compliance 
agreement with APHIS as required by paragraph (k)(1) of this section. If 
the second-party or subsequent handler transfers the avocados to a 
person who has not entered into a compliance agreement, APHIS may revoke 
the handler's compliance agreement

[[Page 313]]

for the remainder of the current shipping season.
    (4) Action on repeat violators. APHIS may deny an application for an 
import permit from, or refuse to enter into a compliance agreement with, 
any person who has had his or her import permit or compliance agreement 
revoked under paragraph (k)(2) or (k)(3) of this section twice within 
any 5-year period.

Sec. 319.56-2gg  Administrative instructions; conditions governing the entry of peppers from Spain.

    Peppers (fruit) (Capsicum spp.) may be imported into the United 
States from Spain only under permit, and only in accordance with this 
section and all other applicable requirements of this subpart:
    (a) The peppers must be grown in the Almeria Province of Spain in 
pest-proof greenhouses registered with, and inspected by, the Spanish 
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food (MAFF);
    (b) The peppers may be shipped only from December 1 through April 
30, inclusive;
    (c) Beginning October 1, and continuing through April 30, MAFF must 
set and maintain Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly) traps baited with 
trimedlure inside the greenhouses at a rate of four traps per hectare. 
In all outside areas, including urban and residential areas, within 8 
kilometers of the greenhouses, MAFF must set and maintain Medfly traps 
baited with trimedlure at a rate of four traps per square kilometer. All 
traps must be checked every 7 days;
    (d) Capture of a single Medfly in a registered greenhouse will 
immediately halt exports from that greenhouse until the Deputy 
Administrator determines that the source of infestation has been 
identified, that all Medflies have been eradicated, and that measures 
have been taken to preclude any future infestation. Capture of a single 
Medfly within 2 kilometers of a registered greenhouse will necessitate 
increased trap density in order to determine whether there is a 
reproducing population in the area. Capture of two Medflies within 2 
kilometers of a registered greenhouse during a 1-month period will halt 
exports from all registered greenhouses within 2 kilometers of the 
capture, until the source of infestation is determined and all Medflies 
are eradicated;
    (e) The peppers must be safeguarded against fruit fly infestation 
from harvest to export. Such safeguarding includes covering newly 
harvested peppers with fruit fly-proof mesh screen or plastic tarpaulin 
while in transit to the packing house and while awaiting packing, and 
packing the peppers in fruit fly-proof cartons, or cartons covered with 
fruit-fly proof mesh or plastic tarpaulin, and placing those cartons in 
enclosed shipping containers for transit to the airport and subsequent 
shipment to the United States;
    (f) The peppers must be packed for shipment within 24 hours of 
harvest;
    (g) During shipment, the peppers may not transit other fruit fly-
supporting areas unless shipping containers are sealed by MAFF with an 
official seal whose number is noted on the phytosanitary certificate; 
and
    (h) A phytosanitary certificate issued by MAFF and bearing the 
declaration, ``These peppers were grown in registered greenhouses in 
Almeria Province in Spain,'' must accompany the shipment.

port of first arrival as may be required by an inspector, and shall be 
subject to reinspection at other locations at the option of an 
inspector. If an inspector finds a plant pest or evidence of a plant 
pest on or in any fruit or vegetable or its container, or finds that the 
fruit or vegetable may have been associated with other articles infested 
with plant pests, the owner or agent of the owner of the fruit or 
vegetable shall clean or treat the fruit or vegetable and its container 
as required by an inspector, and the fruit or vegetable shall also be 
subject to reinspection, cleaning, and treatment at the option of an 
inspector at any time and place before all applicable requirements of 
this subpart have been accomplished.
    (b) Assembly for inspection. The owner or agent of the owner shall 
assemble imported fruits and vegetables for inspection at the port of 
first arrival, or at any other place prescribed by an inspector, at a 
place and time and in a manner designated by an inspector.
    (c) Refusal of entry. If an inspector finds that an imported fruit 
or vegetable is prohibited or is so infested with a plant pest that, in 
the judgment of the inspector, it cannot be cleaned or treated, or 
contains soil or other prohibited contaminants, the entire lot may be 
refused entry into the United States.
    (d) Release for movement. No person shall move from the port of 
first arrival any imported fruit or vegetable unless and until an 
inspector notifies the person (in person, in writing, by telephone, or 
through electronic means) that the fruit or vegetable:

[[Page 315]]

    (1) Has been released; or
    (2) Requires reinspection, cleaning, or treatment of the fruit or 
vegetable at that port or at a place other than the port of first 
arrival, or is prohibited and must be exported from the United States.
    (e) Notice to owner of actions ordered by inspector. If an inspector 
orders any disinfection, cleaning, treatment, reexportation, or other 
action with regard to imported fruits or vegetables, the inspector shall 
file an emergency action notification (PPQ Form 523) with the owner of 
the fruits or vegetables or an agent of the owner. The owner must, 
within the time specified in the PPQ Form 523, destroy the fruits and 
vegetables, ship them to a point outside the United States, move them to 
an authorized site, and/or apply treatments or other safeguards to the 
fruits and vegetables as prescribed by an inspector to prevent the 
introduction of plant pests into the United States.
    (f) Costs and charges. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Service (APHIS), U.S. Department of Agriculture will be responsible only 
for the costs of providing the services of an inspector during regularly

shall include their presence within or accompanying a shipment 
regardless of their function or relation to a shipment or the character 
of the shipment.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Soil containing vegetable matter. Soil containing an appreciable 
admixture of vegetable matter, here brought under quarantine only 
because its content of decaying vegetation or plant remains carries a 
definite pest risk, is to be distinguished from soil of purely mineral 
or earthy composition, which is not covered by this quarantine.
    (c) Inspector. An inspector of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

<R05>
Sec. 319.74-2  Conditions governing the entry of cut flowers.

    (a) Inspection. All cut flowers imported into the United States must 
be made available to an inspector for examination at the port of first 
arrival and must remain at the port of first arrival until released, or 
authorized further movement, by an inspector.
    (b) Actions to prevent the introduction of plant pests; notice by an 
inspector. If an inspector orders any disinfection, cleaning, treatment, 
reexportation, or other action with regard to imported cut flowers that 
are found to be infested with injurious plant pests or infected with 
diseases, the inspector will provide an emergency action notification 
(PPQ Form 523) to the importer, owner, or agent or representative of the 
importer or owner of the cut flowers. The importer, owner, or agent or 
representative of the importer or owner must, within the time specified 
in the PPQ Form 523 and at his or her own expense, destroy the cut 
flowers, ship them to a point outside the United States, move them to an 
authorized site, and/or apply treatments, clean, or apply other 
safeguards to the cut flowers as prescribed by the inspector on the PPQ 
Form 523. Further, if the importer, owner, or agent or representative of 
the importer or owner fails to follow the conditions on PPQ Form 523 by 
the time specified on the form, APHIS will arrange for destruction of 
the cut flowers, and the importer, owner, or agent or representative of 
the importer or owner will be responsible for all costs incurred. Cut 
flowers that have been cleaned or treated must be made available for 
further inspection, cleaning, and treatment at the option of the 
inspector at any time and place indicated by the inspector before the 
requirements of this subpart will have been met. Neither the Department 
of Agriculture nor the inspector may be held responsible for any adverse 
effects of treatment on imported cut flowers.
    (c) Fumigation for agromyzids. (1) Cut flowers imported from any 
country or locality and found upon inspection to be infested with 
agromyzids (insects of the family Agromyzidae) must be fumigated at the 
time of importation with methyl bromide in accordance with paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section, with the following exceptions:
    (i) Fumigation will not be required for cut flowers imported from 
Canada (including Labrador and Newfoundland) or Mexico because of the 
finding of agromyzids.
    (ii) Fumigation will not be required for cut flowers of 
Chrysanthemum spp. imported from Colombia or the Dominican Republic 
because of the finding of agromyzids, when such agromyzids are 
identified by an inspector to be only agromyzids of the species 
Liriomyza trifolii (Burgess).
    (2) Fumigation schedules. Fumigation of cut flowers for agromyzids 
(insects of the family Agromyzidae) must consist of fumigation with 
methyl bromide at normal atmospheric pressure in a chamber or under a 
tarpaulin in accordance with one of the following schedules:

1\1/2\ lbs. per 1,000 cu. ft. for 2 hours at 80-90  deg.F.
    (19 oz. concentration at first \1/2\ hour)
    (12 oz. concentration at 2 hours); or
2 lbs. per 1,000 cu. ft. for 2 hours at 70-79  deg.F.
    (24 oz. concentration at first \1/2\ hour)
    (16 oz. concentration at 2 hours); or
2\1/2\ lbs. per 1,000 cu. ft. for 2 hours at 60-69  deg.F.
    (30 oz. concentration at first \1/2\ hour)
    (20 oz. concentration at 2 hours); or
3 lbs. per 1,000 cu. ft. for 2 hours at 50-59  deg.F.
    (36 oz. concentration at first \1/2\ hour)
    (24 oz. concentration at 2 hours); or
3\1/2\ lbs. per 1,000 cu. ft. for 2 hours at 40-49  deg.F.
    (41 oz. concentration at first \1/2\ hour)
    (27 oz. concentration at 2 hours)

    Note: There is a possibility that some cut flowers could be damaged 
by such fumigation.

    (d) Refusal of entry. If an inspector finds that imported cut 
flowers are so infested with a plant pest or infected with disease that, 
in the judgment of the inspector, they cannot be cleaned or treated, or 
if they contain soil or other prohibited contaminants, the entire lot 
may be refused entry into the United States.

<R05>
Sec. 319.74-3  Conditions governing the entry of cut flowers.

    (a) All cut flowers shall be given such inspection and treatment at 
the port of entry as may be deemed necessary by the inspector. Cut 
flowers imported from any country or locality and found upon inspection 
to be infested with agromyzids (insects of the family Agromyzidae) shall 
be fumigated at the time of importation with methyl bromide in 
accordance with a procedure specified in paragraph (c) of this section, 
except that such fumigation shall not be required for cut flowers 
imported from Canada (including Labrador and Newfoundland) or Mexico 
because of the finding of agromyzids, and shall not be required for cut 
flowers of Chrysanthemum spp. imported from Colombia or the Dominican 
Republic because of the finding of agromyzids, when such agromyzids are 
identified by an inspector to be only agromyzids of the species 
Liriomyza trifolii (Burgess). Any cut flowers found upon inspection to 
be infested with injurious insects or infected with plant diseases, 
which cannot be eliminated by treatment, shall be denied entry. The 
importer will be given the option of abandoning for destruction such 
rejected cut flowers or immediately shipping them to a point outside the 
United States.
    (b) Whenever, during the inspection of cut flowers imported in 
accordance with the regulations in this subpart, the inspector shall 
find them to be infested with an injurious insect or infected with an 
injurious plant disease, which can be eliminated by a method of 
treatment selected by him in accordance with administratively authorized 
procedures known to be effective under the conditions applied, he may 
prescribe as a condition of entry that such treatment be applied by the 
importer or his agent, under the supervision of the inspector. All costs 
for such treatment, except for the services of the inspector, shall be 
borne by the importer or his agent. Neither the Department of 
Agriculture nor the inspector shall be deemed responsible for any 
adverse effects of such treatment on the cut flowers so treated. In lieu 
of treatment the importer of infested or infected cut flowers shall be 
given the option of immediately shipping them to a point outside the 
United States or abandoning them for immediate destruction.
    (c) Fumigation of cut flowers for agromyzids (insects of the family 
Agromyzidae) shall consist of fumigation with methyl bromide at normal 
atmospheric pressure in a chamber or under a tarpaulin in accordance 
with one of the following schedules:

<R05>
Sec. 319.75  Restrictions on importation of restricted articles; disposal of articles refused importation.

    (a) The Secretary has determined that in order to prevent the entry 
into the United States of khapra beetle (Trogoderma granarium Everts) it 
is necessary to restrict the importation of certain articles from 
foreign countries and localities. Accordingly, no person shall import 
any restricted article unless in conformity with all of the applicable 
restrictions in this subpart.
    (b) Any article refused importation for noncompliance with the 
requirements of this subpart shall be promptly removed from the United 
States or abandoned by the importer, and pending such action shall be 
subject to the immediate application of such safeguards against escape 
of plant pests as the inspector determines necessary to prevent the 
introduction into the United States of plant pests. If such article is 
not promptly safeguarded, removed from the United States, or abandoned 
for destruction by the importer, it may be seized, destroyed, or 
otherwise disposed of in accordance with section 10 of the Plant 
Quarantine Act (7 U.S.C. 164a) and sections 105 and 107 of the Federal 
Plant Pest Act (7 U.S.C. 150dd, 150ff).
    (c) A restricted article may be imported without complying with 
other restrictions under this subpart if:
    (1) Imported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for experimental 
or scientific purposes;
    (2) Imported at the Plant Germplasm Quarantine Center, Building 320, 
Beltsville Agricultural Research Center East, Beltsville, MD 20705, or 
at a port of entry designated by an asterisk in Sec. 319.37-14(b);
    (3) Imported pursuant to a Departmental permit issued for such 
article and kept on file at the port of entry;
    (4) Imported under conditions specified on the Departmental permit 
and found by the Deputy Administrator to be adequate to prevent the 
introduction into the United States of plant pests, i.e., conditions of

    (3) Imported pursuant to a departmental permit issued for such 
honeybees and kept on file at the port of entry;
    (4) Imported under conditions specified on the departmental permit 
and found by the Deputy Administrator to be adequate to prevent the 
introduction into the United States of diseases or parasites harmful to 
honeybees, or genetically undesirable germ plasm of honeybees, i.e., 
conditions of treatment, processing, shipment, disposal; and
    (5) Imported with a departmental tag or label securely attached to 
the outside of the container, and with such tag or label bearing the 
name of the person to whom the permit is issued.
    (e) Honeybees and honeybee semen from New Zealand may transit the

    (2) The honeybees or honeybee semen must be shipped nonstop to the 
United States for transit to another country;
    (3) The honeybees must be contained in cages that are completely 
enclosed by screens with mesh fine enough to prevent the honeybees from 
passing through. Each pallet of cages must then be covered by an escape-
proof net that is secured tightly to the pallet so that no honeybees can 
escape from underneath the net;
    (4) The honeybees must be shipped by air through a port staffed by 
an inspector.\1\ The honeybees may be transloaded from one aircraft to 
another at the port of arrival in the United States, provided the 
transloading is done under the supervision of an inspector and the area 
used for any storage of the honeybees between flights is within a 
completely enclosed building.

APHIS Officer in Charge at the port of arrival of the following: the 
date of arrival and departure; the name and address of both the shipper 
and receiver; the quantity of queens and the number of cages of package 
honeybees in the shipment; and, the name of the airline carrying the 
shipment.
    (f) Any honeybees or honeybee semen offered for import or 
intercepted entering the United States and not in compliance with this 
part shall be immediately exported from the United States by the 
importer or shall be destroyed by an inspector. Pending exportation or 
destruction, the honeybees or honeybee semen shall be subject to the 
immediate application of such safeguards against escape of diseases or 
parasites harmful to honeybees, or undesirable species or subspecies of 
honeybees, as the inspector determines necessary to prevent the 
introduction into the United States of

<R05>
Sec. 330.101  Policy.

    The purpose of the regulations in this part is to prevent the 
dissemination of plant pests into the United States, or interstate, by 
regulating the movement of plant pests into or through the United 
States, or interstate, and the movement of means of conveyance, earth, 
stone and quarry products, garbage, and certain other products and 
articles into or through the United States, or from any Territory or 
possession into or through any other Territory or possession or the 
continental United States. The Deputy Administrator shall employ 
procedures to carry out this purpose which will impose a minimum of 
impediment to foreign commerce and travel whenever practicable, 
consistent with proper precaution against plant pest dissemination. The 
same policy is to be applied in the case of interstate commerce and 
travel.


<R05>
Sec. 330.102  Basis for certain regulations.

    Whereas the unregulated movement of means of conveyance, their 
stores, baggage, mail, plants, plant products, garbage, earth, stone and 
quarry products, and other products and articles into or through the 
United States from places outside thereof or from any Territory or 
possession into or through any other Territory or possession or the 
continental United States may disseminate plant pests which are outside 
the scope of the Plant Quarantine Act, as well as pests within that act, 
and whereas authority to regulate the movement into or through the 
United States from foreign countries of means of conveyance and other 
nonplant products and articles, independently of plants or plant 
products, is not conferred by the Plant Quarantine Act, the regulations 
in this part are promulgated under the authority of the Federal Plant 
Pest Act.


<R05>
Sec. 330.103  Documentation.

    Any notifications, reports, and similar documentation not specified 
in the regulations in this part, but necessary to carry out the purpose 
of the regulations, will be prescribed in administrative instructions.


<R05>
Sec. 330.104  Ports of entry.

    Ports of entry for plant pests, means of conveyance, or other 
products or articles of any character whatsoever the entry or movement 
of which is regulated by the regulations in this part may be specified 
in administrative instructions or in the permits if permits are required 
by the regulations. Such ports shall be selected by the Deputy 
Administrator from ports named in 19 CFR 1.2 as ``ports of entry'' for 
the purpose of enforcing the customs laws or named in 19 CFR 6.13 as 
``international airports,'' or airports at which permission to land 
aircraft has been granted by the Commissioner of Customs or by the 
Collectors of Customs in accordance with 19 CFR 6.2. Except as otherwise 
provided by administrative instructions, or by permits issued in 
accordance with this part, the ports of entry shall be those named in 19 
CFR 1.2 and 6.13. The port of entry in Guam shall be Agana unless 
otherwise specified in the permit by the Deputy Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 330.105  Inspection.

    (a) Inspection of foreign arrivals. In order to prevent the 
dissemination into the United States of plant pests and for the purpose 
of carrying out the regulations in this part, all plant pests; means of 
conveyance and their stores; baggage; mail; plants; plant products; 
soil; stone and quarry products under Sec. 330.300; garbage; and any 
other product or article of any character whatsoever which an inspector 
considers may be infested or infected by or contain a plant pest, 
arriving in the United States from any place outside thereof for entry 
into or movement through the United States shall be subject to 
inspection by an inspector at the port of first arrival, except that 
mail will be handled in accordance with the joint customs and postal 
regulations for inspecting and handling mail. No such plant pests; means 
of conveyance or

[[Page 342]]

their stores; baggage; mail; plants; plant products; soil; stone or 
quarry products under Sec. 330.300; garbage; or other products or 
articles which an inspector notifies the Customs authorities should be 
held for inspection shall be released by Customs officers for entry or 
onward movement until released by an inspector. The release of all means 
of conveyance, products and articles regulated under parts 319, 321, and 
352 of this chapter shall be in accordance with the requirements of 
those parts and the applicable provisions in this part. Whenever it 
shall be deemed safe to modify the requirements of this section by 
exempting any class of means of conveyance, products or articles from 
the requirement that they be held for inspection and release of the 
inspector, the exemptions shall be specified in administrative 
instructions. Inspectors shall make local arrangements, in accordance 
with policies of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs, with the 
Collector of Customs for the release by Customs officers on behalf of 
the inspector of any class of means of conveyance, their stores, 
baggage, mail, or other products or articles when such arrangements do 
not increase unduly the danger of plant pest dissemination and will 
facilitate clearance of means of conveyance, baggage, mail, or other 
products or articles.
    (b) Inspection of domestic movements. For the purpose of preventing 
the interstate movement of plant pests, provisions requiring inspection 
of means of conveyance and products or articles moving interstate may be 
issued as regulations in association with quarantines in part 301 or 
part 318 of this chapter or in this part.

    Note:  Notices appearing at 24 FR 4650, June 9, 1959, 24 FR 5363, 
July 2, 1959, 24 FR 6889, August 26, 1959, and 24 FR 7519, September 18, 
1959, provide in part as follows: That means of conveyance subject to 
such inspection and release requirements and arriving at any port of 
entry outside the regularly assigned hours of duty of the Federal plant 
quarantine inspector, will be held for such inspection and release, 
until the regularly assigned hours of duty. However, notice is also 
hereby given that pursuant to the provisions of the Act of August 28, 
1950 (7 U.S.C. 2260) such inspection service outside of the regularly 
assigned hours of duty may be made available to any interested person, 
upon a reimbursable basis and in accordance with applicable regulations, 
upon request to the Plant Quarantine Inspector in Charge at such port.
    Information concerning regularly assigned hours of duty for Federal 
plant quarantine inspectors at each port where such inspection is 
available may be obtained locally by application to the Plant Quarantine 
Inspector in Charge at such port.

Sec. 330.106  Emergency measures.

    (a) Procedures to prevent pest dissemination. Whenever inspection of 
any means of conveyance, stores, baggage, mail, plants, plant products, 
earth, stone and quarry products, garbage, or other products or articles 
of any character whatsoever, arriving in the United States from a place 
outside thereof, or moving interstate, discloses a plant pest, or 
provides a reason to believe such a pest is present (other than one 
moving under permit in accordance with any conditions in the permit and 
the provisions in this part) which is new to, or not theretofore known 
to be widely prevalent or distributed within and throughout the United 
States, the inspector shall employ procedures necessary to prevent the 
dissemination of the plant pest. Such procedures shall also be employed 
with respect to means of conveyance or products or articles of any 
character whatsoever which have moved into the United States or 
interstate and which the inspector has reason to believe were infested 
or infected by or contained any such plant pest at the time of such 
movement. The inspector may follow administrative instructions 
containing procedures prescribed for certain situations, or he may 
follow a procedure selected by him from administratively approved 
methods known to be effective. The procedure may involve seizure, 
quarantine, treatment, application of other remedial measures, 
exportation, return to shipping point of origin, destruction, or other 
disposal, but no means of conveyance, product, article, or plant pest 
owned by any person shall be destroyed, exported, or returned to 
shipping point of origin or ordered to be so handled, unless there is, 
in the opinion of the inspector, no less drastic action

[[Page 343]]

adequate to prevent the dissemination of the plant pest. In forming such 
an opinion that no less drastic action is adequate, the inspector shall 
be guided by applicable specific and general instructions received from 
officers of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs. This section 
does not authorize action with respect to any means of conveyance, 
product, article, or plant pest which, at the time of the proposed 
action, is subject to disposal under the Plant Quarantine Act. In taking 
action with respect to any means of conveyance, product, article, plant 
pest, the inspector shall take cognizance of applicable requirements of 
the customs and postal laws and regulations.
    (b) Orders for remedial measures. The inspector may order the owner 
of any means of conveyance, product, article, or plant pest, subject to 
disposal under paragraph (a) of this section, to treat, apply other 
remedial measures, destroy, or make other disposal thereof without cost 
to the Federal Government and in a manner specified in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Failure to apply remedial measures. If the measures required by 
the inspector are not applied promptly by the owner within the time 
limits specified by the inspector, the inspector shall apply measures 
necessary to prevent the dissemination of the plant pests.
    (d) Khapra beetle infestations of means of conveyance, or cargo or 
stores thereof; other infestations. As a means of preventing the 
dissemination into the United States, or interstate, of the khapra 
beetle (Trogoderma granarium Everts), the following procedures will be 
applicable when that insect is found, or there is reason to believe it 
is present, in a means of conveyance within paragraph (a) of this 
section, or in any cargo or stores in such a means of conveyance, or in 
any cargo or stores unloaded or landed, or being unloaded or landed, in 
the United States therefrom. These procedures will also apply with 
respect to other plant pests when the inspector finds they are necessary 
and sufficient to prevent the spread of such pests.
    (1) Infestation in storerooms and similar compartments of means of 
conveyance (except aircraft). (i) When infestation is found only in 
stores or storerooms, galleys, pantries, or similar noncargo 
compartments of a means of conveyance, except aircraft, the inspector 
shall prescribe and supervise the application of such remedial measures 
as, in his opinion, will be effective under conditions that will not 
spread the infestation to other parts of the means of conveyance, or to 
adjacent piers or other installations. If, in the opinion of the 
inspector, fumigation is the only available safeguard to eliminate the 
infestation, he shall order the owner to arrange for immediate 
fumigation of the infested stores and portions of the means of 
conveyance.
    (ii) If the means of conveyance is to leave the territorial limits 
of the United States directly for a port in another country within 24 
hours of such order, the inspector may suspend compliance with the 
fumigation requirement pending departure from the United States. Pending 
fumigation or departure, the inspector may seal the openings of infested 
compartments, packages, or articles, if in his opinion the action is 
necessary to prevent plant pest dissemination while the means of 
conveyance remains in the teritorial limits of the United States, as 
authorized in Sec. 330.110. The inspector may extend the 24-hour period 
to 48 hours, if, in his judgment, such extension is warranted by plans 
of the owner to remove the means of conveyance from the territorial 
limits of the United States within the extended period, the inability of 
the contractor to begin fumigation within the 24-hour period, or other 
reason deemed valid by the inspector. Further extension shall be given 
only under authority of the Deputy Administrator. Pending compliance 
with the requirement of fumigation, or the departure from the 
territorial limits of the United States directly for a port in another 
country, no stores, laundry, furnishings or equipment, or other articles 
or products whether in cargo or stores, shall be unloaded from the means 
of conveyance except as authorized by the inspector and under conditions 
prescribed by him. The owner of an infested means of conveyance under 
notice for fumigation which leaves the territorial limits

[[Page 344]]

of the United States without fumigation should arrange for the 
eradication of the infestation before returning to the same or another 
port in the United States. Upon return to a port in the United States 
and unless the infestation has been eliminated to the satisfaction of 
the inspector, the means of conveyance shall be subject to fumigation 
immediately upon arrival in the United States. Unloading or landing of 
any product or article shall not be permitted pending compliance with 
the fumigation requirement, except as authorized by the inspector and 
under conditions prescribed by him.
    (iii) If the means of conveyance is to remain at the port where the 
infestation was found or is to be moved to another port in the United 
States, the inspector shall prescribe and supervise the application of 
the remedial measures at the port where the infestation is found, as 
provided in this paragraph, or he may authorize the means of conveyance 
to be moved to another port for fumigation or the application of other 
remedial measures under safeguards prescribed by him.
    (iv) In all instances where the inspector prescribed procedures 
concerned with the application of remedial measures which involve (a) 
withholding permission to discharge articles or products; (b) permission 
to discharge after such permission has been withheld; (c) discontinuance 
of discharging; or (d) resumption of discharging after it has been 
discontinued, the appropriate Customs officer shall be immediately 
notified in writing. The inspector shall also inform the Customs 
officers at the port where the infestation is found and at such other 
ports as may be necessary of the requirement for fumigation and/or 
permission to move coastwise to another U.S. port for fumigation or 
other remedial measures.
    (2) Infestation in cargo compartments of means of conveyance (except 
aircraft). When infestation is found in cargo compartments or in cargo 
of a means of conveyance, except aircraft, the inspector shall prescribe 
and supervise the application of such remedial measures as, in his 
opinion are necessary, with respect to the cargo and the portions of the 
means of conveyance which contain or contained or were contaminated by 
the infested cargo. If in the opinion of the inspector fumigation is the 
only available safeguard to eliminate the infestation, he shall order 
the owner to arrange for immediate fumigation of the infested portions 
of such means of conveyance and cargo. However, if such cargo 
compartments cannot be fumigated without fumigating the entire means of 
conveyance, the inspector may order the entire means of conveyance and 
cargo to be fumigated. The inspector shall notify the owner of the means 
of conveyance of such requirement and the owner shall arrange for 
immediate fumigation. Discharge of cargo shall be discontinued unless 
the inspector allows it to continue under safeguards to be prescribed by 
him. The provisions applicable to stores and storerooms in paragraph 
(d)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section shall apply to cargo and cargo 
areas of such means of conveyance. Customs officers shall be informed as 
required in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.
    (3) Infestation in an aircraft. If infestation is found in an 
aircraft, the inspector may apply seals as provided in Sec. 330.110, and 
he may require such temporary safeguards as he deems necessary, 
including the discontinuance of further unloading or landing of any 
products or articles except as authorized by him. Upon finding such 
infestation in an aircraft the inspector shall promptly notify the Plant 
Protection and Quarantine Programs of all circumstances and the 
temporary safeguards employed, and the Plant Protection and Quarantine 
Programs will specify the measures for eliminating the infestation which 
will not be deleterious to the aircraft or its operating components. Any 
insecticidal application required shall be approved by the Deputy 
Administrator for use in aircraft. If the aircraft is to depart from the 
territorial limits of the United States within 24 hours after the 
infestation is found, the inspector shall permit such departure in lieu 
of the application of other measures and shall prior to departure break 
any seals that would prevent access to the aircraft or safe operation 
thereof. Other seals shall remain intact at time of departure and shall 
be broken by the aircraft commander or a crew member upon his

[[Page 345]]

order only after the aircraft is beyond the territorial limits of the 
United States. Extension of the 24-hour period shall be given only under 
authority of the Deputy Administrator. The owner of the aircraft under 
notice of khapra beetle infestation which leaves the territorial limits 
of the United States before the infestation has been eradicated should 
arrange for eradication before returning the aircraft to the United 
States. Upon return to the United States, if the infestation is not 
eliminated to the satisfaction of the inspector, the aircraft shall be 
subject to the same disinfestation requirements and other safeguards 
immediately upon arrival in the United States. Customs officers shall be 
notified as required in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.
    (4) Precautions. The owner of a means of conveyance required to be 
fumigated pursuant to this section shall arrange with a competent 
operator to apply the fumigant under the supervision of the inspector. 
The owner shall understand that if certain fumigants are used they may 
result in residues in or on foodstuffs which may render them unsafe for 
use as food items. He is hereby warned against such use unless as 
ascertains that the fumigated foodstuffs are fit for human consumption. 
It should also be understood by the owner that emergency measures 
prescribed by the inspector to safeguard against dissemination of 
infestation may have adverse effects on certain products and articles, 
and that the acceptance of fumigation as a requirement is an alternative 
to the immediate removal of the infested means of conveyance and any 
products and articles thereon, from the territorial limits of the United 
States. Products or articles in a means of conveyance, or compartments 
thereof, which may be exposed to methyl bromide or other remedial 
measures and may be adversely affected thereby, may be removed from the 
means of conveyance or compartments thereof prior to the application of 
the remedial measures if in the opinion of the inspector this can be 
done without danger of plant pest dissemination and under conditions 
authorized by him, for additional inspection and/or application of 
effective remedial measures.

Sec. 330.107  Costs.

    All costs (including those incurred under Sec. 330.106 of this part 
by the government or the owner) incident to the inspection, handling, 
cleaning, safeguarding, treating, or other disposal of means of 
conveyance or products, articles, or plant pests under this part shall 
be borne by the owner. Services of the inspector during regularly 
assigned hours of duty at the usual places of duty shall be furnished 
without cost to the person requesting the services, unless a user fee is 
payable under Sec. 354.3 of this chapter.

    Cross reference: See note following Sec. 330.105.

[56 FR 14844, Apr. 12, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 330.108  Authority to issue administrative instructions.

    The Deputy Administrator is authorized to issue the administrative 
instructions for which provision is made in the regulations in this 
part, for the purpose of preventing dissemination of plant pests into 
the United States or interstate. In addition, whenever the Deputy 
Administrator shall find that existing conditions as to pest risk 
involved in the movement of plant pests, means of conveyance, or other 
products or articles to which the regulations in this part apply, make 
it safe to modify by making less stringent the restrictions contained in 
any of such regulations, he shall publish such findings in 
administrative instructions, specifying the manner in which the 
regulations shall be made less stringent whereupon such modification 
shall become effective.


<R05>
Sec. 330.109  Caution.

    In applying treatments or taking other measures prescribed in 
administrative instructions or by the inspector, it should be understood 
that inexactness or carelessness may result in injury or damage.

[[Page 346]]


<R05>
Sec. 330.110  Seals.

    (a) Use authorized; form. Whenever, in the opinion of the inspector, 
it is necessary, as a safeguard in order to prevent the dissemination of 
plant pests into the United States, or interstate, seals may be applied 
to openings, packages, or articles requiring the security provided by 
such seals. The words ``openings, packages, or articles'' shall include 
any form of container, shelf, bin, compartment, or other opening, 
package, or article which the inspector may have occasion to seal in 
lieu of more drastic action or otherwise, as a safeguard against plant 
pest dissemination. The seals may be automatic metal seals or labels or 
tags and will be provided by the Plant Protection and Quarantine 
Programs. When they consist of a label or tag, they will be printed in 
black ink on yellow paper and read substantially as follows: ``Warning! 
The opening, package, or article to which this seal is affixed is sealed 
under authority of law. This seal is not to be broken while within the 
territorial limits of the United States except by, or under instructions 
of, an inspector.''
    (b) Breaking of seals. Seals may be broken: (1) By an inspector; (2) 
by a Customs officer for Customs purposes, in which case the opening, 
package, or article will be resealed with Customs seals; (3) by the 
owner or his agent when the means of conveyance, product, or article has 
left the territorial limits of the United States; (4) by any person 
authorized by the inspector or the Deputy Administrator under conditions 
specified by the inspector or Deputy Administrator. No person shall 
break seals applied under authority of this section except as provided 
in this paragraph. The movement into or through the United States, or 
interstate, of any means of conveyance or product or article on which a 
seal, applied under this paragraph, has been broken in violation of this 
paragraph is hereby prohibited, except as authorized by an inspector.
    (c) Notice of sealing. When an inspector seals any opening, product 
or article, he shall explain the purpose of such action to the owner or 
his representative and shall present him with a written notice of the 
conditions under which the seal may be broken, if requested to do so.

Sec. 330.111  Advance notification of arrival of aircraft and watercraft.

    The owner, operator, or other representative of any aircraft or 
watercraft entering the United States from a foreign country, or 
arriving in the continental United States from Hawaii or any territory 
or possession of the United States, shall provide every Plant Protection 
and Quarantine office (PPQ office) serving a port of arrival on the 
itinerary of the craft while in the United States with advance 
notification of intent to arrive at that port. This advance notification 
of arrival shall:
    (a) Reach the appropriate PPQ office not less than 12 hours before 
the craft's estimated time of arrival at the port;
    (b) Be communicated by radio, wire, telephone, or any other means; 
and
    (c) Include the following information:
    (1) The name or other identifying feature of the individual craft;
    (2) The date and estimated time of arrival at the port;
    (3) The location of arrival, providing the most site-specific data 
available, such as the dock, pier, wharf, berth, mole, anchorage, gate, 
or facility, and;
    (4) The names of all foreign and non-Continental U.S. ports where 
any cargo, crew, or passenger destined for the continental United States 
has boarded the craft since its most recent arrival at a port in the 
United States.
    (d) If the craft's estimated time of arrival changes by more than 
one hour, the PPQ office that serves the port of arrival must be 
notified and provided with updated information immediately.
    (e) If the craft's site of arrival changes after a PPQ office has 
received advance notification of arrival, both that PPQ office and the 
newly affected PPQ office shall be notified of this change immediately. 
This applies, too, to site-specific changes involving watercraft.
    (f) If the craft's point of arrival is an anchorage, the PPQ office 
shall be notified, as soon as possible after the craft's arrival at the 
anchorage, of the

                    Subpart--Movement of Plant Pests


<R05>
Sec. 330.200  Movement of plant pests regulated; permits required.

    No person shall knowingly move any plant pest into or through the 
United States from any place outside thereof, or interstate, or 
knowingly accept delivery of any plant pest so moving unless such 
movement is authorized under permit under this part and is made in 
accordance with the conditions therein and the provisions in this part. 
The movement of snails and slugs, as well as other plant pests, is 
governed by such provisions. Biological specimens of plant pests, in 
preservative or dried, may be imported without further restriction under 
this part, but subject to inspection on arrival in the United States to 
confirm the nature of the material and freedom from risk of plant pest 
dissemination.


<R05>
Sec. 330.201  Applications for permits to move plant pests.

    (a) Into or through the United States from any place outside 
thereof. Only persons resident in the United States may apply for 
permits to move plant pests into the United States from any place 
outside thereof. Persons resident in the United States proposing such 
movement into the United States, or any person proposing movement 
through the United States, of any plant pests shall first make 
application for permits authorizing such movement by submitting to the 
Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs the form provided therefor by 
the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs, or by submitting in the 
form of a letter or other written communication the following 
information insofar as is known to the applicant, for each kind of pest 
for which a permit is requested: (1) Scientific name of the pest, (2) 
stage, (3) quantity, (4) origin, (5) destination, (6) whether the pest 
is established in the State, Territory or other jurisdiction of 
destination in the United States, (7) method of shipment, (8) proposed 
port of first arrival in the United States, (9) approximate date of 
arrival, (10) number of parcels expected to be moved, (11) intended use, 
(12) measures to be employed to prevent danger of plant pest 
dissemination, and (13) method of final disposition. In addition, if 
host materials must necessarily accompany the plant pests, the 
application shall show the name of the host materials and the reasons it 
is necessary for them to accompany the plant pests. Applications for 
permits to move plant pests through the United States should

[[Page 348]]

state the name of the port of export instead of the information required 
by paragraph (a)(6) of this section. Any applicant for a permit to move 
plant pests into or through the United States from any place outside 
thereof will facilitate the consideration of his application by 
furnishing any additional information known to him concerning the 
economic importance of the pests and the justification for the movement.
    (b) Interstate (including interstate for export). Persons proposing 
to move plant pests interstate shall first make application for permits 
authorizing such movement by submitting to the Plant Protection and 
Quarantine Programs the form provided therefor by the Plant Protection 
and Quarantine Programs or by submitting the required information in the 
form of a letter or other written communication showing all pertinent 
information specified in paragraph (a) of this section and also the 
approximate date of the movement, except that persons desiring to move 
plant pests interstate to a port in the United States for export to a 
place outside of the United States \1\ shall use the form provided 
therefor by the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs or submit to 
the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs in the form of a letter or 
other written communication the following information for each kind of 
pest: Scientific name of the pest, stage, quantity, origin, destination, 
method of shipment, proposed port of export from the United States, 
approximate date of the movement, number of parcels to be moved, 
proposed use, and measures to be employed to prevent danger of plant 
pest dissemination during the interstate movement. However, in case it 
is proposed to move interstate, within or from an area quarantined under 
Secs. 301.38, 301.45, 301.48, 301.52, 301.63, 301.64, 301.72, 301.76, 
301.77, 301.78, 301.79, 301.80, or 301.81 of this chapter any plant pest 
covered by said section, the application should be made to the Plant 
Protection and Quarantine Programs of the Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service of the Department. In any case the applicant for a 
permit will facilitate the consideration of his application by 
furnishing any additional information known to him concerning the 
economic importance of the pests and the justification for the movement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Persons contemplating the shipment of plant pests to places 
outside the United States should make prior arrangements directly, or 
through the recipient, with the country of destination for the receipt 
of the plant pests into the country of destination. Many countries have 
laws governing the movement of plant pests into those countries, and 
therefore it is advisable to make advance arrangements for attaching 
permits, etc., as may be required by the countries of destination.

Sec. 330.202  Consideration of applications for permits to move plant pests.

    The Deputy Administrator, upon the receipt of an application, made 
in accordance with Sec. 330.201 (a) or (b), for a permit for movement of 
a plant pest into or through the United States from any place outside 
thereof, or interstate, shall consider the application on its merits.
    (a) Consultation. He may consult with any Federal officials, the 
appropriate officials of any State, Territory, or other jurisdiction in 
the United States in charge of research or regulatory programs relative 
to plant pests, and any other qualified governmental or private research 
laboratory, institution, or individual, for views on the danger of plant 
pest dissemination into the United States, or interstate, in connection 
with the movement proposed.
    (b) Inspection of premises. The Deputy Administrator may inspect the 
site where plant pests are proposed to be handled in connection with or 
after their movement under permit to determine whether existing or 
proposed facilities will be adequate to prevent plant pest dissemination 
in case a permit is issued, provided that the person in possession 
thereof is the applicant

[[Page 349]]

or such inspection is otherwise authorized.

<R05>
Sec. 330.203  Action on applications for permits to move plant pests; form of and conditions in permits.

    The Deputy Administrator, having considered an application for 
permit to move a plant pest, shall approve or deny the application in 
accordance with Sec. 330.204. If the application is denied, the 
applicant shall be furnished the reasons therefor. If the application is 
approved, the Deputy Administrator shall issue the permit including any 
conditions which, in the opinion of the Deputy Administrator, are 
necessary to prevent dissemination of plant pests into the United States 
or interstate. Such conditions may include requirements for inspection 
of the premises where the plant pests are to be handled, after their 
movement under the permits, to determine whether the facilities thereat 
are adequate to prevent plant pest dissemination and the conditions of 
the permit are otherwise being observed. Permits authorizing movement of 
plant pests through the United States will include shipping instructions 
as to routing, labelling, and similar requirements as conditions of the 
permits. Any applicable conditions prescribed in administrative 
instructions may be incorporated in a written permit by citation, but 
shall be applicable whether or not so cited. The Deputy Administrator 
may, prior to the issuance of the permit, require the applicant to agree 
in writing to the conditions under which the plant pests will be 
safeguarded. The permits may be issued in a prescribed form or in letter 
form, or a combination thereof. A permit without conditions may be 
issued orally.


<R05>
Sec. 330.204  Denial or cancellation of permits; reconsiderations.

    (a) The Deputy Administrator will deny an application for a permit 
to move a plant pest when, in his opinion, such movement would involve a 
danger of dissemination of the pest. Danger of plant pest dissemination 
may be deemed to exist when:
    (1) No acceptable safeguards adequate to prevent plant pest 
dissemination can be arranged;
    (2) The destructive potential of the plant pest to plants, and parts 
and products thereof, should it escape despite proposed safeguards, 
outweighs the probable benefits to be derived from the proposed movement 
and use of the pest;
    (3) The applicant, as a previous permittee, failed to maintain the 
safeguards or otherwise observe the conditions prescribed in a previous 
permit and failed to demonstrate his ability or intent to observe them 
in the future;
    (4) The movement is adverse to the conduct of an eradication, 
suppression, control, or regulatory program of the Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service; or
    (5) The movement is objected to in writing by an appropriate 
official of a State, Territory or possession, or the District of 
Columbia on the ground it will involve a danger of dissemination of the 
plant pest into the State, Territory or possession, or District.
    (b) The Deputy Administrator may cancel any outstanding permit 
whenever:
    (1) Information is received subsequent to the issuance of the permit 
of circumstances that constitute cause for the denial of an application 
for permit under paragraph (a) of this section; or
    (2) The permittee has not maintained the safeguards or otherwise 
observed the conditions specified in the permit or in any applicable 
regulations or administrative instructions.
    (c) Any person denied a permit, or whose permit has been canceled, 
may request the Deputy Administrator in person or in writing for a 
reconsideration, and may submit any additional information he may have 
to support the original application.


<R05>
Sec. 330.205  Disposal of plant pests when permits are canceled.

    When an outstanding permit for the movement of a plant pest is 
canceled by the Deputy Administrator and not reinstated under 
Sec. 330.204(c), the further movement of the plant pest covered

[[Page 350]]

thereby into or through the United States, or interstate, is prohibited 
by the Federal Plant Pest Act unless authorized in another permit. The 
permittee should arrange for disposal of the plant pest involved in a 
manner satisfactory to the Deputy Administrator to prevent plant pest 
dissemination. The Deputy Administrator may, whenever he deems it 
necessary as an emergency measure in order to prevent the dissemination 
of any plant pest new to or not theretofore known to be widely prevalent 
or distributed within and throughout the United States, seize, 
quarantine, treat, apply other remedial measures to, destroy, or 
otherwise dispose of, in such manner as he deems appropriate, any plant 
pest which is moving without compliance with any conditions in the 
permit or the provisions of this part or after the permit has been 
canceled.


<R05>
Sec. 330.206  Permits for plant pest movement associated with National Defense projects.

    The Deputy Administrator will facilitate research associated with 
National Defense projects through issuance of permits for movement of 
plant pests for such research, upon receiving assurance satisfactory to 
him that adequate safeguards will surround utilization of the plant 
pests to prevent their dissemination.


<R05>
Sec. 330.207  Permits for movement of organisms issued by other agencies.

    Inspectors shall recognize permits for the movement of organisms 
issued under other acts by other Federal agencies. When such organisms 
are also plant pests, any further conditions of movement to carry out 
the purposes of the Federal Plant Pest Act which have been prescribed in 
administrative instructions, or in correspondence concerning a single 
shipment, shall be complied with but no additional permit will be 
required under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 330.208  Courtesy permits.

    The Deputy Administrator may issue permits for the movement into or 
through the United States, or interstate, or organisms which are not 
subject to regulation under the Federal Plant Pest Act or any other act, 
as a courtesy to facilitate movement when the movement might otherwise 
be impeded because of the similarity of the organisms with others 
regulated under the Federal Plant Pest Act. He may likewise issue such 
permits on behalf of any agency requesting such action as a courtesy to 
facilitate movement for organisms not subject to regulation under the 
Federal Plant Pest Act but subject to regulation under some other act.


<R05>
Sec. 330.209  Permits for means of conveyance.

    No permit shall be required for movement into or through the United 
States from any place outside thereof, or interstate, of a means of 
conveyance unless the primary purpose of such movement of the means of 
conveyance is to move plant pests.


<R05>
Sec. 330.210  Packing materials and containers for plant pest movement; host materials.

    Plant pests moved into or through the United States, or interstate, 
must be free of soil, except when the Deputy Administrator approves in 
the permit the movement of soil with the plant pest. Subject to this 
exception, only approved packing materials are to be employed in the 
shipment of plant pests. Approved packing materials for the movement of 
plant pests under this part will be prescribed in administrative 
instructions or approved in specific cases by the Deputy Administrator. 
Such actions will be coordinated with and may supplement any 
requirements of the Post Office Department governing packing and 
packaging of any materials for movements covered by the postal laws and 
regulations. All containers shall be stoutly constructed so as to 
prevent breakage in transit and danger of plant pest dissemination and 
shall be labeled in accordance with Sec. 330.211. The Deputy 
Administrator may allow the movement of host materials with plant pests 
under permits when they must necessarily accompany the pests, although 
such movement is otherwise barred under the Plant Quarantine Act.

<R05>
Sec. 330.210a  Administrative instructions listing approved packing materials for plant pests.

    (a) The following materials are approved as packing materials for 
use with any shipment of plant pests in accordance with Sec. 330.210:
    (1) Absorbent cotton or processed cotton padding free of cottonseed.
    (2) Cellulose materials.
    (3) Excelsior.
    (4) Felt.
    (5) Ground peat (peat moss).
    (6) Paper or paper products.
    (7) Phenolic resin foam.
    (8) Sawdust.
    (9) Sponge rubber.
    (10) Thread waste; twine; or cord.
    (11) Vermiculite.
    (b) Advance approval for the use of any other packing material for 
any specific movement should be obtained from the Deputy Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 330.211  Labelling of plant pests for movement under permits.

    (a) Interstate movement. For interstate movements of plant pests a 
label shall be attached to each parcel containing the pests as evidence 
that the movement of the plant pests is authorized. Such label shall 
also disclose the contents of the parcel.
    (b) Movement into or through the United States from places outside 
thereof by mail or cargo. (1) When a permit authorizing the movement of 
plant pests into the United States from any place outside thereof is 
issued to an applicant under this part, it will be accompanied by 
distinctive labels, with instructions for their use by the foreign 
shipper. Such labels will be issued in quantity sufficient to permit 
attaching one to each parcel to be moved. The labels will direct the 
parcels to specified inspection stations of the Plant Protection and 
Quarantine Programs, or other designated points, for clearance. The 
stations will be notified by the Deputy Administrator in advance of the 
expected arrival of the plant pests. Plant pests so moved by mail may be 
refused entry unless the containers thereof bear such labels. Cargo 
shipments of plant pests so moved may be refused entry unless they bear 
such labels or are otherwise plainly marked to identify the contents.
    (2) Any labelling requirements with respect to the movement of plant 
pests through the United States will be included in shipping 
instructions issued as conditions of the permits.
    (c) Misuse of labels. No labels unused in accordance with the terms 
of the permit may be used for the movement of any other plant pest. The 
Federal Plant Pest Act provides a penalty \2\ for the misuse of labels 
under this part. Any unauthorized movement of plant pests under a label 
shall be refused by the inspector, and the plant pests so moved may be 
destroyed or otherwise dealt with as set out in Sec. 330.106 if deemed 
necessary as an emergency measure under that section.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Section 108 of the Federal Plant Pest Act provides: ``Any person 
who violates section 103 of this act, or any regulation promulgated 
under this act, or who forges, counterfeits, or without authority from 
the Secretary uses, alters, or defaces any permit or other document 
provided for by this act or the regulations thereunder, shall be guilty 
of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $500, or 
by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both.''

Sec. 330.212  Movement of plant pests by baggage.

    Persons proposing to move plant pests into or through the United 
States from any place outside thereof, or from any Territory or 
possession into or through any other Territory or possession, or the 
Continental United States, by baggage, shall show the permit authorizing 
the movement to the inspector upon arrival at the port where the baggage 
is inspected. The conditions specified for the movement must be 
observed. The inspector will insure that the movement is handled in 
accordance with the terms of the permit. If it is necessary to move the 
plant pest to another place for clearance, the owner will be responsible 
for all costs incidental to such forwarding. Pending forwarding, the 
inspector will specify and supervise the application of safeguards 
against danger of plant pest dissemination and may retain custody of the 
pests until forwarded.

          Subpart--Movement of Soil, Stone, And Quarry Products


<R05>
Sec. 330.300  Soil from foreign countries or Territories or possessions.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The movement of soil from Puerto Rico into or through any other 
State, Territory, or District of the United States is also subject to 
the provisions of the imported fire ant quarantine and regulations 
contained in 7 CFR 301.81 et seq.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No soil shall be moved into or through the United States from any 
place outside thereof or from any Territory or possession into or 
through any other Territory or possession or the Continental United 
States, whether the soil is moved as such or incidentally adhering to 
means of conveyance or other articles, except as authorized in 
Sec. 318.60 or Sec. 319.69 of this chapter, or this subpart.
    (a) Permits authorized. The Deputy Administrator may issue permits 
under this section for movements of soil not governed by Sec. 318.60 or 
Sec. 319.69 of this chapter, for research, analytical, religious, 
ceremonial, patriotic, or similar purposes, or such other purposes as he 
shall deem consistent with the objectives of this part, specifying in 
the permit or in the related correspondence, the safeguards, including 
methods of treatment, or other conditions which he deems necessary for 
the purpose of preventing the dissemination of plant pests into the 
United States or interstate. Whenever it is possible to formulate a 
general rule specifying such conditions, it shall be promulgated in 
administrative instructions and the applicable provisions thereof may be 
incorporated into a permit by citation, but shall be applicable whether 
or not so cited.
    (b) Application for permits. Only persons resident in the United 
States may apply for permits under this section to move soil into the 
United States from any place outside thereof, or from any territory or 
possession into or through any other Territory or possession or the 
Continental United States. Persons resident in the United States 
contemplating such movements, or any persons contemplating movement 
through the United States, of soil under this section shall first make 
application for permits authorizing such movement by submitting to the 
Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs the form provided therefor by 
the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs or by submitting, in the 
form of a letter or other written communication, the following 
information: Origin of the shipment, destination, quantity, method of 
shipment, proposed port of first arrival in the United States, port of 
export (if applicable), approximate date of arrival in the United 
States, intended use, measures to be employed to prevent danger of plant 
pest dissemination, method of final disposition, and the number of 
parcels expected to be moved. In acting upon the application for permits 
for such movement of soil, the Deputy Administrator will follow the 
procedures outlined in Sec. 330.202 for the consideration of 
applications for permits to move plant pests insofar as they are 
applicable.
    (c) Issuance of permits; conditions of permits. Upon the approval of 
an application for a permit authorizing the movement of soil under this 
section, the permit will be issued. The permit may contain any 
conditions which are necessary, in the opinion of the Deputy 
Administrator, to prevent dissemination of plant pests into the United 
States or interstate, including conditions with respect to routing, 
packing, and labeling of the soil. The Deputy Administrator may require 
the applicant to agree in writing to such conditions prior to the 
issuance of the permit. The importer will receive, as a part of the 
permit, information on the manner in which the importation is to be 
made. A permit without conditions may be issued orally.
    (d) Containers; labels. All containers for soil moved under this 
section shall be stoutly constructed so as to prevent breakage in 
transit and danger of plant pest dissemination and shall be 
appropriately labeled as to contents. If the soil is moved by mail, 
special mailing labels will be issued to the importer, with instructions 
for their use, which he is to send to the foreign shipper. The quantity 
of mailing labels issued will be sufficient for the foreign shipper to 
attach one to each parcel moved

[[Page 353]]

by mail. Such mailing labels will indicate to the postal and the plant 
quarantine officials that the movement is authorized under the 
conditions specified in this permit. Importations arriving by mail 
without labels will be subject to refusal of entry into the United 
States, or interstate movement, by the inspector unless treated, at the 
expense of the owner, in a manner to remove danger of plant pest 
dissemination. The Deputy Administrator may issue mailing labels for 
movement into or through the United States from any place outside 
thereof, or from any Territory or possession into or through any other 
Territory or possession of the continental United States, of earth other 
than soil when the movement might otherwise be impeded because of the 
similarity to soil subject to this section.

                            Subpart--Garbage


<R05>
Sec. 330.400  Regulation of certain garbage.

    (a) Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands of the United States, 
Guam, and all other Insular Possessions of the United States are hereby 
quarantined, and the movement therefrom to other parts of the United 
States of garbage is hereby regulated as provided in this section to 
prevent the spread of dangerous plant diseases and insect pests 
specified in Secs. 318.13, 318.58, and 318.82 or other plant pests which 
exist in these areas. Also, to prevent the dissemination of plant pests 
and livestock and poultry diseases, garbage is regulated as otherwise 
provided in this part because of international movements of means of 
conveyance.
    (b) Garbage. For purposes of this part, ``garbage'' means all waste 
material derived in whole or in part from fruits, vegetables, meats, or 
other plant or

[[Page 354]]

animal (including poultry) material, and other refuse of any character 
whatsoever that has been associated with any such material on board any 
means of conveyance, and including food scraps, table refuse, galley 
refuse, food wrappers or packaging materials, and other waste material 
from stores, food preparation areas, passengers' or crews' quarters, 
dining rooms, or any other areas on means of conveyance. For purposes of 
this part, garbage also means meals and other food that were available 
for consumption by passengers and crew on an aircraft but were not 
consumed.

    Note:  Not all garbage is regulated for the purposes of this part. 
Garbage regulated for the purposes of this part is defined as 
``regulated garbage'' in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.

    (c) Garbage regulated because of movements outside the United States 
or Canada. For purposes of this part, garbage on or removed from a means 
of conveyance is regulated garbage, if, when the garbage is on or 
removed from the means of conveyance, the means of conveyance has been 
in any port outside the United States and Canada within the previous 2-
year period. There are, however, two exceptions to this provision. These 
exceptions are as follows:
    (1) Exception 1. Garbage on or removed in the United States from a 
means of conveyance other than an aircraft is exempt from requirements 
under paragraph (c) of this section, if the following conditions are met 
when the garbage is on or removed from the means of conveyance:
    (i) The means of conveyance is accompanied by a certificate from an 
inspector stating the following:
    (A) That the means of conveyance had previously been cleared of all 
garbage and of all meats and meat products, whatever the country of 
origin, except meats that are shelf-stable; all fresh and condensed milk 
and cream from countries designated in 9 CFR 94.1 as those in which 
foot-and-mouth disease exists; all fresh fruits and vegetables; and all 
eggs; and the items cleared from the means of conveyance as prescribed 
by this paragraph have been disposed of according to the procedures for 
disposing of regulated garbage, as specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section.
    (B) That the means of conveyance had then been cleaned and 
disinfected in the presence of the inspector; and
    (ii) Since being cleaned and disinfected, the means of conveyance 
has not been in a non-Canadian foreign port.
    (2) Exception 2. Garbage on or removed from an aircraft is exempt 
from requirements under paragraph (c) of this section if the following 
conditions are met when the garbage is on or removed from the aircraft:
    (i) The aircraft had been cleared of all garbage and all stores; and 
the items cleared from the aircraft as prescribed by this paragraph have 
been disposed of according to the procedures for disposing of regulated 
garbage, as specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
    (ii) After the garbage and stores referred to in paragraph (c)(2)(i) 
of this section were removed, the aircraft has not been in a non-
Canadian foreign port.
    (d) Garbage regulated because of certain movements to or from 
Hawaii, territories, or possessions. For purposes of this part, garbage 
on or removed from a means of conveyance is regulated garbage, if at the 
time the garbage is on or removed from the means of conveyance, the 
means of conveyance has moved during the previous one-year period, 
either directly or indirectly, to the continental United States from any 
territory or possession or from Hawaii; to any territory or possession 
from any other territory or possession or from Hawaii, or to Hawaii from 
any territory or possession. There are, however, two exceptions to this 
provision. These exceptions are as follows:
    (1) Exception 1. Garbage on or removed from a means of conveyance 
other than an aircraft is exempt from requirements under paragraph (d) 
of this section if the following two conditions are met when the garbage 
is on or removed from the means of conveyance:
    (i) The means of conveyance is accompanied by certificate from an 
inspector, saying that the means of conveyance had been cleared of all 
garbage and all fresh fruits and vegetables; and

[[Page 355]]

the items cleared from the means of conveyance as prescribed by this 
paragraph have been disposed of according to the procedures for 
disposing of regulated garbage, as specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section.
    (ii) After being cleared of the garbage and stores referred to in 
paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, the means of conveyance has not 
moved to the continental United States from any territory or possession 
or from Hawaii; to any territory or possession from any other territory 
or possession or from Hawaii; or to Hawaii from any territory or 
possession.
    (2) Exception 2. Garbage on or removed from an aircraft is exempt 
from requirements under paragraph (d) of this section if the following 
two conditions are met when the garbage is on or removed from the 
aircraft:
    (i) The aircraft had been previously cleared of all garbage and all 
fresh fruits and vegetables; and the items cleared from the aircraft as 
prescribed by this paragraph have been disposed of according to the 
procedures for disposing of regulated garbage, as specified in paragraph 
(g)(1) of this section.
    (ii) After the garbage and stores referred to in paragraph (d)(2)(i) 
of this section were removed, the aircraft has not moved to the 
continental United States from any territory or possession or from 
Hawaii; to any territory or possession from any other territory or 
possession or from Hawaii; or to Hawaii from any territory or 
possession.
    (e) Garbage that is commingled with regulated garbage is also 
regulated garbage.
    (f) Restrictions on regulated garbage. (1) Regulated garbage shall 
not be on or removed from a means of conveyance, or be disposed of, 
unless in accordance with the provisions of this part. (2) Regulated 
garbage is subject to general surveillance for compliance with this 
section by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service inspectors and to 
such disposal measures as authorized by section 105 of the Federal Plant 
Pest Act (7 U.S.C. 150dd), section 10 of the Plant Quarantine Act of 
1912, as amended (7 U.S.C. 164a), section 2 of the Act of February 2, 
1903, as amended (21 U.S.C. 111), and section 306 of the Act of July 17, 
1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1306), to prevent the dissemination of plant 
pests and livestock or poultry diseases.
    (g)(1) All regulated garbage must be contained in tight, leak-proof 
covered receptacles during storage on board a means of conveyance while 
in the territorial waters, or while otherwise within the territory of 
the United States. All such receptacles shall be contained inside the 
guard rail if on a watercraft. Such regulated garbage shall not be 
unloaded from such means of conveyance in the United States unless such 
regulated garbage is removed in tight, leak-proof receptacles under the 
direction of an Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service inspector to 
an approved facility for incineration, sterilization, or grinding into 
an approved sewage system, under supervision by such an inspector, or 
such regulated garbage is removed for other handling in such manner and 
under such supervision as may, upon request in specific cases, be 
approved by the Administrator as complying with the applicable laws for 
environmental protection and as adequate to prevent the dissemination 
into or within the United States of plant pests and livestock or poultry 
diseases. Provided that, a cruise ship may dispose of regulated garbage 
in landfills at Alaskan ports only, if and only if the cruise ship does 
not have prohibited or restricted meat or animal products on board at 
the time it enters Alaskan waters for the cruise season, and only if the 
cruise ship, except for incidental travel through international waters 
necessary to navigate safely between ports, remains in Canadian and U.S. 
waters off the west coast of North America, and calls only at 
continental U.S. and Canadian ports during the entire cruise season.
    (2) Application for approval of a facility or sewage system may be 
made in writing by the authorized representative of any carrier or by 
the official having jurisdiction over the port or place of arrival of 
the means of conveyance, to the Administrator, Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 
20250. The application shall be endorsed by the operator of the facility 
or sewage system. Approval will

[[Page 356]]

be granted if the Administrator determines that the requirements set 
forth in this section are met. Approval may be denied or withdrawn at 
any time, if the Administrator determines that such requirements are not 
met, after notice of the proposed denial or withdrawal of the approval 
and the reasons therefor, and an opportunity to demonstrate or achieve 
compliance with such requirements, has been afforded to the operator of 
the facility or sewage system and to the applicant for approval. 
However, approval may also be withdrawn without such prior procedure in 
any case in which the public health, interest, or safety requires 
immediate action, and in such case, the operator of the facility or 
sewage system and the applicant for approval shall promptly thereafter 
be given notice of the withdrawal and the reasons therefor and an 
opportunity to show cause why the approval should be reinstated.

    (h) The Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs and Veterinary 
Services, Animal, and Plant Health Inspection Service, will cooperate 
with other Federal, State, and local agencies responsible for enforcing 
other statutes and regulations governing disposal of the regulated 
garbage to the end that such disposal shall be adequate to prevent the 
dissemination of plant pests and livestock or poultry diseases and 
comply with applicable laws for environmental protection. The 
inspectors, in maintaining surveillance over regulated garbage movements 
and disposal, shall coordinate their activities with the activities of 
representatives of the Environmental Protection Agency and other 
Federal, State, and local agencies also having jurisdiction over such 
regulated garbage.
    (i) As used in this section:
    (1) Sterilization'' means cooking regulated garbage at 212 deg. F. 
for 30 minutes and disposal of the residue by burying in a landfill, 
except that the burial provisions do not apply to materials extracted 
from the residue after cooking and determined by the Administrator to be 
unsuitable for use as food or as soil additives.
    (2) Incineration means to reduce the regulated garbage to ash by 
burning;
    (3) Approved sewage system means a sewage system approved by the 
Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, upon his 
determination that the system is designed and operated in such a way as 
to preclude the discharge of sewage effluents onto land surfaces or into 
lagoons or other stationary waters, and otherwise is adequate to prevent 
the dissemination of plant pests and livestock or poultry diseases, and 
that is certified by an appropriate Government official as currently 
complying with the applicable laws for environmental protection.
    (4) Approved facility means a facility approved by the 
Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, upon his 
determination that it has equipment and uses procedures that are 
adequate to prevent the dissemination of plant pests and livestock or 
poultry diseases, and that it is certified by an appropriate Government 
official as currently complying with the applicable laws for 
environmental protection.
    (5) Carrier means the principal operator of a means of conveyance.
    (j) Compliance agreement and cancellation. (1) Any person engaged in 
the business of handling or disposing of regulated garbage must first 
enter into a compliance agreement with the Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service (APHIS). Compliance agreement forms (PPQ Form 519) 
are available without charge from local USDA/APHIS/Plant Protection and 
Quarantine offices, which are listed in telephone directories.
    (2) A person who enters into a compliance agreement, and employees 
or agents of that person, shall comply with the following conditions and 
any supplemental conditions which shall be listed in the compliance 
agreement, as deemed by the Administrator to be necessary to prevent the 
dissemination into or within the United States of plant pests and 
livestock or poultry diseases:
    (i) Comply with the provisions of 7 CFR 330.400;
    (ii) Allow APHIS inspectors access to all records maintained by the 
person regarding handling or disposal of regulated garbage, and to all 
areas where

[[Page 357]]

handling or disposal of regulated garbage occurs;
    (iii) Remove regulated garbage from a means of conveyance only in 
tight, leak-proof receptacles;
    (iv) Move the receptacles of regulated garbage only to a facility 
approved in accordance with Sec. 330.400(g)(2); and
    (v) At the approved facility, dispose of the regulated garbage only 
through incineration, sterilization, grinding into a sewage system 
approved in accordance with Sec. 330.400(g)(2), or in any other manner 
approved by the Administrator and described in the compliance agreement.
    (3) Approval for a compliance agreement may be denied at any time if 
the Administrator determines that the requirements set forth in this 
subpart are not met, after notice of, and the reasons for, the proposed 
denial of the approval, and an opportunity to demonstrate or achieve 
compliance with such requirements, has been afforded to the compliance 
agreement applicant.
    (4) Any compliance agreement may be canceled in writing by the 
Administrator whenever it is found that the person who has entered into 
the compliance agreement has failed to comply with this subpart. Any 
person whose compliance agreement has been cancelled may appeal the 
decision, in writing, within 10 days after receiving written 
notification of the cancellation. The appeal must state all of the facts 
and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the compliance 
agreement was wrongfully cancelled. As promptly as circumstances allow, 
the Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the 
reasons for the decision. A hearing will be held to resolve any conflict 
as to any material fact. Rules of practice concerning a hearing will be 
adopted by the Administrator. This administrative remedy must be 
exhausted before a person can file suit in court challenging the 
cancellation of a compliance agreement.
    (5) Where a compliance agreement is denied or cancelled, regulated 
garbage may continue to be unloaded from a means of conveyance and 
disposed of at an approved facility in accordance with 
Sec. 330.400(g)(1).

Sec. 340.0  Restrictions on the introduction of regulated articles.

    (a) No person shall introduce any regulated article unless the 
Administrator is:
    (1) Notified of the introduction in accordance with Sec. 340.3, or 
such introduction is authorized by permit in accordance with Sec. 340.4, 
or such introduction is conditionally exempt from permit requirements 
under Sec. 340.2(b); and

[[Page 358]]

    (2) Such introduction is in conformity with all other applicable 
restrictions in this part.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Part 340 regulates, among other things, the introduction of 
organisms and products altered or produced through genetic engineering 
which are plant pests or which there is reason to believe are plant 
pests. The introduction into the United States of such articles may be 
subject to other regulations promulgated under the Federal Plant Pest 
Act (7 U.S.C. 150aa et seq.), the Plant Quarantine Act (7 U.S.C. 151 et 
seq.) and the Federal Noxious Weed Act (7 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.) and found 
in 7 CFR parts 319, 321, 330, and 360. For example under regulations 
promulgated in 7 CFR ``Subpart-Nursery Stock'' (7 CFR 319.37) a permit 
is required for the importation of certain classes of nursery stock 
whether genetically engineered or not. Thus, a person should consult 
those regulations prior to the importation of any nursery stock.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Any regulated article introduced not in compliance with the 
requirements of this part shall be subject to the immediate application 
of such remedial measures or safeguards as an inspector determines 
necessary to prevent the introduction of such plant pests.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Pursuant to section 105 of the Federal Plant Pest Act (7 U.S.C. 
150dd) the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to order prompt 
removal from the United States or to seize, quarantine, treat, apply 
other remedial measures to, destroy, or otherwise dispose of, in such 
manner as the Secretary deems appropriate, certain regulated articles 
which are believed to be infested or infected by or contain a plant 
pest.

Sec. 340.2  Groups of organisms which are or contain plant pests and exemptions.

    (a) Groups of organisms which are or contain plant pests. The 
organisms that are or contain plant pests are included in the taxa or 
group of organisms contained in the following list. Within any taxonomic 
series included on the list, the lowest unit of classification actually 
listed is the taxon or group which may contain organisms which are 
regulated. Organisms belonging to all lower taxa contained within the 
group listed are included as organisms that may be or may contain plant 
pests, and are regulated if they meet the definition of plant pest in 
Sec. 340.1 \4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Any organism belonging to any taxa contained within any listed 
genera or taxa is only considered to be a plant pest if the organism 
``can directly or indirectly injure, or cause disease, or damage in any 
plants or parts thereof, or any processed, manufactured, or other 
products of plants.'' Thus a particular unlisted species within a listed 
genus would be deemed a plant pest for purposes of Sec. 340.2, if the 
scientific literature refers to the organism as a cause of direct or 
indirect injury, disease, or damage to any plants, plant parts or 
products of plants. (If there is any question concerning the plant pest 
status of an organism belonging to any listed genera or taxa, the person 
proposing to introduce the organism in question should consult with 
APHIS to determine if the organism is subject to regulation.)

    Note:  Any genetically engineered organism composed of DNA or RNA 
sequences, organelles, plasmids, parts, copies, and/or analogs, of or 
from any of the groups of organisms listed below shall be deemed a 
regulated article if it also meets the definition of plant pest in

Sec. 340.3  Notification for the introduction of certain regulated articles.<SUP>5</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ APHIS may issue guidelines regarding scientific procedures, 
practices, or protocols which it has found acceptable in making various 
determinations under the regulations. A person may follow an APHIS 
guideline or follow different procedures, practices, or protocols. When 
different procedures, practices, or protocols are followed, a person 
may, but is not required to, discuss the matter in advance with APHIS to 
help ensure that the procedures, practices, or protocols to be followed 
will be acceptable to APHIS.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (a) General. Certain regulated articles may be introduced without a 
permit, provided that the introduction is in compliance with the 
requirements of this section. Any other introduction of regulated 
articles require a permit under Sec. 340.4, with the exception of 
introductions that are conditionally exempt from permit requirements 
under Sec. 340.2(b) of this part.

[[Page 364]]

    (b) Regulated articles eligible for introduction under the 
notification procedure. Regulated articles which meet all of the 
following six requirements and the performance standards set forth in 
paragraph (c) of this section are eligible for introduction under the 
notification procedure.
    (1) The regulated article is any plant species that is not listed as 
a noxious weed in regulations at 7 CFR part 360 under the Federal 
Noxious Weed Act (7 U.S.C. 2809), and, when being considered for release 
into the environment, the regulated article is not considered by the 
Administrator to be a weed in the area of release into the environment.
    (2) The introduced genetic material is ``stably integrated'' in the 
plant genome, as defined in Sec. 340.1.

necessary) in a manner so as to prevent the dissemination and 
establishment of plant pests.
    (2) All packing material, shipping containers, and any other 
material accompanying the regulated article shall be treated or disposed 
of in such a manner so as to prevent the dissemination and establishment 
of plant pests.
    (3) The regulated article shall be kept separate from other 
organisms, except as specifically allowed in the permit;
    (4) The regulated article shall be maintained only in areas and 
premises specified in the permit;
    (5) An inspector shall be allowed access, during regular business 
hours, to the place where the regulated article is located and to any 
records relating to the introduction of a regulated article;
    (6) The regulated article shall, when possible, be kept identified 
with a label showing the name of the regulated article, and the date of 
importation;
    (7) The regulated article shall be subject to the application of 
measures determined by the Administrator to be necessary to prevent the 
accidental or unauthorized release of the regulated article;
    (8) The regulated article shall be subject to the application of 
remedial measures (including disposal) determined by the Administrator 
to be necessary to prevent the spread of plant pests;
    (9) A person who has been issued a permit shall submit to APHIS a 
field test report within 6 months after the termination of the field 
test. A field test report shall include the APHIS reference number, 
methods of observation, resulting data, and analysis regarding all 
deleterious effects on plants, nontarget organisms, or the environment.
    (10) APHIS shall be notified within the time periods and manner 
specified below, in the event of the following occurrences:
    (i) Orally notified immediately upon discovery and notify in writing 
within 24 hours in the event of any accidental or unauthorized release 
of the regulated article;
    (ii) In writing as soon as possible but not later than within 5 
working days if the regulated article or associated host organism is 
found to have characteristics substantially different from those listed 
in the application for a permit or suffers any unusual occurrence 
(excessive mortality or morbidity, or unanticipated effect on non-target 
organisms);
    (11) A permittee or his/her agent and any person who seeks to import 
a regulated article into the United States shall:
    (i) Import or offer the regulated article for entry only at a port 
of entry which is designated by an asterisk in 7 CFR 319.37-14(b);

[[Page 369]]

    (ii) Notify APHIS promptly upon arrival of any regulated article at 
a port of entry, of its arrival by such means as a manifest, customs 
entry document, commercial invoice, waybill, a broker's document, or a 
notice form provided for such purpose; and
    (iii) Mark and identify the regulated article in accordance with 
Sec. 340.5 of this part.
    (g) Withdrawal or denial of a permit. Any permit which has been 
issued may be withdrawn by an inspector or the Administrator if he/she 
determines that the holder thereof has not complied with one or more of 
the conditions listed on the permit. APHIS will confirm the reasons for 
the withdrawal of the permit in writing within ten (10) days. Any person 
whose permit has been withdrawn or any person who has been denied a 
permit may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within 
ten (10) days after receiving the written notification of the withdrawal 
or denial. The appeal shall state all of the facts and reasons upon 
which the person relies to show that the permit was wrongfully withdrawn 
or denied. The Administrator shall grant or deny the appeal, in writing, 
stating the reasons for the decision as promptly as circumstances allow. 
If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing shall be held 
to resolve such conflict. Rules of practice concerning such a hearing 
will be adopted by the Administrator.
    (h) Courtesy permit--(1) Issuance. The Administrator may issue a 
courtesy permit for the introduction of organisms modified through 
genetic engineering which are not subject to regulation under this part 
to facilitate movement when the movement might otherwise be impeded 
because of the similarity of the organism to other organisms regulated 
under this part.
    (2) Application. A person seeking a courtesy permit shall submit on 
an application form obtained from APHIS data required by paragraphs (b) 
(1), (2), and (5) of this section and shall indicate such data is being 
submitted as a request for a courtesy permit. A person should also

which to base a determination, and that it includes relevant data and 
information known to the petitioner which are unfavorable to the 
petition.

(Signature)_____________________________________________________________

(Name of Petitioner)____________________________________________________

(Mailing Address)_______________________________________________________

(Telephone Number)______________________________________________________

    (c) Required data and information. The petition shall include the 
following information:
    (1) Description of the biology of the nonmodified recipient plant 
and information necessary to identify the recipient plant in the 
narrowest taxonomic grouping applicable.
    (2) Relevant experimental data and publications.
    (3) A detailed description of the differences in genotype between 
the regulated article and the nonmodified recipient organism. Include 
all scientific, common, or trade names, and all designations necessary 
to identify: the donor organism(s), the nature of the transformation 
system (vector or vector agent(s)), the inserted genetic material and 
its product(s), and the regulated article. Include country and locality 
where the donor, the recipient, and the vector organisms and the 
regulated articles are collected, developed, and produced.
    (4) A detailed description of the phenotype of the regulated 
article. Describe known and potential differences from the unmodified 
recipient organism that would substantiate that the regulated article is 
unlikely to pose a greater plant pest risk than the unmodified organism 
from which it was derived, including but not limited to: Plant pest risk 
characteristics, disease and pest susceptibilities, expression of the 
gene product, new enzymes, or changes to plant metabolism, weediness of 
the regulated article, impact on the weediness of any other plant with 
which it can interbreed, agricultural or cultivation practices, effects 
of the regulated article on nontarget organisms, indirect plant pest 
effects on other agricultural products, transfer of genetic information 
to organisms with which it cannot interbreed, and any other information 
which the Administrator believes to be relevant to a determination. Any 
information known to the petitioner that indicates that a regulated 
article may pose a greater plant pest risk than the unmodified recipient 
organism shall also be included.
    (5) Field test reports for all trials conducted under permit or 
notification procedures, involving the regulated article, that were 
submitted prior to submission of a petition for determination of 
nonregulated status or prior to submission of a request for extension of 
a determination of nonregulated status under paragraph (e) of this part. 
Fiedl test reports shall include the APHIS reference number, methods of 
observation, resulting data, and analysis regarding all deleterious 
effects on plants, nontarget organisms, or the environment.

[[Page 372]]

    (d) Administrative action on a petition. (1) A petition for 
determination of nonregulated status under this part which meets the 
requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section will be filed by 
the Administrator, stamped with the date of filing, and assigned a 
petition number. The petition number shall identify the file established 
for all submissions relating to the petition. APHIS will promptly notify 
the petitioner in writing of the filing and the assigned petition 
number. If a petition does not meet the requirements specified in this 
section, the petitioner shall be sent a notice indicating how the 
petition is deficient.
    (2) After the filing of a completed petition, APHIS shall publish a 
notice in the Federal Register. This notice shall specify that comments 
will be accepted from the public on the filed petition during a 60 day 
period commencing with the date of the notice. During the comment 
period, any interested person may submit to the Administrator, written 
comments, regarding the filed petition, which shall become part of the 
petition file.
    (3) The Administrator shall, based upon available information, 
furnish a response to each petitioner within 180 days of receipt of a 
completed petition. The response will either:
    (i) Approve the petition in whole or in part; or
    (ii) deny the petition.
    The petitioner shall be notified in writing of the Administrator's 
decision. The decision shall be placed in the public petition file in 
the offices of APHIS and notice of availability published in the Federal 
Register.
    (e) Extensions to determinations of nonregulated status. (1) The 
Administrator may determine that a regulated article does not pose a 
potential for plant pest risk, and should therefore not be regulated 
under this part, based on the similarity of that organism to an 
antecedent organism.
    (2) A person may request that APHIS extend a determination of 
nonregulated status to other organisms. Such a request shall include 
information to establish the similarity of the antecedent organism and 
the regulated articles in question.
    (3) APHIS will announce in the Federal Register all preliminary 
decisions to extend determinations of nonregulated status 30 days before 
the decisions become final and effective. If additional information 
becomes available that APHIS believes justifies changing its decision, 
it will issue a revised decision.
    (4) If a request to APHIS to extend a determination of nonregulated 
status under this part is denied, APHIS will inform the submitter of 
that request of the reasons for denial. The submitter may submit a 
modified request or a separate petition for determination of 
nonregulated status without prejudice.
    (f) Denial of a petition; appeal. (1) The Administrator's written 
notification of denial of a petition shall briefly set forth the reason 
for such denial. The written notification shall be sent by certified 
mail. Any person whose petition has been denied may appeal the 
determination in writing to the Administrator within 10 days from 
receipt of the written notification of denial.
    (2) The appeal shall state all of the facts and reasons upon which 
the person relies, including any new information, to show that the 
petition was wrongfully denied. The Administrator shall grant or deny 
the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision as promptly 
as circumstances allow. An informal hearing may be held by the 
Administrator if there is a dispute of a material fact. Rules of 
Practice concerning such a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.

Sec. 340.8  Container requirements for the movement of regulated articles.

    (a) General requirements. A regulated article shall not be moved 
unless it complies with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, 
unless a variance has been granted in accordance with the provisions of 
paragraph (c) of this section. \12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ The requirements of this section are in addition to and not in 
lieu of any other packing requirements such as those for the 
transportation of etiologic agents prescribed by the Department of 
Transportation in Title 49 CFR or any other agency of the Federal 
government.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Container requirements--(1) Plants and plant parts. All plants 
or plant parts, except seeds, cells, and subcellular elements, shall be 
packed in a sealed plastic bag of at least 5 mil thickness, inside a 
sturdy, sealed, leak-proof, outer shipping container constructed of 
corrugated fiberboard, corrogated cardboard, wood, or other material of 
equivalent strength.
    (2) Seeds. All seeds shall be transported in a sealed plastic bag of 
at least 5 mil thickness, inside a sealed metal container, which shall 
be placed inside a second sealed metal container. Shock absorbing 
cushioning material shall be placed between the inner and outer metal 
containers. Each metal container shall be independently capable of 
protecting the seeds and preventing spillage or escape. Each set of 
metal containers shall then be enclosed in a sturdy outer shipping 
container constructed of corrugated fiberboard, corrugated cardboard, 
wood, or other material of equivalent strength.
    (3) Live microorganisms and/or etiologic agents, cells, or 
subcellular elements. All regulated articles which are live (non-
inactivated) microorganisms, or etiologic agents, cells, or subcellular 
elements shall be packed as specified below:
    (i) Volume not exceeding 50 ml. Regulated articles not exceeding 50 
ml shall be placed in a securely closed, watertight container (primary 
container, test tube, vial, etc.) which shall be enclosed in a second, 
durable watertight container (secondary container). Several primary 
containers may be enclosed in a single secondary container, if the total 
volume of all the primary containers so enclosed does not exceed 50 ml. 
The space at the top, bottom, and sides between the primary and 
secondary containers shall contain sufficient nonparticulate absorbent 
material (e.g., paper towel) to absorb the entire contents of the 
primary container(s) in case of breakage or leakage. Each set of primary 
and secondary containers shall then be enclosed in an outer shipping 
container constructed of corrugated fiberboard, corrugated cardboard, 
wood, or other material of equivalent strength.
    (ii) Volume greater than 50 ml. Regulated articles which exceed a 
volume of 50 ml. shall comply with requirements specified in paragraph 
(b)(3)(i) of this section. In addition, a shock absorbing material, in 
volume at least equal to

[[Page 374]]

that of the absorbent material between the primary and secondary 
containers, shall be placed at the top, bottom, and sides between the 
secondary container and the outer shipping container. Single primary 
containers shall not contain more than 1,000 ml. of material. However, 
two or more primary containers whose combined volumes do not exceed 
1,000 ml. may be placed in a single, secondary container. The maximum 
amount of micro-organisms or etiologic agents, cells, or subcellular 
elements which may be enclosed within a single outer shipping container 
shall not exceed 4,000 ml.
    (iii) Dry ice. If dry ice is used as a refrigerant, it shall be 
placed outside the secondary container(s). If dry ice is used between 
the secondary container and the outer shipping container, the shock 
absorbing material shall be placed so that the secondary container does 
not become loose inside the outer shipping container as the dry ice 
sublimates.
    (4) Insects, mites, and related organisms. Insects, mites, and other 
small arthropods shall be packed for shipment as specified in this 
paragraph or in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Insects (any life 
stage) shall be placed in an escape-proof primary shipping container 
(insulated vacuum container, glass, metal, plastic, etc.) and sealed to 
prevent escape. Such primary container shall be placed securely within a 
secondary shipping container of crushproof styrofoam or other material 
of equivalent strength; one or more rigid ice packs may also be placed 
within the secondary shipping container; and sufficient packing material 
shall be added around the primary container to prevent movement of the 
primary shipping container. The secondary (styrofoam or other) container 
shall be placed securely within an outer shipping container constructed 
of corrugated fiberboard, corrugated cardboard, wood, or other material 
of equivalent strength.
    (5) Other macroscopic organisms. Other macroscopic organisms not 
covered in paragraphs (b) (1), (2), and (4) of this section which do not 
require continuous access to atmospheric oxygen shall be packaged as 
specified in paragraph (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section. All macroscopic 
organisms which are not plants and which require continuous access to 
atmospheric oxygen shall be placed in primary shipping containers 
constructed of a sturdy, crush-proof frame of wood, metal, or equivalent 
strength material, surrounded by escape-proof mesh or netting of a 
strength and mesh size sufficient to prevent the escape of the smallest 
organism in the shipment, with edges and seams of the mesh or netting 
sealed to prevent escape of organisms. Each primary shipping container 
shall be securely placed within a larger secondary shipping container 
constructed of wood, metal, or equivalent strength material. The primary 
and secondary shipping containers shall then be placed securely within 
an outer shipping container constructed of corrugated fiberboard, 
corrugated cardboard, wood, or other material of equivalent strength, 
which outer container may have air holes or spaces in the sides and/or 
ends of the container, provided that the outer shipping container must 
retain sufficient strength to prevent crushing of the primary and 
secondary shipping containers.
    (c) Request for a variance from container requirements. A 
responsible person who believes the container requirements normally 
applicable to the movement of the person's regulated article(s) are 
inappropriate due to unique circumstances (such as the nature, volume, 
or life stage of the regulated article) may submit in an application for 
a permit, a request for a variance from the container requirements. The 
request for a variance under this section shall consist of a short 
statement describing why the normally applicable container requirements 
are inappropriate for the regulated article which the person proposes to 
move and what container requirements the person would use in lieu of the 
normally prescribed container requirements. USDA shall advise the 
responsible person in writing at the time a permit is granted on the 
person's request for a variance.

Sec. 351.5  Return or destruction.

    Where the plant quarantine inspector requires the entire shipment to 
be returned to the country of origin as a prohibited importation (in 
which event he shall endorse his action thereon) and delivers the 
shipment to the collector of customs, the collector shall in turn 
deliver it to the postmaster for dispatch to the country of origin. If, 
upon examination, the plant material is deemed dangerous to plant life, 
the collector of customs shall permit the plant quarantine inspector to 
destroy immediately both the container and its contents. In either case 
the plant quarantine inspector shall notify the addressee of the action 
taken and the reason therefor. If the objectionable plant material forms 
only a portion of the contents of the mail package and in the judgment 
of the inspector the package can safely be delivered to the addressee, 
after removing and destroying the objectionable material, such procedure 
is authorized. In the latter case the inspector shall place in the 
package a memorandum (Form AQI-387) informing the addressee of the 
action taken by the inspector and describing the matter which has been

Sec. 352.2  Purpose; relation to other regulations; applicability.

    (a) The importation into the United States of certain plants, plant 
products, plant pests, soil, and other products and articles which may 
be infested or infected by, or contain, plant pests is prohibited or 
restricted by quarantines, orders, and other regulations in parts 319, 
321, and 330 of this chapter, issued under authority of sections 1, 5, 
7, and 9 of the Plant Quarantine Act, sections 103, 105, 106, and 107 of 
the Federal Plant Pest Act, the Mexican Border Act (7 U.S.C. 149), and 
related laws (31 483a; 7 U.S.C. 2260). Under said authorities it is 
hereby determined that it is not necessary to impose such prohibitions 
and restrictions upon plants, plant products, plant pests, soil, and 
other products and articles designated in said parts when they come 
within any of the following categories and are moved into the United 
States from any foreign country and handled in the United States in 
compliance with this part, and said categories of plants, plant 
products, plant pests, soil, and other products and articles are hereby 
excepted from said prohibitions and restrictions if they comply with 
this part, except as otherwise provided in this part: (1) Are brought in 
for temporary stay where unloading or landing is not intended; (2) are 
unloaded or landed for transshipment and exportation; (3) are unloaded 
or landed for transportation and exportation; (4) are intended for 
unloading and entry at a port other than the port of arrival. However, 
such determination and exception shall not apply to cotton and covers 
imported into the United States from any country for exportation or 
transshipment and exportation or transportation and exportation as 
provided in Secs. 319.8, 319.8-1 et seq. of this chapter and such cotton 
and covers must comply with said sections in lieu of this part. 
Moreover, the applicable provisions of Secs. 330.100 through 330.109

[[Page 380]]

and 330.400 of this chapter shall continue to apply to products and 
articles subject to this Part 352.
    (b) Prohibited or restricted products and articles offered for entry 
into the United States and refused such entry under part 319, 321, or 
330 of this chapter shall be subject to the applicable provisions in 
this part with respect to their subsequent handling in this country.
    (c)(1) The provisions in this part shall apply whether the controls 
over arrival, temporary stay, unloading, landing, transshipment and 
exportation, or transportation and exportation, or other movement or 
possession in the United States are maintained by entry or other 
procedures of the Bureau of Customs, U.S. Department of the Treasury, or 
in Guam by the Customs of the Government of Guam. Such provisions shall 
apply to arrivals in the United States, as defined in Sec. 352.1(b)(31), 
including arrivals in a foreign trade zone in the United States to which 
admission is sought in accordance with the Customs Regulations in title 
19 CFR. Prohibited or restricted products and articles which have 
arrived in the United States and have been exported therefrom pursuant 
to this part, and which for any reason are returned to the United States 
are, upon arrival, again subject to the applicable requirements of this 
part.
    (2) Any restrictions and requirements under this part with respect 
to the arrival, temporary stay, unloading, landing, transshipment, 
exportation, transportation and exportation, or other movement or 
possession in the United States of any product or article shall apply to 
any person who, respectively, brings into, maintains, unloads, lands, 
transships, exports, transports and exports, or otherwise moves or 
possesses in the United States such product or article, whether he is 
the person who was required to have a permit for the product or article 
or a subsequent custodian of such product or article, and failure to 
comply with all applicable restrictions and requirements under this part 
by any such person shall be deemed to be a violation of this part.

Sec. 352.3  Enforcement and administration.

    (a) Plants, plant products, plant pests, soil, and other products 
and articles subject to the regulations in this part which are unloaded 
or landed, or otherwise brought or moved into or through the United 
States in contravention of this part may be seized, destroyed, or 
otherwise disposed of as authorized by section 10 of the Plant 
Quarantine Act (7 U.S.C. 164a), section 105 of the Federal Plant Pest 
Act (7 U.S.C. 150dd), or the Mexican Border Act (7 U.S.C. 149). Any 
person who unloads or lands or otherwise brings or moves into or through 
the United States, any plants, plant products, plant pests, soil, or 
other products or articles subject to this part in any manner contrary 
to this part, shall be subject to prosecution under the applicable 
provisions of law.
    (b) Whenever the Deputy Administrator of the Plant Protection and 
Quarantine Programs shall find that existing conditions of danger of 
plant pest escape or dissemination involved in the arrival, unloading, 
landing, or other movement, or possession in the United States of 
plants, plant products, plant pests, soil, or other products or articles 
subject to the regulations in this part, make it safe to modify by 
making less stringent the restrictions contained in any such regulation, 
he shall publish such findings in administrative instructions, 
specifying the manner in which the regulations shall be made less 
stringent with respect thereto, whereupon such modification shall become 
effective; or he may, upon request in specific cases, when the public 
interests will permit, authorize arrival, unloading, landing, or other 
movement, or possession in the United States under conditions that are 
less stringent than those contained in the regulations in this part.
    (c) The Deputy Administrator also may set forth and publish, in 
administrative instructions, requirements and conditions for any class 
of products or articles supplemental to the regulations in this part, 
and may promulgate interpretations of this part.
    (d) The Deputy Administrator shall employ procedures to carry out 
the purposes of this part which will impose

[[Page 381]]

a minimum of impediment to foreign commerce, consistent with proper 
precaution against plant pest dissemination.


<R05>
Sec. 352.4  Documentation.

    (a) Manifest. Immediately upon the arrival of a carrier in the 
United States the owner shall make available to the inspector for 
examination a complete manifest or other documentation from which the 
inspector may determine whether there are on board any prohibited or 
restricted products or articles subject to this part, other than 
accompanied baggage and mail.
    (b) Other documentation. Any notifications, reports, and similar 
documentation not specified in the regulations in this part, but 
necessary to carry out the purpose of the regulations, will be 
prescribed in administrative instructions.
    (c) Procedure after examination of documents. After examination of 
the carrier cargo manifest or other documentation the inspector may 
notify the owner and the Customs officer that certain products or 
articles on board the carrier are subject to this part and may not be 
unloaded or landed for any purpose pending plant quarantine inspection. 
In such case the owner shall not unload or land such products or 
articles without authorization by an inspector.


<R05>
Sec. 352.5  Permit; requirement, form and conditions.

    (a) General. (1) Permits are required for the arrival, unloading or 
landing, or other movement into or through the United States of plants, 
plant products, plant pests, and soil subject to this part. The permit 
may consist of a general authorization as set out in paragraph (b), (c), 
or (d) of this section or Sec. 352.11, or it may be a specific permit. A 
specific permit may be formal or oral except as a formal permit is 
required by paragraph (c) or (e) of this section. The Deputy 
Administrator may in administrative instructions require specific or 
formal permits for any class of products or articles subject to this 
part.
    (2) A formal permit may be issued in prescribed form, in letter 
form, or a combination thereof. A rubber stamp impression or other 
endorsement made by the inspector on pertinent Customs documents 
covering the products or articles involved may constitute the formal 
permit in appropriate cases.
    (b) Permit for prohibited or restricted products or articles brought 
in for temporary stay where unloading or landing in the United States is 
not intended. No permit other than the authorization contained in this 
paragraph shall be required for bringing into the United States any 
plants, plant products, plant pests, or soil subject to this part for 
temporary stay where unloading or landing in the United States is not 
intended, e.g., in connection with residue cargo movement under Customs 
procedure, or in connection with Customs entry for exportation or for 
transportation and exportation. This authorization also includes 
transshipment of products and articles under this paragraph from a 
carrier directly to another carrier of the same company when 
necessitated by an emergency or operating requirement and effected in 
accordance with safeguards prescribed in writing or orally by the 
inspector under Sec. 352.10.
    (c) Permit for prohibited or restricted products or articles 
unloaded or landed for immediate transshipment and exportation, or 
immediate transportation and exportation. When in the opinion of the 
inspector it is unnecessary to specify in a formal permit the safeguards 
required to prevent plant pest dissemination, plants, plant products, 
plant pests, or soil subject to this part may be unloaded or landed for 
immediate transshipment and exportation or for immediate transportation 
and exportation, as provided in Sec. 352.10, with the approval of the 
inspector and no further permit than the authorization contained in this 
paragraph; otherwise a formal permit shall be required for such 
unloading or landing.
    (d) Permit for restricted products or articles moving as residue 
cargo from port of first arrival to port of entry. Restricted plants, 
plant products, plant pests, or soil subject to this part arriving in 
the United States for movement under residue cargo procedures of Customs 
from a port of first arrival to another port for Customs entry into the 
United States may be allowed to so move

[[Page 382]]

without permit other than the authorization contained in this paragraph, 
if the inspector finds that apparently they can meet the applicable 
requirements of parts 319, 321, and 330 of this chapter at the port 
where entry is to be made; otherwise a formal permit shall be required 
for such movement. Such restricted products and articles shall become 
subject to the applicable permit and other requirements of parts 319, 
321, and 330 of this chapter upon arrival at the port where Customs 
entry is to be made and shall not be unloaded or landed unless they 
comply with the applicable requirements.
    (e) Formal permits required for certain prohibited or restricted 
products or articles brought into a foreign trade zone. A formal permit 
must be obtained to bring any prohibited or restricted plants, plant 
products, plant pests, or soil subject to the provisions in this part, 
into a foreign trade zone for storage, manipulation, or other handling, 
except for immediate transshipment and exportation or for immediate 
transportation and exportation. Special conditions to safeguard such 
storage, manipulation, or other possession or handling may be specified 
in the permit, and when so specified shall be in addition to any other 
applicable requirements of this part or the safeguards prescribed by the 
inspector or otherwise under this part.

formal permit) shall be considered to have been made orally to the 
inspector at the port of

[[Page 383]]

arrival by presentation of the shipment for entry or its listing on the 
manifest or other documentation, but this shall not excuse failure to 
make timely application as required by this section. Express application 
is required for a formal permit.
    (e) Approval or denial of permits. Upon approval of the application, 
the permit will be issued. Any conditions necessary to eliminate danger 
of plant pest dissemination may be specified in the permit, or otherwise

<R05>
Sec. 352.10  Inspection; safeguards; disposal.

    (a) Inspection and release. Prohibited and restricted products and 
articles subject to this part shall be subject to inspection at the port 
of first arrival in accordance with Sec. 330.105(a) of this chapter and 
shall not be released by Customs officers for unloading, landing, or 
other onward movement or entry until released by an inspector or a 
Customs officer on behalf of an inspector in accordance with the 
procedure prescribed in Sec. 330.105(a) of this chapter. If diversion or 
change of Customs entry is not permitted for any movements authorized 
under this part, the inspector at the original port of Customs entry 
shall appropriately endorse Customs documents to show that fact. 
However, the inspector at the U.S. port of export may approve diversion 
or change of Customs entry to permit movement to a different foreign 
country, or entry into the United States, subject to all other 
applicable requirements under this part or part 319, 321, or 330 of this 
chapter. If diversion or change of Customs entry is desired at a Customs 
port in the United States where there is no inspector, the owner may 
apply to the Plant Protection and

[[Page 384]]

Quarantine Programs \3\ for information as to applicable conditions. If 
diversion or change of Customs entry is desired at port, confirmation 
will be given by the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs to the 
appropriate Customs officers and Plant Protection and Quarantine 
Programs inspectors.

    (b) Safeguards. (1) The unloading, landing, retention on board as 
stores and furnishings or cargo, transshipment and exportation, 
transportation and exportation, onward movment to the port of entry as 
residue cargo or under a Customs entry for immediate transportation, and 
other movement or possession within the United States of prohibited or 
restricted products and articles under this part shall be subject to 
such safeguards as may be prescribed in the permits and this part and 
any others which, in the opinion of the inspector, are necessary and are 
specified by him to prevent plant pest dissemination. In the case of 
prohibited or restricted products or articles subject to this part which 
are unloaded or landed for transshipment and exportation or 
transportation and exportation, or for onward movement to the port of 
entry as residue cargo or under a Customs entry for immediate 
transportation, this shall include necessary safeguards with respect to 
any movement within the port area between the point of arrival and the 
point of temporary storage, other handling, or point of departure, 
including a foreign trade zone. Prohibited and restricted products and 
articles subject to this part which are unloaded or landed for 
transshipment and exportation or transportation and exportation, or for 
onward movement as residue cargo or under a Customs entry for immediate 
transportation, shall be transshipped, or transported and exported from 
the United States, or moved onward immediately. This shall mean the 
shortest practicable interval of time commensurate with the risk of 
plant pest dissemination required to transfer the products or articles 
from one carrier to another and to move them onward or from the United 
States. If, in the opinion of the inspector, considerations of risk of 
plant pest dissemination require, such movement shall be made without 
regard to the noncompetitive or competitive relations of the carriers 
concerned, and the inspector shall promptly report to the Plant 
Protection and Quarantine Programs the circumstances when the emergency 
is so acute that subsequent movement is required on a carrier of a 
company other than the one bringing the products or articles to the 
United States or on which onward movement was contemplated by the 
shipper or forwarding carrier. Prohibited or restricted plants, plant 
products, plant pests, and soil which were intended for entry into the 
United States under part 319, 321, or 330 of this chapter, or for 
movement into or through the United States under this part, and which 
were refused such entry or movement before unloading or landing, or 
which were refused such entry or movement after unloading or landing and 
are immediately reloaded on the same carrier, may be retained on board 
pending removal from the United States or other disposal, but shall be 
subject to the safeguards specified under this section. Prohibited or 
restricted products and articles which were refused entry or movement 
under said parts after unloading or landing and which are not 
immediately reloaded in accordance with this section shall be subject to 
such safeguard action as the inspector deems necessary to carry out the 
purposes of this part.
    (2) Safeguards prescribed by an inspector under this section shall 
be prescribed to the owner by the inspector in writing except that the 
inspector may prescribe the safeguards orally when, in his opinion, the 
circumstances and related Customs procedures do not require written 
notice to the owner of the safeguards to be followed by the owner. In 
prescribing safeguards, the relevant requirements of parts 319, 321, and 
330 of this chapter and this part shall be considered. The safeguards 
prescribed shall be the minimum required to prevent plant pest 
dissemination. Destruction or exportation shall be required only when no 
less drastic measures are deemed by the inspector to be

[[Page 385]]

adequate to prevent plant pest dissemination. The inspector may follow 
administrative instructions promulgated for certain situations, or he 
may follow a procedure selected by him from administratively approved 
methods known to be effective in similar situations. In the case of 
aircraft that are contaminated with insect pests, only an insecticidal 
formulation, approved for use in aircraft, may be so applied as an 
emergency measure. If the application is not effective against the 
insect pests or if other pests must be safeguarded against, the 
inspector shall report the circumstances promptly to the Plant 
Protection and Quarantine Programs and receive instructions as to 
safeguards that will not have a deleterious effect on the structure of 
the aircraft or its operating equipment. In prescribing safeguards 
consideration will be given to such factors as:
    (i) The nature and habits of the plant pests known to be, or likely 
to be, present with the plants, plant products, soil, or other products 
or articles.
    (ii) Nature of the plants, plant products, plant pests, soil, or 
other products or articles.
    (iii) Nature of containers or other packaging and adequacy thereof 
to prevent plant pest dissemination.
    (iv) Climatic conditions as they may have a bearing on plant pest 
dispersal, and refrigeration if provided.
    (v) Routing pending exportation.
    (vi) Presence of soil.
    (vii) Construction or physical condition and type of carrier.
    (viii) Facilities for treatment, or for incineration or other 
destruction.

involved prior to reentry into the United States.
    (4) Inspection; safeguards. (i) Each shipment under paragraph (a) of 
this section shall be subject to such inspections and safeguards as are

    (ii) Truck loads of untreated oranges, tangerines, and grapefruit 
arriving from Mexico at authorized ports in the United States for 
loading into refrigerator cars, aircraft, or ships for movement to a 
foreign country shall be preinspected by an inspector for freedom from 
citrus leaves before entry into the United States or be accompanied by 
an acceptable certificate from an inspector as to such freedom. Trucks 
loaded with such untreated fruit that are not free of such leaves will 
be denied entry into the United States. Loaded trucks free of such 
leaves shall be convoyed by an inspector from point of arrival in the 
United States to the point of unloading, or shall move under such other 
safeguards as the inspector shall prescribe.
    (iii) All trucks, refrigerator cars, aircraft, and ships used to 
transport untreated fruit from Mexico through the United States to a 
foreign country under this paragraph (a) shall be subject to such 
treatment at the port of first arrival and elsewhere as may be required 
by the inspector, pursuant to this part, in order to prevent plant pest 
dissemination.
    (b) Additional conditions for overland movement of certain untreated 
fruit. Untreated oranges, tangerines, and grapefruit from Mexico may 
move overland through the United States to a foreign country only in 
accordance with the following additional conditions:
    (1) Containers. Such fruit shall be packed in containers of 
approximately the size customarily used by the trade for marketing such

or Brownsville, Eagle Pass, El Paso, Hidalgo, or Laredo, Texas.
    (3) Carrier--(i) Railway cars. Refrigerator cars, in good condition, 
of United States or Canadian ownership only shall be used to transport 
such fruit by railway through the United States to Canada or other 
foreign country.
    (ii) Aircraft. Aircraft may be used to transport such fruit from the 
ports named in paragraph (b)(2) of this section to points in Canada.
    (iii) Trucks. Trucks may be used to haul such fruit from Mexico to 
shipside, or to approved refrigerated storage pending lading aboard

[[Page 388]]

refrigerator cars or aircraft at the ports named in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section for movement to a foreign country. Such trucks shall be of 
the van-type and shall be kept closed from time of entry into the United 
States until unloading is to commence; or the load shall be covered with 
a tarpaulin tightly tied down which shall not be removed or loosened 
from time of entry into the United States until unloading is to 
commence. Trucks may not be used otherwise to transport such fruit from 
Mexico overland through the United States.
    (4) Bonded rail movement--(i) Routing. Shipments of such fruit may 
move by direct route, in Customs bond and under Customs seal, without 
diversion or change of Customs entry en route, from the port of entry to 
the port of exit en route to Canada or to an approved North Atlantic 
port in the United States for export to another foreign country, as 
follows: The fruit may be entered at Nogales, Arizona, only for direct 
rail routing to El Paso, Texas, after which it shall traverse only the 
territory bounded on the west by a line drawn from El Paso, Texas, to 
Salt Lake City, Utah, and then to Portland, Oregon, and on the east by a 
line drawn from Brownsville, Texas, through Galveston, Texas, and 
Kinder, Louisiana, to Memphis, Tennessee, and then to Louisville, 
Kentucky, and due east therefrom, such territory to include railroad

therefrom. Such fruit may also enter the United States from Mexico at 
any port listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for direct eastward 
rail movement in Customs bond and under Customs seal, without diversion 
en route, for reentry into Mexico.
    (ii) Icing. All refrigerator cars transporting such fruit from 
States in Mexico other than Sonora shall be iced prior to crossing at 
Brownsville, Eagle Pass, El Paso, or Laredo, Texas, and shall be re-iced 
if necessary to prevent plant pest dissemination south of Little Rock, 
Arkansas, or a line drawn east and west therefrom. North of such a line 
no further icing is required. Icing, insofar as this part requires, may 
be omitted if all openings leading from the car to the ice bunkers are 
covered with a 14-mesh fly screen in a manner satisfactory to the 
inspector. All such cars must move through the United States with all 
doors closed and sealed.
    (5) Bonded air cargo movement. Shipments of such fruit may move by 
direct route as air cargo, in Customs bond and without change of Customs 
entry while in the United States en route from the port of entry, to 
Canada. If an emergency occurs en route to the port of export that will 
require transshipment to another carrier, the owner should apply to the 
Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs \4\ for information as to 
applicable conditions.

North Atlantic ports in the United States shall move by direct water 
route to New York or Boston, or to such other North Atlantic ports as 
may be named in the permit only for immediate direct export by water 
route to any foreign country, or for immediate transportation and 
exportation in Customs bond by direct rail route to Canada.
    (3) Exportation from Brownsville or Galveston by water. (i) Such 
fruit laden in refrigerated holds for export from Brownsville or 
Galveston shall be stowed in closed compartments if the ship is to call

desired at a Customs port in the United States where there is no 
inspector, the owner may apply to the Plant Protection and Quarantine 
Programs for information as to applicable conditions. If diversion or 
change of entry is approved at such a port, confirmation will be given 
by the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs to appropriate Customs 
officers and Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs inspectors.
    (e) Untreated fruit from certain municipalities in Sonora, Mexico. 
Oranges, tangerines, and grapefruit in transit to foreign countries may 
be imported from certain municipalities in Sonora, Mexico listed in 
Sec. 319.56-2(h) of this chapter in accordance with the applicable

Sec. 353.2  Purpose and administration.

    The export certification program does not require certification of 
any exports, but does provide certification of plants and plant products 
as a service to exporters. After assessing the phytosanitary condition 
of the plants or plant products intended for export, relative to the 
receiving country's regulations, an inspector issues an internationally 
recognized phytosanitary certificate (PPQ Form 577), a phytosanitary 
certificate for reexport (PPQ Form 579), an export certificate for 
processed plant products (PPQ Form 578), or a certificate of heat 
treatment (PPQ Form 553) if warranted. APHIS also enters into written 
agreements with industry to allow the issuance of industry-issued 
certificates giving assurance that a plant product has been handled, 
processed, or inspected in a manner required by a foreign government.

Sec. 353.8  Accreditation of non-government facilities.

    (a) The Administrator may accredit a non-government facility to 
perform specific laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services 
if the Administrator determines that the non-government facility meets 
the criteria of paragraph (b) of this section.<SUP>1</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ A list of accredited non-government facilities may be obtained 
by writing to Phytosanitary Issues Management, PPQ, APHIS, 4700 River 
Road, Unit 140, Riverdale, MD 20737-1236.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) A non-government facility's compliance with the criteria of 
paragraph (b) of this section shall be determined through an assessment 
of the facility and its fitness to conduct the laboratory testing or 
phytosanitary inspection services for which it seeks to be accredited. 
If, after evaluating the results of the assessment, the Administrator 
determines that the facility meets the accreditation criteria, the 
facility's application for accreditation will be approved.
    (2) The Administrator may deny accreditation to, or withdraw the 
accreditation of, any non-government facility to conduct laboratory 
testing or phytosanitary inspection services upon a determination that 
the facility does not meet the criteria for accreditation or maintenance 
of accreditation under paragraph (b) of this section and has failed to 
take the remedial action recommended to correct identified deficiencies.
    (i) In the case of a denial, the operator of the facility will be 
informed of the reasons for the denial and may appeal the decision in 
writing to the Administrator within 10 days after receiving notification 
of the denial. The appeal must include all of the facts and reasons upon 
which the person relies to show that the facility was wrongfully denied 
accreditation. The Administrator will grant or deny the appeal in 
writing as promptly as circumstances permit, stating the reason for his 
or her decision. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a 
hearing will be held to resolve the conflict. Rules of practice 
concerning the hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.
    (ii) In the case of withdrawal, before such action is taken, the 
operator of the facility will be informed of the reasons for the 
proposed withdrawal. The operator of the facility may appeal the 
proposed withdrawal in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after 
being informed of the reasons for the proposed withdrawal. The appeal 
must include all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies 
to show that the reasons for the proposed withdrawal are incorrect or do 
not support

[[Page 396]]

the withdrawal of the accreditation of the facility. The Administrator 
will grant or deny the appeal in writing as promptly as circumstances 
permit, stating the reason for his or her decision. If there is a 
conflict as to any material fact, a hearing will be held to resolve the 
conflict. Rules of practice concerning the hearing will be adopted by 
the Administrator. However, withdrawal shall become effective pending 
final determination in the proceeding when the Administrator determines 
that such action is necessary to protect the public health, interest, or 
safety. Such withdrawal will be effective upon oral or written 
notification, whichever is earlier, to the operator of the facility. In 
the event of oral notification, written confirmation will be given as 
promptly as circumstances allow. This withdrawal will continue in effect 
pending the completion of the proceeding, and any judicial review 
thereof, unless otherwise ordered by the Administrator.
    (3) The Administrator will withdraw the accreditation of a non-
government facility if the operator of the facility informs APHIS in 
writing that the facility wishes to terminate its accredited status.
    (4) A non-government facility whose accreditation has been denied or 
withdrawn may reapply for accreditation using the application procedures 
in paragraph (b) of this section. If the facility's accreditation was 
denied or withdrawn under the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, the facility operator must include with the application written 
documentation specifying what actions have been taken to correct the 
conditions that led to the denial or withdrawal of accreditation.
    (5) All information gathered during the course of a non-government 
facility's assessment and during the term of its accreditation will be 
treated by APHIS with the appropriate level of confidentiality, as set 
forth in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's administrative regulations 
in Sec. 1.11 of this title.
    (b) Criteria for accreditation of non-government facilities. (1) 
Specific standards for accreditation in a particular area of laboratory 
testing or phytosanitary inspection are set forth in this part and may 
be obtained by writing to APHIS. If specific standards for accreditation 
in a particular area of laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection 
have not been promulgated by APHIS, and the Administrator determines 
that accreditation in that area is practical, APHIS will develop 
appropriate standards applicable to accreditation in the area for which 
the non-government facility is seeking accreditation and publish a 
notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register to inform the 
public and other interested persons of the opportunity to comment on and 
participate in the development of those standards.
    (2) The operator of a non-government facility seeking accreditation 
to conduct laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection shall submit 
an application to the Administrator. The application must be completed 
and signed by the operator of the facility or his or her authorized 
representative and must contain the following:
    (i) Legal name and full address of the facility;
    (ii) Name, address, and telephone and fax number of the operator of 
the facility or his or her authorized representative;
    (iii) A description of the facility, including its physical plant, 
primary function, scope of operation, and, if applicable, its 
relationship to a larger corporate entity; and
    (iv) A description of the specific laboratory testing or 
phytosanitary inspection services for which the facility is seeking 
accreditation.
    (3) Upon receipt of the application, APHIS will review the 
application to identify the scope of the assessment that will be 
required to adequately review the facility's fitness to conduct the 
laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services for which it is 
seeking accreditation. Before the assessment of the facility begins, the 
applicant's representative must agree, in writing, to fulfill the 
accreditation procedure, especially to receive the assessment team, to 
supply any information needed for the evaluation of the facility, and to 
enter into a trust fund agreement as provided by paragraph (c) of this 
section to pay the fees charged to the applicant facility

[[Page 397]]

regardless of the result of the assessment and to pay the charges of 
subsequent maintenance of the accreditation of the facility. Once the 
agreement has been signed, APHIS will assemble an assessment team and 
commence the assessment as soon as circumstances permit. The assessment 
team will measure the facility's fitness to conduct the laboratory 
testing or phytosanitary inspection services for which it is seeking 
accreditation against the specific standards identified by the 
Administrator for those services by reviewing the facility in the 
following areas:
    (i) Physical plant. The facility's physical plant (e.g., laboratory 
space, office space, greenhouses, vehicles, etc.) must meet the criteria 
identified in the accreditation standards as necessary to properly 
conduct the laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services for 
which it seeks accreditation.
    (ii) Equipment. The facility's personnel must possess or have 
unrestricted access to the equipment (e.g., microscopes, computers, 
scales, triers, etc.) identified in the accreditation standards as 
necessary to properly conduct the laboratory testing or phytosanitary 
inspection services for which it seeks accreditation. The calibration 
and monitoring of that equipment must be documented and conform to 
prescribed standards.
    (iii) Methods of testing or inspection. The facility must have a 
quality manual or equivalent documentation that describes the system in 
place at the facility for the conduct of the laboratory testing or 
phytosanitary inspection services for which the facility seeks 
accreditation. The manual must be available to, and in use by, the 
facility personnel who perform the services. The methods and procedures 
followed by the facility to conduct the laboratory testing or 
phytosanitary inspection services for which it seeks accreditation must 
be commensurate with those identified in the accreditation standards and 
must be consistent with or equivalent to recognized international 
standards for such testing or inspection.
    (iv) Personnel. The management and facility personnel accountable 
for the laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services for 
which the facility is seeking accreditation must be identified and must 
possess the training, education, or experience identified in the 
accreditation standards as necessary to properly conduct the testing or 
inspection services for which the facility seeks accreditation, and that 
training, education, or experience must be documented.
    (4) To retain accreditation, the facility must agree to:
    (i) Observe the specific standards applicable to its area of 
accreditation;
    (ii) Be assessed and evaluated on a periodic basis by means of 
proficiency testing or check samples;
    (iii) Demonstrate on request that it is able to perform the tests or 
inspection services representative of those for which it is accredited;
    (iv) Resolve all identified deficiencies;
    (v) Notify APHIS as soon as possible, but no more than 10 days 
following its occurrence, of any change in key management personnel or 
facility staff accountable for the laboratory testing or phytosanitary 
inspection services for which the facility is accredited; and
    (vi) Report to APHIS as soon as possible, but no more than 10 days 
following its occurrence, any change involving the location, ownership, 
physical plant, equipment, or other conditions that existed at the 
facility at the time accreditation was granted.
    (c) Fees and trust fund agreement. The fees charged by APHIS in 
connection with the initial accreditation of a non-government facility 
and the maintenance of that accreditation shall be adequate to recover 
the costs incurred by the government in the course of APHIS' 
accreditation activities. To cover those costs, the operator of the 
facility seeking accreditation must enter into a trust fund agreement 
with APHIS under which the operator of the facility will pay in advance 
all estimated costs that APHIS expects to incur through its involvement 
in the pre-accreditation assessment process and the maintenance of the 
facility's accreditation. Those costs shall include administrative 
expenses incurred in those activities, such as laboratory fees for 
evaluating check test results, and all salaries (including overtime

[[Page 398]]

and the Federal share of employee benefits), travel expenses (including 
per diem expenses), and other incidental expenses incurred by the APHIS 
in performing those activities. The operator of the facility must 
deposit a certified or cashier's check with APHIS for the amount of the 
costs, as estimated by APHIS. If the deposit is not sufficient to meet 
all costs incurred by APHIS, the operator of the facility must deposit 
another certified or cashier's check with APHIS for the amount of the 
remaining costs, as determined by APHIS, before APHIS' services will be 
completed. After a final audit at the conclusion of the pre-
accreditation assessment, any overpayment of funds will be returned to 
the operator of the facility or held on account until needed for future 
activities related to the maintenance of the facility's accreditation.

Service inspector on behalf of any other person, firm, partnership, 
corporation, or other legal entity (principal), and who has not 
previously requested such service from an Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service inspector, must pay the inspector before service is 
provided.
    (2) Since the payment must be collected before service can be 
provided, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service inspector will 
estimate the amount to be paid. Any difference between the inspector's 
estimate and the actual amount owed to the Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service

will be resolved as soon as reasonably possible following the delivery 
of service, with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service either 
returning the difference to the agent, broker, or principal, or billing 
the agent, broker, or principal for the difference.
    (3) The prepayment must be in some guaranteed form, such as money 
order, certified check, or cash. Prepayment in guaranteed form will 
continue until the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service determines 
that the agent, broker, or principal has established an acceptable 
credit history.
    (4) For security reasons, cash payments will be accepted only from 7 
a.m. to 5 p.m., and only at a location designated by the Animal and 
Plant Health Inspection Service inspector.
    (e)(1) Any principal, or any person, firm, partnership, corporation, 
or other legal entity requesting Sunday, holiday, or overtime services 
of an Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service inspector, and who has 
a debt to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service more than 60 
days delinquent, must pay the inspector before service is provided.
    (2) Since the payment must be collected before service can be 
provided, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service inspector will 
estimate the amount to be paid. Any difference between the inspector's 
estimate and the actual amount owed to the Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service will be resolved as soon as reasonably possible 
following the delivery of service, with the Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service either returning the difference to the agent, broker, 
or principal, or billing the agent, broker, or principal for the 
difference.
    (3) The prepayment must be in some guaranteed form, such as money 
order, certified check, or cash. Prepayment in guaranteed form will 
continue until the debtor pays the delinquent debt.
    (4) For security reasons, cash payments will be accepted only from 7 
a.m. to 5 p.m., and only at a location designated by the Animal and 
Plant Health Inspection Service inspector.
    (f) Reimbursable Sunday, holiday, or overtime services will be 
denied to any principal, or any person, firm, partnership, corporation, 
or other legal entity who has a debt to the Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service more than 90 days delinquent. Services will be denied 
until the delinquent debt is paid.

the passenger from the United States must collect the APHIS user fee 
upon departure.

to paragraph (f) of this section shall be held in trust for the United 
States by the person collecting such fees, by any person holding such 
fees, or by the person who is ultimately responsible for remittance of 
such fees to APHIS. APHIS user fees collected from international 
passengers shall be accounted for separately and shall be regarded as 
trust funds held by the person possessing such fees as agents, for the 
beneficial interest of the United States. All such user fees held by any 
person shall be property in which the person holds only a possessory 
interest and not an equitable interest. As compensation for collecting, 
handling, and remitting the APHIS user fees for international 
passengers, the person holding such user fees shall be entitled to any 
interest or other investment return earned on the user fees between the

tickets, marked to show collection of the APHIS user fee, are issued for 
the individual contracted spaces.
    (7) Compliance. Each carrier, travel agent, United States-based tour 
wholesaler, or other entity, subject to this section, must allow APHIS 
personnel to verify the accuracy of the APHIS user fees collected and 
remitted and to otherwise determine compliance with the 21 U.S.C. 136a 
and this paragraph. Each carrier, travel agent, United States-based tour 
wholesaler, or other entity must advise the United States Department of

following guidelines:
    (i) Calculation of a ``cost-per-certificate'' fee. The State must:
    (A) Estimate the annual number of certificates to be issued;
    (B) Determine the total cost of issuing certificates by adding 
together delivery,<SUP>2</SUP> support,<SUP>3</SUP> and administrative

user fee costs associated with maintaining field offices. Delivery hours 
are similar hours taken by inspectors, including travel time, inspection 
time, and time taken to complete paperwork.

collecting and monitoring Federal phytosanitary certificates. 
Administrative hours are hours taken as a direct result of collecting 
and monitoring Federal phytosanitary certificates.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (C) Divide the cost of issuing certificates by the estimated number 
of certificates to be issued to obtain a ``raw'' fee. The State may 
round the ``raw'' fee

[[Page 420]]

up to the nearest quarter, if necessary for ease of calculation, 
collection, or billing; or
    (ii) Calculation of a ``cost-per-hour'' fee. The State must:
    (A) Estimate the annual number of hours taken to issue certificates 
by adding together delivery \2\, support \3\, and administrative \4\ 
hours;
    (B) Determine the total cost of issuing certificates by adding 
together delivery, support, and administrative costs; and
    (C) Divide the cost of issuing certificates by the estimated number 
of hours taken to issue certificates to obtain a ``cost-per-hour'' fee. 
The State may round the ``cost-per-hour'' fee up to the nearest quarter, 
if necessary for ease of calculation, collection, or billing.
    (5) The APHIS user fees are:
    (i)(A) $50 for a certificate for a commercial shipment; or
    (B) $23 for a certificate for a low-value commercial shipment, if 
the following criteria are met:
    (1) the items being shipped are identical to those identified on the 
phytosanitary certificate;
    (2) the shipment is accompanied by an invoice which states that the 
items being shipped are worth less than $1,250; and

shipment, if the following criteria are met:
    (1) The items being shipped are identical to those identified on the 
phytosanitary certificate;
    (2) The shipment is accompanied by an invoice which states that the 
items being shipped are worth less than $1,250; and
    (3) The shipper requests that the user fee charged be based on the 
low value of the shipment;
    (iv) $50 for a processed product certificate for a commercial 
shipment;
    (v) $7 for reissuing any certificate or certificate for reexport; 
and
    (h) Refunds of APHIS user fees. (1) A shipper who pays for a block 
of certificates to cover commercial shipments may obtain a refund or a 
credit against future APHIS user fees under the following circumstances:
    (i) If a certificate from the block is voided;
    (ii) If a certificate from the block is returned unused;
    (iii) If the shipper pays for inspection outside of normal business 
hours (8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.) under Sec. 354.1 of this part.
    (iv) If a certificate from the block is used for a noncommercial 
shipment; or
    (v) If a certificate from the block is used to reissue another 
certificate.

    (b) Documentation for any mailed or nonmailed terrestrial plant 
which is listed in 50 CFR 17.12 or 23.23 and which is required to have 
documentation under 50 CFR part 17 or part 23 at the time of exportation 
or reexportation, must be validated at the port of export or reexport by 
an inspector prior to the exportation or reexportation of such 
plant.<SUP>6</SUP> The original and one copy of the documentation must 
be submitted for validation, and the copy must be surrendered to the 
inspector at the time of validation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ It is the policy of the Department of Agriculture to allow, if 
inspectors are available, terrestrial plants listed in 50 CFR 17.12 or 
23.23 which are intended for export to be inspected at the premises 
where such plants are grown. However, the documentation required for the 
export of such plants by 50 CFR part 17 or part 23 shall only be 
validated at the port of export and only when such plants are presented 
at the port for export together with the documents required by 50 CFR 
part 17 or part 23 and a certified statement by the inspector who 
inspected the plants that the plants are apparently eligible for 
exportation in accordance with the provisions of this part and 
provisions of 50 CFR chapter I relating to the Act and Convention. 
Plants which have been previously inspected must be exported through a 
designated port (unless allowed by the United States Department of the 
Interior to be exported through a nondesignated port) in order to comply 
with section 9(f) of the Act [16 U.S.C. 1538(f)]. Plants which are 
inspected at the premises of origin must be available at the port of 
export for monitoring inspections and for other inspections deemed need 
for enforcement purposes, but, unless so inspected, will not need to be 
unpacked, inspected and repacked at the port. Information concerning the 
availability of inspectors to conduct inspections at the premise of 
origin may be obtained by calling local offices of Plant Protection and 
Quarantine, which are listed in telephone directories, or by writing the 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and 
Quarantine, Operational Support--Director's Office, 4700 River Road, 
Unit 131, Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1236.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Documentation for a plant shall be validated under this section 
upon endorsement of the documentation by an inspector when he or she 
determines that the plant was apparently eligible for importation, 
exportation, or reexportation in accordance with the provisions of this 
part and the provisions of 50 CFR chapter I relating to the Act and 
Convention.
    (d) To obtain validation of documentation, the importer, exporter, 
or reexporter, or agent thereof, shall make available to an inspector:
    (1) All shipping documents (including bills of lading, waybills, 
packing lists, and invoices):
    (2) All documents required by the Act and Convention; and
    (3) The plant being imported, exported, or reexported.

    (a) Any person engaged in business as an importer, exporter, or 
reexporter of terrestrial plants listed in 50 CFR part 17 or part 23 
shall keep such records as will fully and correctly disclose each 
importation, exportation, or reexportation of terrestrial plants made by 
such person and the subsequent disposition made by such person of the 
plants. Such records shall include shipping documents for each shipment 
of plants imported, exported, or reexported; a description of the form 
of the plants (such as whole live plants, cuttings, seeds, or other 
specific parts

[[Page 428]]

or derivatives of plants); the scientific and common names of the 
plants; the country or place of origin of the plants; the date and place 
of importation, exportation, or reexportation of the plants; the number 
(weight if the plants cannot be quantified by number) and specific 
location of plants; the date and means of subsequent disposition of the 
plants, whether by sale, barter, consignment, loan, delivery, 
destruction, or other means; and names and addresses of persons to whom 
the plants were disposed, if applicable.
    (b) Every record required to be kept under this section shall be 
kept for a period of 5 years after the occurrence of the transactions to 
which the records relate, and for such further time as the Deputy 
Administrator may require by written notice to the person required to 
keep such records under this part for purposes of any investigation, 
litigation, or other proceeding under the Act or this part.
    (c) Any person engaged in business as an importer, exporter, or 
reexporter of terrestrial plants listed in 50 CFR part 17 or part 23 
shall, upon presentation of credentials by an inspector or duly 
authorized representatives of the Secretary; during ordinary business 
hours of the person given notice, afford such inspector access to the 
person's place of business, the opportunity to examine the person's 
inventory of plants and the records required to be kept under paragraph 
(a) of this section, and the opportunity to copy such records. The use 
of a room, table, or other facilities (other than reproduction 
equipment) necessary for examination and copying of records and for such 
examination of inventory shall be afforded such inspector.
    (d) Any person engaged in business as an importer, exporter, or 
reexporter of terrestrial plants listed in 50 CFR part 17 or part 23, 
upon written request by the Deputy Administrator, shall submit within 60 
days of such request, a report concerning any of the information 
required to be maintained under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

Sec. 356.1  Property subject to forfeiture procedures.

    This part sets forth procedures relating to the forfeiture of any 
plant, equipment, means of conveyance or other property \1\ seized under 
the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) 
or the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 (16 U.S.C. 3371 et seq.), \2\ in 
possession (actual or constructive) of the United States Department of 
Agriculture, and subject to forfeiture under these Acts because of 
activities pertaining to the importation,

[[Page 429]]

exportation, or reexportation of terrestrial plants.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Under section 11(e)(4) of the Endangered Species Act (``Act''; 
16 U.S.C. 1540(e)(4)) any such equipment and means of conveyance would 
be subject to forfeiture upon conviction of a criminal violation 
pursuant to section 11(b)(1) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1540(b)(1)); however, 
such a plant may be subject to forfeiture regardless of whether a 
criminal conviction is obtained.
    \2\ Under section 5(a)(2) of the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 (16 
U.S.C. 3374(a)(2)) USDA has authority to initiate forfeiture proceedings 
against all vessels, vehicles, aircraft, and other equipment used to aid 
in the importation or exportation of plants in a criminal violation of 
the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 for which a felony conviction has been 
obtained if (a) the owner of such vessel, vehicle, aircraft, or 
equipment was at the time of the alleged illegal act a consenting part 
or privy thereto or in the exercise of due care should have known that 
such vessel, vehicle, aircraft, or equipment would be used in a criminal 
violation of the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981, and (b) the violation 
involved the sale or purchase of, the offer of sale or purchase of, or 
the intent to sell or purchase plants. However, under section 5(a)(1) of 
the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 (16 U.S.C. 3474(a)(1) plants seized for 
violations of the Amendments are subject to forfeiture regardless of 
whether a civil penalty assessment or criminal conviction is obtained.

[49 FR 46336, Nov. 26, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 356.2  Appraisement.

    Promptly following the seizure or other receipt of property 
specified in Sec. 356.1, the Deputy Administrator shall determine the 
retail value of such property in the same quantity or quantities as 
seized. If the property may lawfully be sold in the United States, the 
value thereof shall be determined by ascertaining the price at which the 
property or similar property in the ordinary course of trade is freely 
offered for sale at the time of appraisement, and at a principal market 
as close as possible to the place of appraisement. If the property may 
not lawfully be sold in the United States, the value thereof shall be 
determined by other reasonable means.


<R05>
Sec. 356.3  Property valued at greater than $10,000; notice of seizure and civil action to obtain forfeiture.

    Promptly following the seizures or other receipt of any property 
specified in Sec. 356.1 and determined under Sec. 356.2 to have a value 
greater than $10,000, the Deputy Administrator shall mail a notice of 
seizure by registered or certified mail to the current or last known or 
reasonable ascertainable address, return receipt requested, to persons 
known or reasonably ascertained to be the owner or agent of the seized 
property and to any other person having an interest in the property. 
Such notice shall describe the seized property, shall state the time, 
date, place, and reason for the seizure, that there is a right to 
petition for remission or mitigation of forfeiture pursuant to 
Sec. 356.7, and shall state that action shall be taken in accordance 
with this part. Promptly following the seizure of such property, the 
Secretary shall also submit a report concerning such property to the 
U.S. Attorney for the district in which the seizure was made for 
institution of forfeiture proceedings in the U.S. District Court. The 
report shall provide a statement of all the relevant facts and 
circumstances of the case, including the names of the witnesses, and a 
citation to the laws believed to have been violated and on which 
reliance may be had for forfeiture.


<R05>
Sec. 356.4  Property valued at $10,000 or less; notice of seizure administrative action to obtain forfeiture.

    (a) When authorized. The Secretary shall take measures to obtain 
forfeiture in accordance with this section of any property specified in 
Sec. 356.1 and determined under Sec. 356.2 to have a value of $10,000 or 
less.
    (b) Waiver of forfeiture procedures by owner of seized property. A 
person claiming to be an owner or to have an interest in any property 
specified in Sec. 356.1 with a value of $10,000 or less may waive any 
rights to any procedures relating to forfeiture under this subpart by 
signing a statement providing for waiver of such rights.
    (1) The Deputy Administrator shall publish a copy of the notice of 
seizure and proposed forfeiture as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, by posting for 21 days in a conspicuous place accessible to the 
public at the Plant Protection and Quarantine Enforcement office nearest 
the place of seizure. The time and date of posting shall be indicated on 
the notice.
    (2) Upon the execution of such statement and following publication 
of the notice for 21 days as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, any interest in such property by such owner shall become 
forfeited under the Act without further action under this subpart, and 
the Deputy Administrator shall not be required to send such owner any 
notices or declarations otherwise required by this subpart.
    (c) Procedure absent waiver of forfeiture procedures by owner. (1) 
Notice of seizure and proposed forfeiture. Promptly following seizure of 
property, the Deputy Administrator shall issue a

[[Page 430]]

notice of seizure and proposed forfeiture. The notice shall be in 
substantially the same form as a complaint for forfeiture filed in the 
U.S. District Court. The notice shall describe the seized property, 
including any identification numbers, such as the license, registration, 
motor, and serial numbers for a motor vehicle. The notice shall state 
the time, date, and place of seizure; the reason for seizure; and shall 
specify the value of the property as determined under Sec. 356.2. The 
notice shall contain specific reference to the provisions of the Act, 
permit, certificate, or regulations allegedly violated and under which 
the property is subject to forfeiture. The notice shall state that any 
person desiring to claim the property must file a claim and a bond in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and shall state that 
if a proper claim and bond are not received by the specified office 
within the time prescribed by such paragraph, the property will be 
declared forfeited to the United States and disposed of according to 
law. The notice shall also advise interested persons of their right to 
file a petition for remission or mitigation of forfeiture in accordance 
with Sec. 356.7.
    (i) Promptly following the seizure, The Deputy Administrator shall 
mail a copy of the notice by registered or certified mail, return 
receipt requested, to persons known or reasonably ascertained to be the 
owner or agent of the seized property, and to any other person having an 
interest in the property, if such owner or agent or other person and 
their address is known or reasonably ascertainable.
    (ii) Publication. Promptly following the seizure, the Deputy 
Administrator shall publish a copy of the notice by posting for 21 days 
in a conspicuous place accessible to the public at the Plant Protection 
and Quarantine enforcement office nearest the place of seizure. The time 
and date of posting shall be indicated on the notice.
    (2) Filing a claim and bond. Upon issuance of the notice of proposed 
forfeiture, any person claiming ownership of or other interest in the 
seized property may file with the office specified in the notice a claim 
to the property and a bond in the amount of $250, with sureties to be 
approved by the Deputy Administrator, conditioned that in case of 
condemnation of the articles so claimed, the obligor shall pay all the 
costs and expenses of the proceedings to obtain such condemnation. Any 
claim and bond must be received in such office within 20 days after 
posting of the notice of proposed forfeiture, and shall state claimant's 
interest in the property. The Deputy Administrator may extend the 20 day 
period with an appropriate statement on the posted notice of proposed 
forfeiture, if necessary, to allow a person deemed to have an interest 
in the property at least 10 days to file such a claim and bond after 
receipt of a notice of proposed forfeiture. The bond shall be on a U.S. 
Customs Form 4615 or on a similar form provided by Plant Protection and 
Quarantine. There shall be endorsed on the bond a list or schedule in 
substantially the following form which shall be signed by the claimant 
in the presence of the witnesses to the bond, and attested by the 
witnesses:

List or schedule containing a description of seized articles, claim for 
which is covered by the bond:

_______________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________

    The foregoing list is correct.

_______________________________________________________________________

Claimant

Attest:_________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________


The claim and bond referred to in the paragraph shall not entitle the 
claimant or any other person to possession of the property.
    (3) Transmittal to U.S. Attorney. As soon as practicable after 
timely receipt by the specified office of a proper claim and bond in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the Secretary shall 
transmit such claim, bond (with a duplicate list and description of the 
articles seized), and a report as described in Sec. 356.3 to the U.S. 
Attorney for the district in which seizure was made for forfeiture 
proceedings in the U.S. District Court.
    (d) Summary forfeiture. If a proper claim and bond are not received 
by the specified office within the time periods as specified in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the property shall be forfeited and 
the Deputy Administrator shall

[[Page 431]]

prepare a declaration of forfeiture. The declaration of forfeiture shall 
be in writing, and the Deputy Administrator shall send such declaration 
by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to each 
person whose whereabouts and prior interests in the seized property are 
known or reasonably ascertainable. The declaration shall be in 
substantially the same form as a default judgment of forfeiture entered 
in U.S. District Court. The declaration shall describe the property and 
state the time, date, place, and reason for its seizure. The declaration 
shall identify the notice of proposed forfeiture, describing the dates 
and manner of publication of the notice and any efforts made to serve 
the notice personally or by mail. The declaration shall state that in 
response to the notice a proper claim and bond were not timely received 
by the proper office from any claimant, and that, therefore, all 
potential claimants are deemed to admit the truth of the allegations of 
the notice. The declaration shall conclude with an order of condemnation 
and forfeiture of the property to the United States for disposition 
according to law.

(Information collection requirements were approved by the Office of 
Budget and Management under control number 0579-0076)


<R05>
Sec. 356.5  Bonded release.

    (a) The Deputy Administrator may accept a bond or other security, in 
the amount of the value of the property as determined under Sec. 356.3, 
in place of any property specified in Sec. 356.1 and release the 
property to the owner or agent of the property, if such action would not 
frustrate the purposes of the Act and Convention. As an example, this 
section does not allow the release of terrestrial plants that are 
without documentation required under 50 CFR chapter I.
    (b) Any request for the return of property based on the acceptance 
of a bond or other security shall be submitted in writing to the Deputy 
Administrator. The request shall include evidence to establish that the 
person making the request is the sole owner of the property referred to 
in the request or is the agent of the sole owner of such property. A 
response in writing, granting or denying the request, and the reasons 
therefor, shall be sent to the person making the request.


<R05>
Sec. 356.6  Storage of property.

    Following the seizure or other receipt of any property specified in 
Sec. 356.1 and valued at $10,000 or less, the property shall remain in 
the custody of the Deputy Administrator pending disposition. Pending 
such disposition, the property shall be stored in such place, as, in the 
opinion of the Deputy Administrator, is most convenient and appropriate 
with due regard to the expense involved, whether or not the place of 
storage is within the judicial district in which the property was 
seized.


<R05>
Sec. 356.7  Petition for remission or mitigation of forfeiture.

    (a) Any person who has an interest in any property specified in 
Sec. 356.1 and valued at $10,000 or less, or any person who has incurred 
or is alleged to have incurred a forfeiture of any such property, may 
file with the Deputy Administrator a petition for remission or 
mitigation of forfeiture while the property is in the custody of the 
Deputy Administrator.
    (b) A petition filed with the Deputy Administrator need not be in 
any particular form, but must contain the following:
    (1) A description of the property:
    (2) The time, date, and place of seizure;
    (3) Evidence of the petitioner's interest in the property such as 
contracts, bills of sale, invoices, security interests, certificates of 
title; and
    (4) A statement of all facts and circumstances relied upon by the 
petitioners to justify remission or mitigation of the forfeiture.
    (c) The petition shall be signed by the petitioner or the 
petitioner's attorney at law. If the petitioner is a business, the 
petition must be signed by a partner, officer, or petitioner's attorney 
at law.
    (d) Upon receiving the petition, the Deputy Administrator shall 
decide whether or not to grant relief. In making a decision, the Deputy 
Administrator shall consider the information submitted by the 
petitioner, as well as

[[Page 432]]

any other available information relating to the matter, and may require 
that testimony be taken concerning the petition.
    (e) If the Deputy Administrator finds that the forfeiture was 
incurred without willful negligence or without any intention on the part 
of the petitioner to violate the law or finds the existence of such 
mitigating circumstances as to justify remission or mitigation of the 
forfeiture or alleged forfeiture, the Deputy Administrator may remit or 
mitigate the same upon terms and conditions as he deems reasonable and 
just. However, remission or mitigation will not be made if such action 
would frustrate the purposes of the Act or Convention. As an example, 
this section does not allow remission or mitigation with respect to 
terrestrial plants that are without documentation required under 50 CFR 
chapter I.
    (f) The Deputy Administrator shall notify the petitioner in writing 
concerning whether the petition was granted or denied, and shall state 
the reasons therefor. If the petition is denied fully or in part, the 
petitioner may then file a supplemental petition, but no supplemental 
petition shall be considered unless it is received within 60 days from 
the date of the Deputy Administrator's notification concerning the 
original petition. The Deputy Administrator shall notify the petitioner 
in writing concerning the action taken in response to the supplemental 
petition, and shall state the reasons therefor.

(Information collection requirements were approved by the Office of 
Budget and Management under control number 0579-0076)


<R05>
Sec. 356.8  Return procedure.

    If, at the conclusion of proceedings, seized property is to be 
returned to the person determined to be the owner or agent thereof, the 
Deputy Administrator shall issue a letter or other document to the 
person determined to be owner or agent thereof authorizing its return. 
This letter shall be delivered personally or sent by registered or 
certified mail, return receipt requested, and shall identify the person 
determined to be the owner or agent, the seized property, and if 
appropriate, the bailee of the seized property. It shall also provide 
that upon presentation of the letter or other document and proper 
identification, and the signing of a receipt provided by Plant 
Protection and Quarantine, the seized property is authorized to be 
released.


<R05>
Sec. 356.9  Filing of documents.

    (a) Any document required by this subpart to be filed or served 
within a certain period of time, will be considered filed or served as 
of the time of receipt by the party with or upon whom filing or service 
is required.
    (b) Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays shall be included in 
computing the time allowed for the filing or serving of any document or 
paper; except that when such time expires on a Saturday, Sunday or 
federal holiday, such period shall be extended to include the next 
following business day.

Sec. 360.200  Designation of noxious weeds.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ One or more common names of weeds are given in parentheses after 
most scientific names to help identify the weeds represented by such 
scientific names; however, a scientific name is intended to include all

paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section; and
    (2) The movement is consistent with the specific conditions 
contained in the permit.
    (b) The Deputy Administrator will issue a written permit for the 
movement of a noxious weed into or through the United States, or 
interstate, if application is made for such movement and if the Deputy 
Administrator determines that such movement, under conditions specified 
in the permit, would not involve a danger of dissemination of the 
noxious weed in the United States, or interstate; otherwise such a 
permit will not be issued.
    (c) All such permits issued shall contain in written form in the 
permit any conditions (other than those conditions specified in this

Sec. 361.2  General restrictions on the importation of seed and screenings.

    (a) No person shall import any agricultural seed, vegetable seed, or 
screenings into the United States unless the importation is in 
compliance with this part.
    (b) Any agricultural seed, vegetable seed, or screenings imported 
into the United States not in compliance with this part shall be subject 
to exportation, destruction, disposal, or any remedial measures that the 
Administrator determines are necessary to prevent the dissemination into 
the United States of noxious weeds.
    (c) Except as provided in Sec. 361.7(b), coated or pelleted seed may 
enter the United States only if each lot of seed is accompanied by an 
officially drawn and sealed sample of seed drawn from the lot before the 
seed was coated or pelleted. The sample must be drawn in a manner 
consistent with that described in Sec. 361.5 of this part.
    (d) Except as provided in Secs. 361.4(a)(3) and 361.7(c), screenings 
of all agricultural seed and vegetable seed are prohibited entry into 
the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 361.3  Declarations and labeling.

    (a) All lots of agricultural seed, vegetable seed, and screenings 
imported

[[Page 440]]

into the United States must be accompanied by a declaration from the 
importer of the seed or screenings. The declaration must state the kind, 
variety, and origin of each lot of seed or screenings and the use for 
which the seed or screenings are being imported.
    (b) Each container of agricultural seed and vegetable seed imported 
into the United States for seeding (planting) purposes must be labeled 
to indicate the identification code or designation for the lot of seed; 
the name of each kind or kind and variety of agricultural seed or the 
name of each kind and variety of vegetable seed present in the lot in 
excess of 5 percent of the whole; and the designation ``hybrid'' when 
the lot contains hybrid seed. Kind and variety names used on the label 
shall conform to the kind and variety names used in the definitions of 
``agricultural seed'' and ``vegetable seed'' in Sec. 361.1. If any seed 
in the lot has been treated, each container must be further labeled, in 
type no smaller than 8 point, as follows:
    (1) The label must indicate that the seed has been treated and 
provide the name of the substance or process used to treat the seed. 
Substance names used on the label shall be the commonly accepted coined, 
chemical (generic), or abbreviated chemical name.
    (i) Commonly accepted coined names are commonly recognized as names 
of particular substances, e.g., thiram, captan, lindane, and dichlone.
    (ii) Examples of commonly accepted chemical (generic) names are 
blue-stone, calcium carbonate, cuprous oxide, zinc hydroxide, 
hexachlorobenzene, and ethyl mercury acetate. The terms ``mercury'' or 
``mercurial'' may be used in labeling all types of mercurials.
    (iii) Examples of commonly accepted abbreviated chemical names are 
BHC (1,2,3,4,5,6-Hexachlorocyclohexane) and DDT (dichloro diphenyl 
trichloroethane).
    (2) If the seed has been treated with a mercurial or similarly toxic 
substance harmful to humans and vertebrate animals, the label must 
include a representation of a skull and crossbones and a statement 
indicating that the seed has been treated with poison. The skull and 
crossbones must be at least twice the size of the type used for the 
information provided on the label, and the poison warning statement must 
be written in red letters on a background of distinctly contrasting 
color. Mercurials and similarly toxic substances include the following:

Aldrin, technical
Demeton
Dieldrin
p-Dimethylaminobenzenediazo sodium sulfonate
Endrin
Ethion
Heptachlor
Mercurials, all types
Parathion
Phorate
Toxaphene
O-O-Diethyl-O-(isopropyl-4-methyl-6-pyrimidyl) thiophosphate
O,O-Diethyl-S-2-(ethylthio) ethyl phosphorodithioate

    (3) If the seed has been treated with a substance other than one 
classified as a mercurial or similarly toxic substance under paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, and the amount remaining with the seed is 
harmful to humans or other vertebrate animals, the label must indicate 
that the seed is not to be used for food, feed, or oil purposes. Any 
amount of any substance used to treat the seed that remains with the 
seed will be considered harmful when the seed is in containers of more 
than 4 ounces, except that the following substances will not be deemed 
harmful when present at a rate less than the number of parts per million 
(p/m) indicated:

Allethrin--2 p/m
Malathion--8 p/m
Methoxyclor--2 p/m
Piperonyl butoxide--20 p/m (8 p/m on oat and sorghum)
Pyrethrins--3 p/m (1 p/m on oat and sorghum)

    (c) In the case of seed in bulk, the information required under 
paragraph (b) of this section shall appear in the invoice or other 
records accompanying and pertaining to such seed. If the seed is in 
containers and in quantities of 20,000 pounds or more, regardless of the 
number of lots included, the information required on each container 
under paragraph (b) of this section need not

[[Page 441]]

be shown on each container if each container has stenciled upon it or 
bears a label containing a lot designation and the invoice or other 
records accompanying and pertaining to such seed bear the various 
statements required for the respective seeds.
    (d) Each container of agricultural seed and vegetable seed imported 
into the United States for cleaning need not be labeled to show the 
information required under paragraph (b) of this section if:
    (1) The seed is in bulk;
    (2) The seed is in containers and in quantities of 20,000 pounds or 
more, regardless of the number of lots involved, and the invoice or 
other records accompanying and pertaining to the seed show that the seed 
is for cleaning; or
    (3) The seed is in containers and in quantities of less than 20,000 
pounds, and each container carries a label that bears the words ``Seed 
for cleaning.''


<R05>
Sec. 361.4  Inspection at the port of first arrival.

    (a) All agricultural seed, vegetable seed, and screenings imported 
into the United States shall be made available for examination by an 
APHIS inspector at the port of first arrival and shall remain at the 
port of first arrival until released by an APHIS inspector. Lots of 
agricultural seed, vegetable seed, or screenings may enter the United 
States without meeting the sampling requirements of paragraph (b) of 
this section if the lot is:
    (1) Seed that is not being imported for seeding (planting) purposes 
and the declaration required by Sec. 361.3(a) states the purpose for 
which the seed is being imported;
    (2) Seed that is being shipped in bond through the United States;
    (3) Screenings from seeds of wheat, oats, barley, rye, buckwheat, 
field corn, sorghum, broomcorn, flax, millet, proso, soybeans, cowpeas, 
field peas, or field beans that are not being imported for seeding 
(planting) purposes and the declaration accompanying the screenings as 
required under Sec. 361.2(a) indicates that the screenings are being 
imported for processing or manufacturing purposes;
    (4) Seed that is being imported for sowing for experimental or 
breeding purposes, is not for sale, is limited in quantity to the amount 
indicated in column 3 of table 1 of Sec. 361.5, and is accompanied by a 
declaration stating the purpose for which it is being imported (seed 
imported for increase purposes only will not be considered as being 
imported for experimental or breeding purposes); or
    (5) Seed that was grown in the United States, exported, and is now 
returning to the United States, provided that the person importing the 
seed into the United States furnishes APHIS with the following 
documentation:
    (i) Export documents indicating the quantity of seed and number of 
containers, the date of exportation from the United States, the 
distinguishing marks on the containers at the time of exportation, and 
the name and address of the United States exporter;
    (ii) A document issued by a Customs or other government official of 
the country to which the seed was exported indicating that the seed was 
not admitted into the commerce of that country; and
    (iii) A document issued by a Customs or other government official of 
the country to which the seed was exported indicating that the seed was 
not commingled with other seed after being exported to that country.
    (b) Except as provided in Secs. 361.5(a)(2) and 361.7, samples will 
be taken from all agricultural seed and vegetable seed imported into the 
United States for seeding (planting) purposes prior to being released 
into the commerce of the United States.
    (1) Samples of seed will be taken from each lot of seed in 
accordance with Sec. 361.5 to determine whether any seeds of noxious 
weeds listed in Sec. 361.6(a) are present. If seeds of noxious weeds are 
present at a level higher than the tolerances set forth in 
Sec. 361.6(b), the lot of seed will be deemed to be adulterated and will 
be rejected for entry into the United States for seeding (planting) 
purposes. Once deemed adulterated, the lot of seed must be:
    (i) Exported from the United States;
    (ii) Destroyed under the monitoring of an APHIS inspector;
    (iii) Cleaned under APHIS monitoring at a seed-cleaning facility 
that

[[Page 442]]

is operated in accordance with Sec. 361.8(a); or
    (iv) If the lot of seed is adulterated with the seeds of a noxious 
weed listed in Sec. 361.6(a)(2), the seed may be allowed entry into the 
United States for feeding or manufacturing purposes, provided the 
importer withdraws the original declaration and files a new declaration 
stating that the seed is being imported for feeding or manufacturing 
purposes and that no part of the seed will be used for seeding 
(planting) purposes.
    (2) Seed deemed adulterated may not be mixed with any other seed 
unless the Administrator determines that two or more lots of seed deemed 
adulterated are of substantially the same quality and origin. In such 
cases, the Administrator may allow the adulterated lots of seed to be 
mixed for cleaning as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (3) If the labeling of a lot of seed is false or misleading in any 
respect, the seed will be rejected for entry into the United States. A 
falsely labeled lot of seed must be:
    (i) Exported from the United States;
    (ii) Destroyed under the monitoring of an APHIS inspector; or
    (iii) The seed may be allowed entry into the United States if the 
labeling is corrected under the monitoring of an APHIS inspector to 
accurately reflect the character of the lot of seed.


<R05>
Sec. 361.5  Sampling of seeds.

    (a) Sample sizes. As provided in Sec. 361.4(b), samples of seed will 
be taken from each lot of seed being imported for seeding (planting) 
purposes to determine whether any seeds of noxious weeds listed in 
Sec. 361.6(a) are present. The samples shall be drawn in the manner 
described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. Unused portions of 
samples of rare or expensive seeds will be returned by APHIS upon 
request of the importer.
    (1) A minimum sample of not less than 1 quart shall be drawn from 
each lot of agricultural seed; a minimum sample of not less than 1 pint 
shall be drawn from each lot of vegetable seed, except that a sample of 
\1/4\ pint will be sufficient for a vegetable seed importation of 5 
pounds or less. The minimum sample shall be divided repeatedly until a 
working sample of proper weight has been obtained. If a mechanical 
divider cannot be used or is not available, the sample shall be 
thoroughly mixed, then placed in a pile; the pile shall be divided 
repeatedly into halves until a working sample of the proper weight 
remains. The weights of the working samples for noxious weed examination 
for each lot of seed are shown in column 1 of table 1 of this section. 
If the lot of seed is a mixture, the following methods shall be used to 
determine the weight of the working sample:
    (i) If the lot of seed is a mixture consisting of one predominant 
kind of seed or a group of kinds of similar size, the weight of the 
working sample shall be the weight shown in column 1 of table 1 of this 
section for the kind or group of kinds that comprises more than 50 
percent of the sample.
    (ii) If the lot of seed is a mixture consisting of two or more kinds 
or groups of kinds of different sizes, none of which comprises over 50 
percent of the sample, the weight of the working sample shall be the 
weighted average (to the nearest half gram) of the weight shown in 
column 1 of table 1 of this section for each of the kinds that comprise 
the sample, as determined by the following method:
    (A) Multiply the percentage of each component of the mixture 
(rounded off to the nearest whole number) by the sample sizes shown in 
column 1 of table 1 of this section;
    (B) Add all these products;
    (C) Total the percentages of all components of the mixtures; and
    (D) Divide the sum in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section by the 
total in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(C) of this section.
    (2) It is not ordinarily practical to sample and test small lots of 
seed offered for entry. The maximum sizes of lots of each kind of seed 
not ordinarily sampled are shown in column 2 of table 1 of this section.
    (3) The maximum sizes of lots of each kind of seed allowed entry 
without sampling for sowing for experimental or breeding purposes as 
provided in Sec. 361.4(a)(4) are shown in column 3 of table 1 of this 
section.

    (b) Method of sampling. (1) When an importation consists of more 
than one lot, each lot shall be sampled separately.
    (2) For lots of six or fewer bags, each bag shall be sampled. A 
total of at least five trierfuls shall be taken from the lot.
    (3) For lots of more than six bags, five bags plus at least 10 
percent of the number of bags in the lot shall be sampled. (Round off 
numbers with decimals to the nearest whole number, raising 0.5 to the 
next whole number.) Regardless of the lot size, it is not necessary to 
sample more than 30 bags.
    (4) When the lot of seed to be sampled is comprised of seed in small 
containers that cannot practically be sampled as described in paragraph 
(b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section, entire unopened containers may be 
taken in sufficient number to supply a sample that meets the minimum 
size requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (c) Drawing samples. Samples will not be drawn unless each container 
is labeled to show the lot designation and the name of the kind and 
variety of each agricultural seed, or kind and variety of each vegetable 
seed, appearing on the invoice and other entry papers,

[[Page 448]]

and a declaration has been filed by the importer as required under 
Sec. 361.2(a). In order to secure a representative sample, an APHIS 
inspector will draw equal portions from evenly distributed parts of the 
quantity of seed to be sampled; the APHIS inspector, therefore, must be 
given access to all parts of that quantity.
    (1) For free-flowing seed in bags or in bulk, a probe or trier shall 
be used. For small free-flowing seed in bags, a probe or trier long 
enough to sample all portions of the bag shall be used. When drawing 
more than one trierful of seed from a bag, a different path through the 
seed shall be used when drawing each sample.
    (2) For non-free-flowing seed in bags or bulk that may be difficult 
to sample with a probe or trier, samples shall be obtained by thrusting 
one's hand into the seed and withdrawing representative portions. The 
hand shall be inserted in an open position with the fingers held closely 
together while the hand is being inserted and the portion withdrawn. 
When more than one handful is taken from a bag, the handfuls shall be 
taken from well-separated points.
    (3) When more than one sample is drawn from a single lot, the 
samples may be combined into a composite sample unless it appears that 
the quantity of seed represented as a lot is not of uniform quality, in 
which case the separate samples shall be forwarded together, but without 
being combined into a composite sample.
    (d) In most cases, samples will be drawn and examined by an APHIS 
inspector at the port of first arrival. The APHIS inspector may release 
a shipment if no contaminants are found and the labeling is sufficient. 
If contaminants are found or the labeling of the seed is insufficient, 
the APHIS inspector may forward the sample to the USDA Seed Examination 
Facility (SEF), Beltsville, MD, for analysis, testing, or examination. 
APHIS will notify the owner or consignee of the seed that samples have 
been drawn and forwarded to the SEF and that the shipment must be held 
intact pending a decision by APHIS as to whether the seed is within the 
noxious weed seed tolerances of Sec. 361.6 and is accurately labeled. If 
the decision pending is with regard to the noxious weed seed content of 
the seed and the seed has been determined to be accurately labeled, the 
seed may be released for delivery to the owner or consignee under the 
following conditions:
    (1) The owner or consignee executes with Customs either a Customs 
single-entry bond or a Customs term bond, as appropriate, in such amount 
as is prescribed by applicable Customs regulations;
    (2) The bond must contain a condition for the redelivery of the seed 
or any part thereof upon demand of the Port Director of Customs at any 
time;
    (3) Until the seed is approved for entry upon completion of APHIS' 
examination, the seed must be kept intact and not tampered with in any 
way, or removed from the containers except under the monitoring of an 
APHIS inspector; and
    (4) The owner or consignee must keep APHIS informed as to the 
location of the seed until it is finally entered into the commerce of 
the United States.

Sec. 361.7  Special provisions for Canadian-origin seed and screenings.

    (a) In addition to meeting the declaration and labeling requirements 
of Sec. 361.2 and all other applicable provisions of this part, all 
Canadian-origin agricultural seed and Canadian-origin vegetable seed 
imported into the United States from Canada for seeding (planting) 
purposes or cleaning must be accompanied by a certificate of analysis 
issued by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency or by a private seed 
laboratory accredited by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Samples of 
seed shall be drawn using sampling methods comparable to those detailed 
in Sec. 361.5 of this part. The seed analyst who examines the seed at 
the laboratory must be accredited to analyze the kind of seed covered by 
the certificate.
    (1) If the seed is being imported for seeding (planting) purposes, 
the certificate of analysis must verify that the seed meets the noxious 
weed seed tolerances of Sec. 361.6. Such seed will not be subject to the 
sampling requirements of Sec. 361.3(b).
    (2) If the seed is being imported for cleaning, the certificate of 
analysis must name the kinds of noxious weed seeds that are to be 
removed from the lot of seed. Seed being imported for cleaning must be 
consigned to a facility operated in accordance with Sec. 361.8(a).
    (b) Coated or pelleted agricultural seed and coated or pelleted 
vegetable seed of Canadian origin may be imported into the United States 
if the seed was analyzed prior to being coated or pelleted and is 
accompanied by a certificate of analysis issued in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Screenings otherwise prohibited under this part may be imported 
from Canada if the screenings are imported for processing or manufacture 
and are consigned to a facility operating under a compliance agreement 
as provided by Sec. 361.8(b).

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
0579-0124)


<R05>
Sec. 361.8  Cleaning of imported seed and processing of certain Canadian-origin screenings.

    (a) Imported seed that is found to contain noxious weed seeds at a 
level higher than the tolerances set forth in Sec. 361.6(b) may be 
cleaned under the monitoring of an APHIS inspector. The cleaning will be 
at the expense of the owner or consignee.
    (1) At the location where the seed is being cleaned, the identity of 
the seed must be maintained at all times to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator. The refuse from the cleaning must be placed in containers 
and securely sealed and identified. Upon completion of the cleaning, a 
representative sample of the seed will be analyzed by a registered seed 
technologist, an official seed laboratory, or by APHIS; if the seed is 
found to be within the noxious weed tolerances set forth in 
Sec. 361.6(b),

[[Page 451]]

the seed may be allowed entry into the United States;
    (2) The refuse from the cleaning must be destroyed under the 
monitoring of an APHIS inspector at the expense of the owner or 
consignee of the seed.
    (3) Any person engaged in the business of cleaning imported seed may 
enter into a compliance agreement under paragraph (c) of this section to 
facilitate the cleaning of seed imported into the United States under 
this part.
    (b) Any person engaged in the business of processing screenings who 
wishes to process screenings imported from Canada under Sec. 361.7(c) 
that are otherwise prohibited under this part must enter into a 
compliance agreement under paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) A compliance agreement for the cleaning of imported seed or 
processing of otherwise prohibited screenings from Canada shall be a 
written agreement <SUP>1</SUP> between a person engaged in such a 
business, the State in which the business operates, and APHIS, wherein 
the person agrees to comply with the provisions of this part and any 
conditions imposed pursuant thereto. Any compliance agreement may be 
canceled orally or in writing by the APHIS inspector who is monitoring 
its enforcement whenever the inspector finds that the person who entered 
into the compliance agreement has failed to comply with the provisions 
of this part or any conditions imposed pursuant thereto. If the 
cancellation is oral, the decision and the reasons for the decision 
shall be confirmed in writing, as promptly as circumstances permit. Any 
person whose compliance agreement has been canceled may appeal the 
decision to the Administrator, in writing, within 10 days after 
receiving written notification of the cancellation. The appeal shall 
state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show 
that the compliance agreement was wrongfully canceled. The Administrator 
shall grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for such 
decision, as promptly as circumstances permit. If there is a conflict as 
to any material fact, a hearing shall be held to resolve such conflict. 
Rules of practice concerning such a hearing will be adopted by the 
Administrator.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Compliance Agreement forms are available without charge from 
Permit Unit, PPQ, APHIS, 4700 River Road Unit 136, Riverdale, MD 20737-

Sec. 361.9  Recordkeeping.

    (a) Each person importing agricultural seed or vegetable seed under 
this part must maintain a complete record, including copies of the 
declaration and labeling required under this part and a sample of seed, 
for each lot of seed imported. Except for the seed sample, which may be 
discarded 1 year after the entire lot represented by the sample has been 
disposed of by the person who imported the seed, the records must be 
maintained for 3 years following the importation.
    (b) Each sample of vegetable seed and each sample of agricultural 
seed must be at least equal in weight to the sample size prescribed for 
noxious weed seed examination in table 1 of Sec. 361.5.
    (c) An APHIS inspector shall, during normal business hours, be 
allowed to inspect and copy the records.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
0579-0124)


<R05>
Sec. 361.10  Costs and charges.

    Unless a user fee is payable under Sec. 354.3 of this chapter, the 
services of an APHIS inspector during regularly assigned hours of duty 
and at the usual places of duty will be furnished without cost. The U.S. 
Department of Agriculture's provisions relating to overtime charges for 
an APHIS inspector's services are set forth in part 354 of this chapter. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will not be responsible for any costs 
or charges incident to inspections or compliance with this part, other 
than for the services of the APHIS inspector during regularly assigned 
hours of duty and at the usual places of duty. All expenses incurred by 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture (including travel, per diem or 
subsistence, and salaries of officers or employees of the Department) in 
connection with the monitoring of cleaning, labeling, other 
reconditioning, or destruction of seed, screenings, or refuse under this 
part shall be reimbursed by the owner or consignee of the seed or 
screenings.

<R05>
Sec. 370.1  Scope and purpose.

    These regulations are issued pursuant to the Freedom of Information 
Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552), and in accordance with the requirements 
of the Department of Agriculture regulations in part 1, subpart A of 
this title. The availability of records of the Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service (APHIS), and the procedures by which the public may 
obtain such information, shall be governed by the Department regulations 
as implemented by the regulations in this part. It is the policy of 
APHIS to be an open agency and to promptly make available for public 
inspection any records or information which are required to be released 
under the Act. Material which is exempt from disclosure will also be 
promptly made available when the Agency in its discretion determines 
that release of such material is in the public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 370.2  Published materials.

    Rules and regulations of APHIS relating to its regulatory 
responsibilities are continuously published in the Federal Register, and 
codified in this chapter III, title 7, and in 9 CFR chapter I. APHIS 
issues publications explaining animal and plant health programs and the 
laws and regulations, including quarantines, under which the programs 
are conducted. These publications are, for the most part available free 
from the Office of Governmental and Public Affairs, USDA, Washington, DC 
20250; or, in some cases from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. 
Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, at established rates.

maintain and make available for public inspection and copying a current 
index providing identifying information regarding the materials required 
to be published or made available under the Freedom of Information Act 
(5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)). Notice is hereby given that publication of this 
index is unnecessary and impracticable, since the material is voluminous 
and does not change often enough to justify the expense of publication.


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 370.5  Requests for records.

    (a) Requests for APHIS records or information other than material 
published or made available under the preceding sections, shall be made 
in writing in accordance with 7 CFR 1.3(a) and submitted to the APHIS 
Freedom of Information Act Coordinator at the following address:

Freedom of Information Act Coordinator, (FOIA Request), Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service, Legislative and Public Affairs, Freedom of 
Information, 4700 River Road, Unit 50, Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1231.


[[Page 453]]


    The request shall identify each record with reasonable specificity 
as prescribed in Sec. 1.3(b) of this title. The APHIS FOIA Coordinator 
is hereby delegated authority to make determinations with respect to 
such requests in accordance with 7 CFR.
    (b) The FOIA Coordinator or his designee is authorized to receive 
requests and to exercise the authority under Sec. 1.4(c) of this title 
to:
    (1) Make determinations to grant or deny requests,
    (2) Extend the administrative deadline,
    (3) Make discretionary releases of exempt records, and
    (4) Make determinations regarding charges pursuant to the fee 
schedule.
    (c) In exercising his authority under Sec. 1.4(c) of this title to 
grant and deny requests, the Coordinator will comply with subsection (b) 
of the Freedom of Information Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552(b)), which 
requires that any reasonably segregable portion of a document shall be 
provided to a person requesting such document after deletion of any 
portions which are exempt under the Act. Therefore, unless the 
disclosable and non-disclosable portions are so inextricably linked that 
it is not reasonably possible to separate them, the document will be 
released with the non-disclosable portions deleted, except that the 
Coordinator may exercise discretion as limited by Sec. 1.11 of this 
title, to release the entire document, or to make only a minimum number 
of deletions, e.g., the names of individuals.

Sec. 370.7  Agency response to requests.

    (a) The response to requests for information and to appeals shall be 
made in accordance with the Department regulations in Sec. 1.5 of this 
title and the regulations in this part.
    (b) Requests for records and information which have customarily been 
directed to field stations and agency headquarters may continue to be 
directed to those locations, notwithstanding the provisions of these 
regulations. If the information is not available at the location at 
which the request is made, or the official receiving the request is in 
doubt as to whether the information should be released, the official 
shall (1) promptly forward the request to the FOIA Coordinator, or (2) 
inform the requester of the procedures established in these regulations 
by which the request may be sent directly to the FOIA Coordinator. The 
date of receipt of the request by the Coordinator shall be the 
determining date for purposes of the time limitations under the Freedom 
of Information Act and the regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 372.1  Purpose.

    These procedures implement section 102(2) of the National 
Environmental Policy Act by assuring early and adequate consideration of 
environmental factors in Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 
planning and decisionmaking and by promoting the effective, efficient 
integration of all relevant environmental requirements under the 
National Environmental Policy Act. The goal of timely, relevant 
environmental analysis will be secured principally by adhering to the 
National Environmental Policy Act implementing regulations (40 CFR parts 
1500-1508), especially provisions pertaining to timing (Sec. 1502.5), 
integration (Sec. 1502.25), and scope of analysis (Sec. 1508.25).


<R05>
Sec. 372.2  Designation of responsible APHIS official.

    The Administrator of APHIS, or an agency official to whom the 
Administrator may formally delegate the task, is responsible for overall 
review of APHIS' NEPA compliance.


<R05>
Sec. 372.3  Information and assistance.

    Information, including the status of studies, and the availability 
of reference materials, as well as the informal interpretations of 
APHIS' NEPA procedures and other forms of assistance, will be made 
available upon request to Environmental Analysis and Documentation, 
Biotechnology, Biologics, and Environmental Protection, APHIS, USDA, 
P.O. Drawer 810, Riverdale MD 20738, (301) 436-8565 (Hyattsville) or 
(301) 734-8565 (Riverdale).


<R05>
Sec. 372.4  Definitions.

    The terminology set forth in the Council on Environmental Quality's 
(CEQ) implementing regulations at 40 CFR part 1508 is incorporated 
herein. In addition, the following terms, as used in these procedures, 
are defined as follows:
    APHIS. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).
    Decisionmaker. The agency official responsible for executing 
findings of no significant impact in the environmental assessment 
process and the record of decision in the environmental impact statement 
process.
    Department. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).
    Environmental unit. Environmental Analysis and Documentation, the 
analytical unit in Biotechnology, Biologics, and Environmental 
Protection responsible for coordinating APHIS' compliance with the 
National Environmental Policy Act and other environmental laws and 
regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 372.5  Classification of actions.

    (a) Actions normally requiring environmental impact statements. This 
class of policymakings and rulemakings seeks to establish programmatic 
approaches to animal and plant health issues. Actions in this class 
typically involve the agency, an entire program, or a substantial 
program component and are characterized by their broad scope (often 
global or nationwide) and potential effect (impacting a wide range of 
environmental quality values or indicators, whether or not affected 
individuals or systems may be completely identified at the time). 
Ordinarily, new or untried methodologies, strategies, or techniques to 
deal with pervasive threats to animal and plant health are the subjects 
of this class of actions. Alternative means of dealing with those 
threats usually have not been well developed. Actions in this class 
include:
    (1) Formulation of contingent response strategies to combat future 
widespread outbreaks of animal and plant diseases; and
    (2) Adoption of strategic or other long-range plans that purport to 
adopt for future program application a preferred course of action.
    (b) Actions normally requiring environmental assessments but not 
necessarily environmental impact statements. This class of APHIS actions 
may involve the

[[Page 475]]

agency as a whole or an entire program, but generally is related to a 
more discrete program component and is characterized by its limited 
scope (particular sites, species, or activities) and potential effect 
(impacting relatively few environmental values or systems). Individuals 
and systems that may be affected can be identified. Methodologies, 
strategies, and techniques employed to deal with the issues at hand are 
seldom new or untested. Alternative means of dealing with those issues 
are well established. Mitigation measures are generally available and 
have been successfully employed. Actions in this class include:
    (1) Policymakings and rulemakings that seek to remedy specific 
animal and plant health risks or that may affect opportunities on the 
part of the public to influence agency environmental planning and 
decisionmaking. Examples of this category of actions include:
    (i) Development of program plans that seek to adopt strategies, 
methods, and techniques as the means of dealing with particular animal 
and plant health risks that may arise in the future;
    (ii) Implementation of program plans at the site-specific, action 
level, except for actions that are categorically excluded, as provided 
in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) Planning, design, construction, or acquisition of new 
facilities, or proposals for modifications to existing facilities.
    (3) Disposition of waste and other hazardous or toxic materials at 
laboratories and other APHIS facilities, except for actions that are 
categorically excluded, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (4) Approvals and issuance of permits for proposals involving 
genetically engineered or nonindigenous species, except for actions that 
are categorically excluded, as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (5) Research or testing that:
    (i) Will be conducted outside of a laboratory or other containment 
area (field trials, for example); or
    (ii) Reaches a stage of development (e.g., formulation of 
premarketing strategies) that forecasts an irretrievable commitment to 
the resulting products or technology.
    (c) Categorically excluded actions. This class of APHIS actions 
shares many of the same characteristics--particularly in terms of the 
extent of program involvement, as well as the scope, effect of, and the 
availability of alternatives to proposed actions--as the class of 
actions that normally requires environmental assessments but not 
necessarily environmental impact statements. The major difference is 
that the means through which adverse environmental impacts may be 
avoided or minimized have actually been built right into the actions 
themselves. The efficacy of this approach generally has been established 
through testing and/or monitoring. The Department of Agriculture has 
also promulgated a listing of categorical exclusions that are applicable 
to all agencies within the department unless their procedures provide 
otherwise. Those categorical exclusions, codified at 7 CFR 1b.3(a), are 
entirely appropriate for APHIS. Other actions in this class include:
    (1) Routine measures. (i) Routine measures, such as identifications, 
inspections, surveys, sampling that does not cause physical alteration 
of the environment, testing, seizures, quarantines, removals, 
sanitizing, inoculations, control, and monitoring employed by agency 
programs to pursue their missions and functions. Such measures may 
include the use--according to any label instructions or other lawful 
requirements and consistent with standard, published program practices 
and precautions--of chemicals, pesticides, or other potentially 
hazardous or harmful substances, materials, and target-specific devices 
or remedies, provided that such use meets all of the following criteria 
(insofar as they may pertain to a particular action):
    (A) The use is localized or contained in areas where humans are not 
likely to be exposed, and is limited in terms of quantity, i.e., 
individualized dosages and remedies;
    (B) The use will not cause contaminants to enter water bodies, 
including wetlands;

[[Page 476]]

    (C) The use does not adversely affect any federally protected 
species or critical habitat; and
    (D) The use does not cause bioaccumulation.
    (ii) Examples of routine measures include:
    (A) Inoculation or treatment of discrete herds of livestock or 
wildlife undertaken in contained areas (such as a barn or corral, a zoo, 
an exhibition, or an aviary);
    (B) Pesticide treatments applied to infested plants at a nursery; 
and
    (C) Isolated (for example, along a highway) weed control efforts.
    (2) Research and development activities. (i) Activities that are 
carried out in laboratories, facilities, or other areas designed to 
eliminate the potential for harmful environmental effects--internal or 
external--and to provide for lawful waste disposal.
    (ii) Examples of this category of actions include:
    (A) The development and/or production (including formulation, 
repackaging, movement, and distribution) of previously approved and/or 
licensed program materials, devices, reagents, and biologics;
    (B) Research, testing, and development of animal repellents; and
    (C) Development and production of sterile insects.
    (3) Licensing and permitting. (i) Issuance of a license, permit, or 
authorization to ship for field testing previously unlicensed veterinary 
biological products;
    (ii) Permitting, or acknowledgment of notifications for, confined 
field releases of genetically engineered organisms and products; and
    (iii) Permitting of:
    (A) Importation of nonindigenous species into containment 
facilities,
    (B) Interstate movement of nonindigenous species between containment 
facilities, or
    (C) Releases into a State's environment of pure cultures of 
organisms that are either native or are established introductions.
    (4) Rehabilitation of facilities. Rehabilitation of existing 
laboratories and other APHIS facilities, functional replacement of parts 
and equipment, and minor additions to such existing APHIS facilities.
    (d) Exceptions for categorically excluded actions. Whenever the 
decisionmaker determines that a categorically excluded action may have 
the potential to affect ``significantly'' the quality of the ``human 
environment,'' as those terms are defined at 40 CFR 1508.27 and 1508.14, 
respectively, an environmental assessment or an environmental impact 
statement will be prepared. For example:
    (1) When any routine measure, the incremental impact of which, when 
added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions 
(regardless of what agency or person undertakes such actions), has the 
potential for significant environmental impact;
    (2) When a previously licensed or approved biologic has been 
subsequently shown to be unsafe, or will be used at substantially higher 
dosage levels or for substantially different applications or 
circumstances than in the use for which the product was previously 
approved;
    (3) When a previously unlicensed veterinary biological product to be 
shipped for field testing contains live microorganisms or will not be 
used exclusively for in vitro diagnostic testing; or
    (4) When a confined field release of genetically engineered 
organisms or products involves new species or organisms or novel 
modifications that raise new issues.

<R05>
Sec. 372.6  Early planning for applicants and non-APHIS entities.

    Each prospective applicant who anticipates the need for approval of 
proposed activities classified as normally requiring environmental 
documentation is encouraged to contact, at the earliest opportunity, 
APHIS' program staff.

[60 FR 6002, Feb. 1, 1995; 60 FR 13212, Mar. 10, 1995]

[[Page 477]]


<R05>
Sec. 372.7  Consultation.

    Prospective applicants are encouraged to contact APHIS program 
officials to determine what types of environmental analyses or 
documentation, if any, need to be prepared. NEPA documents will 
incorporate, to the fullest extent possible, surveys and studies 
required by other environmental statutes, such as the Endangered Species 
Act.

[60 FR 6002, Feb. 1, 1995; 60 FR 13212, Mar. 10, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 372.8  Major planning and decision points and public involvement.

    (a) Major planning and decisions points. The NEPA process will be 
fully coordinated with APHIS planning in cooperation with program 
personnel. Specific decision points or milestones will be identified and 
communicated to the public and others in a notice of intent and in the 
context of the public scoping process.
    (b) Public involvement. There will be an early and open process for 
determining the scope of issues to be addressed in the environmental 
impact statement process.
    (1) A notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement 
will be published in the Federal Register as soon as it is determined 
that a proposed major Federal action has the potential to affect 
significantly the quality of the human environment. The notice may 
include a preliminary scope of environmental study. All public and other 
involvement in APHIS' environmental impact statement process, including 
the scoping process, commenting on draft documents, and participation in 
the preparation of any supplemental documents, will be pursuant to CEQ's 
implementing regulations.
    (2) Opportunities for public involvement in the environmental 
assessment process will be announced in the same fashion as the 
availability of environmental assessments and findings of no significant 
impact.
    (3) Notification of the availability of environmental assessments 
and findings of no significant impact for proposed activities will be 
published in the Federal Register, unless it is determined that the 
effects of the action are primarily of regional or local concern. Where 
the effects of the action are primarily of regional or local concern, 
notice will normally be provided through publication in a local or area 
newspaper of general circulation and/or the procedures implementing 
Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs.''
    (4) All environmental documents, comments received, and any 
underlying documents, including interagency correspondence where such 
correspondence transmits comments of Federal agencies on the 
environmental impact of proposals for which documents were prepared 
(except for privileged or confidential information (50 FR 38561)), will 
be made available to the public upon request. Materials to be made 
available will be provided without charge, to the extent practicable, or 
at a fee not more than the actual cost of reproducing copies required to 
be sent to other Federal agencies, including CEQ.


<R05>
Sec. 372.9  Processing and use of environmental documents.

    (a) Environmental assessments will be forwarded immediately upon 
completion to the decisionmaker for a determination of whether the 
proposed action may have significant effects on the quality of the human 
environment, and for the execution, as appropriate, of a finding of no 
significant impact or a notice of intent to prepare an environmental 
impact statement.
    (1) The availability of environmental assessments will be announced 
by publishing a notice consistent with the notification provisions of 
Sec. 372.8.
    (2) Comments, if any, will be transmitted, together with any 
analyses and recommendations, to the APHIS decisionmaker who may then 
take appropriate action.
    (3) Changes to environmental assessments and findings of no 
significant impact that are prompted by comments, new information, or 
any other source, will normally be announced in the same manner as the 
notice of availability (except that all commenters will be mailed copies 
of changes directly) prior to implementing the proposed action or any 
alternative.

[[Page 478]]

    (b) Environmental impact statements will be processed from inception 
(publication of the notice of intent) to completion (publication of a 
final environmental impact statement or a supplement) according to the 
Council on Environmental Quality implementing regulations.
    (c) For rulemaking or adjudicatory proceedings, relevant 
environmental documents, comments, and responses will be a part of the 
administrative record.
    (d) For all APHIS activity that is subject to the NEPA process, 
relevant environmental documents, comments, and responses will accompany 
proposals through the review process.
    (e) The APHIS decisionmaker will consider the alternatives discussed 
in environmental documents in reaching a determination on the merits of 
proposed actions.
    (f) APHIS will implement mitigation and other conditions established 
in environmental documentation and committed to as part of the 
decisionmaking process.


<R05>
Sec. 372.10  Supplementing environmental impact statements.

    Once a decision to supplement an environmental impact statement is 
made, a notice of intent will be published. The administrative record 
will thereafter be open. The supplemental document will then be 
processed in the same fashion (exclusive of scoping) as a draft and a 
final statement (unless alternative procedures are approved by CEQ) and 
will become part of the administrative record.
