                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2000, consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

<R02>
                CHAPTER I--PANAMA CANAL REGULATIONS<SUP>1


<R03>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1</SUP>  Pursuant to Pub. L. 96-70 and a document published at 44 FR 
75306, Dec. 19, 1979, the chapter heading has been adjusted to read 
``Panama Canal Regulations.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  --------------------------------------------------------------------


  Editorial Note: Upon entry into force on October 1, 1979, of the 
Panama Canal Treaty of 1977, the United States relinquished and Panama 
assumed plenary jurisdiction over what was the Canal Zone. Pursuant to 
the Panama Canal Act of 1979, Pub. L. 96-70, the statute implementing 
the new treaty, the Canal Zone Government was disestablished and the 
Panama Canal Company was replaced by a new United States Government 
agency, the Panama Canal Commission, which will operate the waterway 
until the termination of the treaty on December 31, 1999. Many of the 
functions performed by the two former Canal agencies will not be 
undertaken by the Panama Canal Commission.

  As a result of the Treaty and Pub. L. 96-70, the regulations published 
in Title 35, have to be rewritten in accordance with the substantially 
different authority and responsibilities which the new agency has.

  It should be noted that those regulations which have not been revised 
since October 1, 1979 must be read in light of the new definitions 
provided by section 3 of Pub. L. 96-70, which states in part as follows:


  (b) Subject to the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, for 
purposes of applying the Canal Zone Code or other laws of the United 
States and regulations issued pursuant to such Code or other laws with 
respect to transactions, occurrences, or status on or after the 
effective date of this Act--

  (1) ``Canal Zone'' shall be deemed to refer to the areas and 
installations in the Republic of Panama made available to the United 
States pursuant to the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 and related 
agreements;

  (2) ``Canal Zone waters'' and ``waters of the Canal Zone'' shall be 
deemed to refer to ``Panama Canal waters'' and ``waters of the Panama 
Canal'', respectively;

  (3) ``Government of the Canal Zone'' or ``Canal Zone Government'' 
shall be deemed to refer to the United States of America;

  (4) ``Governor of the Canal Zone'' or ``Governor'', wherever the 
reference is to the Governor of the Canal Zone, shall be deemed to refer 
to the Panama Canal Commission;

  (5) ``Panama Canal Company'' or ``Company'' wherever the reference is 
to the Panama Canal Company, shall be deemed to refer to the Panama 
Canal Commission;

  (6) In chapter 57 of title 5 of the Canal Zone Code, ``hospitals'' and 
``Health Bureau'' shall be deemed to refer, respectively, to the 
hospitals operated by the United States in the Republic of Panama, and 
to the organizational unit operating such hospitals; and

  (7) In chapter 57 of title 5 of the Canal Zone Code, in section 4784 
of title 6 of such Code, and in section 2 of title 7 of such Code, 
``health director'' shall be deemed to refer to the senior official in 
charge of the hospitals operated by the United States in the Republic of 
Panama.

  (c) Any reference set forth in subsection (b) of this section shall 
apply except as otherwise provided in this Act or unless (1) such 
reference is inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, (2) in the 
context in which a term is used such reference is clearly not intended, 
or (3) a term refers to a time before the effective date of this Act.


  Parts 1, 5, 53, 57, 59, 63, 65, 69, 127, and 129 have been removed 
because they are inconsistent with the provisions of the Panama Canal 
Treaty of 1977 and related agreements or with Pub.

    As used in this part:

<R05>
Sec. 9.3  Functions.

    (a) The Panama Canal Commission, which replaced the Canal Zone 
Government and the Panama Canal Company effective October 1, 1979, is 
established in the executive branch of the United States by the Panama 
Canal Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96-70, 93 Stat. 452) as an agency of the 
United States, for the purpose of maintaining and operating the Panama 
Canal and the facilities and appurtenances related thereto. As provided 
in section 1101 of that Act, the authority of the President with respect 
to the Commission is exercised through the Secretary of Defense.
    (b) As provided in the Panama Canal Act of 1979, the supervision of 
the Commission is vested in a Board composed of nine members, one of 
whom is the Secretary of Defense or an officer of the Department of 
Defense designated by the Secretary. Not fewer than five

[[Page 11]]

members of the Board are nationals of the United States; the remaining 
members are nationals of the Republic of Panama.
    (c) The President appoints the members of the Board. The members of 
the Board who are United States nationals are appointed by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate. Each member of the Board holds office 
at the pleasure of the President.
    (d) The Administrator of the Commission, who is appointed by the 
President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, holds 
office at the pleasure of the President.
    (e) The Commission maintains and operates the Panama Canal and 
facilities and appurtenances related thereto, including electric power, 
water, and telephone systems; procurement and storehouse facilities; 
motor transportation services; an agency press and duplicating center; 
marine and general repair shop; and an employees' housing system.

(The Panama Canal Act of 1979, secs. 1101, 1102, 1103, Pub. L. 96-70, 93 
Stat. 456, 457)


<R05>
Sec. 9.4  How to request general information or publications.

    The Commission has an Office of Public Affairs which is responsible 
for providing information about the agency to members of the public and 
the press. If you are interested in general information about the 
Commission's activities, or copies of its publications, you should 
write, visit, or call this office. Address letters to: Panama Canal 
Commission, Office of Public Affairs, Unit 2300, APO AA 34011-2300 (or

<R05>
Sec. 9.5  The Freedom of Information Act.

    (a) The Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) is a law which 
creates a procedure for any person to request official records from 
United States Government agencies. The rest of the rules in this subpart 
explain how you may request official records from the Panama Canal 
Commission.
    (b) The Freedom of Information Act requires every United States 
Government agency to make official records available to any person who 
requests them, unless the records that the person requests fall within 
one of more of the exceptions to availability listed in the law. For 
more details about these exceptions, see subsection (b) of section 552, 
Title 5, United States Code, available in libraries.
    (c) The Freedom of Information Act does not require an agency to 
create records or compile information that you would like to have. The 
law deals only with making existing records available.

[44 FR 75309, Dec. 19, 1979, as amended at 52 FR 31397, Aug. 20, 1987; 
53 FR 16256, May 6, 1988]

Sec. 9.6  How to make a Freedom of Information Act request.

    (a) To make a request for a record using the Freedom of Information 
Act, you must:
    (1) Write to the Panama Canal Commission, Agency Records Officer 
(Chief, Administrative Services Division), Unit 2300, APO AA 34011-2300 
(or Balboa, Republic of Panama); and
    (2) State in your letter that you are making a request under the 
Freedom of Information Act, and clearly mark the envelope ``Freedom of 
Information Act Request''. A request under 5 U.S.C. 552 which is not 
properly addressed and is not marked in this way shall not be considered 
to be received by the agency until it has actually been received by the 
Agency Records Officer.
    (3) In your letter, reasonably describe the records you are seeking. 
Be as specific in describing the records as you can. Although it is not 
required, it will be helpful if, whenever possible, you supply in your 
letter specific information regarding dates, titles, file designations, 
the office where you believe the records may be found, and other 
information which may help to identify the records.
    (b) The Panama Canal Commmission may request that you furnish 
information as to the purpose of your request. Such information is 
required to assist agency officials in categorizing your request in 
order to accurately assess fees.

the Commission but which originated in another Federal agency, the 
Agency Records Officer may refer your request to that agency. In that 
case, the Agency Records Officer will inform you that your request has 
been referred to the originating agency.


<R05>
Sec. 9.8  How to make an appeal under the Freedom of Information Act.

    (a) If you are not satisfied with the decision of the Agency Records 
Officer, you may require the Commission to reconsider that decision. 
This is called ``making an appeal.''
    (b) To make an appeal, you must:
    (1) Write to the Panama Canal Commission, Director, Office of 
Executive Administration, Unit 2300, APO AA 34011-2300 (or Balboa,

Information Act Appeal''; and
    (3) Mail or deliver the letter of appeal within ten working days 
after you receive the letter from the Agency Records Officer.
    (c) Although it is not required, it may be helpful if you clearly

on your request and your reasons for wanting the records.

[44 FR 75309, Dec. 19, 1979, as amended at 46 FR 48659, Oct. 2, 1981; 52 
FR 31397, Aug. 20, 1987; 53 FR 16256, May 6, 1988; 59 FR 26122, May 19, 
1994]


<R05>
Sec. 9.9  How your Freedom of Information Act appeal will be handled.

    (a) The official responsible for deciding whether to grant your 
appeal is the Director, Office of Executive Administration of the Panama 
Canal Commission. That official must make that decision and send you 
notification of it within 20 working days after receiving your appeal. 
In unusual circumstances, the Commission may extend the time for 
responding to your appeal. For details, see Sec. 9.10 of this part.
    (b) If the Director, Office of Executive Administration denies your 
appeal, in whole or in part, the letter sent to you to notify you of 
this decision must:
    (1) Tell you why the appeal is being denied;
    (2) Tell you that this denial is the Commission's final decision; 
and
    (3) Tell you that you have the right to request a U.S. District 
Court to review the denial of your appeal, as provided by 5 U.S.C. 
552(a)(4)(B), as amended.

[44 FR 75309, Dec. 19, 1979, as amended at 46 FR 48659, Oct. 2, 1981]


<R05>
Sec. 9.10  How the Commission may extend the time to respond to your request or appeal.

    (a) In unusual circumstances, the Commission may extend the time for 
making a decision about your request or about your appeal. If the

notice signed by the Agency Records Officer. The notice will:
    (1) Tell you why it is necessary to extend the time;
    (2) Tell you how long the time has been extended; and
    (3) Tell you the date when you can expect the decision about your 
request or your appeal to be sent to you.
    (b) The Commission may extend the time for making a decision about 
your request or your appeal by a total of ten

[[Page 13]]

working days. The extension period may be split between the request and 
the appeal, but it may not exceed ten working days overall.
    (c) The unusual circumstances which may reasonably require an 
extension of time for the proper handling of your request or appeal are:
    (1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from 
field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the 
office processing the request; or
    (2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a 
voluminous quantity of separate and distinct records which are demanded 
in a single request; or
    (3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all 
practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in 
the determination of the request or among two or more components of the 
Commission having substantial subject matter interest in the request.

revise the request.
    (d) The Panama Canal Commission may require a requester to pay fees 
in advance only if the estimated charges are likely to exceed $250.00, 
or the requester has previously failed to pay a fee in a timely fashion 
(i.e., within 30 days of the date of billing).
    (1) If the requester has a history of prompt payment, and the 
estimated charges are likely to exceed $250.00, the Commission will 
notify the requester of the estimated cost and obtain satisfactory 
assurance of full payment.
    (2) If the requester has no prior payment history, and the estimated 
charges are likely to exceed $250.00, the agency may require an advance 
payment of an amount up to the full amount of estimated charges.
    (3) If the requester has a poor payment history, the agency may 
require advance payment of the full amount of

[[Page 14]]

the estimated fees, as well as any amount currently owed, plus interest 
on the delinquent amount, before the agency begins to process a new or 
pending request from that requester.
    (4) When the agency acts under this subsection, the administrative 
time limits prescribed in Secs. 9.7(a) and 9.9(a) will begin only after 
receipt of the required fee payments.
    (e) If you wish to request a waiver or reduction of fees, you must 
do so in writing to the Chief, Administrative Services Division, Agency 
Records Officer, Panama Canal Commission, Unit 2300, APO AA 34011-2300. 
The Agency Records Officer may waive or reduce the fees if the official 
decides that providing the records you request would be in the public 
interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public 
understanding of the operations or activities of the government, and is 
not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Requests for 
a waiver or reduction of fees shall be considered on a case-by-case 
basis.
    (1) In order to determine whether disclosure of the information is 
in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly 
to public understanding of the operations or activities of the 
government, the Agency Records Officer will consider the following four 
factors:
    (i) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested 
records concerns the operations or activities of the government;
    (ii) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: 
Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute to an understanding of 
government operations or activities;
    (iii) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the 
general public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of 
the requested information will contribute to public understanding; and
    (iv) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: 
Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to public 
understanding of government operations or activities.
    (2) In order to determine whether disclosure of the information is 
not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, the Agency 
Records Officer will consider the following two factors:
    (i) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether 
the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the 
requested disclosure; and, if so
    (ii) The primary interest in disclosure: Whether the magnitude of 
the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently 
large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that 
disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
    (3) The Agency Records Officer will not consider waiver or reduction 
of fees for requesters (persons or organizations) from whom unpaid fees 
remain due to the Agency for another information access request.
    (4) The Agency's decision to refuse to waive or reduce fees as 
requested under this section may be appealed to the Director, Office of 
Executive Administration, Panama Canal Commission, Unit 2300, APO AA 
34011-2300. Appeals should contain as much information and documentation 
as possible to support the request for a waiver or reduction of fees. 
The requester will be notified within thirty working days from the date 
on which the Agency received the appeal.
    (f) This agency will assess interest charges on an unpaid bill 
starting on the 31st day following the day on which the bill was sent. 
Interest will be computed at the rate prescribed in Section 3717 of 
Title 31, United States Code, and will accrue from the date of the 
billing.

Sec. 9.12  Definitions.

    Commercial use refers to a request or a requester seeking 
information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or 
profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the 
request is made.
    Duplication refers to the process of making a copy of document 
necessary to respond to a Freedom of Information Act request. Such 
copies can take the form of paper copy, microfilm, audio-visual 
materials, or machine readable

[[Page 15]]

documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others. The copy 
provided will be in a form that is reasonably usable by the requester.
    Educational institution refers to a preschool, a public or private 
elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher 
education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an 
institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational 
education, which operates programs of scholarly research.
    Non-commercial scientific institution refers to an institution that 
is not operated on a commercial basis and which is operated solely for 
the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are 
not intended to promote any particular product or industry.
    Representative of the news media refers to any person actively 
gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish 
or broadcast news to the public. As used herein, the word ``news'' means 
information that is about current events or that would be of current 
interest to the public.
    Review refers to the process of examining documents located in 
response to a request that is for a commercial use to determine whether 
any portion of any document located is permitted to be withheld. It also 
includes the time spent processing any documents for disclosure; i.e., 
doing all that is necessary to delete unreleasable portions and prepare 
documents for release. Review does not include time spent resolving 
general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.
    Search time is the time spent by the agency to identify the 
documents requested and will be charged in accordance with 
Sec. 9.11(a)(1) and (2).

<R05>
Sec. 9.13  Classifying requests for fee purposes.

    (a) When the Panama Canal Commission receives a request for 
documents that appears to be for commercial use, fees will be assessed 
for the total search time, review time, and all duplication of the 
documents. Requestors must reasonably describe the records sought. When 
the agency has reasonable cause to doubt the stated use of the 
documents, or where the use is not clear from the request itself, the 
agency can seek additional clarification. Requesters should note that 
the Panama Canal Commission may assess fees for search and review even 
if no documents are determined to be releasable under the Freedom of 
Information Act.
    (b) Educational institution requesters will be provided the first 
100 pages of duplication without charge and will not be charged for 
search time. To be eligible for this reduction in fees, the requester 
must show that the request is being made under the auspices of a 
qualifying institution and that the records are being sought to further 
scholarly research and not for commercial use. The requester must 
reasonably describe the records sought.
    (c) Non-commercial scientific institution requesters will be 
provided the first 100 pages without charge and will not be charged for 
search time. To be eligible for this reduction in fees, the requester 
must show that the request is being made under the auspices of a 
qualifying institution and that the records are being sought to further 
scientific research and not for commercial use. The requester must 
reasonably describe the records sought.
    (d) Representatives of the news media will be provided the first 100 
pages without charge and will not be charged for search time. To be 
eligible for reduction in fees, the requester must meet the criteria 
prescribed in Sec. 9.12 and the request must not be for commercial use. 
A request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the 
requester will not be considered to be a request that is for a 
commercial use. The requester must reasonably describe the records 
sought.
    (e) For all other requesters who do not fit into the above 
categories, fees will be charged which recover the full reasonable 
direct cost of searching for and reproducing records that are responsive 
to the request, except that the first 100 pages of reproduction and the 
first two hours of search time will be furnished without charge. The 
requester must reasonably describe the records sought.

[[Page 16]]

    (f) Those requesters searching for records about themselves will be 
treated under the Privacy Act of 1974 and will only be charged for 
reproduction costs.
    (g) A requester may not file multiple requests solely in order to 
avoid payment of fees. When the agency reasonably believes that a 
requester is attempting to separate a request into a series of requests 
for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the agency may 
aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly.

Sec. 9.14  Current index.

    (a) The Commission maintains and will make available for public 
inspection and copying a current index of the agency's opinions, policy 
statements, administrative staff manuals, and instructions to staff that 
affect a member of the public.
    (b) The Commission has decided that it is not necessary to publish 
this index.
    (c) On request, the Commission will provide copies of this index to 
members of the public. The charges for the copies will be no greater 
than those set out in Sec. 9.11.

Sec. 9.15  Annual report.

    On or before March 1 of each calendar year, the Panama Canal 
Commission sends to both Houses of Congress a report of its activities 
in connection with the Freedom of Information Act during the preceding 
calendar year. The Freedom of Information Act requires each agency to 
make this report and to include in it such information as: how many 
requests were denied and why; how many denials were appealed and the 
result of those appeals; the name and title of each official who denied 
a request; and other information showing how the agency administered the 
Freedom of Information Act during the period covered by the report.

<R05>
Sec. 9.16  Predisclosure notification procedures for confidential commercial information.

    (a) In general. Confidential commercial information provided to the 
Panama Canal Commission by a submitter shall not be disclosed pursuant 
to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request except in accordance with 
this section. The following definitions apply:
    (1) Confidential commercial information means records provided to 
the Commission by a submitter that arguably contain material exempt from 
release under Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 
552(b)(4), because disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause 
substantial competitive harm.
    (2) Submitter means any person or entity who provides confidential 
commercial information to the Commission. The term ``submitter'' 
includes, but is not limited to, corporations, state governments, and 
foreign governments.
    (b) Notice to submitters. The Panama Canal Commission shall provide 
a submitter with prompt notice of receipt of a Freedom of Information 
Act request encompassing its confidential commercial information 
whenever required in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, and 
except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section. The written notice 
shall either describe the exact nature of the information requested or 
provide copies of the records or portions of records containing the 
requested information.
    (c) When notice is required. (1) For confidential commercial 
information submitted prior to January 1, 1988, the Panama Canal 
Commission shall provide a submitter with notice of receipt of a FOIA 
request whenever:
    (i) the records are less than 10 years old and the information has 
been designated by the submitter as confidential commercial information;
    (ii) The Panama Canal Commission has reason to believe that 
disclosure of the information could reasonably result in commercial or 
financial harm to the submitter; or
    (iii) The information is subject to the prior express commitment of 
confidentiality given by the Commission to the submitter.

[[Page 17]]

    (2) For confidential commercial information submitted on or after 
January 1, 1988, the Commission shall provide a submitter with notice of 
receipt of a FOIA request whenever:
    (i) The submitter has in good faith designated the information as 
commercially or financially sensitive; or
    (ii) The Commission has reason to believe that disclosure of the 
information could reasonably result in commercial or financial harm to 
the submitter.
    (3) Notice of a request for confidential commercial information 
falling within paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section shall be required for 
a period of not more than ten years after the date of submission unless 
the submitter requests, and provides acceptable justification for, a 
specific notice period of greater duration.
    (4) Whenever possible, the submitter's claim of confidentiality 
shall be supported by a statement or certification by an officer or 
authorized representative of the company that the information in 
question is in fact confidential commercial or financial information and 
that the information has not been disclosed to the public.
    (5) When notice is given to a submitter under this section, the 
Commission shall at the same time provide written notice to the 
requester that it is affording the submitter a reasonable period of time 
within which to object to disclosure and that, therefore, there will be 
a delay in responding to the request because of the overseas location of 
the agency and the time requirements to obtain responses from the 
submitters.
    (d) Opportunity to object to disclosure. (1) The notice required by 
paragraph (b) of this section shall afford a submitter ten (10) working 
days within which to provide the Commission with a detailed statement of 
any objection to disclosure. Such statement must specify all grounds for 
withholding information under any exemption of the Freedom of 
Information Act and, in the case of Exemption 4, must demonstrate why 
the information is contended to be a trade secret or commercial or 
financial information which is considered privileged or confidential and 
capable of causing competitive damage if disclosed. Information provided 
by a submitter pursuant to this paragraph may itself be subject to 
disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.
    (e) Notice of intent to disclose. The Commission will carefully 
consider the submitter's objections to release prior to determining 
whether or not to disclose the information. Whenever the Commission 
decides to disclose information over the objection of the submitter, the 
Commission will forward a written notice to the submitter which shall 
include:
    (1) A statement of the reasons for which the submitter's disclosure 
objections were not sustained;
    (2) A description of the confidential commercial information to be 
disclosed; and,
    (3) A specific disclosure date, which shall be ten (10) working days 
after the notice of the final decision to release the requested 
information has been mailed to the submitter.
    (4) When notice is given to a submitter under this section, the 
Commission will notify the requester that such notice has been given to 
the submitter and the proposed date for disclosure.
    (f) Notice of lawsuit. (1) Whenever a requester brings legal action 
seeking to compel disclosure of information covered by paragraph (c) of 
this section, the Commission shall promptly notify the submitter.
    (2) Whenever a submitter brings legal action seeking to prevent 
disclosure of information covered by paragraph (c) of this section, the 
Commission shall notify the requester.
    (g) Exception to notice requirement. The notice requirements of 
paragraph (c) of this section shall not apply if:
    (1) The Panama Canal Commission determines that the information 
should not be disclosed;
    (2) The information has been published or otherwise officially made 
available to the public;
    (3) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 
U.S.C. 552); or
    (4) The information was acquired in the course of a lawful 
investigation of a possible violation of criminal law.

    As used in this subpart:
    Live birth means the birth of a child who shows evidence of life 
after the child is entirely outside the mother.
    Stillbirth means a birth after 20 weeks of gestation which is not a 
live birth.
    Physician means a person legally authorized to practice medicine 
before October 1, 1979, in the area then known as the Canal Zone.
    Vital statistics includes the registration, preparation, 
transcription and preservation of data pertaining to marriages, births,

<R05>
Sec. 9.33  Functions of the Vital Statistics Unit.

    The Vital Statistics Unit is the keeper of the vital statistics 
records of the Canal Zone Government. Some of the functions previously 
performed by that unit were discontinued on October 1, 1979, when the 
Canal Zone and its civil government ceased to exist. The Vital 
Statistics Unit now performs the residual functions of recordkeeping; 
i.e., it is limited to performing the following:
    (a) Maintaining all vital statistics records of the Canal Zone 
Government.
    (b) Performing the vital statistics functions as defined in 
Sec. 9.31 of this part for those events which occurred in the Canal Zone 
before October 1, 1979, and which were not previously registered in that 
unit. This includes the delayed registration of a birth that occurred 
prior to October 1, 1979.
    (c) The alteration of records which are filed in that unit.
    (d) The issuance of copies of documents filed in that unit.

(Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 and related agreements and Pub. L. 96-70,

<R05>
Sec. 9.34  Supplementary certificate upon adoption.

    Upon receipt of a certified copy of an order or decree of adoption, 
the Vital Statistics Unit shall prepare a supplementary certificate in 
the new name of the adopted person and shall seal and file the original 
certificate of birth with such certified copy attached thereto. The 
sealed documents may be opened only upon the demand of the adopted 
person, if of legal age, or by an order of court. Upon receipt of a 
certified copy of a court order of annulment of the adoption, the 
original certificate shall be restored to its original place in the 
file.


<R05>
Sec. 9.35  New birth certificate upon legitimation.

    In cases of legitimation the Vital Statistics Unit, upon receipt of 
proof thereof, shall prepare a new certificate of birth in the new name 
of the legitimated child. The evidence upon which the new certificate is 
made and the original certificate shall be sealed and filed and may be 
opened only upon the demand of the person involved, if of legal age, or 
by an order of court.

    Cross Reference: Legitimation of child, see 8 P.C.C. 335, 387, 76A 
Stat. 689, 691. See also 7 P.C.C. 576, 76A Stat. 571.


<R05>
Sec. 9.36  Delayed filing of birth certificate.

1, 1979), a certificate of live birth should have been filed with the 
Vital Statistics Unit within five days after the birth by the physician, 
midwife, or other legally authorized person in attendance at the birth 
or, if the birth was not so attended, by one of the parents. If a 
certificate of live birth in the Canal Zone was not filed during that 
time, it may still be possible to file a delayed certificate of birth by 
following the procedure set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) A delayed certificate of live birth may be filed upon the 
submission to, and receipt by, the Vital Statistics Unit of such 
evidence, in the form of affidavits or otherwise, as the Vital 
Statistics Unit deems sufficient to establish satisfactorily the truth 
of the facts alleged in support of the request

[[Page 19]]

for delayed filing. Certificates accepted more than six months after the 
time prescribed for filing in paragraph (a) of this section shall 
contain the date of the delayed filing and shall be marked ``delayed.'' 
A summary statement of the evidence submitted in support of the 
acceptance for delayed filing shall be endorsed on the certificate. Such 
evidence shall be kept in a special permanent file.


<R05>
Sec. 9.37  Altered certificates.

    Certificates of marriage, birth, stillbirth, or death filed in the 
Vital Statistics Unit may be altered upon the submission to, and receipt 
by, the Vital Statistics Unit of such evidence, in the form of 
affidavits or otherwise, as that unit deems sufficient to establish 
satisfactorily the truth of the facts alleged in support of the request 
for alteration. Certificates which are altered after being filed shall 
contain the date of the alteration and shall be marked ``altered.'' A 
summary statement of the evidence submitted in support of the acceptance 
for alteration shall be endorsed on the certificate. Such evidence shall 
be kept in a special permanent file.


<R05>
Sec. 9.38  Certified copies of records.

    Subject to the restrictions contained in Sec. 9.39, a certified copy 
of a certificate on file or any part thereof shall be furnished to any 
applicant upon request. The person designated by the Administrator or by 
the Administrator's designee to act as Vital Statistics Clerk shall be 
the person to certify copies of such certificates or parts thereof. 
Charges shall be made for certified copies of vital statistics records 
at the rate prescribed in the official Panama Canal Commission tariff.


<R05>
Sec. 9.39  Disclosure of records.

    Inspection of a vital statistics record is not permitted, and a 
certified copy of a certificate or part thereof may not be issued, 
unless the Vital Statistics Unit is satisfied that the applicant has a 
direct and legitimate interest in the matter recorded or that the 
information therein contained is necessary for the determination of 
personal or property rights.

    Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a.

    Source: 44 FR 75312, Dec. 19, 1979, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 10.1  Purpose of this part.

    The purpose of this part is to establish Panama Canal Commission 
policies and procedures for implementing the Privacy Act of 1974 (Pub. 
L. 93-579), and particularly the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a.


<R05>
Sec. 10.2  The Privacy Act of 1974.

    The Privacy Act of 1974 (referred to in this part as ``the Privacy 
Act'') is a law which provides safeguards against the invasion of an 
individual's personal privacy. The Privacy Act creates a procedure for 
an individual to request access to or amendment of a record about 
himself or herself that is maintained

[[Page 20]]

by an agency of the United States Government. It also places certain 
restrictions on the disclosure of records containing information about 
an individual to other persons. The rest of the rules in this part:
    (a) Explain how you may request access to or amendment of records 
about yourself that are maintained by the Panama Canal Commission 
(referred to in this part as ``the Commission'' or ``the agency'');
    (b) Explain the conditions under which the Commission may disclose 
information about an individual to others without the individual's 
consent; and
    (c) List the systems of records maintained by the Commission which 
are exempt from certain provisions of the Privacy Act, including the 
provisions for access and amendment.


<R05>
Sec. 10.3  Definitions.

    (a) All terms used in this part which are defined in the Privacy Act 
(5 U.S.C. 552a(a)) shall have the same meanings as they do in that Act.
    (b) Agency Records Officer means the Chief, Administrative Services 
Division, Panama Canal Commission.
    (c) Director of Executive Administration means the Director, Office 
of Executive Administration of the Panama Canal Commission.
    (d) System manager means the official designated in the most recent 
Notice of Systems of Records published in the Federal Register, as 
having responsibility for a given system of records.

[44 FR 75312, Dec. 19, 1979, as amended at 46 FR 48659, Oct. 2, 1981]


<R05>
Sec. 10.4  When this part applies.

    (a) This part applies only to information about individuals that is 
maintained by the Panama Canal Commission in a system of records which 
has been described in a notice published in the Federal Register. This 
means that these regulations apply only to information about an 
individual that can be retrieved from a group of records by the 
individual's name or other personal identifier (such as an employee 
identification number).
    (b) Where another agency (such as the Office of Personnel 
Management) has published a notice describing a system of records that 
is partially under the control of the Panama Canal Commission, the 
Privacy Act regulations of that agency take precedence over the 
regulations in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 10.5  How to make a Privacy Act request.

    (a) You may find it helpful to review the descriptions of Commission 
systems of records, as published in the Federal Register, before you 
make a request. You may review these in the annual compilation of 
``Privacy Act Issuances,'' available at libraries, or, upon request, at 
the Records Management Branch, Administration Building, Balboa Heights, 
Republic of Panama.
    (b) To find out whether a particular system of records contains 
information about you, or to request access to records about yourself, 
you must:
    (1) Write or visit the system manager or the Agency Records Officer. 
The title and address of the system manager are given in the Notice of 
System of Records published in the Federal Register. The office of the 
Agency Records Officer is located in the Administration Building, Balboa 
Heights, Republic of Panama, and that official's mailing address is: 
Panama Canal Commission, Agency Records Officer, Unit 2300, APO AA 
34011-2300 (or Balboa, Republic of Panama).
    (2) Reasonably identify the system of records or the type of 
information, or records, you are interested in. Be as specific as you 
can. If you do not know which system of records is involved, it will be 
helpful if you identify the office where you believe the records may be 
located.
    (3) Adequately identify yourself in accordance with the requirements 
contained in Sec. 10.6 of this part.
    (c) If you make your request in writing, state in your letter that 
you are making a request under the Privacy Act and clearly mark the 
envelope with the words ``Privacy Act Request.'' A request under 5 
U.S.C. 552a which is not properly addressed and is not marked in this 
way shall not be considered to have been received by the agency until it 
has actually been received

[[Page 21]]

by the system manager or the Agency Records Officer.

Sec. 10.6  How to identify yourself.

    (a) If you make your request in person, or if you wish to review 
your records in person, you must identify yourself to the system manager 
or the Agency Records Officer (or to a person designated by one of those 
officials) by showing at least one identification document containing 
your picture (for example, employee identification card, driver's 
license, passport), or at least two identification documents containing 
your signature, or other identification acceptable to the official 
concerned.
    (b) If you make your request in writing, you must supply information 
that will help to verify your identity (for example, signature, employee 
identification number, date and place of birth), and you may also be 
required to provide the certificate of a notary public or other official 
authorized to administer oaths.
    (c) Whether making your request in person or in writing, if you 
cannot identify yourself to the satisfaction of the system manager or 
the Agency Records Officer (or the person designated by one of those 
officials), you may be asked to make and sign a written statement 
asserting your identity and indicating that you understand that 
knowingly and willfully requesting or obtaining access to any record 
about another individual under false pretenses is a misdemeanor 
punishable by a fine of up to $5,000 (5 U.S.C. 552a(i)(3)).


<R05>
Sec. 10.7  How your Privacy Act request will be handled.

    (a) The system manager or the Agency Records Officer will 
acknowledge receipt of your request within ten working days. At the same 
time, or as soon as possible after acknowledging receipt, that official 
will:
    (1) Tell you that a record about you is maintained in the system of 
records you identified and tell how you may review it, or get a copy; or
    (2) Tell you that no record about you is maintained in the system of 
records you identified; or
    (3) Tell you that your inquiry cannot be answered or your request 
cannot or will not be granted because you have not adequately identified 
yourself or the system of records; because the system of records in 
question is exempt from the access provisions of the Privacy Act; or 
because the record or system of records in question is not under the 
control of the Commission.
    (b) When the system manager or the Agency Records Officer makes a 
decision to grant you access to the records you requested, you normally 
may see the records or get copies of them right away. If, for any 
reason, the records cannot be provided immediately, that official will 
arrange with you a mutually acceptable time and place for you to review 
and copy the records. If that official cannot make the records available 
to you within 30 working days of receipt of your request, that official 
will advise you in writing of the reason for the delay.


<R05>
Sec. 10.8  When, where, and under what conditions you may review the records.

    (a) If you want to review your records in person, you will normally 
be required to go during regular working hours to the location specified 
in the Notice of the System of Records or to the office of the Agency 
Records Officer, in the administration Building, Balboa Heights, 
Republic of Panama. If you cannot go in person during regular working 
hours, you should telephone or write the system manager or the Agency 
Records Officer so that appropriate arrangements can be made for you to 
review the records.
    (b) You must identify yourself to the system manager or the Agency 
Records Officer (or to a person designated by one of those officials) in 
accordance with the requirements contained in Sec. 10.6 of this part.
    (c) If you have been told that you may review your records in 
person, you may, upon your request, be accompanied by a person of your 
choosing. You will however, have to provide the system manager with a 
written signed statement authorizing disclosure of the

[[Page 22]]

records about you to that person, and authorizing discussion of your 
records in the presence of that person. 
    (d) You may be shown a copy of a record rather than the original 
record itself when the record is not maintained at, or cannot be 
transferred to, a location which is accessible to you. In that event, 
you will be charged for the copies only if you choose to retain them. If 
copies are made at your request, the agency will charge you the cost of 
making the copies, as stated in Sec. 10.11 of this part.
    (e) No one shall be allowed to inspect original agency records 
except under the immediate supervision of the system manager, or the 
Agency Records Officer, or a person designated by one of those 
officials.


<R05>
Sec. 10.9  Special procedures for medical records.

    (a) If you request medical records about yourself, including 
psychiatric and psychological records, the records will be made 
available to you only after the Director of Health and Safety, or that 
official's designee, determines that release of the records would not be 
likely to have an adverse effect on you. If they are not made available 
to you, upon your written request the medical records which are not 
otherwise exempt from disclosure may be reviewed by a licensed medical 
practitioner designated by you.
    (b) School records of a psychological nature may be shown to the 
student who is the subject of the records or to the parent or guardian 
of the student only if the Director of Health and Safety, or that 
official's designee, determines that the release would not be likely to 
have an adverse effect on the individual who is the subject of the 
records.


<R05>
Sec. 10.10  How to request review of a system manager's denial of access.

    (a) If the system manager denies your request for records, in whole 
or in part, you may ask the Agency Records Officer to review that 
decision. The denial is not considered a final agency decision unless it 
has been reviewed and confirmed in writing by the Agency Records 
Officer.
    (b) To request review of a system manager's denial, you must:
    (1) Write to the Panama Canal Commission, Agency Records Officer, 
Unit 2300, APO AA 34011-2300 (or Balboa, Republic of Panama); and
    (2) State in your letter that you are requesting review of the 
system manager's denial and clearly mark the envelope ``Privacy Act 
Request for Review''; and
    (3) Mail or deliver the request for review within ten working days 
after you receive the system manager's denial.
    (c) Although it is not required, it may be helpful if you state in 
your request for review the reasons why you disagree with the decision 
on your request for access and your reasons for wanting the records.

<R05>
Sec. 10.11  Fees for Privacy Act requests.

    (a) The fees for copies of records made at your request under this 
section will be the same as the fees provided in Sec. 9.11(a) (3), (4), 
(5), (6), (7); (c); and (e) of this title for copies of materials 
provided under the Freedom of Information Act.
    (b) If your request for copies of records or portions of records is 
expected to involve fees of more than $50, the Commission will not treat 
your request as having been received until:
    (1) The Commission has sent you a written notification of the 
estimated fees; and
    (2) You agree in writing to pay at least the estimated fees; and
    (3) You pay part of the estimated fees in advance, if the agency 
requires such a deposit before it will begin to copy the records you 
have requested.


<R05>
Sec. 10.12  How to request amendment of your record under the Privacy Act.

    After you have reviewed your record, you may ask the Commission to 
correct or amend any portion of the record that you believe is not 
accurate, timely, relevant, or complete. To make a request for 
amendment, you must:
    (a) Write to the Panama Canal Commission, Agency Records Officer, 
Unit 2300, APO AA 34011-2300 (or Balboa, Republic of Panama).

[[Page 23]]

    (b) State in your letter that you are requesting amendment of a 
record under the Privacy Act, and clearly mark the envelope ``Privacy 
Act Request for Amendment.'' A request for amendment of a record under 5 
U.S.C. 552a which is not properly addressed and is not marked in this 
way shall not be considered to be received by the Commission until it 
has actually been received by the Agency Records Officer.
    (c) In your letter, identify the system of records involved, if you 
can, and identify the particular record or portion of the record you 
wish to have corrected or amended. If possible, attach a copy of the 
record in question.
    (d) Explain in your letter why you believe the record or portion of 
the record is not accurate, timely, relevant, or complete, and provide 
any evidence available to support your request.
    (e) Include in your letter any other information that may be 
necessary for proper processing of your request.

<R05>
Sec. 10.13  How your Privacy Act request for amendment will be handled.

    (a) The Agency Records Officer (or that official's designee) will 
decide whether your request for amendment of a record should be granted. 
That official (or the designee) will acknowledge receipt of your request 
within ten working days and will either notify you of the decision or 
tell you when you can expect to have the decision. If a decision cannot 
be made within 30 working days of the receipt of your request, the 
Agency Records Officer (or the designee) will advise you in writing of 
the circumstances causing the delay.
    (b) If your request for amendment is granted, in whole or in part:
    (1) The Agency Records Officer (or that official's designee) will 
notify you of this decision;

    (3) Where an accounting of disclosures has been maintained, the 
system manager will advise all previous recipients of the record that 
the correction has been made.
    (c) If your request for amendment is denied, in whole or in part,

    (2) Tell you that you have the right to request further review by 
appealing the decision; and
    (3) Tell you how to make an appeal.


<R05>
Sec. 10.14  How to appeal a refusal to amend a record under the Privacy Act.

    (a) If the Agency Records Officer (or that official's designee) has 
denied your request to amend a record, you may request the Executive 
Secretary to review that decision. This is called ``making an appeal.''
    (b) To make an appeal, you must:
    (1) Write to the Panama Canal Commission, Director, Office of 
Executive Administration, Unit 2300, APO AA 34011-2300 (or Balboa, 
Republic of Panama); and
    (2) State in your letter that you are appealing a denial of a 
request for amendment under the Privacy Act, and clearly mark the 
envelope ``Privacy Act Appeal''; and
    (3) Mail or deliver the letter of appeal within ten working days 
after you receive the initial agency denial.

FR 26123, May 19, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 10.15  How your Privacy Act appeal will be handled.

    (a) The official responsible for deciding whether to grant your 
appeal is the Director of Executive Administration of the Panama Canal 
Commission. The Director of Executive Administration will review the

in whole or in part:
    (1) That official will notify you of the decision;
    (2) The system manager will promptly correct the record; and
    (3) Where an accounting of disclosures has been maintained, the 
system

[[Page 24]]

manager will advise all previous recipients of the record that the

    (c) If the Director of Executive Administration denies your appeal, 
in whole or in part, the letter sent to notify you of this decision 
must:
    (1) Tell you why the appeal is being denied;
    (2) Tell you that this denial of your appeal is a final agency 
decision;
    (3) Tell you that you have the right to file a concise statement of 
your reasons for disagreeing with the decision of the agency; and
    (4) Tell you that you have the right to request a U.S. District 
Court to review this denial of your appeal, as provided by 5 U.S.C. 
552a(g).
    (d) The Administrator of the Panama Canal Commission may extend the 
30-working-day period specified in paragraph (a) of this section for 
good cause shown. In that case, the Agency Records Officer will notify 
you in writing of the reason for the delay and will tell you when you 
can expect a decision on your appeal.
    (e) If you choose to file a concise statement of your reasons for 
disagreeing with the agency's refusal to amend your record:
    (1) The system manager shall cause a notation to be made on the 
disputed portion of the record;
    (2) Copies of your statement of disagreement will be provided to 
anyone to whom the disputed record is subsequently disclosed and (to the 
extent that an accounting of disclosures has been maintained) to any 
previous recipients of the disputed record; and
    (3) The Commission may, at its discretion, make a brief summary of 
its reasons for not amending the record and may provide this summary, 
along with your statement of disagreement, to previous or subsequent 
recipients of the disputed record.

Sec. 10.16  Rights of parents and legal guardians.

    The parent of legal guardian of a minor or the legal guardian of an 
individual who has been declared incompetent may request access to, or 
amendment of, a record on behalf of that individual. To do so, a parent 
will be required to show a certified or authenticated copy of the 
minor's birth certificate, and a legal guardian will be required to show 
a certified or authenticated copy of the court order establishing 
guardianship. In some cases, the parent or legal guardian of a minor may 
be asked to provide evidence that the minor is in the parent's or 
guardian's custody, that the minor has consented to disclosure of the 
information to the parent or guardian, or that the parent or guardian 
has authority to act on the minor's behalf.


<R05>
Sec. 10.17  Conditions under which the Commission may disclose an individual's record to other persons.

    (a) The Commission shall not disclose information about an 
individual that is contained in one of its systems of records to any 
person or to another agency, except by written request of, or with the 
prior written consent of, the individual who is the subject of the 
record, unless the disclosure is authorized by paragraph (b) of this 
section or is required by other applicable law.
    (b) Under 5 U.S.C. 552a, the Commission may disclose information 
contained in its systems of records, without the consent of the

information, or record, would be:
    (1) To the parent or legal guardian of any minor, or to the legal 
guardian of any individual who has been declared to be incompetent by a 
court of competent jurisdiction, where such person is acting on the 
individual's behalf (5 U.S.C. 552a(h));
    (2) To those officers and employees of the Commission who have a 
need for the information in the performance of their duties (5 U.S.C. 
552a(b)(1));
    (3) Required under 5 U.S.C. 552, the Freedom of Information Act (5 
U.S.C. 552a(b)(2));
    (4) For a routine use as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(7) and as 
described for all systems of records in Appendix A of this part and for 
specific systems of records in the Notice of Systems of Records 
published in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(3));
    (5) To the Bureau of the Census for purposes of planning or carrying

    (6) To a recipient who has provided the Commission with advance 
adequate written assurance that the record will be used solely as a 
statistical research or reporting record, and the record is to be 
transferred in a form that is not individually identifiable (5 U.S.C. 
552a(b)(5));
    (7) To the National Archives of the United States as a record which 
has sufficient historical or other value to warrant its continued 
preservation by the United States Government, or for evaluation by the 
Administrator of General Services or that official's designee to 
determine whether the record has such value (5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(6));
    (8) To another agency or to an instrumentality of any governmental 
jurisdiction within or under the control of the United States for a 
civil or criminal law enforcement activity if the activity is authorized 
by law, and if the head of the agency or instrumentality has made a 
written request to the Commission specifying the particular portion 
desired and the law enforcement activity for which the record is sought 
(5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(7));
    (9) To a person pursuant to a showing of compelling circumstances 
affecting the health or safety of an individual, if upon such disclosure 
notification is transmitted to the last known address of such individual 
(5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(8));
    (10) To either House of Congress, or, to the extent of matter within

Sec. 10.18  Accounting of certain disclosures.

    (a) The system manager or his designee shall keep an accurate 
accounting of each disclosure of personal information about an 
individual from a system of records under his control which is made in 
accordance with Sec. 10.17(b) of this part, except if that disclosure is 
to officers and employees of the Commission (Sec. 10.17(b)(2)) or is 
required under the Freedom of Information Act (Sec. 10.17(b)(3)).
    (b) This accounting of disclosure shall include:
    (1) The date, nature, and purpose of each such disclosure; and
    (2) The name and address of the person or agency to whom the 
disclosure is made.
    (c) The system manager shall retain this accounting of disclosure 
for at least five years after the disclosure or for the life of the 
record, whichever is longer.
    (d) The Commission shall make the accounting of disclosure available 
to the individual named in the record, at that individual's request, 
except when the disclosure was made under Sec. 10.17(b)(8) of this part 
or when the record in question is exempt from the access provisions of 
the Privacy Act under Secs. 10.21 and 10.22 of this part. An individual 
may request access to the accounting of disclosure by the procedure for 
requesting access to records that is explained in Secs. 10.5 through 
10.10 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 10.19  Records about deceased persons.

    A record about a deceased person is not covered by the rules in this 
part, except to the extent that the deceased person's record contains 
information about a living individual. In disclosing information about a 
deceased person, the Commission will make every effort to avoid any 
infringement of the privacy rights of a living individual.


<R05>
Sec. 10.20  Penalties for noncompliance with the Act.

    Subsections (g) and (i) of 5 U.S.C. 552a provide civil remedies and 
criminal penalties for noncompliance with the provisions of the Privacy 
Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-579) or regulations implementing that Act. In 
addition, adverse or disciplinary action may be taken against any 
officer or employee who willfully or negligently fails to comply with 
the requirements of the

[[Page 26]]

Privacy Act or the regulations in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 10.21  General exemptions.

    (a) The following systems of records are eligible for exemption 
under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) because each system is maintained by a 
component of the agency, or subcomponent, which performs as its 
principal function the enforcement of criminal laws, and which contains 
investigatory material compiled for criminal law enforcement purposes. 
Accordingly, these systems are exempt from the following sections of 
552a of 5 U.S.C.: (c) (3) and (4); (d); (e) (1), (2) and (3); (e)(4) (G) 
and (H); (e) (5); (e)(8); (f); (g); and (h).
    (1) PCC/GSCP-2, Canal Protection Division Incident Report Files;
    (2) PCC/OIG-1, Investigative Files of the Office of Inspector 
General;
    (3) PCC/OIG-2, Allegation/Complaint Files of the Office of Inspector 
General;
    (4) PCC/OIG-3, Cash Audit Files.
    (b) The systems of records listed below, although no longer actively 
in use, continue to be subject to general exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552a(j)(2) because they were compiled by a component, or subcomponent, 
of the agency which performed as its principal function the enforcement 
of criminal laws, and which contain investigatory material compiled for 
criminal law enforcement purposes. Accordingly, the following systems of 
records are exempt from subsections (c)(3) and (4); (d); (e)(1), (2) and 
(3); (e)(4) (G) and (H); (e)(5); (e)(8); (f); (g); and (h) of 5 U.S.C. 
552a:
    (1) PCC/AEPR-1, Probation and Parole Unit Child Custody Reports;
    (2) PCC/AEPR-2, Presentence and Preparole Investigation Reports;
    (3) PCC/AEPR-3, Probation and Parole Unit Statistical File;
    (4) PCC/GSPL-1, Law Enforcement Case Report File;
    (5) PCC/GSPL-2, Police Headquarters Confidential File;
    (6) PCC/GSPL-3, Detective Confidential Files;
    (7) PCC/GSPL-4, Convict Files;
    (8) PCC/GSPL-6, Police Photo Files;
    (9) PCC/GSPL-7, Fingerprint File;
    (10) PCC/GSPL-10, Master Name File;
    (c) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From (c)(3) because release of an accounting of disclosures to 
an individual who is the subject of an investigation could reveal the 
nature and scope of the investigation and could result in the altering 
or destruction of evidence, improper influencing of witnesses and other 
evasive action that could impede or compromise the investigation.
    (2) From (c)(4) because this subsection is inapplicable to the 
extent that an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d).
    (3) From subsection (d) because access to the records contained in 
these systems would inform the subject of a criminal or civil 
investigation, matter or case of the existence of such, and provide the 
subject with information that might enable him or her to avoid 
detection, apprehension or legal obligations, and present a serious 
impediment to law enforcement and other civil remedies. Amendment of the 
records would impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring 
investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.
    (4) From subsection (e)(1) because it is often impossible to 
determine relevance or necessity of information in the early stages of 
an investigation. The value of such information is a question of 
judgment and timing; what appears relevant and necessary when collected 
may ultimately be evaluated and viewed as irrelevant and unnecessary to 
an investigation. In addition, information may be obtained concerning 
the violation of laws other than those within the scope of its 
jurisdiction. In the interest of effective law enforcement, information 
should be retained because it may aid in establishing patterns of 
unlawful activity and provide leads for other law enforcement agencies. 
Further, in obtaining evidence during an investigation, information may 
be provided which relates to matters incidental to the main purpose of 
the investigation but which may be pertinent to the investigative 
jurisdiction of another agency. Such information cannot readily be 
identified.

[[Page 27]]

    (5) From subsection (e)(2) because in a law enforcement 
investigation it is usually counterproductive to collect information to 
the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject thereof. It is 
not always feasible to rely upon the subject of an investigation as a 
source for information which may implicate him or her in illegal 
activities. In addition, collecting information directly from the 
subject could seriously compromise an investigation by prematurely 
revealing its nature and scope, or could provide the subject with an 
opportunity to conceal criminal activities, or intimidate potential 
sources, in order to avoid apprehension.
    (6) From subsection (e)(3) because providing such notice to the 
subject of an investigation, or to other individual sources, could 
seriously compromise the investigation by prematurely revealing its 
nature and scope, or could inhibit cooperation, or permit the subject to 
evade apprehension.
    (7) From (e)(4) (G) and (H); (f); (g); and (h) because these 
provisions concern an individual's access to records which concern him 
and such access to records in this system would compromise 
investigations, reveal investigatory techniques and confidential 
informants, and invade the privacy of private citizens who provide 
information in connection with a particular investigation.
    (8) From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection of information 
for law enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine what 
information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. With the 
passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may 
acquire new significance as further investigation brings new details to 
light and the accuracy of such information can only be determined in a 
court of law. The restrictions of subsection (e)(5) would restrict the 
ability of trained investigators to exercise their judgment in reporting 
on investigations and impede the development of information necessary 
for effective law enforcement.
    (9) From subsection (e)(8) because the application of this provision 
could prematurely reveal an ongoing criminal investigation to the 
subject of the investigation and could reveal investigative techniques, 
procedures or evidence.

<R05>
Sec. 10.22  Specific exemptions.

any individual is denied any right, privilege or benefit that he would 
otherwise be eligible, as a result of the maintenance of such material, 
such material shall be provided to such individual, except to the extent 
that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a 
source who furnished information to the Government under an express 
promise that the identify of the source would be held in confidence, or 
prior to January 1, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of 
the source would be held in confidence. Accordingly, the following

    (b) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of the accounting of 
disclosures would permit the subject of a criminal investigation and/or 
civil case or matter under investigation, in litigation, or under 
regulatory or administrative review or action to obtain valuable 
information concerning the nature of that investigation, case or matter 
and present a serious impediment to law enforcement or civil legal 
activities.
    (2) From (d); (e)(4) (G) and (H); (f); (g); and (h) because these 
provisions concern an individual's access to records which concern him 
and such access to records in this system would compromise 
investigations, reveal investigatory techniques and confidential 
informants, and invade the privacy of private citizens who provide 
information in connection with a particular investigation.
    (3) From subsection (e)(1) because it is often impossible to 
determine relevancy or necessity of information in the early stages of 
an investigation. The value of such information is a question of 
judgment and timing; what appears relevant and necessary when collected 
may ultimately be evaluated and viewed as irrelevant and unnecessary to 
an investigation. In addition, information may be obtained concerning 
the violation of laws other than those within the scope of its 
jurisdiction. In the interest of effective law enforcement, this 
information should be retained because it may aid in establishing 
patterns of unlawful activity and provide leads for other law 
enforcement agencies. Further, in obtaining evidence during an 
investigation, information may be provided which relates to matters 
incidental to the main purpose of the investigation but which may be 
pertinent to the investigative jurisdiction of another agency. Such 
information cannot readily be identified.
    (c) The following systems of records are eligible for exemption 
under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) because they contain investigatory material 
compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility 
or qualifications for Federal civilian employment, military service, 
Federal contracts, or access to classified information, but only to the 
extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of 
a source who furnished information to the Government under an express 
promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, 
prior to January 1, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of 
the source would be held in confidence. Accordingly, these systems of 
records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and (d).
    (1) PCC/FMAC-1, Embezzlements, Burglaries, and Cash Shortages;
    (2) PCC/PB-2, Appeals, Grievances, Complaints and Assistance 
Records;
    (3) PCC/PB-3, Personnel Investigation Records;
    (4) PCC/PR-5, Recruiting and Placement Records;
    (5) PCC/PR-7, Personnel Reference Unit Files.
    (6) PCC/OIG-1, Investigative Files of the Office of Inspector 
General;
    (7) PCC/OIG-2, Allegation/Complaint Files of the Office of Inspector 
General;
    (8) PCC/OIG-3, Cash Audit Files.
    (d) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From (c)(3) because release of an accounting of disclosure to an 
individual who is the subject of an investigation could compromise the 
investigation.
    (2) From (d) because access to or amendment of records in these 
systems would reveal the identity(ies) of the source(s) of information 
collected in the course of a background investigation. Such knowledge 
might violate the explicit or implicit promise of confidentiality made 
to the source during the investigation or constitute an unwarranted 
invasion of the personal privacy of third parties, or reveal sensitive 
investigative techniques and procedures. Such breaches could restrict

[[Page 29]]

the free flow of information vital to a determination of a candidate's 
qualifications and suitability.
    (e) The following systems of records are eligible for exemption 
under 5 U.S.C. 552a (k)(6) because they contain testing or examination 
material used solely to determine individual qualifications for 
appointment or promotion in the Federal service, the disclosure of which 
would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the testing or 
examination process. Accordingly, these systems of records are exempt 
from 5 U.S.C. 552a(d).
    (1) PCC/CZG/BRAE-1, Canal Zone Board of Registration for Architects 
and Professional Engineers Reference Files;
    (2) PCC/MRBL-1, Marine License Files;
    (3) PCC/MRNA-1, Admeasurer Examination File;
    (f) Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) The exemption from (d) is justified because portions of records 
in these systems relate to testing or examining materials and are used 
solely to determine individual qualifications for appointment or 
promotion in the Federal service. Access to or amendment of this 
information would compromise the objectivity and fairness of the testing 
or examining process.
    (2) [Reserved]

the Panama Canal Company or Canal Zone Government by reason of a

[[Page 34]]

Code, except for those which are specifically excepted and covered in

<R05>
Sec. 251.23  Manual category.

    (a) Those manual-type occupational groupings that elsewhere in the 
Federal government are usually covered by the Federal Wage System, i.e., 
those that encompass the unskilled, semi-skilled, and skilled manual-
labor occupations in the trades, crafts, and related employment. This 
category does not include those positions that are specifically excepted 
and placed in the special category.
    (b) The PAPB shall prescribe standards for grading manual category 
jobs. Whenever a job-grading standard under the Federal Wage System is 
utilized, the PAPB shall modify it if necessary to take into account any 
significant differences in knowledge, skill, or responsibility 
requirements that are found between the job covered by the Federal Wage 
System standard and the Canal Area position to which it is applied.


<R05>
Sec. 251.24  Special category.

    Those occupational groupings which are excepted from the Non-Manual 
and Manual categories, and whose bases have been traditionally or by 
statute evaluated, classified, and titled by reference to applicable 
Government or industry standards for the same or similar work.


<R05>
Sec. 251.25  Basic compensation.

    (a) For employees not entitled to the differential prescribed by 
Sec. 251.31 or the additional remuneration prescribed by Sec. 251.32, 
the rates of pay shall be the base salary or wage rates prescribed by 
Sec. 251.13. For employees who are entitled to the differential 
prescribed by Sec. 251.31 or the additional remuneration prescribed by 
Sec. 251.32, the rates of pay shall be the base salary or wage rate plus 
the applicable differential or additional remuneration. The aggregate 
pay thus derived shall be considered basic compensation.
    (b) An employee shall not be paid, except as provided in paragraph 
(c) of this section, basic compensation as defined in paragraph (a) of 
this section at a rate in excess of the rate of basic pay payable for 
Level V of the Executive Schedule.
    (c) The Deputy Administrator and the Chief Engineer of the Panama 
Canal Commission shall not be paid basic compensation as defined in 
paragraph (a) of this section at a rate in excess of the rate of basic 
pay payable for level IV of the Executive Schedule.

    (a) An overseas tropical differential for an employee in the 
category established by Sec. 251.12(b)(1) who is a United States citizen 
employee and who qualifies under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this 
section, shall be fixed by the head of each agency in an amount equal to 
15 percent of the applicable base wage or salary established under 
Sec. 251.13.

the alternate is unable to serve for any reason.
    (e) The Panama Area Personnel Board will provide administrative and 
logistical support necessary to accomplish Board functions.

Sec. 253.12  Decisions of the Board.

    (a) Decisions of the Board on any question or other matter relating 
to an appeal shall be made by majority vote of its members.
    (b) Decisions of the Board are final and conclusive and the agency

<R05>
Sec. 253.13  Classification appeals.

    (a) Any employee may request at any time that his employing agency 
review and revise or adjust the classification, grade, and pay level of 
his position, or any of them, as the case may be. Such requests for 
review and revision or adjustment shall be submitted and adjudicated in 
accordance with the regularly established procedures of the employing 
agency.
    (b) In the event of adverse classification decision by the employing 
agency, an employee shall have the right to appeal, in writing, to the 
Panama Canal Board of Appeals.


<R05>
Sec. 253.14  Terms of members.

    The term of service for each member or alternate member of the 
Panama Canal Board of Appeals shall be for 2 years, provided that the 
Assistant Secretary of the Army may, in his discretion, terminate or 
extend the term of service of any member or alternate member at any 
time. Individuals who are designated as members or alternate members 
shall be detailed to the Panama Canal Board of Appeals for such periods 
as their services are required.

[[Page 42]]

Any hearings on employee appeals will be heard in the Republic of 
Panama.


<R05>
Sec. 253.15  Appeals procedures.

    The Panama Canal Board of Appeals shall formulate the procedures 
necessary to the performance of the functions prescribed by section 1222 
of the Panama Canal Act. Those portions of the procedures establishing 
time limits for filing appeals, the form in which appeals are to be 
submitted, and the circumstances under which the personal appearance of 
an employee or his representative will be authorized, shall be published 
for the information of all employees.


<R05>
Sec. 253.16  Effective date of decisions.

    (a) Decisions of the Panama Canal Board of Appeals shall be binding 
upon all employing agencies, and shall be effective not later than the 
beginning of the fourth pay period following the receipt of the decision 
in the employing agency unless a specific date is stated in the decision 
in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) When the appeal to the Panama Canal Board of Appeals is made 
within 30 calendar days from the date of an employee's receipt of an 
adverse decision from his employing agency on a classification appeal 
provided by Sec. 253.13, if it is from an action lowering the grade or 
pay level of the employee's position, and the decision of the Panama 
Canal Board of Appeals raises the grade or pay level of the position, 
the effective date shall be retroactive to the date of the action which 
lowered the grade or pay level. However, when the decision of the Panama 
Canal Board of Appeals raises the grade or pay level of the position 
above the grade or pay level in effect immediately preceding the 
lowering thereof, retroactivity will apply only to the extent of 
restoration to the grade or pay level in effect immediately preceding 
the lowering thereof. Retroactivity may be based only on duties and 
responsibilities existing at the time of the lowering of the grade or 
pay level and not on the basis of duties and responsibilities later 
assigned.
    (c) The right to a retroactive effective date under paragraph (b) of 
this section may be preserved in the discretion of the Panama Canal 
Board of Appeals upon a showing by the employee that reasons beyond his 
control prevented him from appealing within the 30-day period referred 
to in that subparagraph and that he did appeal as promptly as 
circumstances permitted.

only on the basis of intentional false statements or deception or fraud 
in examination or appointment.


<R05>
Sec. 253.36  Prohibited practices.

    (a) Coercion in competition. An applicant for competitive 
examination, eligible on any register, or officer or employee in the 
executive branch of the Government may not directly or indirectly 
persuade, induce, or coerce, or attempt to persuade, induce, or coerce 
any prospective applicant to withhold filing application, or any 
applicant or eligible to withdraw from competition or eligibility for 
the purpose of either improving or injuring the prospects of any 
applicant or eligible for appointment. The penalty for violation of this 
section by applicants or eligibles shall be cancellation of application 
or eligibility, as the case may be. The penalty for violation of this 
section by an employee shall be as determined by the head of the agency.
    (b) Instruction of applicants. Employees are forbidden to instruct, 
either directly or indirectly, or to be concerned in any manner with the 
instruction of any person or classes of persons with a view to their

<R05>
Sec. 253.37  Examinations.

    The Manager, CEO shall be responsible for conducting open

of eligible Panamanians.
    (b) In rating competitors, CEO shall, in the case of veteran's 
preference eligibles, provide for waiver of the physical standards and 
requirements in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3312.

Sec. 253.39  Establishment of registers of eligibles.

    The names of eligibles (those competitors who meet minimum 
requirements and are rated as attaining the minimum required rating) 
shall be entered on appropriate registers in the order outlined below. 
In the judgment of CEO, eligibility on registers may be established on 
the basis of earned eligible ratings attained in appropriate 
examinations for positions in the competitive service.
    (a) According to their ratings (including veteran preference and 
Panamanian preference).
    (b) An individual entitled to veteran preference shall be entered 
ahead of all others having the same rating.
    (c) All veterans who have a compensable service-connected disability 
of 10 percent or more shall be entered at the top of the register in the 
order of their ratings, except for professional and scientific positions 
comparable in pay level to positions in grades Non-Manual 9 and above.
    (d) When establishing registers, or making certifications therefrom, 
CEO will provide for priority consideration for career and career-
conditional employees of agencies operating in the Republic of Panama 
who have been separated by reduction in force. However, such priority 
consideration shall not extend to any position which is in a pay level 
higher than that from which the employee was separated. Any benefits 
conferred pursuant to this section are in addition to those conferred by 
entry of the employee's name on the employing activity's reemployment 
priority list.
    (e) CEO will take appropriate action to insure that veterans of, or 
persons serving in, the Armed Forces of the United States, receive the 
same consideration in examinations and entry upon registers as are 
provided for the competitive service by 5 CFR 332.311, 332.312, 332.313, 
332.321, 332.322.
    (f) CEO will establish appropriate time periods and procedures for 
terminating the eligibility of individuals on a register.


<R05>
Sec. 253.40  Certificate for appointment.

    (a) Upon receipt of a request for certification of eligibles, a 
sufficient number of names to permit the appointing officer to consider 
three eligibles in connection with each vacancy shall be certified from 
the top of the appropriate register. Certificates may contain fewer than 
three names, if fewer than three eligibles are available and the 
requesting agency consents to issuance of such a certificate.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) If the number of eligibles on the register is insufficient, CEO, 
in consultation with the employing agency, will determine whether 
selective certification is to be made from another register, whether a 
recruiting campaign to attract applicants for examination should be 
initiated, or whether examining action is to be taken in accordance with 
Sec. 253.37 or a temporary appointment authorized in accordance with 
Sec. 253.43.
    (d) When there is no register appropriate as a whole for 
certification for filling a particular position, there may be certified 
selectively from the most nearly appropriate existing register the names 
of eligibles who are qualified for the particular position. Such 
eligibles shall be certified in the order of their ranking. Eligibles on 
the register may, when appropriate, be rerated on the basis of the 
particular requirements of the position.
    (e) Certification shall be made without regard to sex, unless the 
appointing officer requests and justifies referral of eligibles of a 
specified sex.
    (f) Certification must be limited to eligibles residing in the 
Republic of Panama except when persons possessing the requisite skills 
and qualifications are not found in the Republic of Panama.


<R05>
Sec. 253.41  Selection from certificates.

    Selections from certificates are made by application of either the 
rule of three or the rule of ten.

[[Page 45]]

    (a) Rule of three. When selecting from a certificate of eligibles, 
an appointing official shall, with sole reference to merit and fitness, 
make the selection for the first vacancy from the highest three 
eligibles available for appointment on the certificate. For the second 
vacancy, the selecting official must make selection from the three 
highest eligibles remaining on the certificate. Each succeeding vacancy 
must be filled in like manner subject to the rules in Sec. 253.40. The 
rule of three applies to selections involving:
    (1) All United States Wage Base positions except those of 
apprentice, floating equipment trainees at the grade FE-5 and FE-7 
levels and marine engineer trainees at the grade ME-7 level; and
    (2) United States citizens.
    (b) Rule of ten. When selecting from a certificate of eligibles, an 
appointing official shall, with sole reference to merit and fitness, 
make the selection for the first vacancy from the highest ten eligibles 
available for appointment on the certificate. For the second vacancy, 
the selecting official must make selection from the ten highest 
eligibles remaining on the certificate. Each succeeding vacancy must be 
filled in like manner subject to the rules in Sec. 253.40. The rule of 
ten applies to selections involving:
    (1) All Canal Area Wage Base positions filled from pre-rated 
inventories which includes the positions of firefighter and firefighter 
trainee, and
    (2) United States Wage Base positions of apprentice, floating 
equipment trainees at the grade FE-5 and FE-7 levels and marine engineer 
trainees at the grade ME-7 level.
    The rule of ten shall not be applied in any situation where a United 
States applicant is among the top three candidates available.
    (c) An appointing officer is not required to consider any eligible:
    (1) Who has been considered for three or ten separate appointments, 
as applicable, from the same or different certificates for the same 
position, or
    (2) To whose certification for the particular position the officer 
makes an objection that is sustained by the CEO for any of the reasons 
stated in Sec. 253.34 or for other reasons considered by the CEO to be 
disqualifying for the particular position. The length of a non-
Panamanian candidate's previous service or residence in foreign areas 
may be a valid qualification and selection factor in filling positions 
in an agency having an established policy for periodic rotation of non-
Panamanian citizens.
    (d) When an appointing officer passes over a veteran-preference 
eligible and tentatively selects a non-preference eligible, the 
provisions of 5 CFR 332.406 apply except that the CEO shall exercise the 
authority vested in the Office of Personnel Management.

[56 FR 1924, Jan. 18, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 253.42  Appointments from registers.

    (a) Except as provided by paragraph (d) of this section, a ``Canal 
Area Career-Conditional Appointment'' shall be given to an eligible 
selected from a register for other than temporary or term appointment.
    (b) Upon completion by the appointee of 3 years of creditable 
service, his career-conditional appointment shall be automatically 
converted to a ``Canal Area Career Appointment.'' As used in this 
paragraph, ``creditable service'' means all substantially continuous 
service with the Federal Government since initial non-temporary civilian 
appointment, including any service in the competitive or excepted 
service, or intervening service in the legislative or judicial branches 
or in the Armed Forces of the United States. A break in service of 30 
days or less shall be considered substantially continuous service. 
Breaks in service of more than 30 days shall not be considered 
substantially continuous service unless the head of the agency excepts 
particular types of cases from this requirement. In making such 
exceptions, the agency will be guided by the instructions published for 
the competitive service in the Federal Personnel Manual.
    (c) An eligible given a Canal Area Career-Conditional Appointment 
shall be required to serve a probationary period of 1 year. Prior 
Federal service may be counted toward completion of the probationary 
period as provided in the Federal Personnel Manual. The employing agency 
shall utilize the probationary period as fully as possible to

[[Page 46]]

determine the fitness of the employee and shall terminate his services 
during such period if he fails to demonstrate fully his qualifications 
for continued employment. The employee shall automatically acquire a 
merit status upon satisfactory completion of probation.
    (d) An eligible selected from a register for other than a temporary 
or term appointment shall be given a Canal Area Career Appointment if:
    (1) He is a Federal employee serving under a career appointment in 
the competitive service, a permanent appointment in the excepted 
service, or a Canal Area Career Appointment;
    (2) He is a former Federal employee who once met the service 
requirement for a career appointment in the competitive service, a 
permanent appointment in the excepted service, a Canal Zone Career 
Appointment, or a Canal Area Career Appointment.
    (e) An eligible selected from a register for career appointment 
shall be required to serve a probationary period, subject to the same 
conditions as apply to a career-conditional appointment.


<R05>
Sec. 253.43  Temporary and term appointments.

    (a) An agency may make temporary limited appointments for periods 
not in excess of 1 year, and term appointments for periods of more than 
1, but not in excess of 4 years. In making such appointments, the agency 
will be guided by the instructions published for the competitive service 
in the Federal Personnel Manual. A person so appointed shall not acquire 
merit status by reason of such appointment.
    (b) Term employees are required to serve a 1-year trial period, 
during which they shall be entitled to the same limited protection as is 
accorded probationers under the Panama Canal Employment System. In 
adverse actions, term employees are entitled to the rights accorded 
career and career-conditional employees under the Panama Canal 
Employment System except while they are serving the 1-year trial period 
and when the term appointment has expired.


<R05>
Sec. 253.44  Noncompetitive appointments.

    (a) Appointing officers may noncompetitively appoint a current 
Federal employee who has a merit status, a competitive status, or who is 
serving probation at the time of appointment. Appointing officers may 
noncompetitively reappoint a former Federal employee who has a merit 
status, a competitive status, or who was serving probation at the time 
of separation. Eligibility for such reappointment will be subject to the 
following conditions:
    (1) Former Federal employees who have never completed the service 
requirement for Canal Zone or Canal Area career appointment or for 
career appointment in the competitive service may be reappointed only 
within 3 years following the date of their separation, except that 
periods of temporary employment shall serve to extend the three-year 
period. This time limit does not apply to former employees entitled to 
veteran preference.
    (2) Former employees who have once completed the service requirement 
for Canal Zone or Canal Area career appointment or for career 
appointment in the competitive service may be reappointed without time 
limitation.
    (b) Appointing officers may noncompetitively appoint an individual 
who is certified by the Director of ACTION as having served 
satisfactorily as a Volunteer or Volunteer Leader under the Peace Corps 
Act, or as a VISTA volunteer under the Economic Opportunity Act. Such 
appointments shall be made in accordance with the procedures and 
regulations in effect for the appointment of such persons to positions 
in the competitive service.
    (c) A Student Trainee who has successfully completed his cooperative 
work-study program may be appointed noncompetitively to a position at 
grade 5 or grade 7 in the applicable Non-Manual schedule for which he 
meets the qualification requirements, with the exception of any written 
test requirements, in the field of work in which he received his 
training, provided:
    (1) He has successfully completed all the requirements for a 
bachelor's degree, including any specialized courses required for the 
particular position for which he has been in training;

[[Page 47]]

    (2) He has completed at least 6 months work experience (i.e., 6 
months in a pay status) as a Student Trainee in the agency that 
recommends his appointment; and
    (3) His employing agency recommends him for noncompetitive 
appointment within 90 days after completion of his work-study program.
    (d) Employees appointed to positions excluded from this subpart 
pursuant to Sec. 253.8(c)(5) may have their appointments converted to 
career or career-conditional appointments in accordance with regulations 
prescribed by the PAPB. Such regulations shall generally conform to the 
regulations of the Office of Personnel Management for conversion of 
excepted service appointments of physically or mentally handicapped 
persons to career or career-conditional appointments.
    (e) A Professional and Administrative Career Intern Program 
participant who has successfully completed at least one year of the 
prescribed training may be noncompetitively appointed to a position at 
non-manual grades 7 and above for which he/she meets the qualification 
requirements.

The appointment shall be automatically converted to a Canal Area Career 
Appointment upon completion of the service requirement. A merit status 
shall be acquired upon satisfactory completion of any required

reassign, or transfer employees who are serving under Canal Area Career 
or Career-Conditional Appointments, subject to the provisions of this 
section and in accordance with the appropriate qualification standards 
established by the PAPB for the position. Such actions will be based 
solely on the merit of the employee and upon his qualifications and 
fitness to hold the positions concerned. Such actions for employees 
serving under temporary or term appointments will be subject to such 
regulations as the agency may prescribe.

In preparing such regulations the agency will be guided by the 
instructions published for the competitive service in the Federal 
Personnel Manual.

    (b) The head of each agency shall establish a policy of periodic 
rotation in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section and other 
applicable law. Such policy may except positions from rotation for sound 
administrative reasons. This section shall not preclude an agency other 
than the Commission from adopting a policy of periodic rotation of 
employees pursuant to other authority.
    (c) Notwithstanding any Canal Area Career or Career-Conditional 
Appointment or acquisition of merit status, an employee may, in 
accordance with an agency's rotation policy, be removed from service

<R05>
Sec. 253.71  Eligibility.

    Incumbents of positions made subject to Subpart B of this part by 
revocation of an exclusion in Sec. 253.8 or by other action, may be 
retained in their positions. Each retained incumbent without a personal 
or competitive status who is serving in a continuing position under a 
non-temporary appointment will become eligible for conversion to a Canal 
Area Career or Career-Conditional Appointment provided:
    (a) He rendered 6 months satisfactory service in the position 
immediately prior to its inclusion under Subpart B of this part. Periods 
to be counted toward the 6-month period as an exception to the

<R05>
Sec. 253.72  Procedure.

    The employing agency shall recommend to the PAPB that the 
appointment of an eligible employee be converted. The recommendation 
shall be submitted not later than one year after the date that the

approval by the PAPB, the conversion is effective as of the date of the 
employing agency's recommendation. Notice of the PAPB's decision 
together with the reasons therefor shall be given in writing to the 
agency and employee concerned and be made a part of the employee's 
official personnel folder.

[[Page 49]]


<R05>
Sec. 253.73  Tenure.

    (a) Preservation of tenure. Neither a conversion action, nor a 
recommendation for conversion, shall serve to reduce an employee's 
retention standing for reduction-in-force purposes.
    (b) Tenure following recommendation. Upon submission of a 
recommendation for conversion, the nominee's retention standing for 
reduction in force is in Retention Group I if he is already in that 
group or if he meets the service requirement for a Canal Area Career 
Appointment; otherwise, his retention standing is in Tenure Group II.
    (1) An employee reverts to his previous tenure group if the 
recommendation is returned without final action, and remains in this 
group until such time as the recommendation is resubmitted.
    (2) Irrespective of his previous retention standing, an employee is

Sec. 256.1  Collection of debts by offset; scope of regulations.

    (a) If it is determined that an employee of the United States is 
indebted to the Panama Canal Commission, the employee's pay may be 
offset to satisfy that indebtedeness under the procedures set forth in 
this part.
    (b) Debts owed by Commission employees to other agencies of the 
United States may be recovered by offset against the employee's pay in 
accordance with Sec. 256.13. Similar provision in the regulations of 
other agencies permit the Commission to recover by offset debts owed to 
the Commission by the employee of another agency, if the Commission 
first complies with the provisions of Secs. 256.1 through 256.12 of this 
part.
    (c) An offset against pay shall be carried out in accordance with 
the standards established under the Federal Claims Collection Act of 
1966, as amended (31 U.S.C. 3701 et seq.).
    (d) The regulations in this part do not apply to, and do not impair 
the United States' authority with regard to, the collection of a debt, 
by offset or by other means, if the debt is owed to the United States by 
a Federal employee and the debt arose under the Internal Revenue Code of 
1954 as amended (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), or in any other circumstances in 
which collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly provided by 
Federal statute, such as the collection authority granted the Commission 
pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 3645.
    (e) These regulations do not preclude an employee from questioning 
the amount or validity of a debt by submitting a claim to the General 
Accounting Office, but the Commission need not suspend the collection of 
the debt because of the filing of such a claim.
    (f) These regulations do not preclude the compromise, suspension or 
termination of collection actions where appropriate under the standards 
set forth at 4 CFR 101.1 et seq.
    (g) An employee's involuntary payment of all or any portion of an 
alleged debt being collected pursuant to this part shall not be 
construed as a waiver of any rights which the employee may have under 
this subpart or any other provision of law, except as otherwise provided 
by law.
    (h) Amounts paid or deducted pursuant to this subpart shall be 
promptly refunded to an employee if the debt is waived or otherwise 
found not owing to the United States or if the Commission is directed by 
a competent judicial or administrative authority to refund amounts 
deducted from an employee's current pay.
    (i) The procedures in this part and the collection of debts by the 
Panama Canal Commission shall be carried out by the Chief Financial 
Officer.
    (j) The Commission will not initiate salary offset to collect a debt 
under this subpart more than ten years after the Government's right to 
collect the debt first accrued, unless facts material to the 
Government's right to collect the debt were not known and could not 
reasonably have been known by the official or officials of the 
Government who are charged with discovering and collecting the debt in 
question.

<R05>
Sec. 256.3  Pay subject to offset.

    (a) An offset from an employee's pay from the Commission may not 
exceed 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay, unless the employee 
agree in writing to a larger offset.
    (b) If collection in one lump-sum payment would exceed 15 percent of 
the employee's disposable pay, an offset shall be made biweekly or at 
officially established pay intervals from the employee's current pay 
account. Whenever possible, the installment payments shall be sufficient 
in size to liquidate the debt during a period not greater than the 
anticipated period of active duty or employment of the debtor employee.
    (c) If an employee retires, resigns, or is discharged, or if his 
employment period or period of active duty otherwise ends before 
collection of the debt is completed, an offset may be made from 
subsequent payments of any nature (e.g., final salary payment, lump-sum 
leave, etc.) due the individual from the employing agency, to the extent 
necessary to liquidate the debt. If the final payment due the employee 
is insufficient to satisfy the debt, the creditor agency shall take 
steps necessary to provide for payment of the debt by administrative 
offset from payments of any kind due the former employee from the United 
States pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716. (See 4 CFR 102.4)


<R05>
Sec. 256.4  Advance notice of debt; request for records; submission of information.

    (a) Before initiating an offset proceeding, the Chief Financial 
Officer of the Panama Canal Commission will establish an individual

proceeding and notify the employee--
    (1) That he has determined that the employee is indebted to the 
United States in a specific amount as the result of a debt due and owing 
to the Panama Canal Commission;
    (2) That he intends to satisfy that indebtedness by offsetting 15 
percent of the employee's disposable pay unless the employee can 
demonstrate that he is not indebted to the United States or that the 
proposed offset schedule would produce an extreme financial hardship, as 
defined in Sec. 256.12 of this part;
    (3) If the applicable law includes a provision requiring waiver of 
debts in certain circumstances, notice of the waiver provision, 
including a description of the conditions under which a waiver must be 
granted, notice that the employee has an opportunity to request such a 
waiver, and instructions on how to apply for a waiver; and
    (4) The options available to him and time limits within which 
submission of additional information or documents must be made.
    (b)(1) An employee who has been notified of the Chief Financial 
Officer's determination of the existence and amount of the debt and the 
proposed offset schedule, may submit to him a request--

[[Page 54]]

    (i) Not later than 10 days from the date the employee receives the 
notice, for a copy of the records in the possession of the agency 
relating to the debt,
    (ii) Within the time specified in paragraph (c) of this section, 
that he reconsider his determination of the existence or amount of the 
debt,
    (iii) Within the time set forth in paragraph (c) fo this section, 
that he reconsider the proposed offset schedule, on the basis that it 
would produce an extreme financial hardship for the employee, and
    (iv) Within the time set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, 
that he consider a request for waiver of the debt, if a waiver provision 
is applicable to the debt.
    (2) If the employee requests a reconsideration of the determination 
of the existence or amount of the debt, the employee shall submit a 
statement, with supporting documents, indicating why the employee 
believes he is not so indebted.
    (3) If the employee requests a reconsideration of the proposed 
offset schedule, the employee shall file an alternative proposed offset 
schedule and a statement, with supporting documents, showing why the 
schedule proposed by the agency would produce an extreme financial 
hardship for the employee. The supporting documents must show, for the 
employee and his spouse and legal dependents, for the one-year period 
preceding the receipt of the notice and for the repayment period 
proposed by the employee in his or her offset schedule, the--
    (i) Income from all sources,
    (ii) Assets,
    (iii) Liabilities,
    (iv) Number of legal dependents,
    (v) Expenses for food, housing, clothing, and transportation,
    (vi) Medical expenses, and
    (vii) Exceptional expenses, if any.
    (c) An employee who requests a reconsideration of the existence or 
amount of the debt, or the proposed offset schedule, shall submit his 
statement, with supporting documents, to the Chief Financial Officer no 
later than--
    (1) Forty-five days from the date the employee receives the notice 
of the debt, if he does not make a timely request for records under 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section; or
    (2) Forty-five days from the date the employee receives the records, 
if a timely request for records was made.
    (d) If the employee submits a timely request for reconsideration 
under paragraph (b) of this section, together with the required 
documents, the Chief Financial Officer will reconsider whether the 
employee is indebted to the United States, the amount that the employee 
owes, or whether the proposed offset schedule is appropriate.
    (e) If the employee files a timely request for waiver of the debt, 
the Chief Financial Officer will consider that request. If the employee 
files a request for waiver that is not timely, the request will be 
considered if he establishes that his failure to file within the time 
prescribed was because of circumstances beyond his control or because he 
did not receive the notice of the time limit and was not otherwise aware 
of it.
    (f) The Chief Financial Officer's decision on the employee's request 
for reconsideration will be based on agency records and the material 
submitted by the employee. He shall promptly notify the employee of his 
decision concerning the existence and amount of the debt and the 
appropriateness of the employee's proposed alternative offset schedule.
    (g) If the Chief Financial Officer determines that the employee is 
indebted to the United States, he will include in the notice to the 
employee the following matters:
    (1) A statement of the reasons for the decision regarding the 
indebtedness, including, if applicable, the reasons for any reduction of 
the amount of the indebtedness; and
    (2) The notice described in Sec. 256.5.
    (h) If the Chief Financial Officer determines that his original 
offset schedule, or a modified schedule (other than the one proposed by 
the employee) will not impose an extreme financial hardship on the 
employee, he will include in the notice to the employee--
    (1) A statement of the reasons for his conclusion that his original 
or modified offset schedule will not impose an extreme financial 
hardship, and
    (2) The notice described in Sec. 256.6.

    (1) A proposed alternative offset schedule;
    (2) A statement of the reasons why the proposed offset against

Sec. 256.6, the Commission will select the time, date, and location for 
the hearing. A hearing will be granted on a request for a waiver only if 
such waiver is provided for by law and if the request, in the judgment 
of the Chief Financial Officer, raises issues of veracity or credibility 
of the employee. To the extent feasible, the Commission will select a 
date and location that is convenient for the employee.
    (b) For an employee who resides on the Isthmus of Panama, the 
hearing will be held in Panama. Hearings may be scheduled in New Orleans

appear at the time fixed for a hearing, or fails to file the required 
submissions under Sec. 256.6 within five days after the filing date 
established under that section.
    (b) The hearing official may excuse the employee's failure to meet 
any of

[[Page 57]]

the foregoing requirements if the employee shows that he exercised due 
diligence and that there is good cause for his failure to meet the 
requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 256.9  Hearing procedures.

    (a) The hearing will be conducted by a hearing official who is not 
an employee of the Commission or otherwise under its supervision or 
control, except that hearings on waivers may be conducted by an employee 
of the Commission.
    (b) The hearing official shall prepare a summary record of the 
hearing, which will be maintained by the Commission as a part of the 
record of the offset procedures; however, no transcript of the hearing 
shall be made.
    (c) The hearing shall not be conducted in accordance with formal 
rules of evidence with regard to the admissibility or use of evidence, 
except that the hearing official shall limit the evidence to testimony 
and documents which are relevant to the issues being considered.
    (d) At the hearing, the employee and the Commission may introduce 
evidence and may call witnesses, consistent with the provisions of 
paragraph (c) of this section. Witnesses shall testify under oath and 
are subject to cross-examination.
    (e) If the matter being contested is the existence or amount of a 
debt, the hearing official shall issue a decision upholding the 
Commission determination, unless the hearing official finds that the 
Commission determination was clearly erroneous.
    (f) If the hearing official finds that the Commission's 
determination of the amount of the debt was clearly erroneous, he shall 
determine the amount owed by the employee, if any.
    (g) If the matter being contested is the Commission's proposed 
offset schedule, the hearing official shall uphold that schedule unless 
the employee has demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that the 
payments called for under that schedule would result in an extreme 
financial hardship for the employee.
    (h) If the matter being contested is the credibility or veracity of 
the employee in connection with his request for a waiver, the hearing 
official shall make a determination as to the employee's credibility or 
veracity.
    (i) If the hearing official finds that the payments called for under 
the Chief Financial Officer's proposed offset schedule will produce an 
extreme financial hardship for the employee, the hearing official shall 
establish an offset schedule that will result in the repayment of the 
debt in the shortest period of time which will not result in an extreme 
financial hardship for the employee.
    (j) The hearing official shall issue a written opinion setting forth 
his decision and a statement of the reasons supporting it as soon as 
practicable, but not more than 60 days after the filing of the petition 
requesting the hearing, unless the hearing official has granted a delay 
in the proceedings at the request of the employee. The opinion shall 
contain his determinations as to the existence and amount of the debt, 
the origin of the debt, and, if a request for a waiver has been made, 
the employee's veracity or credibility.
    (k) If the employee files a petition for a hearing in connection 
with a request for a waiver under a statute requiring a waiver and meets 
the time limits for filing material prior to the hearing, no deductions 
to effect the offset will be made until the employee has been provided a 
hearing and a final written decision has been issued.

    (a) The hearing official may not find that the Commission's 
determination of the existence or amount of the employee's debt was 
erroneous--
    (1) On the basis of State or local statutes of limitations;
    (2) On the basis that the employee is owed monies by the United 
States (other than regular salary) and that payment of that debt by the 
United States would eliminate or reduce the debt, unless the employee 
has, not later than 45 days after receipt of advance notice of the debt 
under Sec. 256.4, submitted written confirmation by the

[[Page 58]]

agency which is indebted to the employee that such money is owed and has 
assigned the payment of that money to the Commission; or
    (3) On the basis of any factual or legal argument that was decided 
on the merits adversely to the employee in a court of competent 
jurisdiction.
    (b) In determining whether the Chief Financial Officer's decision 
concerning the existence or amount of the employee's debt is clearly 
erroneous, the hearing official shall be bound by the relevant Federal 
statutes and regulations governing the program which gave rise to the 
debt, and general principles of the law of the United States, if 
relevant.


<R05>
Sec. 256.12  Standards for determining extreme financial hardship.

    (a) An offset will be considered to produce an extreme financial 
hardship for an employee if the offset prevents the employee from 
meeting the costs necessarily incurred for essential subsistence 
expenses of the employee and his spouse and dependents. Essential 
subsistence expenses consist of the costs incurred for medical care, 
food, housing, clothing, and transportation only.
    (b) In determining whether an offset would prevent the employee from 
meeting the essential subsistence costs described in paragraph (a) of 
this section, the following matters shall be considered--
    (1) The income from all sources of the employee and his spouse and 
dependents;
    (2) The extent to which the assets of the employee and his spouse 
and dependents are available to pay the debt or the essential 
subsistence expenses;
    (3) Whether the essential subsistence costs have been minimized to 
the greatest extent possible;
    (4) The extent to which the employee and his spouse and dependents 
can borrow money to pay the debt or the essential subsistence expenses; 
and
    (5) The extent to which the employee and his spouse and dependents 
have other exceptional expenses that should be taken into account, and 
whether these expenses have been minimized.


<R05>
Sec. 256.13  Collection of debts on behalf of other agencies by offsetting the pay of a Commission employee.

    (a) Upon completion of the procedures established by the creditor 
agency under 5 U.S.C. 5514, the creditor agency shall forward to the 
Commission a certified statement of the existence of the debt. This 
document shall include a statement that the employee owes the debt, the 
amount and basis of the debt, the date on which payment is due, the date 
on which the claim against the debtor accrued, if different from the 
payment due date, and a statement that agency regulations implementing 5 
U.S.C. 5514 have been approved by the Office of Personnel Management.
    (b) Unless the employee has consented to the salary offset in 
writing or signed a statement acknowledging receipt of the required 
procedures and the writing or statement is attached to the debt claim 
form, the creditor agency must also indicate the actions taken under 
section 5514(b) and give the dates the actions were taken.
    (c) If, after the debt claim has been submitted by the creditor 
agency, the employee transfers to a position in another agency, the 
Commission will certify the total amount of the collection made on the 
debt. One copy of the certification will be furnished to the employee, 
and one copy will be furnished to the creditor agency, together with 
notice of the employee's transfer. The original of the debt claim form 
shall be inserted in the employee's official personnel folder, together 
with the certification of the amount which has been collected. Upon 
receiving the official personnel folder, it will be the responsibility 
of the new paying agency to resume the collection from the individual's 
current pay and notify the employee and the creditor agency of the 
resumption. In cases in which an employee transfers to the Commission 
while a debt is being collected from him by another Federal agency by 
offset, the Commission will resume the collection and notify the 
employee that it is doing so.
    (d) For collections of debts by offset under this section, the 
Commission

[[Page 59]]

will not repeat the procedures prescribed by 5 U.S.C. 5514 and agency 
regulations under section 5514.
    (e) If the Commission receives an incomplete or improperly certified 
debt claim, it will return the claim to the creditor agency with a 
notice that procedures under 5 U.S.C. 5514 must be complied with and a 
complete debt claim must be submitted before any action will be taken to 
collect the debt by offset from the employee's current pay.
    (f) If the Commission receives a complete debt claim, deductions 
shall be scheduled to begin on the next officially established pay 
interval, if possible. A copy of the debt claim form shall be given to 
the debtor, together with notice of the date deductions will commence.
    (g) The Commission will not review the merits of the creditor 
agency's determination with respect to the amount or validity of the 
debt.

<R05>
Sec. 257.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 257.150 no qualified individual 
with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible 
to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the benefits of, 
be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to 
discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 257.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph 
does not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps; or
    (2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 257.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his designee 
after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding 
and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that 
individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the 
program or activity.
    (b) Methods--(1) General. The agency may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignments 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and 
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any 
other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is 
not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where 
other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. 
The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet 
accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), and any 
regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for 
meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority 
to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified 
individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.

[[Page 63]]

    (2) [Reserved]
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by October 8, 1987, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by July 10, 1990, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by January 11, 1988, a transition plan setting 
forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall 
provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with 
handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals 
with handicaps;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section, and if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period;
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 257.151  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards 
of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), as 
established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings 
covered by this section.

necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signs at a primary entrance to each of 
its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they 
can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international 
symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an 
accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 257.160 would result 
in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result 
in such alteration or burdens must be

[[Page 64]]

made by the agency head or his designee after considering all agency 
resources available for use in the funding and operation of the 
conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written 
statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action 
required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration 
or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not 
result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless 
ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps 
receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

complainant, he shall have 60 days from the date it receives the 
additional information to make its determination on the appeal.
    (k) The time limits cited in paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section 
may be extended with the permission of the Assistant Attorney General.
    (l) The agency may delegate its authority for conducting complaint 
investigations to other Federal agencies, except that the authority for

  were omitted from this revision, and which were repealed by one or
  another of the documents promulgating the revision. Those sections are
  included in Table 2. Nor does this table purport to set forth omitted
  orders dealing with the Canal Zone which were not codified in 35 CFR
  (1960) and which continue to be in full force and effect. Examples of
  these are those provisions of Exec. Order No. 1888, Feb. 2, 1914, as
  amended, relating to leave of Canal Zone employees; and Exec. Order
  No. 2455, Sept. 15, 1916, transferring to the Governor of the ``Panama
