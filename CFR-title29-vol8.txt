                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 1998), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.

[[Page vii]]

    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

otherwise noted.

    Editorial Note: At 44 FR 8577, Feb. 9, 1979, and corrected at 44 FR 
20940, Apr. 6, 1979, OSHA reprinted without change the entire text of 29 
CFR part 1926 together with certain General Industry Occupational Safety 
and Health Standards contained in 29 CFR part 1910, which have been 
identified as also applicable to construction work. This republication 
developed a single set of OSHA regulations for both labor and management 
forces within the construction industry.

<R04>
                   Subpart B--General Interpretations

    Authority: Sec. 107, Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act 
(Construction Safety Act) (40 U.S.C. 333).


<R05>
Sec. 1926.10  Scope of subpart.

    (a) This subpart contains the general rules of the Secretary of 
Labor interpreting and applying the construction safety and health 
provisions of section 107 of the Contract Work Hours and Safety 
Standards Act (83 Stat. 96). Section 107 requires as a condition of each 
contract which is entered into under legislation subject to 
Reorganization Plan Number 14 of 1950 (64 Stat. 1267), and which is for 
construction, alteration, and/or repair, including painting and 
decorating, that no contractor or subcontractor contracting for any part 
of the contract work shall require any laborer or mechanic employed in 
the performance of the contract to work in surroundings or under working 
conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to his health 
or safety, as determined under construction safety and health standards 
promulgated by the Secretary by regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 1926.11  Coverage under section 103 of the act distinguished.

    (a) Coverage under section 103. It is important to note that the 
coverage of section 107 differs from that for the overtime requirements 
of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act. The application of 
the overtime requirements is governed by section 103, which subject to 
specific exemptions, includes: (1) Federal contracts requiring or 
involving the employment of laborers or mechanics (thus including, but 
not limited to, contracts for construction), and (2) contracts assisted 
in whole or in part by Federal loans, grants, or guarantees under any 
statute ``providing wage standards for such work.'' The statutes 
``providing wage standards for such work'' include statutes for 
construction which require the payment of minimum wages in accordance 
with prevailing wage findings by the Secretary of Labor in accordance 
with the Davis-Bacon Act. A provision to section 103 excludes from the 
overtime requirements work where the Federal assistance is only in the 
form of a loan guarantee or insurance.
    (b) Coverage under section 107. To be covered by section 107 of the 
Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, a contract must be one 
which (1) is entered into under a statute that is subject to 
Reorganization Plan No. 14 of 1950 (64 Stat. 1267); and (2) is for 
``construction, alteration, and/or repair, including painting and 
decorating.''


<R05>
Sec. 1926.12  Reorganization Plan No. 14 of 1950.

    (a) General provisions. Reorganization Plan No. 14 of 1950 relates 
to the prescribing by the Secretary of Labor of ``appropriate standards, 
regulations, and procedures'' with respect to the enforcement of labor 
standards under Federal and federally assisted contracts which are 
subject to various statutes subject to the Plan. The rules of the 
Secretary of Labor implementing the Plan are published in part 5 of this 
title. Briefly, the statutes subject to the Plan include the Davis-Bacon 
Act, including its extension to Federal-aid highway legislation subject 
to 23 U.S.C. 113, and other statutes subject to the Plan by its original 
terms, statutes by which the Plan is expressly applied, such as the 
Contract Work Hours Standards Act by virtue of section 104(d) thereof.
    (b) The Plan. (1) The statutes subject to Reorganization Plan No. 14 
of 1950 are cited and briefly described in the

[[Page 13]]

remaining paragraphs of this section. These descriptions are general in 
nature and not intended to convey the full scope of the work to be 
performed under each statute. The individual statutes should be resorted 
to for a more detailed scope of the work.
    (2) Federal-Aid Highway Acts. The provisions codified in 23 U.S.C. 
113 apply to the initial construction, reconstruction, or improvement 
work performed by contractors or subcontractors on highway projects on 
the Federal-aid systems, the primary and secondary, as well as their 
extensions in urban areas, and the Interstate System, authorized under 
the highway laws providing for the expenditure of Federal funds upon the 
Federal-aid system. As cited in 41 Op. A.G. 488, 496, the Attorney 
General ruled that the Federal-Aid Highway Acts are subject to 
Reorganization Plan No. 14 of 1950.
    (3) National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1713, 1715a, 1715e, 1715k, 
1715l(d)(3) and (4), 1715v, 1715w, 1715x, 1743, 1747, 1748, 1748h-2, 
1750g, 1715l(h)(1), 1715z(j)(1), 1715z-1, 1715y(d), Subchapter 1x-A and

insurance on single family or multifamily housing in approved urban 
renewal areas.
    (v) Low or Moderate Income Housing--Section 1715L(d) (3) and (4) 
insures mortgages on low-cost single family or multifamily housing.
    (vi) Housing for Elderly--Section 1715v provides mortgage insurance 
on rental housing for elderly or handicapped persons.
    (vii) Nursing Homes--Section 1715w authorizes mortgage insurance on 
nursing home facilities and major equipment.
    (viii) Experimental Housing--Section 1715x provides mortgage 
insurance on single family or multifamily housing with experimental 
design of materials.
    (ix) War Housing Insurance--Section 1743 not active.
    (x) Yield Insurance--Section 1747 insures investment returns on 
multifamily housing.
    (xi) Armed Services Housing--Section 1748b to assist in relieving 
acute shortage and urgent need for family housing at or in areas 
adjacent to military installations.
    (xii) Defense Housing for Impacted Areas--Section 1748h-2 provides 
mortgage insurance on single family or multifamily housing for sale or 
rent primarily to military or civilian personnel of the Armed Services, 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or Atomic Energy 
Commission.
    (xiii) Defense Rental Housing--Section 1750g provides for mortgage 
insurance in critical defense housing areas.
    (xiv) Rehabilitation--Section 1715L (h)(1) provides mortgage 
insurance for nonprofit organizations to finance the purchase and 
rehabilitation of deteriorating or substandard housing for subsequent 
resale to low-income home purchasers. There must be located on the 
property five or more single family dwellings of detached, semidetached, 
or row construction.
    (xv) Homeowner Assistance--Section 1715Z(j)(1) authorizes mortgage 
insurance to nonprofit organizations or public bodies or agencies 
executed to finance sale of individual dwellings to lower income 
individuals or families. Also includes the rehabilitation of such 
housing if it is deteriorating or substandard for subsequent resale to 
lower income home purchasers.
    (xvi) Rental Housing Assistance--Section 1715Z-1 authorizes mortgage 
insurance and interest reduction payments on behalf of owners of rental 
housing projects designed for occupancy by lower income families. 
Payments are also authorized for certain State or locally aided 
projects.

[[Page 14]]

    (xvii) Condominium Housing--Section 1715y(d) provides mortgage 
insurance on property purchased for the development of building sites. 
This includes waterlines and water supply installations, sewer lines and 
sewage disposal installations, steam, gas, and electrical lines and 
installations, roads, streets, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, storm drainage

authorizes mortgage insurance for the financing of construction and 
equipment, of facilities for group practice of medicine, optometry, or 
dentistry.
    (xix) Nonprofit Hospitals--1715z-7 authorizes mortgage insurance to 
cover new and rehabilitated hospitals, including initial equipment.
    (4) Hospital Survey and Construction Act, as amended by the Hospital 
and Medical Facilities Amendments of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 291e). The 
provisions of this Act cover construction contracts made by State or 
local authorities or private institutions under Federal grant-in-aid 
programs for the construction of hospitals and other medical facilities.
    (5) Federal Airport Act (49 U.S.C. 1114(b)). The act provides grant-
in-aid funds for airport construction limited to general site 
preparation runways, taxiways, aprons, lighting appurtenant thereto, and 
fire, rescue, and maintenance buildings. The act excludes construction 
intended for use as a public parking facility for passenger automobiles 
and the cost of construction of any part of an airport building except 
such of those buildings or parts of buildings to house facilities or 
activities directly related to the safety of persons at the airport.
    (6) Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C. 1459). Construction contracts 
awarded by local authorities financed with the assistance of loans and 
grants from the Federal Government. The construction programs are for

ownership. Concerning construction under the National Housing Act, 
Reorganization Plan No. 14 of 1950 applies to construction which is 
subject to the minimum wage requirements of section 212(a) thereof (12 
U.S.C. 1715c).


<R05>
Sec. 1926.13  Interpretation of statutory terms.

    (a) The terms construction, alteration, and repair used in section 
107 of the Act are also used in section 1 of the Davis-Bacon Act (40 
U.S.C. 276a), providing minimum wage protection on Federal construction 
contracts, and section 1 of the Miller Act (40 U.S.C. 270a), providing 
performance and payment bond protection on Federal construction 
contracts. Similarly, the terms contractor and subcontractor are used in 
those statutes, as well as in Copeland (Anti-Kickback) Act (40 U.S.C. 
276c) and the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act itself, which 
apply concurrently with the Miller Act and the Davis-Bacon Act on 
Federal construction contracts and also apply to most federally assisted 
construction contracts. The use of the same or identical terms in these 
statutes which apply concurrently with section 107 of the Act have 
considerable precedential value in ascertaining the coverage of section 
107.
    (b) It should be noted that section 1 of the Davis-Bacon Act limits 
minimum wage protection to laborers and

[[Page 20]]

mechanics ``employed directly'' upon the ``site of the work.'' There is 
no comparable limitation in section 107 of the Act. Section 107 
expressly requires as a self-executing condition of each covered 
contract that no contractor or subcontractor shall require ``any laborer 
or mechanic employed in the performance of the contract to work in 
surroundings or under working conditions which are unsanitary, 
hazardous, or dangerous to his health or safety'' as these health and 
safety standards are applied in the rules of the Secretary of Labor.
    (c) The term subcontractor under section 107 is considered to mean a 
person who agrees to perform any part of the labor or material 
requirements of a contract for construction, alteration or repair. Cf. 
MacEvoy Co. v. United States, 322 U.S. 102, 108-9 (1944). A person who 
undertakes to perform a portion of a contract involving the furnishing 
of supplies or materials will be considered a ``subcontractor'' under 
this part and section 107 if the work in question involves the 
performance of construction work and is to be performed: (1) Directly on 
or near the construction site, or (2) by the employer for the specific 
project on a customized basis. Thus, a supplier of materials which will 
become an integral part of the construction is a ``subcontractor'' if 
the supplier fabricates or assembles the goods or materials in question 
specifically for the construction project and the work involved may be 
said to be construction activity. If the goods or materials in question 
are ordinarily sold to other customers from regular inventory, the 
supplier is not a ``subcontractor.'' Generally, the furnishing of 
prestressed concrete beams and prestressed structural steel would be 
considered manufacturing; therefore a supplier of such materials would 
not be considered a ``subcontractor.'' An example of material supplied 
``for the specific project on a customized basis'' as that phrase is 
used in this section would be ventilating ducts, fabricated in a shop 
away from the construction job site and specifically cut for the project 
according to design specifications. On the other hand, if a contractor 
buys standard size nails from a foundry, the foundry would not be a 
covered ``subcontractor.'' Ordinarily a contract for the supplying of 
construction equipment to a contractor would not, in and of itself, be 
considered a ``subcontractor'' for purposes of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1926.14  Federal contract for ``mixed'' types of performance.

    (a) It is the intent of the Congress to provide safety and health 
protection of Federal, federally financed, or federally assisted 
construction. See, for example, H. Report No. 91-241, 91st Cong., first 
session, p. 1 (1969). Thus, it is clear that when a Federal contract 
calls for mixed types of performance, such as both manufacturing and 
construction, section 107 would apply to the construction. By its 
express terms, section 107 applies to a contract which is ``for 
construction, alteration, and/or repair.'' Such a contract is not 
required to be exclusively for such services. The application of the 
section is not limited to contracts which permit an overall 
characterization as ``construction contracts.'' The text of section 107 
is not so limited.
    (b) When the mixed types of performances include both construction 
and manufacturing, see also Sec. 1926.15(b) concerning the relationship 
between the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act and section 107.


<R05>
Sec. 1926.15  Relationship to the Service Contract Act; Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act.

    (a) A contract for ``construction'' is one for nonpersonal service. 
See, e.g., 41 CFR 1-1.208. Section 2(e) of the Service Contract Act of 
1965 requires as a condition of every Federal contract (and bid 
specification therefor) exceeding $2,500, the ``principal purpose'' of 
which is to furnish services to the United States through the use of 
``service employees,'' that certain safety and health standards be met. 
See 29 CFR part 1925, which contains the Department rules concerning 
these standards. Section 7 of the Service Contract Act provides that the 
Act shall not apply to ``any contract of the United States or District 
of Columbia for construction, alteration, and/or repair, including 
painting and decorating of public buildings or public works.'' It is 
clear

[[Page 21]]

from the legislative history of section 107 that no gaps in coverage 
between the two statutes are intended.
    (b) The Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act requires that contracts 
entered into by any Federal agency for the manufacture or furnishing of 
materials, supplies, articles, and equipment in any amount exceeding 
$10,000 must contain, among other provisions, a requirement that ``no 
part of such contract will be performed nor will any of the materials, 
supplies, articles or equipment to be manufactured or furnished under 
said contract be manufactured or fabricated in any plants, factories, 
buildings, or surroundings or under working conditions which are 
unsanitary or hazardous or dangerous to the health and safety of 
employees engaged in the performance of said contract.'' The rules of 
the Secretary concerning these standards are published in 41 CFR part 
50-204, and express the Secretary of Labor's interpretation and 
application of section 1(e) of the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act to 
certain particular working conditions. None of the described working 
conditions are intended to deal with construction activities, although 
such activities may conceivably be a part of a contract which is subject 
to the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act. Nevertheless, such activities 
remain subject to the general statutory duty prescribed by section 1(e). 
Section 103(b) of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act 
provides, among other things, that the Act shall not apply to any work 
required to be done in accordance with the provisions of the Walsh-
Healey Public Contracts Act.


<R05>
Sec. 1926.16  Rules of construction.

    (a) The prime contractor and any subcontractors may make their own 
arrangements with respect to obligations which might be more 
appropriately treated on a jobsite basis rather than individually. Thus, 
for example, the prime contractor and his subcontractors may wish to 
make an express agreement that the prime contractor or one of the 
subcontractors will provide all required first-aid or toilet facilities, 
thus relieving the subcontractors from the actual, but not any legal, 
responsibility (or, as the case may be, relieving the other 
subcontractors from this responsibility). In no case shall the prime 
contractor be relieved of overall responsibility for compliance with the 
requirements of this part for all work to be performed under the 
contract.
    (b) By contracting for full performance of a contract subject to 
section 107 of the Act, the prime contractor assumes all obligations 
prescribed as employer obligations under the standards contained in this 
part, whether or not he subcontracts any part of the work.
    (c) To the extent that a subcontractor of any tier agrees to perform 
any part of the contract, he also assumes responsibility for complying 
with the standards in this part with respect to that part. Thus, the 
prime contractor assumes the entire responsibility under the contract 
and the subcontractor assumes responsibility with respect to his portion 
of the work. With respect to subcontracted work, the prime contractor 
and any subcontractor or subcontractors shall be deemed to have joint 
responsibility.
    (d) Where joint responsibility exists, both the prime contractor and 
his subcontractor or subcontractors, regardless of tier, shall be 
considered subject to the enforcement provisions of the Act.

Sec. 1926.32  Definitions.

    The following definitions shall apply in the application of the 
regulations in this part:
    (a) Act means section 107 of the Contract Work Hours and Safety 
Standards Act, commonly known as the Construction Safety Act (86 Stat. 
96; 40 U.S.C. 333).
    (b) ANSI means American National Standards Institute.
    (c) Approved means sanctioned, endorsed, accredited, certified, or 
accepted as satisfactory by a duly constituted and nationally recognized 
authority or agency.
    (d) Authorized person means a person approved or assigned by the 
employer to perform a specific type of duty or duties or to be at a 
specific location or locations at the jobsite.
    (e) Administration means the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration.
    (f) Competent person means one who is capable of identifying 
existing and predictable hazards in the surroundings or working 
conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to employees, 
and who has authorization to take prompt corrective measures to 
eliminate them.
    (g) Construction work. For purposes of this section, Construction 
work means work for construction, alteration, and/

[[Page 25]]

or repair, including painting and decorating.
    (h) Defect means any characteristic or condition which tends to 
weaken or reduce the strength of the tool, object, or structure of which 
it is a part.
    (i) Designated person means ``authorized person'' as defined in 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (j) Employee means every laborer or mechanic under the Act 
regardless of the contractual relationship which may be alleged to exist 
between the laborer and mechanic and the contractor or subcontractor who 
engaged him. ``Laborer and mechanic'' are not defined in the Act, but 
the identical terms are used in the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a), 
which provides for minimum wage protection on Federal and federally 
assisted construction contracts. The use of the same term in a statute 
which often applies concurrently with section 107 of the Act has 
considerable precedential value in ascertaining the meaning of ``laborer 
and mechanic'' as used in the Act. Laborer generally means one who 
performs manual labor or who labors at an occupation requiring physical 
strength; mechanic generally means a worker skilled with tools. See 18 
Comp. Gen. 341.
    (k) Employer means contractor or subcontractor within the meaning of 
the Act and of this part.
    (l) Hazardous substance means a substance which, by reason of being 
explosive, flammable, poisonous, corrosive, oxidizing, irritating, or 
otherwise harmful, is likely to cause death or injury.
    (m) Qualified means one who, by possession of a recognized degree, 
certificate, or professional standing, or who by extensive knowledge, 
training, and experience, has successfully demonstrated his ability to 
solve or resolve problems relating to the subject matter, the work, or 
the project.
    (n) Safety factor means the ratio of the ultimate breaking strength 
of a member or piece of material or equipment to the actual working 
stress or safe load when in use.
    (o) Secretary means the Secretary of Labor.
    (p) SAE means Society of Automotive Engineers.
    (q) Shall means mandatory.
    (r) Should means recommended.
    (s) Suitable means that which fits, and has the qualities or 
qualifications to meet a given purpose, occasion, condition, function, 
or circumstance.

institutions where supervisory personnel is continually on duty and 
effective provisions are made to remove occupants in case of fire or 
other emergency.

Access to exits shall be marked by readily visible signs in all cases 
where the exit or way to reach it is not immediately visible to the 
occupants.
    (c) Maintenance and workmanship. Means of egress shall be 
continually maintained free of all obstructions or impediments to full 
instant use in the case of fire or other emergency.

    (a) Scope and application. This section applies to all emergency 
action plans required by a particular OSHA standard. The emergency 
action plan shall be in writing (except as provided in the last sentence 
of paragraph (e)(3) of this section) and shall cover those designated 
actions employers and employees must take to ensure employee safety from 
fire and other emergencies.

[[Page 26]]

    (b) Elements. The following elements, at a minimum, shall be 
included in the plan:
    (1) Emergency escape procedures and emergency escape route

    (2) The employer shall review the plan with each employee covered by 
the plan at the following times:
    (i) Initially when the plan is developed,
    (ii) Whenever the employee's responsibilities or designated actions 
under the plan change, and
    (iii) Whenever the plan is changed.
    (3) The employer shall review with each employee upon initial 
assignment those parts of the plan which the employee must know to 
protect the employee in the event of an emergency. The written plan 
shall be kept at the workplace and made available for employee review. 
For those employers with 10 or fewer employees the plan may be 
communicated orally to employees and the employer need not maintain a 
written plan.

       Appendix A to Sec. 1926.50--First aid Kits (Non-Mandatory)

    First aid supplies are required to be easily accessible under 
paragraph Sec. 1926.50(d)(1). An example of the minimal contents of a 
generic first aid kit is described in American National Standard (ANSI) 
Z308.1-1978 ``Minimum Requirements for Industrial Unit-Type First-aid 
Kits''. The contents of the kit listed in the ANSI standard should be 
adequate for small work sites. When larger operations or multiple 
operations are being conducted at the same location, employers should 
determine the need for additional first aid kits at the worksite, 
additional types of first aid equipment and supplies and additional 
quantities and types of supplies and equipment in the first aid kits.
    In a similar fashion, employers who have unique or changing first-
aid needs in their workplace, may need to enhance their first-aid kits. 
The employer can use the OSHA 200 log, OSHA 101's or other reports to 
identify these unique problems. Consultation from the local Fire/Rescue 
Department, appropriate medical professional, or local emergency room 
may be helpful to employers in these circumstances. By assessing the 
specific needs of their workplace, employers can ensure that reasonably 
anticipated supplies are available. Employers should assess the specific 
needs of their worksite periodically and augment the first aid kit 
appropriately.
    If it is reasonably anticipated employees will be exposed to blood 
or other potentially infectious materials while using first-aid 
supplies, employers should provide personal protective equipment (PPE). 
Appropriate PPE includes gloves, gowns, face shields, masks and eye 
protection (see ``Occupational Exposure to Blood borne Pathogens'', 29 
CFR 1910.1030(d)(3)) (56 FR 64175).

Sec. 1926.52  Occupational noise exposure.

    (a) Protection against the effects of noise exposure shall be 
provided when the sound levels exceed those shown in Table D-2 of this 
section when measured on the A-scale of a standard sound level meter at 
slow response.
    (b) When employees are subjected to sound levels exceeding those 
listed in Table D-2 of this section, feasible administrative or 
engineering controls shall be utilized. If such controls fail to reduce 
sound levels within the levels of the table, personal protective 
equipment as required in subpart E, shall be provided and used to reduce 
sound levels within the levels of the table.
    (c) If the variations in noise level involve maxima at intervals of 
1 second or less, it is to be considered continuous.
    (d)(1) In all cases where the sound levels exceed the values shown 
herein, a continuing, effective hearing conservation program shall be 
administered.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2)(i) When the daily noise exposure is composed of two or more 
periods of noise exposure of different levels, their combined effect 
should be considered, rather than the individual effect of each. 
Exposure to different levels for various periods of time shall be 
computed according to the formula set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of 
this section.
    (ii) F<INF>e</INF>=(T<INF>1</INF>/L<INF>1</INF>)+(T<INF>2</INF>/
L<INF>2</INF>)+ <t-bullet> <t-bullet> <t-bullet> + (T<INF>n</INF>/
L<INF>n</INF>)

where:
F<INF>e</INF>=The equivalent noise exposure factor.
T=The period of noise exposure at any essentially constant level.
L=The duration of the permissible noise exposure at the constant level 
          (from Table D-2).


If the value of F<INF>e</INF> exceeds unity (1) the exposure exceeds 
permissible levels.
    (iii) A sample computation showing an application of the formula in 
paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section is as follows. An employee is 
exposed at these levels for these periods:

    110 db A \1/4\ hour.
    100 db A \1/2\ hour.
    90 db A 1\1/2\ hours.

F<INF>e</INF>=(\1/4\/\1/2\)+(\1/2\/2)+(1\1/2\/8)
F<INF>e</INF>=0.500+0.25+0.188
F<INF>e</INF>=0.938


Since the value of F<INF>e</INF> does not exceed unity, the exposure is 
within permissible limits.
    (e) Exposure to impulsive or impact noise should not exceed 140 dB 
peak sound pressure level.

Regulatory Commission's Standards for Protection Against Radiation (10 
CFR part 20), relating to protection against occupational radiation 
exposure, shall apply.
    (b) Any activity which involves the use of radioactive materials or 
X-rays, whether or not under license from the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission, shall be performed by competent persons specially trained in 
the proper and safe operation of such equipment. In the case of 
materials used under Commission license, only persons actually licensed, 
or competent persons under direction and supervision of the licensee, 
shall perform such work.
    (c)--(r) [Reserved]

Sec. 1926.57  Ventilation.

    (a) General. Whenever hazardous substances such as dusts, fumes, 
mists, vapors, or gases exist or are produced in the course of 
construction work, their concentrations shall not exceed the limits 
specified in Sec. 1926.55(a). When ventilation is used as an engineering 
control method, the system shall be installed and operated according to 
the requirements of this section.
    (b) Local exhaust ventilation. Local exhaust ventilation when used 
as described in (a) shall be designed to prevent dispersion into the air 
of dusts, fumes, mists, vapors, and gases in concentrations causing 
harmful exposure. Such exhaust systems shall be so designed that dusts, 
fumes, mists, vapors, or gases are not drawn through the work area of 
employees.
    (c) Design and operation. Exhaust fans, jets, ducts, hoods, 
separators, and all necessary appurtenances, including refuse 
receptacles, shall be so designed, constructed, maintained and operated 
as to ensure the required protection by maintaining a volume and 
velocity of exhaust air sufficient to gather dusts, fumes, vapors, or 
gases from said equipment or process, and to convey them to suitable 
points of safe disposal, thereby preventing their dispersion in harmful 
quantities into the atmosphere where employees work.
    (d) Duration of operations. (1) The exhaust system shall be in 
operation continually during all operations which it is designed to 
serve. If the employee remains in the contaminated zone, the system 
shall continue to operate after the cessation of said operations, the 
length of time to depend upon the individual circumstances and 
effectiveness of the general ventilation system.
    (2) Since dust capable of causing disability is, according to the 
best medical opinion, of microscopic size, tending to remain for hours 
in suspension in still air, it is essential that the exhaust system be 
continued in operation for a time after the work process or equipment 
served by the same shall have ceased, in order to ensure the removal of 
the harmful elements to the required extent. For the same reason, 
employees wearing respiratory equipment should not remove same 
immediately until the atmosphere seems clear.
    (e) Disposal of exhaust materials. The air outlet from every dust 
separator, and the dusts, fumes, mists, vapors, or gases collected by an 
exhaust or ventilating system shall discharge to the

[[Page 46]]

outside atmosphere. Collecting systems which return air to work area may 
be used if concentrations which accumulate in the work area air do not 
result in harmful exposure to employees. Dust and refuse discharged from 
an exhaust system shall be disposed of in such a manner that it will not 
result in harmful exposure to employees.
    (f) Abrasive blasting--(1) Definitions applicable to this 
paragraph--(i) Abrasive. A solid substance used in an abrasive blasting 
operation.
    (ii) Abrasive-blasting respirator. A respirator constructed so that 
it covers the wearer's head, neck, and shoulders to protect the wearer 
from rebounding abrasive.
    (iii) Blast cleaning barrel. A complete enclosure which rotates on 
an axis, or which has an internal moving tread to tumble the parts, in 
order to expose various surfaces of the parts to the action of an 
automatic blast spray.
    (iv) Blast cleaning room. A complete enclosure in which blasting 
operations are performed and where the operator works inside of the room 
to operate the blasting nozzle and direct the flow of the abrasive 
material.
    (v) Blasting cabinet. An enclosure where the operator stands outside 
and operates the blasting nozzle through an opening or openings in the 
enclosure.
    (vi) Clean air. Air of such purity that it will not cause harm or 
discomfort to an individual if it is inhaled for extended periods of 
time.
    (vii) Dust collector. A device or combination of devices for 
separating dust from the air handled by an exhaust ventilation system.
    (viii) Exhaust ventilation system. A system for removing 
contaminated air from a space, comprising two or more of the following 
elements (A) enclosure or hood, (B) duct work, (C) dust collecting 
equipment, (D) exhauster, and (E) discharge stack.
    (ix) Particulate-filter respirator. An air purifying respirator, 
commonly referred to as a dust or a fume respirator, which removes most 
of the dust or fume from the air passing through the device.
    (x) Respirable dust. Airborne dust in sizes capable of passing 
through the upper respiratory system to reach the lower lung passages.
    (xi) Rotary blast cleaning table. An enclosure where the pieces to 
be cleaned are positioned on a rotating table and are passed 
automatically through a series of blast sprays.
    (xii) Abrasive blasting. The forcible application of an abrasive to 
a surface by pneumatic pressure, hydraulic pressure, or centrifugal 
force.
    (2) Dust hazards from abrasive blasting. (i) Abrasives and the 
surface coatings on the materials blasted are shattered and pulverized 
during blasting operations and the dust formed will contain particles of 
respirable size. The composition and toxicity of the dust from these 
sources shall be considered in making an evaluation of the potential 
health hazards.
    (ii) The concentration of respirable dust or fume in the breathing 
zone of the abrasive-blasting operator or any other worker shall be kept 
below the levels specified in Sec. 1926.55 or other pertinent sections 
of this part.
    (iii) Organic abrasives which are combustible shall be used only in 
automatic systems. Where flammable or explosive dust mixtures may be 
present, the construction of the equipment, including the exhaust system 
and all electric wiring, shall conform to the requirements of American 
National Standard Installation of Blower and Exhaust Systems for Dust, 
Stock, and Vapor Removal or Conveying, Z33.1-1961 (NFPA 91-1961), and 
subpart S of this part. The blast nozzle shall be bonded and grounded to 
prevent the build up of static charges. Where flammable or explosive 
dust mixtures may be present, the abrasive blasting enclosure, the 
ducts, and the dust collector shall be constructed with loose panels or 
explosion venting areas, located on sides away from any occupied area, 
to provide for pressure relief in case of explosion, following the 
principles set forth in the National Fire Protection Association 
Explosion Venting Guide. NFPA 68-1954.
    (3) Blast-cleaning enclosures. (i) Blast-cleaning enclosures shall 
be exhaust ventilated in such a way that a continuous inward flow of air 
will be maintained at all openings in the enclosure during the blasting 
operation.
    (A) All air inlets and access openings shall be baffled or so 
arranged that by

[[Page 47]]

the combination of inward air flow and baffling the escape of abrasive 
or dust particles into an adjacent work area will be minimized and 
visible spurts of dust will not be observed.
    (B) The rate of exhaust shall be sufficient to provide prompt 
clearance of the dust-laden air within the enclosure after the cessation 
of blasting.
    (C) Before the enclosure is opened, the blast shall be turned off 
and the exhaust system shall be run for a sufficient period of time to 
remove the dusty air within the enclosure.
    (D) Safety glass protected by screening shall be used in observation 
windows, where hard deep-cutting abrasives are used.
    (E) Slit abrasive-resistant baffles shall be installed in multiple 
sets at all small access openings where dust might escape, and shall be 
inspected regularly and replaced when needed.
    (1) Doors shall be flanged and tight when closed.
    (2) Doors on blast-cleaning rooms shall be operable from both inside 
and outside, except that where there is a small operator access door, 
the large work access door may be closed or opened from the outside 
only.
    (4) Exhaust ventilation systems. (i) The construction, installation, 
inspection, and maintenance of exhaust systems shall conform to the 
principles and requirements set forth in American National Standard 
Fundamentals Governing the Design and Operation of Local Exhaust 
Systems, Z9.2-1960, and ANSI Z33.1-1961.
    (a) When dust leaks are noted, repairs shall be made as soon as 
possible.
    (b) The static pressure drop at the exhaust ducts leading from the 
equipment shall be checked when the installation is completed and 
periodically thereafter to assure continued satisfactory operation. 
Whenever an appreciable change in the pressure drop indicates a partial 
blockage, the system shall be cleaned and returned to normal operating 
condition.
    (ii) In installations where the abrasive is recirculated, the 
exhaust ventilation system for the blasting enclosure shall not be 
relied upon for the removal of fines from the spent abrasive instead of 
an abrasive separator. An abrasive separator shall be provided for the 
purpose.
    (iii) The air exhausted from blast-cleaning equipment shall be 
discharged through dust collecting equipment. Dust collectors shall be 
set up so that the accumulated dust can be emptied and removed without 
contaminating other working areas.
    (5) Personal protective equipment. (i) Employers must use only 
respirators approved by NIOSH under 42 CFR part 84 for protecting 
employees from dusts produced during abrasive-blasting operations.
    (ii) Abrasive-blasting respirators shall be worn by all abrasive-
blasting operators:
    (A) When working inside of blast-cleaning rooms, or
    (B) When using silica sand in manual blasting operations where the 
nozzle and blast are not physically separated from the operator in an 
exhaust ventilated enclosure, or
    (C) Where concentrations of toxic dust dispersed by the abrasive 
blasting may exceed the limits set in Sec. 1926.55 or other pertinent 
sections of this part and the nozzle and blast are not physically 
separated from the operator in an exhaust-ventilated enclosure.
    (iii) Properly fitted particulate-filter respirators, commonly 
referred to as dust-filter respirators, may be used for short, 
intermittent, or occasional dust exposures such as cleanup, dumping of 
dust collectors, or unloading shipments of sand at a receiving point 
when it is not feasible to control the dust by enclosure, exhaust 
ventilation, or other means. The respirators used must be approved by 
NIOSH under 42 CFR part 84 for protection against the specific type of 
dust encountered.
    (iv) A respiratory protection program as defined and described in 
Sec. 1926.103, shall be established wherever it is necessary to use 
respiratory protective equipment.
    (v) Operators shall be equipped with heavy canvas or leather gloves 
and aprons or equivalent protection to protect them from the impact of 
abrasives. Safety shoes shall be worn to protect against foot injury 
where heavy pieces of work are handled.
    (A) Safety shoes shall conform to the requirements of American 
National

Standard for Men's Safety-Toe Footwear, Z41.1-1967.
    (B) Equipment for protection of the eyes and face shall be supplied 
to the operator when the respirator design does not provide such 
protection and to any other personnel working in the vicinity of 
abrasive blasting operations. This equipment shall conform to the 
requirements of Sec. 1926.102.
    (6) Air supply and air compressors. Air for abrasive-blasting 
respirators must be free of harmful quantities of dusts, mists, or 
noxious gases, and must meet the requirements for supplied-air quality 
and use specified in 29 CFR 1910.134(i).
    (7) Operational procedures and general safety. Dust shall not be 
permitted to accumulate on the floor or on ledges outside of an 
abrasive-blasting enclosure, and dust spills shall be cleaned up 
promptly. Aisles and walkways shall be kept clear of steel shot or 
similar abrasive which may create a slipping hazard.
    (8) Scope. This paragraph applies to all operations where an 
abrasive is forcibly applied to a surface by pneumatic or hydraulic 
pressure, or by centrifugal force. It does not apply to steam blasting, 
or steam cleaning, or hydraulic cleaning methods where work is done 
without the aid of abrasives.

    (viii) Cradles and swing-frame grinders. Where cradles are used for 
handling the parts to be ground, polished, or buffed, requiring large 
partial enclosures to house the complete operation, a minimum average 
air velocity of 150 feet per minute shall be maintained over the entire 
opening of the enclosure. Swing-frame grinders shall also be exhausted 
in the same manner as provided for cradles. (See fig. D-57.3)
    (ix) Where the work is outside the hood, air volumes must be 
increased as shown in American Standard Fundamentals Governing the 
Design and Operation of Local Exhaust Systems, Z9.2-1960 (section 4, 
exhaust hoods).
    (4) Exhaust systems. (i) Exhaust systems for grinding, polishing, 
and buffing operations should be designed in accordance with American 
Standard Fundamentals Governing the Design and Operation of Local 
Exhaust Systems, Z9.2-1960.
    (ii) Exhaust systems for grinding, polishing, and buffing operations 
shall be tested in the manner described in American Standard 
Fundamentals Governing the Design and Operation of Local Exhaust 
Systems, Z9.2-1960.
    (iii) All exhaust systems shall be provided with suitable dust 
collectors.
    (5) Hood and enclosure design. (i) (A) It is the dual function of 
grinding and abrasive cutting-off wheel hoods to protect the operator 
from the hazards of bursting wheels as well as to provide a means for 
the removal of dust and dirt generated. All hoods shall be not less in 
structural strength than specified in the American National Standard 
Safety Code for the Use, Care, and Protection of Abrasive Wheels, B7.1-
1970.
    (B) Due to the variety of work and types of grinding machines 
employed,

[[Page 51]]

it is necessary to develop hoods adaptable to the particular machine in 
question, and such hoods shall be located as close as possible to the 
operation.
    (ii) Exhaust hoods for floor stands, pedestals, and bench grinders 
shall be designed in accordance with figure D-57.2. The adjustable 
tongue shown in the figure shall be kept in working order and shall be 
adjusted within one-fourth inch (0.635 cm) of the wheel periphery at all 
times.
    (iii) Swing-frame grinders shall be provided with exhaust booths as 
indicated in figure D-57.3.
    (iv) Portable grinding operations, whenever the nature of the work 
permits, shall be conducted within a partial enclosure. The opening in 
the enclosure shall be no larger than is actually required in the 
operation and an average face air velocity of not less than 200 feet per 
minute shall be maintained.
    (v) Hoods for polishing and buffing and scratch-brush wheels shall 
be constructed to conform as closely to figure D-57.4 as the nature of 
the work will permit.
    (vi) Cradle grinding and polishing operations shall be performed 
within a partial enclosure similar to figure D-57.5. The operator shall 
be positioned outside the working face of the opening of the enclosure. 
The face opening of the enclosure should not be any greater in area than 
that actually required for the performance of the operation and the 
average air velocity into the working face of the enclosure shall not be 
less than 150 feet per minute.
    (vii) Hoods for horizontal single-spindle disc grinders shall be 
constructed to conform as closely as possible to the hood shown in 
figure D-57.6. It is essential that there be a space between the back of 
the wheel and the hood, and a space around the periphery of the wheel of 
at least 1 inch (2.54 cm) in order to permit the suction to act around 
the wheel periphery. The opening on the side of the disc shall be no 
larger than is required for the grinding operation, but must never be 
less than twice the area of the branch outlet.
    (viii) Horizontal double-spindle disc grinders shall have a hood 
encircling the wheels and grinding chamber similar to that illustrated 
in figure D-57.7. The openings for passing the work into the grinding 
chamber should be kept as small as possible, but must never be less than 
twice the area of the branch outlets.
    (ix) Vertical-spindle disc grinders shall be encircled with a hood 
so constructed that the heavy dust is drawn off a surface of the disc 
and the lighter dust exhausted through a continuous slot at the top of 
the hood as shown in figure D-57.1.
    (x) Grinding and polishing belt hoods shall be constructed as close 
to the operation as possible. The hood should extend almost to the belt, 
and 1-inch (2.54 cm) wide openings should be provided on either side. 
Figure D-57.8 shows a typical hood for a belt operation.

    (6) Scope. This paragraph (g), prescribes the use of exhaust hood 
enclosures and systems in removing dust, dirt, fumes, and gases 
generated through the grinding, polishing, or buffing of ferrous and 
nonferrous metals.
    (h) Spray finishing operations--(1) Definitions applicable to this 
paragraph--(i) Spray-finishing operations. Spray-finishing operations 
are employment of methods wherein organic or inorganic materials are 
utilized in dispersed form for deposit on surfaces to be coated, 
treated, or cleaned. Such methods of deposit may involve either 
automatic, manual, or electrostatic deposition but do not include metal 
spraying or metallizing, dipping, flow coating, roller coating, 
tumbling, centrifuging, or spray washing and degreasing as conducted in 
self-contained washing and degreasing machines or systems.
    (ii) Spray booth. Spray booths are defined and described in 
Sec. 1926.66(a). (See sections 103, 104, and 105 of the Standard for 
Spray Finishing Using Flammable and Combustible Materials, NFPA No. 33-
1969).
    (iii) Spray room. A spray room is a room in which spray-finishing 
operations not conducted in a spray booth are performed separately from 
other areas.

booth has an adequate air replacement system, the velocity of air into 
all openings of a spray booth shall be not less than that specified in 
Table D-57.7 for the operating conditions specified. An adequate air 
replacement system is one which introduces replacement air upstream or 
above the object being sprayed and is so designed that the velocity of 
air in the booth cross section is not less than that specified in Table 
D-57.7 when measured upstream or above the object being sprayed.

  (1) Attention is invited to the fact that the effectiveness of the spray booth is dependent upon the          
  relationship of the depth of the booth to its height and width.                                               
  (2) Crossdrafts can be eliminated through proper design and such design should be sought. Crossdrafts in      
  excess of 100fpm (feet per minute) should not be permitted.                                                   
  (3) Excessive air pressures result in loss of both efficiency and material waste in addition to creating a    
  backlash that may carry overspray and fumes into adjacent work areas.                                         
  (4) Booths should be designed with velocities shown in the column headed ``Design.'' However, booths operating
  with velocities shown in the column headed ``Range'' are in compliance with this standard.                    
                                                                                                                

    (ii) In addition to the requirements in paragraph (h)(6)(i) of this 
section the total air volume exhausted through a spray booth shall be 
such as to dilute solvent vapor to at least 25 percent of the lower 
explosive limit of the solvent being sprayed. An example of the method 
of calculating this volume is given below.

    Example: To determine the lower explosive limits of the most common 
solvents used in spray finishing, see Table D-57.8. Column 1 gives the 
number of cubic feet of vapor per gallon of solvent and column 2 gives 
the lower explosive limit (LEL) in percentage by volume of air. Note 
that the quantity of solvent will be diminished by the quantity of 
solids and nonflammables contained in the finish.
    To determine the volume of air in cubic feet necessary to dilute the 
vapor from 1 gallon of solvent to 25 percent of the lower explosive 
limit, apply the following formula:

Dilution volume required per gallon of solvent=4 (100-LEL) (cubic feet 
of vapor per gallon)<divide> LEL

Using toluene as the solvent.
    (1) LEL of toluene from Table D-57.8, column 2, is 1.4 percent.
    (2) Cubic feet of vapor per gallon from Table D-57.8, column 1, is 
30.4 cubic feet per gallon.
    (3) Dilution volume required=


4 (100-1.4) 30.4<divide> 1.4=8,564 cubic feet.

    (4) To convert to cubic feet per minute of required ventilation, 
multiply the dilution volume required per gallon of solvent by the 
number of gallons of solvent evaporated per minute.

    (iii)(A) When an operator is in a booth downstream of the object 
being sprayed, an air-supplied respirator or other type of respirator 
approved by NIOSH under 42 CFR Part 84 for the material being sprayed 
should be used by the operator.
    (B) Where downdraft booths are provided with doors, such doors shall 
be closed when spray painting.
    (7) Make-up air. (i) Clean fresh air, free of contamination from 
adjacent industrial exhaust systems, chimneys, stacks, or vents, shall 
be supplied to a spray booth or room in quantities equal to the volume 
of air exhausted through the spray booth.
    (ii) Where a spray booth or room receives make-up air through self-
closing

[[Page 64]]

doors, dampers, or louvers, they shall be fully open at all times when 
the booth or room is in use for spraying. The velocity of air through 
such doors, dampers, or louvers shall not exceed 200 feet per minute. If 
the fan characteristics are such that the required air flow through the 
booth will be provided, higher velocities through the doors, dampers, or 
louvers may be used.
    (iii) (A) Where the air supply to a spray booth or room is filtered, 
the fan static pressure shall be calculated on the assumption that the 
filters are dirty to the extent that they require cleaning or 
replacement.
    (B) The rating of filters shall be governed by test data supplied by 
the manufacturer of the filter. A pressure gage shall be installed to 
show the pressure drop across the filters. This gage shall be marked to 
show the pressure drop at which the filters require cleaning or 
replacement. Filters shall be replaced or cleaned whenever the pressure 
drop across them becomes excessive or whenever the air flow through the 
face of the booth falls below that specified in Table D-57.7.
    (iv) (A) Means for heating make-up air to any spray booth or room, 
before or at the time spraying is normally performed, shall be provided 
in all places where the outdoor temperature may be expected to remain 
below 55 deg.F. (12.77 deg.C.) for appreciable periods of time during 
the operation of the booth except where adequate and safe means of 
radiant heating for all operating personnel affected is provided. The 
replacement air during the heating seasons shall be maintained at not 
less than 65 deg.F. (18.33 deg.C.) at the point of entry into the spray 
booth or spray room. When otherwise unheated make-up air would be at a 
temperature of more than 10 deg.F. below room temperature, its 
temperature shall be regulated as provided in section 3.6.3 of ANSI 
Z9.2-1960.
    (B) As an alternative to an air replacement system complying with 
the preceding section, general heating of the building in which the 
spray room or booth is located may be employed provided that all 
occupied parts of the building are maintained at not less than 65 deg.F. 
(18.33 deg.C.) when the exhaust system is in operation or the general 
heating system supplemented by other sources of heat may be employed to 
meet this requirement.
    (C) No means of heating make-up air shall be located in a spray 
booth.
    (D) Where make-up air is heated by coal or oil, the products of 
combustion shall not be allowed to mix with the make-up air, and the 
products of combustion shall be conducted outside the building through a 
flue terminating at a point remote from all points where make-up air 
enters the building.
    (E) Where make-up air is heated by gas, and the products of 
combustion are not mixed with the make-up air but are conducted through 
an independent flue to a point outside the building remote from all 
points where make-up air enters the building, it is not necessary to 
comply with paragraph (h)(7)(iv)(F) of this section.
    (F) Where make-up air to any manually operated spray booth or room 
is heated by gas and the products of combustion are allowed to mix with 
the supply air, the following precautions must be taken:
    (1) The gas must have a distinctive and strong enough odor to warn 
workmen in a spray booth or room of its presence if in an unburned state 
in the make-up air.
    (2) The maximum rate of gas supply to the make-up air heater burners 
must not exceed that which would yield in excess of 200 p.p.m. (parts 
per million) of carbon monoxide or 2,000 p.p.m. of total combustible 
gases in the mixture if the unburned gas upon the occurrence of flame 
failure were mixed with all of the make-up air supplied.
    (3) A fan must be provided to deliver the mixture of heated air and 
products of combustion from the plenum chamber housing the gas burners 
to the spray booth or room.
    (8) Scope. Spray booths or spray rooms are to be used to enclose or 
confine all spray finishing operations covered by this paragraph (h). 
This paragraph does not apply to the spraying of the exteriors of 
buildings, fixed tanks, or similar structures, nor to small portable 
spraying apparatus not used repeatedly in the same location.

    (i) Open surface tanks--(1) General. (i) This paragraph applies to 
all operations involving the immersion of materials in liquids, or in 
the vapors of such liquids, for the purpose of cleaning or altering the 
surface or adding to or imparting a finish thereto or changing the 
character of the materials, and their subsequent removal from the liquid 
or vapor, draining, and drying. These operations include washing, 
electroplating, anodizing, pickling, quenching, dying, dipping, tanning, 
dressing, bleaching, degreasing, alkaline cleaning, stripping, rinsing, 
digesting, and other similar operations.
    (ii) Except where specific construction specifications are 
prescribed in this section, hoods, ducts, elbows, fans, blowers, and all 
other exhaust system parts, components, and supports thereof shall be so 
constructed as to meet conditions of service and to facilitate 
maintenance and shall conform in construction to the specifications 
contained in American National Standard Fundamentals Governing the 
Design and Operation of Local Exhaust Systems, Z9.2-1960.
    (2) Classification of open-surface tank operations. (i) Open-surface 
tank operations shall be classified into 16 classes, numbered A-1 to D-
4, inclusive.
    (ii) Determination of class. Class is determined by two factors, 
hazard potential designated by a letter from A to D, inclusive, and rate 
of gas, vapor, or mist evolution designated by a number from 1 to 4, 
inclusive (for example, B.3).
    (iii) Hazard potential is an index, on a scale of from A to D, 
inclusive, of the severity of the hazard associated with the substance 
contained in the tank because of the toxic, flammable, or explosive 
nature of the vapor, gas, or mist produced therefrom. The toxic hazard 
is determined from the concentration, measured in parts by volume of a 
gas or vapor, per million parts by volume of contaminated air (p.p.m.), 
or in milligrams of mist per cubic meter of air (mg./m. <SUP>3</SUP>), 
below which ill effects are unlikely to occur to the exposed worker. The 
concentrations shall be those in Sec. 1926.55 or other pertinent 
sections of this part.
    (iv) The relative fire or explosion hazard is measured in degrees 
Fahrenheit in terms of the closed-cup flash point of the substance in 
the tank. Detailed information on the prevention of fire hazards in dip 
tanks may be found in Dip Tanks Containing Flammable or Combustible 
Liquids, NFPA No. 34-1966, National Fire Protection Association. Where 
the tank contains a mixture of liquids, other than organic solvents, 
whose effects are additive, the hygienic standard of the most toxic 
component (for example, the one having the lowest p.p.m. or mg./m. 
<SUP>3</SUP>) shall be used, except where such substance constitutes an 
insignificantly small fraction of the mixture. For mixtures of organic 
solvents, their combined effect, rather than that of either 
individually, shall determine the hazard potential. In the absence of 
information to the contrary, the effects shall be considered as 
additive. If the sum of the ratios of the airborne concentration of each 
contaminant to the toxic concentration of that contaminant exceeds 
unity, the toxic concentration shall be considered to have been 
exceeded. (See Note A to paragraph (i)(2)(v) of this section.)
    (v) Hazard potential shall be determined from Table D-57.9, with the 
value indicating greater hazard being used. When the hazardous material 
may be either a vapor with a threshhold limit value (TLV) in p.p.m. or a 
mist with a TLV in mg./m.<INF>3</INF>, the TLV indicating the greater 
hazard shall be used (for example, A takes precedence over B or C; B 
over C; C over D).


    Note A:

(c<INF>1</INF><divide>TLV<INF>1</INF>)+(c<INF>2</INF><divide>TLV<INF>2</INF>)

    (vi) Rate of gas, vapor, or mist evolution is a numerical index, on 
a scale of from 1 to 4, inclusive, both of the relative capacity of the 
tank to produce gas, vapor, or mist and of the relative energy with 
which it is projected or carried upwards from the tank. Rate is 
evaluated in terms of
    (A) The temperature of the liquid in the tank in degrees Fahrenheit;
    (B) The number of degrees Fahrenheit that this temperature is below 
the boiling point of the liquid in degrees Fahrenheit;
    (C) The relative evaporation of the liquid in still air at room 
temperature in an arbitrary scale--fast, medium, slow, or nil; and
    (D) The extent that the tank gases or produces mist in an arbitrary 
scale--high, medium, low, and nil. (See Table D-57.10, Note 2.) Gassing 
depends upon electrochemical or mechanical processes, the effects of 
which have to be individually evaluated for each installation (see Table 
D-57.10, Note 3).
    (vii) Rate of evolution shall be determined from Table D-57.10. When 
evaporation and gassing yield different rates, the lowest numerical 
value shall be used.

\1\ In certain classes of equipment, specifically vapor degreasers, an internal condenser or vapor level        
  thermostat is used to prevent the vapor from leaving the tank during normal operation. In such cases, rate of 
  vapor evolution from the tank into the workroom is not dependent upon the factors listed in the table, but    
  rather upon abnormalities of operating procedure, such as carryout of vapors from excessively fast action,    
  dragout of liquid by entrainment in parts, contamination of solvent by water and other materials, or improper 
  heat balance. When operating procedure is excellent, effective rate of evolution may be taken as 4. When      
  operating procedure is average, the effective rate of evolution may be taken as 3. When operation is poor, a  
  rate of 2 or 1 is indicated, depending upon observed conditions.                                              
\2\ Relative evaporation rate is determined according to the methods described by A. K. Doolittle in Industrial 
  and Engineering Chemistry, vol. 27, p. 1169, (3) where time for 100-percent evaporation is as follows: Fast: 0-
  3 hours; Medium: 3-12 hours; Slow: 12-50 hours; Nil: more than 50 hours.                                      
\3\ Gassing means the formation by chemical or electrochemical action of minute bubbles of gas under the surface
  of the liquid in the tank and is generally limited to aqueous solutions.                                      
                                                                                                                

    (3) Ventilation. Where ventilation is used to control potential 
exposures to workers as defined in paragraph (i)(2)(iii) of this 
section, it shall be adequate to reduce the concentration of the air 
contaminant to the degree that a hazard to the worker does not exist. 
Methods of ventilation are discussed in American National Standard 
Fundamentals Governing the Design and Operation of Local Exhaust 
Systems, Z9.2-1960.
    (4) Control requirements. (i) Control velocities shall conform to 
Table D-57.11 in all cases where the flow of air past the breathing or 
working zone of the operator and into the hoods is undisturbed by local 
environmental conditions, such as open windows, wall fans, unit heaters, 
or moving machinery.
    (ii) All tanks exhausted by means of hoods which
    (A) Project over the entire tank;
    (B) Are fixed in position in such a location that the head of the 
workman, in all his normal operating positions while working at the 
tank, is in front of all hood openings; and
    (C) Are completely enclosed on at least two sides, shall be 
considered to be exhausted through an enclosing hood.
    (D) The quantity of air in cubic feet per minute necessary to be 
exhausted through an enclosing hood shall be not

[[Page 67]]

less than the product of the control velocity times the net area of all 
openings in the enclosure through which air can flow into the hood.

\2\ Do not use canopy hood for Hazard Potential A processes.                                                    
\3\ Where complete control of hot water is desired, design as next highest class.                               
\4\ General room ventilation required.                                                                          
                                                                                                                

    (iii) All tanks exhausted by means of hoods which do not project 
over the entire tank, and in which the direction of air movement into 
the hood or hoods is substantially horizontal, shall be considered to be 
laterally exhausted. The quantity of air in cubic feet per minute 
necessary to be laterally exhausted per square foot of tank area in 
order to maintain the required control velocity shall be determined from 
Table D-57.12 for all variations in ratio of tank width (W) to tank 
length (L). The total quantity of air in cubic feet per minute required 
to be exhausted per tank shall be not less than the product of the area 
of tank surface times the cubic feet per minute per square foot of tank 
area, determined from Table D-57.12.
    (A) For lateral exhaust hoods over 42 inches (1.06 m) wide, or where 
it is desirable to reduce the amount of air removed from the workroom, 
air supply slots or orifices shall be provided along the side or the 
center of the tank opposite from the exhaust slots. The design of such 
systems shall meet the following criteria:
    (1) The supply air volume plus the entrained air shall not exceed 50 
percent of the exhaust volume.
    (2) The velocity of the supply airstream as it reaches the effective 
control area of the exhaust slot shall be less than the effective 
velocity over the exhaust slot area.

\1\ It is not practicable to ventilate across the long dimension of a tank whose ratio W/L exceeds 2.0.         
It is undesirable to do so when W/L exceeds 1.0. For circular tanks with lateral exhaust along up to 1/2 the    
  circumference, use W/L=1.0; for over one-half the circumference use W/L=0.5.                                  
\2\ Baffle is a vertical plate the same length as the tank, and with the top of the plate as high as the tank is
  wide. If the exhaust hood is on the side of a tank against a building wall or close to it, it is perfectly    
  baffled.                                                                                                      
\3\ Use W/2 as tank width in computing when manifold is along centerline, or when hoods are used on two parallel
  sides of a tank.

Tank Width (W) means the effective width over which the hood must pull air to operate (for example, where the   
  hood face is set back from the edge of the tank, this set back must be added in measuring tank width). The    
  surface area of tanks can frequently be reduced and better control obtained (particularly on conveyorized     
  systems) by using covers extending from the upper edges of the slots toward the center of the tank.           

    (3) The vertical height of the receiving exhaust hood, including any 
baffle, shall not be less than one-quarter the width of the tank.
    (4) The supply airstream shall not be allowed to impinge on 
obstructions between it and the exhaust slot in such a manner as to 
significantly interfere with the performance of the exhaust hood.
    (5) Since most failure of push-pull systems result from excessive 
supply air volumes and pressures, methods of measuring and adjusting the 
supply air shall be provided. When satisfactory control has been 
achieved, the adjustable features of the hood shall be fixed so that 
they will not be altered.
    (iv) All tanks exhausted by means of hoods which project over the 
entire tank, and which do not conform to the definition of enclosing 
hoods, shall be considered to be overhead canopy hoods. The quantity of 
air in cubic feet per minute necessary to be exhausted through a canopy 
hood shall be not less than the product of the control velocity times 
the net area of all openings between the bottom edges of the hood and 
the top edges of the tank.
    (v) The rate of vapor evolution (including steam or products of 
combustion) from the process shall be estimated. If the rate of vapor 
evolution is equal to or greater than 10 percent of the calculated 
exhaust volume required, the exhaust volume shall be increased in equal 
amount.
    (5) Spray cleaning and degreasing. Wherever spraying or other 
mechanical means are used to disperse a liquid above an open-surface 
tank, control must be provided for the airborne spray. Such operations 
shall be enclosed as completely as possible. The inward air velocity 
into the enclosure shall be sufficient to prevent the discharge of spray 
into the workroom. Mechanical baffles may be used to help prevent the 
discharge of spray. Spray painting operations are covered by paragraph 
(h) of this section.
    (6) Control means other than ventilation. Tank covers, foams, beads, 
chips, or other materials floating on the tank surface so as to confine 
gases, mists, or vapors to the area under the cover or to the foam, 
bead, or chip layer; or surface tension depressive agents added to the 
liquid in the tank to minimize mist formation, or any combination 
thereof, may all be used as gas, mist, or vapor control means for open-
surface tank operations, provided that they effectively reduce the 
concentrations of hazardous materials in the vicinity of the worker 
below the limits set in accordance with paragraph (i)(2) of this 
section.
    (7) System design. (i) The equipment for exhausting air shall have 
sufficient capacity to produce the flow of air required in each of the 
hoods and openings of the system.
    (ii) The capacity required in paragraph (i)(7)(i) of this section 
shall be obtained when the airflow producing equipment is operating 
against the following pressure losses, the sum of which is the static 
pressure:
    (A) Entrance losses into the hood.
    (B) Resistance to airflow in branch pipe including bends and 
transformations.
    (C) Entrance loss into the main pipe.
    (D) Resistance to airflow in main pipe including bends and 
transformations.
    (E) Resistance of mechanical equipment; that is, filters, washers, 
condensers, absorbers, etc., plus their entrance and exit losses.
    (F) Resistance in outlet duct and discharge stack.
    (iii) Two or more operations shall not be connected to the same 
exhaust system where either one or the combination of the substances 
removed may constitute a fire, explosion, or chemical reaction hazard in 
the duct system. Traps or other devices shall be provided to insure that 
condensate in ducts does not drain back into any tank.
    (iv) The exhaust system, consisting of hoods, ducts, air mover, and 
discharge outlet, shall be designed in accordance with American National 
Standard Fundamentals Governing the Design and Operation of Local 
Exhaust

[[Page 69]]

Systems, Z9.2-1960, or the manual, Industrial Ventilation, published by 
the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists 1970. 
Airflow and pressure loss data provided by the manufacturer of any air 
cleaning device shall be included in the design calculations.
    (8) Operation. (i) The required airflow shall be maintained at all 
times during which gas, mist, or vapor is emitted from the tank, and at 
all times the tank, the draining, or the drying area is in operation or 
use. When the system is first installed, the airflow from each hood 
shall be measured by means of a pitot traverse in the exhaust duct and 
corrective action taken if the flow is less than that required. When the 
proper flow is obtained, the hood static pressure shall be measured and 
recorded. At intervals of not more than 3 months operation, or after a 
prolonged shutdown period, the hoods and duct system shall be inspected 
for evidence of corrosion or damage. In any case where the airflow is 
found to be less than required, it shall be increased to the required 
value. (Information on airflow and static pressure measurement and 
calculations may be found in American National Standard Fundamental 
Governing the Design and Operation of Local Exhaust Systems, Z9.2-1960, 
or in the manual, Industrial Ventilation, published by the American 
Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists.)
    (ii) The exhaust system shall discharge to the outer air in such a 
manner that the possibility of its effluent entering any building is at 
a minimum. Recirculation shall only be through a device for contaminant 
removal which will prevent the creation of a health hazard in the room 
or area to which the air is recirculated.
    (iii) A volume of outside air in the range of 90 percent to 110 
percent of the exhaust volume shall be provided to each room having 
exhaust hoods. The outside air supply shall enter the workroom in such a 
manner as not to be detrimental to any exhaust hood. The airflow of the 
makeup air system shall be measured on installation. Corrective action 
shall be taken when the airflow is below that required. The makeup air 
shall be uncontaminated.
    (9) Personal protection. (i) All employees working in and around 
open-surface tank operations must be instructed as to the hazards of 
their respective jobs, and in the personal protection and first aid 
procedures applicable to these hazards.
    (ii) All persons required to work in such a manner that their feet 
may become wet shall be provided with rubber or other impervious boots 
or shoes, rubbers, or wooden-soled shoes sufficient to keep feet dry.
    (iii) All persons required to handle work wet with a liquid other 
than water shall be provided with gloves impervious to such a liquid and 
of a length sufficient to prevent entrance of liquid into the tops of 
the gloves. The interior of gloves shall be kept free from corrosive or 
irritating contaminants.
    (iv) All persons required to work in such a manner that their 
clothing may become wet shall be provided with such aprons, coats, 
jackets, sleeves, or other garments made of rubber, or of other 
materials impervious to liquids other than water, as are required to 
keep their clothing dry. Aprons shall extend well below the top of boots 
to prevent liquid splashing into the boots. Provision of dry, clean, 
cotton clothing along with rubber shoes or short boots and an apron 
impervious to liquids other than water shall be considered a 
satisfactory substitute where small parts are cleaned, plated, or acid 
dipped in open tanks and rapid work is required.
    (v) Whenever there is a danger of splashing, for example, when 
additions are made manually to the tanks, or when acids and chemicals 
are removed from the tanks, the employees so engaged shall be required 
to wear either tight-fitting chemical goggles or an effective face 
shield. See Sec. 1926.102.
    (vi) When, during the emergencies specified in paragraph (i)(11)(v) 
of this section, employees must be in areas where concentrations of air 
contaminants are greater than the limits set by paragraph (i)(2)(iii) of 
this section or oxygen concentrations are less than 19.5 percent, they 
must use respirators that reduce their exposure to a level below these 
limits or that provide adequate oxygen. Such respirators must

[[Page 70]]

also be provided in marked, quickly-accessible storage compartments 
built for this purpose when the possibility exists of accidental release 
of hazardous concentrations of air contaminants. Respirators must be 
approved by NIOSH under 42 CFR part 84, selected by a competent 
industrial hygienist or other technically-qualified source, and used in 
accordance with 29 CFR 1926.103.
    (vii) Near each tank containing a liquid which may burn, irritate, 
or otherwise be harmful to the skin if splashed upon the worker's body, 
there shall be a supply of clean cold water. The water pipe (carrying a 
pressure not exceeding 25 pounds (11.325 kg)) shall be provided with a 
quick opening valve and at least 48 inches (1.216 m) of hose not smaller 
than three-fourths inch, so that no time may be lost in washing off 
liquids from the skin or clothing. Alternatively, deluge showers and eye 
flushes shall be provided in cases where harmful chemicals may be 
splashed on parts of the body.
    (viii) Operators with sores, burns, or other skin lesions requiring 
medical treatment shall not be allowed to work at their regular 
operations until so authorized by a physician. Any small skin abrasions, 
cuts, rash, or open sores which are found or reported shall be treated 
by a properly designated person so that chances of exposures to the 
chemicals are removed. Workers exposed to chromic acids shall have a 
periodic examination made of the nostrils and other parts of the body, 
to detect incipient ulceration.
    (ix) Sufficient washing facilities, including soap, individual 
towels, and hot water, shall be provided for all persons required to use 
or handle any liquids which may burn, irritate, or otherwise be harmful 
to the skin, on the basis of at least one basin (or its equivalent) with 
a hot water faucet for every 10 employees. See Sec. 1926.51(f).
    (x) Locker space or equivalent clothing storage facilities shall be 
provided to prevent contamination of street clothing.
    (xi) First aid facilities specific to the hazards of the operations 
conducted shall be readily available.
    (10) Special precautions for cyanide. Dikes or other arrangements 
shall be provided to prevent the possibility of intermixing of cyanide 
and acid in the event of tank rupture.
    (11) Inspection, maintenance, and installation. (i) Floors and 
platforms around tanks shall be prevented from becoming slippery both by 
original type of construction and by frequent flushing. They shall be 
firm, sound, and of the design and construction to minimize the 
possibility of tripping.
    (ii) Before cleaning the interior of any tank, the contents shall be 
drained off, and the cleanout doors shall be opened where provided. All 
pockets in tanks or pits, where it is possible for hazardous vapors to 
collect, shall be ventilated and cleared of such vapors.
    (iii) Tanks which have been drained to permit employees to enter for 
the purposes of cleaning, inspection, or maintenance may contain 
atmospheres which are hazardous to life or health, through the presence 
of flammable or toxic air contaminants, or through the absence of 
sufficient oxygen. Before employees shall be permitted to enter any such 
tank, appropriate tests of the atmosphere shall be made to determine if 
the limits set by paragraph (i)(2)(iii) of this section are exceeded, or 
if the oxygen concentration is less than 19.5 percent.
    (iv) If the tests made in accordance with paragraph (i)(11)(iii) of 
this section indicate that the atmosphere in the tank is unsafe, before 
any employee is permitted to enter the tank, the tank shall be 
ventilated until the hazardous atmosphere is removed, and ventilation 
shall be continued so as to prevent the occurrence of a hazardous 
atmosphere as long as an employee is in the tank.
    (v) If, in emergencies, such as rescue work, it is necessary to 
enter a tank which may contain a hazardous atmosphere, suitable 
respirators, such as self-contained breathing apparatus; hose mask with 
blower, if there is a possibility of oxygen deficiency; or a gas mask, 
selected and operated in accordance with paragraph (i)(9)(vi) of this 
section, shall be used. If a contaminant in the tank can cause 
dermatitis, or be absorbed through the skin, the employee entering the 
tank shall also wear protective clothing. At least one trained standby 
employee,

[[Page 71]]

with suitable respirator, shall be present in the nearest uncontaminated 
area. The standby employee must be able to communicate with the employee 
in the tank and be able to haul him out of the tank with a lifeline if 
necessary.
    (vi) Maintenance work requiring welding or open flame, where toxic 
metal fumes such as cadmium, chromium, or lead may be evolved, shall be 
done only with sufficient local exhaust ventilation to prevent the 
creation of a health hazard, or be done with respirators selected and 
used in accordance with paragraph (i)(9)(vi) of this section. Welding, 
or the use of open flames near any solvent cleaning equipment shall be 
permitted only after such equipment has first been thoroughly cleared of 
solvents and vapors.
    (12) Vapor degreasing tanks. (i) In any vapor degreasing tank 
equipped with a condenser or vapor level thermostat, the condenser or 
thermostat shall keep the level of vapors below the top edge of the tank 
by a distance at least equal to one-half the tank width, or at least 36 
inches (0.912 m), whichever is shorter.
    (ii) Where gas is used as a fuel for heating vapor degreasing tanks, 
the combustion chamber shall be of tight construction, except for such 
openings as the exhaust flue, and those that are necessary for supplying 
air for combustion. Flues shall be of corrosion-resistant construction 
and shall extend to the outer air. If mechanical exhaust is used on this 
flue, a draft diverter shall be used. Special precautions must be taken 
to prevent solvent fumes from entering the combustion air of this or any 
other heater when chlorinated or fluorinated hydrocarbon solvents (for 
example, trichloroethylene, Freon) are used.
    (iii) Heating elements shall be so designed and maintained that 
their surface temperature will not cause the solvent or mixture to 
decompose, break down, or be converted into an excessive quantity of 
vapor.
    (iv) Tanks or machines of more than 4 square feet (0.368 m\2\) of 
vapor area, used for solvent cleaning or vapor degreasing, shall be 
equipped with suitable cleanout or sludge doors located near the bottom 
of each tank or still. These doors shall be so designed and gasketed 
that there will be no leakage of solvent when they are closed.
    (13) Scope. (i) This paragraph (i) applies to all operations 
involving the immersion of materials in liquids, or in the vapors of 
such liquids, for the purpose of cleaning or altering their surfaces, or 
adding or imparting a finish thereto, or changing the character of the 
materials, and their subsequent removal from the liquids or vapors, 
draining, and drying. Such operations include washing, electroplating, 
anodizing, pickling, quenching, dyeing, dipping, tanning, dressing, 
bleaching, degreasing, alkaline cleaning, stripping, rinsing, digesting, 
and other similar operations, but do not include molten materials 
handling operations, or surface coating operations.
    (ii) Molten materials handling operations means all operations, 
other than welding, burning, and soldering operations, involving the 
use, melting, smelting, or pouring of metals, alloys, salts, or other 
similar substances in the molten state. Such operations also include 
heat treating baths, descaling baths, die casting stereotyping, 
galvanizing, tinning, and similar operations.
    (iii) Surface coating operations means all operations involving the 
application of protective, decorative, adhesive, or strengthening 
coating or impregnation to one or more surfaces, or into the interstices 
of any object or material, by means of spraying, spreading, flowing, 
brushing, roll coating, pouring, cementing, or similar means; and any 
subsequent draining or drying operations, excluding open-tank

made from breathing zone air samples collected over a 15 minute sampling 
period.
    (ii) Representative employee exposure shall be determined on the 
basis of one or more samples representing full shift exposure for each 
shift for each job classification in each work area where exposure to 
MDA may occur.
    (iii) Where the employer can document that exposure levels are 
equivalent for similar operations in different work shifts, the employer 
shall only be required to determine representative employee exposure for 
that operation during one shift.
    (2) Initial monitoring. Each employer who has a workplace or work 
operation covered by this standard shall perform initial monitoring to 
determine accurately the airborne concentrations of MDA to which 
employees may be exposed unless:
    (i) The employer can demonstrate, on the basis of objective data, 
that the MDA-containing product or material being handled cannot cause 
exposures above the standard's action level, even under worst-case 
release conditions; or
    (ii) The employer has historical monitoring or other data 
demonstrating that exposures on a particular job will be below the 
action level.
    (3) Periodic monitoring and monitoring frequency. (i) If the 
monitoring required by paragraph (f)(2) of this section reveals employee 
exposure at or above the action level, but at or below the PELs, the 
employer shall repeat such monitoring for each such employee at least 
every six (6) months.
    (ii) If the monitoring required by paragraph (f)(2) of this section 
reveals employee exposure above the PELs, the employer shall repeat such 
monitoring for each such employee at least every three (3) months.
    (iii) Employers who are conducting MDA operations within a regulated 
area can forego periodic monitoring if the employees are all wearing 
supplied-air respirators while working in the regulated area.
    (iv) The employer may alter the monitoring schedule from every three 
months to every six months for any employee for whom two consecutive 
measurements taken at least 7 days apart indicate that the employee 
exposure has decreased to below the PELs but above the action level.
    (4) Termination of monitoring. (i) If the initial monitoring 
required by paragraph (f)(2) of this section reveals employee exposure 
to be below the action level, the employer may discontinue the 
monitoring for that employee, except as otherwise required by paragraph 
(f)(5) of this section.
    (ii) If the periodic monitoring required by paragraph (f)(3) of this 
section reveals that employee exposures, as indicated by at least two 
consecutive measurements taken at least 7 days apart, are below the 
action level the employer may discontinue the monitoring for that 
employee, except as otherwise required by paragraph (f)(5) of this 
section.
    (5) Additional monitoring. The employer shall institute the exposure 
monitoring required under paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section 
when there has been a change in production process, chemicals present, 
control equipment, personnel, or work practices which may result in new 
or additional exposures to MDA, or when the employer has any reason to 
suspect a change which may result in new or additional exposures.

[[Page 75]]

    (6) Accuracy of monitoring. Monitoring shall be accurate, to a 
confidence level of 95 percent, to within plus or minus 25 percent for 
airborne concentrations of MDA.
    (7) Employee notification of monitoring results. (i) The employer 
shall, within 15 working days after the receipt of the results of any 
monitoring performed under this standard, notify each employee of these 
results, in writing, either individually or by posting of results in an 
appropriate location that is accessible to affected employees.
    (ii) The written notification required by paragraph (f)(7)(i) of 
this section shall contain the corrective action being taken by the 
employer or any other protective measures which have been implemented to 
reduce the employee exposure to or below the PELs, wherever the PELs are 
exceeded.
    (8) Visual monitoring. The employer shall make routine inspections 
of employee hands, face and forearms potentially exposed to MDA. Other 
potential dermal exposures reported by the employee must be referred to 
the appropriate medical personnel for observation. If the employer 
determines that the employee has been exposed to MDA the employer shall:
    (i) Determine the source of exposure;
    (ii) Implement protective measures to correct the hazard; and
    (iii) Maintain records of the corrective actions in accordance with 
paragraph (n) of this section.
    (g) Regulated areas--(1) Establishment--(i) Airborne exposures. The 
employer shall establish regulated areas where airborne concentrations 
of MDA exceed or can reasonably be expected to exceed, the permissible 
exposure limits.
    (ii) Dermal exposures. Where employees are subject to ``dermal 
exposure to MDA'' the employer shall establish those work areas as 
regulated areas.
    (2) Demarcation. Regulated areas shall be demarcated from the rest 
of the workplace in a manner that minimizes the number of persons 
potentially exposed.
    (3) Access. Access to regulated areas shall be limited to authorized 
persons.
    (4) Personal protective equipment and clothing. Each person entering 
a regulated area shall be supplied with, and required to use, the 
appropriate personal protective clothing and equipment in accordance 
with paragraphs (i) and (j) of this section.
    (5) Prohibited activities. The employer shall ensure that employees 
do not eat, drink, smoke, chew tobacco or gum, or apply cosmetics in 
regulated areas.
    (h) Methods of compliance--(1) Engineering controls and work 
practices and respirators. (i) The employer shall use one or any 
combination of the following control methods to achieve compliance with 
the permissible exposure limits prescribed by paragraph (c) of this 
section:
    (A) Local exhaust ventilation equipped with HEPA filter dust 
collection systems;
    (B) General ventilation systems;
    (C) Use of workpractices; or
    (D) Other engineering controls such as isolation and enclosure that 
the Assistant Secretary can show to be feasible.
    (ii) Wherever the feasible engineering controls and work practices 
``which can be instituted are not sufficient to reduce employee exposure 
to or below the PELs, the employer shall use them to reduce employee 
exposure to the lowest levels achievable by these controls and shall 
supplement them by the use of respiratory protective devices which 
comply with the requirements of paragraph (i) of this section.
    (2) Special Provisions. For workers engaged in spray application 
methods, respiratory protection must be used in addition to feasible 
engineering controls and work practices to reduce employee exposure to 
or below the PELs.
    (3) Prohibitions. Compressed air shall not be used to remove MDA, 
unless the compressed air is used in conjunction with an enclosed 
ventilation system designed to capture the dust cloud created by the 
compressed air.
    (4) Employee rotation. The employer shall not use employee rotation 
as a means of compliance with the exposure limits prescribed in 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (5) Compliance program. (i) The employer shall establish and 
implement a written program to reduce employee exposure to or below the 
PELs by means of engineering and work practice controls, as required by 
paragraph

[[Page 76]]

(h)(1) of this section, and by use of respiratory protection where 
permitted under this section.
    (ii) Upon request this written program shall be furnished for 
examination and copying to the Assistant Secretary, the Director, 
affected employees and designated employee representatives. The employer 
shall review and, as necessary, update such plans at least once every 12 
months to make certain they reflect the current status of the program.

could affect the employee's job status, the

[[Page 80]]

employee may designate an appropriate and mutually acceptable second 
physician:
    (A) To review any findings, determinations or recommendations of the 
initial physician; and
    (B) To conduct such examinations, consultations, and laboratory 
tests as the second physician deems necessary to facilitate this review.
    (ii) The employer shall promptly notify an employee of the right to 
seek a second medical opinion after each occasion that an initial

this section. The employer may condition its participation in, and 
payment for, the multiple physician review mechanism upon the employee 
doing the following within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the 
foregoing notification, or receipt of the initial physician's written 
opinion, whichever is later:
    (A) The employee informing the employer that he or she intends to 
seek a second medical opinion, and
    (B) The employee initiating steps to make an appointment with a 
second physician.
    (iii) If the findings, determinations, or recommendations of the 
second physician differ from those of the initial physician, then the 
employer and the employee shall assure that efforts are made for the two 
physicians to resolve any disagreement.
    (iv) If the two physicians have been unable to quickly resolve their 
disagreement, then the employer and the employee through their 
respective physicians shall designate a third physician:
    (A) To review any findings, determinations, or recommendations of 
the prior physicians; and
    (B) To conduct such examinations, consultations, laboratory tests, 
and discussions with the prior physicians as the third physician deems 
necessary to resolve the disagreement of the prior physicians.
    (v) The employer shall act consistent with the findings,

examinations of the affected employee.
    (ii) The employer shall provide the foregoing information to a 
second physician under this section upon request either by the second 
physician, or by the employee.
    (8) Physician's written opinion. (i) For each examination under this 
section, the employer shall obtain, and provide the employee with a copy 
of, the examining physician's written opinion within 15 days of its 
receipt. The written opinion shall include the following:
    (A) The occupationally pertinent results of the medical examination 
and tests;
    (B) The physician's opinion concerning whether the employee has any 
detected medical conditions which would place the employee at increased 
risk of material impairment of health from exposure to MDA;
    (C) The physician's recommended limitations upon the employee's 
exposure to MDA or upon the employee's use of protective clothing or 
equipment and respirators; and
    (D) A statement that the employee has been informed by the physician 
of the results of the medical examination and any medical conditions 
resulting from MDA exposure which require further explanation or 
treatment.
    (ii) The written opinion obtained by the employer shall not reveal 
specific findings or diagnoses unrelated to occupational exposures.
    (9) Medical removal--(i) Temporary medical removal of an employee--
(A) Temporary removal resulting from occupational exposure. The employee 
shall be removed from work environments in which exposure to MDA is at 
or above

[[Page 81]]

the action level or where dermal exposure to MDA may occur, following an 
initial examination (paragraph (n)(2) of this section), periodic 
examinations (paragraph (n)(3) of this section), an emergency situation 
(paragraph (n)(4) of this section), or an additional examination 
(paragraph (n)(5) of this section) in the following circumstances:
    (1) When the employee exhibits signs and/or symptoms indicative of 
acute exposure to MDA; or
    (2) When the examining physician determines that an employee's 
abnormal liver function tests are not associated with MDA exposure but 
that the abnormalities may be exacerbated as a result of occupational 
exposure to MDA.
    (B) Temporary removal due to a final medical determination. (1) The 
employer shall remove an employee from work having an exposure to MDA at 
or above the action level or where the potential for dermal exposure 
exists on each occasion that a final medical determination results in a 
medical finding, determination, or opinion that the employee has a 
detected medical condition which places the employee at increased risk 
of material impairment to health from exposure to MDA.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, the phrase ``final medical 
determination'' shall mean the outcome of the physician review mechanism 
used pursuant to the medical surveillance provisions of this section.
    (3) Where a final medical determination results in any recommended 
special protective measures for an employee, or limitations on an 
employee's exposure to MDA, the employer shall implement and act 
consistent with the recommendation.
    (ii) Return of the employee to former job status. (A) The employer 
shall return an employee to his or her former job status:
    (1) When the employee no longer shows signs or symptoms of exposure 
to MDA, or upon the advice of the physician.
    (2) When a subsequent final medical determination results in a 
medical finding, determination, or opinion that the employee no longer 
has a detected medical condition which places the employee at increased 
risk of material impairment to health from exposure to MDA.
    (B) For the purposes of this section, the requirement that an 
employer return an employee to his or her former job status is not 
intended to expand upon or restrict any rights an employee has or would 
have had, absent temporary medical removal, to a specific job 
classification or position under the terms of a collective bargaining 
agreement.
    (iii) Removal of other employee special protective measure or 
limitations. The employer shall remove any limitations placed on an 
employee or end any special protective measures provided to an employee 
pursuant to a final medical determination when a subsequent final 
medical determination indicates that the limitations or special 
protective measures are no longer necessary.
    (iv) Employer options pending a final medical determination. Where 
the physician review mechanism used pursuant to the medical surveillance 
provisions of this section, has not yet resulted in a final medical 
determination with respect to an employee, the employer shall act as 
follows:
    (A) Removal. The employer may remove the employee from exposure to 
MDA, provide special protective measures to the employee, or place 
limitations upon the employee, consistent with the medical findings, 
determinations, or recommendations of the physician who has reviewed the 
employee's health status.
    (B) Return. The employer may return the employee to his or her 
former job status, and end any special protective measures provided to 
the employee, consistent with the medical findings, determinations, or 
recommendations of any of the physicians who have reviewed the 
employee's health status, with two exceptions:
    (1) If the initial removal, special protection, or limitation of the 
employee resulted from a final medical determination which differed from 
the findings, determinations, or recommendations of the initial 
physician; or
    (2) The employee has been on removal status for the preceding six 
months as a result of exposure to MDA, then the employer shall await a 
final medical determination.

[[Page 82]]

    (v) Medical removal protection benefits--(A) Provisions of medical 
removal protection benefits. The employer shall provide to an employee 
up to six (6) months of medical removal protection benefits on each 
occasion that an employee is removed from exposure to MDA or otherwise 
limited pursuant to this section.
    (B) Definition of medical removal protection benefits. For the 
purposes of this section, the requirement that an employer provide 
medical removal protection benefits means that the employer shall 
maintain the earnings, seniority, and other employment rights and 
benefits of an employee as though the employee had not been removed from 
normal exposure to MDA or otherwise limited.
    (C) Follow-up medical surveillance during the period of employee 
removal or limitations. During the period of time that an employee is 
removed from normal exposure to MDA or otherwise limited, the employer 
may condition the provision of medical removal protection benefits upon 
the employee's participation in follow-up medical surveillance made 
available pursuant to this section.
    (D) Workers' compensation claims. If a removed employee files a 
claim for workers' compensation payments for a MDA-related disability, 
then the employer shall continue to provide medical removal protection 
benefits pending disposition of the claim. To the extent that an award 
is made to the employee for earnings lost during the period of removal, 
the employer's medical removal protection obligation shall be reduced by 
such amount. The employer shall receive no credit for workers' 
compensation payments received by the employee for treatment-related 
expenses.
    (E) Other credits. The employer's obligation to provide medical 
removal protection benefits to a removed employee shall be reduced to 
the extent that the employee receives compensation for earnings lost 
during the period of removal either from a publicly or employer-funded 
compensation program, or receives income from employment with any 
employer made possible by virtue of the employee's removal.
    (F) Employees who do not recover within the 6 months of removal. The 
employer shall take the following measures with respect to any employee 
removed from exposure to MDA:
    (1) The employer shall make available to the employee a medical 
examination pursuant to this section to obtain a final medical 
determination with respect to the employee;
    (2) The employer shall assure that the final medical determination 
obtained indicates whether or not the employee may be returned to his or 
her former job status, and, if not, what steps should be taken to 
protect the employee's health;
    (3) Where the final medical determination has not yet been obtained, 
or once obtained indicates that the employee may not yet be returned to 
his or her former job status, the employer shall continue to provide 
medical removal protection benefits to the employee until either the 
employee is returned to former job status, or a final medical 
determination is made that the employee is incapable of ever safely 
returning to his or her former job status; and
    (4) Where the employer acts pursuant to a final medical 
determination which permits the return of the employee to his or her 
former job status despite what would otherwise be an unacceptable liver 
function test, later questions concerning removing the employee again 
shall be decided by a final medical determination. The employer need not 
automatically remove such an employee pursuant to the MDA removal 
criteria provided by this section.
    (vi) Voluntary removal or restriction of an employee. Where an 
employer, although not required by this section to do so, removes an 
employee from exposure to MDA or otherwise places limitations on an 
employee due to the effects of MDA exposure on the employee's medical 
condition, the employer shall provide medical removal protection 
benefits to the employee equal to that required by paragraph (n)(9)(v) 
of this section.
    (o) Recordkeeping--(1) Objective data for exempted operations. (i) 
Where the employer has relied on objective data that demonstrate that 
products made

[[Page 83]]

from or containing MDA are not capable of releasing MDA or do not 
present a dermal exposure problem under the expected conditions of 
processing, use, or handling to exempt such operations from the initial 
monitoring requirements under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the 
employer shall establish and maintain an accurate record of objective 
data reasonably relied upon in support of the exemption.
    (ii) The record shall include at least the following information:
    (A) The product qualifying for exemption;
    (B) The source of the objective data;
    (C) The testing protocol, results of testing, and/or analysis of the 
material for the release of MDA;
    (D) A description of the operation exempted and how the data support 
the exemption; and
    (E) Other data relevant to the operations, materials, processing, or 
employee exposures covered by the exemption.
    (iii) The employer shall maintain this record for the duration of 
the employer's reliance upon such objective data.
    (2) Historical monitoring data. (i) Where the employer has relied on 
historical monitoring data that demonstrate that exposures on a 
particular job will be below the action level to exempt such operations 
from the initial monitoring requirements under paragraph (f)(2) of this 
section, the employer shall establish and maintain an accurate record of 
historical monitoring data reasonably relied upon in support of the 
exception.
    (ii) The record shall include information that reflect the following

<R05>
Sec. 1926.62  Lead.

    (a) Scope. This section applies to all construction work where an 
employee may be occupationally exposed to lead. All construction work 
excluded from coverage in the general industry standard for lead by 29 
CFR 1910.1025(a)(2) is covered by this standard. Construction work is 
defined as work for construction, alteration and/or repair, including 
painting and decorating. It includes but is not limited to the 
following:

    (1) Demolition or salvage of structures where lead or materials 
containing lead are present;
    (2) Removal or encapsulation of materials containing lead;
    (3) New construction, alteration, repair, or renovation of 
structures, substrates, or portions thereof, that contain lead, or 
materials containing lead;
    (4) Installation of products containing lead;
    (5) Lead contamination/emergency cleanup;
    (6) Transportation, disposal, storage, or containment of lead or 
materials containing lead on the site or location at which construction 
activities are performed, and
    (7) Maintenance operations associated with the construction 
activities described in this paragraph.

    (b) Definitions.
    Action level means employee exposure, without regard to the use of 
respirators, to an airborne concentration of lead of 30 micrograms per 
cubic meter of air (30 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP>) calculated as an 8-hour 
time-weighted average (TWA).
    Assistant Secretary means the Assistant Secretary of Labor for 
Occupational Safety and Health, U.S. Department of Labor, or designee.
    Competent person means one who is capable of identifying existing 
and predictable lead hazards in the surroundings or working conditions 
and who has authorization to take prompt corrective measures to 
eliminate them.
    Director means the Director, National Institute for Occupational 
Safety and Health (NIOSH), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 
or designee.
    Lead means metallic lead, all inorganic lead compounds, and organic 
lead

[[Page 86]]

soaps. Excluded from this definition are all other organic lead 
compounds.
    This section means this standard.
    (c) Permissible exposure limit. (1) The employer shall assure that 
no employee is exposed to lead at concentrations greater than fifty 
micrograms per cubic meter of air (50 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP>) averaged 
over an 8-hour period.
    (2) If an employee is exposed to lead for more than 8 hours in any 
work day the employees' allowable exposure, as a time weighted average 
(TWA) for that day, shall be reduced according to the following formula:

    Allowable employee exposure (in <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP>)=400 
divided by hours worked in the day.

    (3) When respirators are used to limit employee exposure as required 
under paragraph (c) of this section and all the requirements of 
paragraphs (e)(1) and (f) of this section have been met, employee 
exposure may be considered to be at the level provided by the protection 
factor of the respirator for those periods the respirator is worn. Those 
periods may be averaged with exposure levels during periods when 
respirators are not worn to determine the employee's daily TWA exposure.
    (d) Exposure assessment--(1) General. (i) Each employer who has a 
workplace or operation covered by this standard shall initially 
determine if any employee may be exposed to lead at or above the action 
level.
    (ii) For the purposes of paragraph (d) of this section, employee 
exposure is that exposure which would occur if the employee were not 
using a respirator.
    (iii) With the exception of monitoring under paragraph (d)(3), where 
monitoring is required under this section, the employer shall collect 
personal samples representative of a full shift including at least one 
sample for each job classification in each work area either for each 
shift or for the shift with the highest exposure level.
    (iv) Full shift personal samples shall be representative of the 
monitored employee's regular, daily exposure to lead.
    (2) Protection of employees during assessment of exposure. (i) With 
respect to the lead related tasks listed in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this 
section, where lead is present, until the employer performs an employee 
exposure assessment as required in paragraph (d) of this section and 
documents that the employee performing any of the listed tasks is not 
exposed above the PEL, the employer shall treat the employee as if the 
employee were exposed above the PEL, and not in excess of ten (10) times 
the PEL, and shall implement employee protective measures prescribed in 
paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section. The tasks covered by this 
requirement are:
    (A) Where lead containing coatings or paint are present: Manual 
demolition of structures (e.g, dry wall), manual scraping, manual 
sanding, heat gun applications, and power tool cleaning with dust 
collection systems;
    (B) Spray painting with lead paint.
    (ii) In addition, with regard to tasks not listed in paragraph 
(d)(2)(i), where the employee has any reason to believe that an employee 
performing the task may be exposed to lead in excess of the PEL, until 
the employer performs an employee exposure assessment as required by 
paragraph (d) of this section and documents that the employee's lead 
exposure is not above the PEL the employer shall treat the employee as 
if the employee were exposed above the PEL and shall implememt employee 
protective measures as prescribed in paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this 
section.
    (iii) With respect to the tasks listed in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of 
this section, where lead is present, until the employer performs an 
employee exposure assessment as required in paragraph (d) of this 
section, and documents that the employee performing any of the listed 
tasks is not exposed in excess of 500 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP>, the 
employer shall treat the employee as if the employee were exposed to 
lead in excess of 500 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> and shall implement 
employee protective measures as prescribed in paragraph (d)(2)(v) of 
this section. Where the employer does establish that the employee is 
exposed to levels of lead below 500 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP>, the 
employer may provide the exposed employee with the appropriate 
respirator prescribed for such use at such lower exposures, in 
accordance with Table 1 of this section. The tasks covered by this 
requirement are:
    (A) Using lead containing mortar; lead burning

[[Page 87]]

    (B) Where lead containing coatings or paint are present: rivet 
busting; power tool cleaning without dust collection systems; cleanup 
activities where dry expendable abrasives are used; and abrasive 
blasting enclosure movement and removal.
    (iv) With respect to the tasks listed in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of 
this section, where lead is present, until the employer performs an 
employee exposure assessment as required in paragraph (d) of this 
section and documents that the employee performing any of the listed 
tasks is not exposed to lead in excess of 2,500 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> 
(50 x PEL), the employer shall treat the employee as if the employee 
were exposed to lead in excess of 2,500 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> and 
shall implement employee protective measures as prescribed in paragraph 
(d)(2)(v) of this section. Where the employer does establish that the 
employee is exposed to levels of lead below 2,500 <greek-m>g/m3, the 
employer may provide the exposed employee with the appropriate 
respirator prescribed for use at such lower exposures, in accordance 
with Table I of this section. Interim protection as described in this 
paragaraph is required where lead containing coatings or paint are 
present on structures when performing:
    (A) Abrasive blasting,
    (B) Welding,
    (C) Cutting, and
    (D) Torch burning.
    (v) Until the employer performs an employee exposure assessment as 
required under paragraph (d) of this section and determines actual 
employee exposure, the employer shall provide to employees performing 
the tasks described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i), (d)(2)(ii), (d)(2)(iii), 
and (d)(2)(iv) of this section with interim protection as follows:
    (A) Appropriate respiratory protection in accordance with paragraph 
(f) of this section.
    (B) Appropriate personal protective clothing and equipment in 
accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
    (C) Change areas in accordance with paragraph (i)(2) of this 
section.
    (D) Hand washing facilities in accordance with paragraph (i)(5) of 
this section.
    (E) Biological monitoring in accordance with paragraph (j)(1)(i) of 
this section, to consist of blood sampling and analysis for lead and 
zinc protoporphyrin levels, and
    (F) Training as required under paragraph (l)(1)(i) of this section 
regarding 29 CFR 1926.59, Hazard Communication; training as required 
under paragraph (l)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, regarding use of 
respirators; and training in accordance with 29 CFR 1926.21, Safety 
training and education.
    (3) Basis of initial determination. (i) Except as provided under 
paragraphs (d)(3)(iii) and (d)(3)(iv) of this section the employer shall 
monitor employee exposures and shall base initial determinations on the 
employee exposure monitoring results and any of the following, relevant 
considerations:
    (A) Any information, observations, or calculations which would 
indicate employee exposure to lead;
    (B) Any previous measurements of airborne lead; and
    (C) Any employee complaints of symptoms which may be attributable to 
exposure to lead.
    (ii) Monitoring for the initial determination where performed may be 
limited to a representative sample of the exposed employees who the 
employer reasonably believes are exposed to the greatest airborne 
concentrations of lead in the workplace.
    (iii) Where the employer has previously monitored for lead 
exposures, and the data were obtained within the past 12 months during 
work operations conducted under workplace conditions closely resembling 
the processes, type of material, control methods, work practices, and 
environmental conditions used and prevailing in the employer's current 
operations, the employer may rely on such earlier monitoring results to 
satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (d)(3)(i) and (d)(6) of this 
section if the sampling and analytical methods meet the accuracy and 
confidence levels of paragraph (d)(10) of this section.
    (iv) Where the employer has objective data, demonstrating that a 
particular product or material containing lead or a specific process, 
operation or activity involving lead cannot result in employee exposure 
to lead at or above the action level during processing, use, or 
handling, the employer may rely

[[Page 88]]

upon such data instead of implementing initial monitoring.
    (A) The employer shall establish and maintain an accurate record 
documenting the nature and relevancy of objective data as specified in 
paragraph (n)(4) of this section, where used in assessing employee 
exposure in lieu of exposure monitoring.
    (B) Objective data, as described in paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this 
section, is not permitted to be used for exposure assessment in 
connection with paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (4) Positive initial determination and initial monitoring. (i) Where 
a determination conducted under paragraphs (d) (1), (2) and (3) of this 
section shows the possibility of any employee exposure at or above the 
action level the employer shall conduct monitoring which is 
representative of the exposure for each employee in the workplace who is 
exposed to lead.
    (ii) Where the employer has previously monitored for lead exposure, 
and the data were obtained within the past 12 months during work 
operations conducted under workplace conditions closely resembling the 
processes, type of material, control methods, work practices, and 
environmental conditions used and prevailing in the employer's current 
operations, the employer may rely on such earlier monitoring results to 
satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section if the 
sampling and analytical methods meet the accuracy and confidence levels 
of paragraph (d)(10) of this section.
    (5) Negative initial determination. Where a determination, conducted 
under paragraphs (d) (1), (2), and (3) of this section is made that no 
employee is exposed to airborne concentrations of lead at or above the 
action level the employer shall make a written record of such 
determination. The record shall include at least the information 
specified in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section and shall also include 
the date of determination, location within the worksite, and the name 
and social security number of each employee monitored.
    (6) Frequency. (i) If the initial determination reveals employee 
exposure to be below the action level further exposure determination 
need not be repeated except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(7) of 
this section.
    (ii) If the initial determination or subsequent determination 
reveals employee exposure to be at or above the action level but at or 
below the PEL the employer shall perform monitoring in accordance with 
this paragraph at least every 6 months. The employer shall continue 
monitoring at the required frequency until at least two consecutive 
measurements, taken at least 7 days apart, are below the action level at 
which time the employer may discontinue monitoring for that employee 
except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(7) of this section.
    (iii) If the initial determination reveals that employee exposure is 
above the PEL the employer shall perform monitoring quarterly. The 
employer shall continue monitoring at the required frequency until at 
least two consecutive measurements, taken at least 7 days apart, are at 
or below the PEL but at or above the action level at which time the 
employer shall repeat monitoring for that employee at the frequency 
specified in paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of this section, except as otherwise 
provided in paragraph (d)(7) of this section. The employer shall 
continue monitoring at the required frequency until at least two 
consecutive measurements, taken at least 7 days apart, are below the 
action level at which time the employer may discontinue monitoring for 
that employee except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(7) of this 
section.
    (7) Additional exposure assessments. Whenever there has been a 
change of equipment, process, control, personnel or a new task has been 
initiated that may result in additional employees being exposed to lead 
at or above the action level or may result in employees already exposed 
at or above the action level being exposed above the PEL, the employer 
shall conduct additional monitoring in accordance with this paragraph.
    (8) Employee notification. (i) Within 5 working days after 
completion of the exposure assessment the employer shall notify each 
employee in writing of the results which represent that employee's 
exposure.

[[Page 89]]

    (ii) Whenever the results indicate that the representative employee 
exposure, without regard to respirators, is at or above the PEL the 
employer shall include in the written notice a statement that the 
employees exposure was at or above that level and a description of the 
corrective action taken or to be taken to reduce exposure to below that 
level.
    (9) Accuracy of measurement. The employer shall use a method of 
monitoring and analysis which has an accuracy (to a confidence level of 
95%) of not less than plus or minus 25 percent for airborne 
concentrations of lead equal to or greater than 30<greek-m>g/m\3\.
    (e) Methods of compliance. (1) Engineering and work practice 
controls. The employer shall implement engineering and work practice 
controls, including administrative controls, to reduce and maintain 
employee exposure to lead to or below the permissible exposure limit to 
the extent that such controls are feasible. Wherever all feasible 
engineering and work practices controls that can be instituted are not 
sufficient to reduce employee exposure to or below the permissible 
exposure limit prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, the employer 
shall nonetheless use them to reduce employee exposure to the lowest 
feasible level and shall supplement them by the use of respiratory 
protection that complies with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this 
section.
    (2) Compliance program. (i) Prior to commencement of the job each 
employer shall establish and implement a written compliance program to 
achieve compliance with paragraph (c) of this section.
    (ii) Written plans for these compliance programs shall include at 
least the following:
    (A) A description of each activity in which lead is emitted; e.g. 
equipment used, material involved, controls in place, crew size, 
employee job responsibilities, operating procedures and maintenance 
practices;
    (B) A description of the specific means that will be employed to 
achieve compliance and, where engineering controls are required 
engineering plans and studies used to determine methods selected for 
controlling exposure to lead;
    (C) A report of the technology considered in meeting the PEL;
    (D) Air monitoring data which documents the source of lead 
emissions;
    (E) A detailed schedule for implementation of the program, including 
documentation such as copies of purchase orders for equipment, 
construction contracts, etc.;

    (I) Other relevant information.
    (iii) The compliance program shall provide for frequent and regular 
inspections of job sites, materials, and equipment to be made by a 
competent person.
    (iv) Written programs shall be submitted upon request to any 
affected employee or authorized employee representatives, to the 
Assistant Secretary and the Director, and shall be available at the 
worksite for examination and copying by the Assistant Secretary and the 
Director.
    (v) Written programs shall be revised and updated at least every 6 
months to reflect the current status of the program.
    (3) Mechanical ventilation. When ventilation is used to control lead 
exposure, the employer shall evaluate the mechanical performance of the 
system in controlling exposure as necessary to maintain its 
effectiveness.
    (4) Administrative controls. If administrative controls are used as 
a means of reducing employees TWA exposure to lead, the employer shall 
establish and implement a job rotation schedule which includes:
    (i) Name or identification number of each affected employee;

[[Page 90]]

    (ii) Duration and exposure levels at each job or work station where 
each affected employee is located; and
    (iii) Any other information which may be useful in assessing the 
reliability of administrative controls to reduce exposure to lead.
    (5) The employer shall ensure that, to the extent relevant, 
employees follow good work practices such as described in Appendix B of 
this section.
    (f) Respiratory protection. (1) General. For employees who use 
respirators required by this section, the employer must provide 
respirators that comply with the requirements of this paragraph. 
Respirators must be used during:
    (i) Periods when an employee's exposure to lead exceeds the PEL.
    (ii) Work operations for which engineering and work-practice 
controls are not sufficient to reduce employee exposures to or below the

accessible to employees.
    (iii) The employer shall assure that employees whose airborne 
exposure to lead is above the PEL, without regard to the use of a 
respirator, wash their hands and face prior to eating, drinking, smoking 
or applying cosmetics.
    (iv) The employer shall assure that employees do not enter lunchroom 
facilities or eating areas with protective work clothing or equipment 
unless surface lead dust has been removed by vacuuming, downdraft booth, 
or other cleaning method that limits dispersion of lead dust.
    (5) Hand washing facilities. (i) The employer shall provide adequate 
handwashing facilities for use by employees exposed to lead in 
accordance with 29 CFR 1926.51(f).
    (ii) Where showers are not provided the employer shall assure that 
employees wash their hands and face at the end of the work-shift.
    (j) Medical surveillance--(1) General. (i) The employer shall make 
available initial medical surveillance to employees occupationally 
exposed on any day to lead at or above the action level. Initial medical 
surveillance consists of biological monitoring in the form of blood 
sampling and analysis for lead and zinc protoporphyrin levels.
    (ii) The employer shall institute a medical surveillance program in 
accordance with paragraphs (j)(2) and (j)(3) of this section for all 
employees who are or may be exposed by the employer at or above the 
action level for more than 30 days in any consecutive 12 months;
    (iii) The employer shall assure that all medical examinations and 
procedures are performed by or under the supervision of a licensed 
physician.
    (iv) The employer shall make available the required medical 
surveillance including multiple physician review under paragraph 
(j)(3)(iii) without cost to employees and at a reasonable time and 
place.
    (2) Biological monitoring--(i) Blood lead and ZPP level sampling and 
analysis. The employer shall make available biological monitoring in the 
form of blood sampling and analysis for lead and zinc protoporphyrin 
levels to each employee covered under paragraphs (j)(1)(i) and (ii) of 
this section on the following schedule:
    (A) For each employee covered under paragraph (j)(1)(ii) of this 
section, at least every 2 months for the first 6 months and every 6 
months thereafter;
    (B) For each employee covered under paragraphs (j)(1) (i) or (ii) of 
this section whose last blood sampling and analysis indicated a blood 
lead level at or above 40 <greek-m>g/dl, at least every two months. This 
frequency shall continue until two consecutive blood samples and 
analyses indicate a blood lead level below 40 <greek-m>g/dl; and
    (C) For each employee who is removed from exposure to lead due to an 
elevated blood lead level at least monthly during the removal period.
    (ii) Follow-up blood sampling tests. Whenever the results of a blood 
lead level test indicate that an employee's blood lead level exceeds the 
numerical criterion for medical removal under paragraph (k)(1)(i) of 
this section, the employer shall provide a second (follow-up) blood 
sampling test within two weeks after the employer receives the results 
of the first blood sampling test.
    (iii) Accuracy of blood lead level sampling and analysis. Blood lead 
level sampling and analysis provided pursuant to this section shall have 
an accuracy (to a confidence level of 95 percent) within plus or minus 
15 percent or 6 <greek-m>g/dl, whichever is greater, and shall be 
conducted by a laboratory approved by OSHA.

[[Page 93]]

    (iv) Employee notification. (A) Within five working days after the 
receipt of biological monitoring results, the employer shall notify each 
employee in writing of his or her blood lead level; and
    (B) The employer shall notify each employee whose blood lead level 
exceeds 40 <greek-m>g/dl that the standard requires temporary medical 
removal with Medical Removal Protection benefits when an employee's 
blood lead level exceeds the numerical criterion for medical removal 
under paragraph (k)(1)(i) of this section.
    (3) Medical examinations and consultations--(i) Frequency. The 
employer shall make available medical examinations and consultations to 
each employee covered under paragraph (j)(1)(ii) of this section on the 
following schedule:
    (A) At least annually for each employee for whom a blood sampling 
test conducted at any time during the preceding 12 months indicated a 
blood lead level at or above 40 <greek-m>g/dl;
    (B) As soon as possible, upon notification by an employee either 
that the employee has developed signs or symptoms commonly associated 
with lead intoxication, that the employee desires medical advice 
concerning the effects of current or past exposure to lead on the 
employee's ability to procreate a healthy child, that the employee is 
pregnant, or that the employee has demonstrated difficulty in breathing 
during a respirator fitting test or during use; and
    (C) As medically appropriate for each employee either removed from 
exposure to lead due to a risk of sustaining material impairment to 
health, or otherwise limited pursuant to a final medical determination.
    (ii) Content. The content of medical examinations made available 
pursuant to paragraph (j)(3)(i)(B)-(C) of this section shall be 
determined by an examining physician and, if requested by an employee, 
shall include pregnancy testing or laboratory evaluation of male 
fertility. Medical examinations made available pursuant to paragraph 
(j)(3)(i)(A) of this section shall include the following elements:
    (A) A detailed work history and a medical history, with particular 
attention to past lead exposure (occupational and non-occupational), 
personal habits (smoking, hygiene), and past gastrointestinal, 
hematologic, renal, cardiovascular, reproductive and neurological 
problems;
    (B) A thorough physical examination, with particular attention to 
teeth, gums, hematologic, gastrointestinal, renal, cardiovascular, and 
neurological systems. Pulmonary status should be evaluated if 
respiratory protection will be used;
    (C) A blood pressure measurement;
    (D) A blood sample and analysis which determines:
    (1) Blood lead level;
    (2) Hemoglobin and hematocrit determinations, red cell indices, and 
examination of peripheral smear morphology;
    (3) Zinc protoporphyrin;
    (4) Blood urea nitrogen; and,
    (5) Serum creatinine;
    (E) A routine urinalysis with microscopic examination; and
    (F) Any laboratory or other test relevant to lead exposure which the 
examining physician deems necessary by sound medical practice.
    (iii) Multiple physician review mechanism. (A) If the employer 
selects the initial physician who conducts any medical examination or 
consultation provided to an employee under this section, the employee 
may designate a second physician:
    (1) To review any findings, determinations or recommendations of the 
initial physician; and
    (2) To conduct such examinations, consultations, and laboratory 
tests as the second physician deems necessary to facilitate this review.
    (B) The employer shall promptly notify an employee of the right to 
seek a second medical opinion after each occasion that an initial 
physician conducts a medical examination or consultation pursuant to 
this section. The employer may condition its participation in, and 
payment for, the multiple physician review mechanism upon the employee 
doing the following within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the 
foregoing notification, or receipt of the initial physician's written 
opinion, whichever is later:

[[Page 94]]

    (1) The employee informing the employer that he or she intends to 
seek a second medical opinion, and
    (2) The employee initiating steps to make an appointment with a 
second physician.
    (C) If the findings, determinations or recommendations of the second 
physician differ from those of the initial physician, then the employer 
and the employee shall assure that efforts are made for the two 
physicians to resolve any disagreement.
    (D) If the two physicians have been unable to quickly resolve their 
disagreement, then the employer and the employee through their 
respective physicians shall designate a third physician:
    (1) To review any findings, determinations or recommendations of the 
prior physicians; and
    (2) To conduct such examinations, consultations, laboratory tests 
and discussions with the prior physicians as the third physician deems 
necessary to resolve the disagreement of the prior physicians.
    (E) The employer shall act consistent with the findings, 
determinations and recommendations of the third physician, unless the 
employer and the employee reach an agreement which is otherwise 
consistent with the recommendations of at least one of the three 
physicians.
    (iv) Information provided to examining and consulting physicians. 
(A) The employer shall provide an initial physician conducting a medical 
examination or consultation under this section with the following 
information:
    (1) A copy of this regulation for lead including all Appendices;
    (2) A description of the affected employee's duties as they relate 
to the employee's exposure;
    (3) The employee's exposure level or anticipated exposure level to 
lead and to any other toxic substance (if applicable);
    (4) A description of any personal protective equipment used or to be 
used;
    (5) Prior blood lead determinations; and
    (6) All prior written medical opinions concerning the employee in 
the employer's possession or control.
    (B) The employer shall provide the foregoing information to a second 
or third physician conducting a medical examination or consultation 
under this section upon request either by the second or third physician, 
or by the employee.
    (v) Written medical opinions. (A) The employer shall obtain and 
furnish the employee with a copy of a written medical opinion from each 
examining or consulting physician which contains only the following 
information:
    (1) The physician's opinion as to whether the employee has any 
detected medical condition which would place the employee at increased 
risk of material impairment of the employee's health from exposure to 
lead;
    (2) Any recommended special protective measures to be provided to 
the employee, or limitations to be placed upon the employee's exposure 
to lead;
    (3) Any recommended limitation upon the employee's use of 
respirators, including a determination of whether the employee can wear 
a powered air purifying respirator if a physician determines that the 
employee cannot wear a negative pressure respirator; and
    (4) The results of the blood lead determinations.
    (B) The employer shall instruct each examining and consulting 
physician to:
    (1) Not reveal either in the written opinion or orally, or in any 
other means of communication with the employer, findings, including 
laboratory results, or diagnoses unrelated to an employee's occupational 
exposure to lead; and
    (2) Advise the employee of any medical condition, occupational or 
nonoccupational, which dictates further medical examination or 
treatment.
    (vi) Alternate physician determination mechanisms. The employer and 
an employee or authorized employee representative may agree upon the use 
of any alternate physician determination mechanism in lieu of the 
multiple physician review mechanism provided by paragraph (j)(3)(iii) of 
this section so long as the alternate mechanism is as expeditious and 
protective as the requirements contained in this paragraph.

[[Page 95]]

    (4) Chelation. (i) The employer shall assure that any person whom he 
retains, employs, supervises or controls does not engage in prophylactic 
chelation of any employee at any time.
    (ii) If therapeutic or diagnostic chelation is to be performed by 
any person in paragraph (j)(4)(i) of this section, the employer shall 
assure that it be done under the supervision of a licensed physician in 
a clinical setting with thorough and appropriate medical monitoring and 
that the employee is notified in writing prior to its occurrence.
    (k) Medical removal protection--(1) Temporary medical removal and 
return of an employee--(i) Temporary removal due to elevated blood lead 
level. The employer shall remove an employee from work having an 
exposure to lead at or above the action level on each occasion that a 
periodic and a follow-up blood sampling test conducted pursuant to this 
section indicate that the employee's blood lead level is at or above 50 
<greek-m>g/dl; and,
    (ii) Temporary removal due to a final medical determination. (A) The 
employer shall remove an employee from work having an exposure to lead 
at or above the action level on each occasion that a final medical 
determination results in a medical finding, determination, or opinion 
that the employee has a detected medical condition which places the 
employee at increased risk of material impairment to health from 
exposure to lead.
    (B) For the purposes of this section, the phrase final medical 
determination means the written medical opinion on the employees' health 
status by the examining physician or, where relevant, the outcome of the 
multiple physician review mechanism or alternate medical determination 
mechanism used pursuant to the medical surveillance provisions of this 
section.
    (C) Where a final medical determination results in any recommended 
special protective measures for an employee, or limitations on an 
employee's exposure to lead, the employer shall implement and act 
consistent with the recommendation.
    (iii) Return of the employee to former job status. (A) The employer 
shall return an employee to his or her former job status:
    (1) For an employee removed due to a blood lead level at or above 50 
<greek-m>g/dl when two consecutive blood sampling tests indicate that 
the employee's blood lead level is at or below 40 <greek-m>g/dl;
    (2) For an employee removed due to a final medical determination, 
when a subsequent final medical determination results in a medical 
finding, determination, or opinion that the employee no longer has a 
detected medical condition which places the employee at increased risk 
of material impairment to health from exposure to lead.
    (B) For the purposes of this section, the requirement that an 
employer return an employee to his or her former job status is not 
intended to expand upon or restrict any rights an employee has or would 
have had, absent temporary medical removal, to a specific job 
classification or position under the terms of a collective bargaining 
agreement.
    (iv) Removal of other employee special protective measure or 
limitations. The employer shall remove any limitations placed on an 
employee or end any special protective measures provided to an employee 
pursuant to a final medical determination when a subsequent final 
medical determination indicates that the limitations or special 
protective measures are no longer necessary.
    (v) Employer options pending a final medical determination. Where 
the multiple physician review mechanism, or alternate medical 
determination mechanism used pursuant to the medical surveillance 
provisions of this section, has not yet resulted in a final medical 
determination with respect to an employee, the employer shall act as 
follows:
    (A) Removal. The employer may remove the employee from exposure to 
lead, provide special protective measures to the employee, or place 
limitations upon the employee, consistent with the medical findings, 
determinations, or recommendations of any of the physicians who have 
reviewed the employee's health status.
    (B) Return. The employer may return the employee to his or her 
former job status, end any special protective measures provided to the 
employee,

[[Page 96]]

and remove any limitations placed upon the employee, consistent with the 
medical findings, determinations, or recommendations of any of the 
physicians who have reviewed the employee's health status, with two 
exceptions.
    (1) If the initial removal, special protection, or limitation of the 
employee resulted from a final medical determination which differed from 
the findings, determinations, or recommendations of the initial 
physician or;
    (2) If the employee has been on removal status for the preceding 
eighteen months due to an elevated blood lead level, then the employer 
shall await a final medical determination.
    (2) Medical removal protection benefits--(i) Provision of medical 
removal protection benefits. The employer shall provide an employee up 
to eighteen (18) months of medical removal protection benefits on each 
occasion that an employee is removed from exposure to lead or otherwise 
limited pursuant to this section.
    (ii) Definition of medical removal protection benefits. For the 
purposes of this section, the requirement that an employer provide 
medical removal protection benefits means that, as long as the job the 
employee was removed from continues, the employer shall maintain the 
total normal earnings, seniority and other employment rights and 
benefits of an employee, including the employee's right to his or her 
former job status as though the employee had not been medically removed 
from the employee's job or otherwise medically limited.
    (iii) Follow-up medical surveillance during the period of employee 
removal or limitation. During the period of time that an employee is 
medically removed from his or her job or otherwise medically limited, 
the employer may condition the provision of medical removal protection 
benefits upon the employee's participation in follow-up medical 
surveillance made available pursuant to this section.
    (iv) Workers' compensation claims. If a removed employee files a 
claim for workers' compensation payments for a lead-related disability, 
then the employer shall continue to provide medical removal protection 
benefits pending disposition of the claim. To the extent that an award 
is made to the employee for earnings lost during the period of removal, 
the employer's medical removal protection obligation shall be reduced by 
such amount. The employer shall receive no credit for workers' 
compensation payments received by the employee for treatment- related 
expenses.
    (v) Other credits. The employer's obligation to provide medical 
removal protection benefits to a removed employee shall be reduced to 
the extent that the employee receives compensation for earnings lost 
during the period of removal either from a publicly or employer-funded 
compensation program, or receives income from employment with another 
employer made possible by virtue of the employee's removal.
    (vi) Voluntary removal or restriction of an employee. Where an 
employer, although not required by this section to do so, removes an 
employee from exposure to lead or otherwise places limitations on an 
employee due to the effects of lead exposure on the employee's medical 
condition, the employer shall provide medical removal protection 
benefits to the employee equal to that required by paragraph (k)(2) (i) 
and (ii) of this section.
    (l) Employee information and training--(1) General. (i) The employer 
shall communicate information concerning lead hazards according to the 
requirements of OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard for the 
construction industry, 29 CFR 1926.59, including but not limited to the 
requirements concerning warning signs and labels, material safety data 
sheets (MSDS), and employee information and training. In addition, 
employers shall comply with the following requirements:

   Appendix A to Sec. 1926.62--Substance Data Sheet for Occupational 
                            Exposure to Lead

                       I. Substance Identification

    A. Substance: Pure lead (Pb) is a heavy metal at room temperature 
and pressure and is a basic chemical element. It can combine with 
various other substances to form numerous lead compounds.
    B. Compounds covered by the standard: The word lead when used in 
this interim final standard means elemental lead, all inorganic lead 
compounds and a class of organic lead compounds called lead soaps. This 
standard does not apply to other organic lead compounds.
    C. Uses: Exposure to lead occurs in several different occupations in 
the construction industry, including demolition or salvage of structures 
where lead or lead-containing materials are present; removal or 
encapsulation of lead-containing materials, new construction, 
alteration, repair, or renovation of structures that contain lead or 
materials containing lead; installation of products containing lead. In 
addition, there are construction related activities where exposure to 
lead may occur, including transportation, disposal, storage, or 
containment of lead or materials containing lead on construction sites, 
and maintenance operations associated with construction activities.
    D. Permissible exposure: The permissible exposure limit (PEL) set by 
the standard is 50 micrograms of lead per cubic meter of air (50 
<greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP>), averaged over an 8-hour workday.
    E. Action level: The interim final standard establishes an action 
level of 30 micrograms of lead per cubic meter of air (30 <greek-m>g/
m<SUP>3</SUP>), averaged over an 8-hour workday. The action level 
triggers several ancillary provisions of the standard such as exposure 
monitoring, medical surveillance, and training.

                         II. Health Hazard Data

    A. Ways in which lead enters your body. When absorbed into your body 
in certain doses, lead is a toxic substance. The object of the lead 
standard is to prevent absorption of harmful quantities of lead. The 
standard is intended to protect you not only from the immediate toxic 
effects of lead, but also from the serious toxic effects that may not 
become apparent until years of exposure have passed. Lead can be 
absorbed into your body by inhalation (breathing) and ingestion 
(eating). Lead (except for certain organic lead compounds not covered by 
the standard, such as tetraethyl lead) is not absorbed through your 
skin. When lead is scattered in the air as a dust, fume respiratory 
tract. Inhalation of airborne lead is generally the most important 
source of occupational lead absorption. You can also absorb lead through 
your digestive system if lead gets into your mouth and is swallowed. If 
you handle food, cigarettes, chewing tobacco, or make-up which have lead 
on them or handle them with hands contaminated with lead, this will 
contribute to ingestion. A significant portion of the lead that you 
inhale or ingest gets into your blood stream. Once in your blood stream, 
lead is circulated throughout your body and stored in various organs and 
body tissues. Some of this lead is quickly filtered out of your body and 
excreted, but some remains in the blood and other tissues. As exposure 
to lead continues, the amount stored in your body will increase if you 
are

[[Page 100]]

absorbing more lead than your body is excreting. Even though you may not 
be aware of any immediate symptoms of disease, this lead stored in your 
tissues can be slowly causing irreversible damage, first to individual 
cells, then to your organs and whole body systems.
    B. Effects of overexposure to lead--(1) Short term (acute) 
overexposure. Lead is a potent, systemic poison that serves no known 
useful function once absorbed by your body. Taken in large enough doses, 
lead can kill you in a matter of days. A condition affecting the brain 
called acute encephalopathy may arise which develops quickly to 
seizures, coma, and death from cardiorespiratory arrest. A short term 
dose of lead can lead to acute encephalopathy. Short term occupational 
exposures of this magnitude are highly unusual, but not impossible. 
Similar forms of encephalopathy may, however, arise from extended, 
chronic exposure to lower doses of lead. There is no sharp dividing line 
between rapidly developing acute effects of lead, and chronic effects 
which take longer to acquire. Lead adversely affects numerous body 
systems, and causes forms of health impairment and disease which arise 
after periods of exposure as short as days or as long as several years.
    (2) Long-term (chronic) overexposure. Chronic overexposure to lead 
may result in severe damage to your blood-forming, nervous, urinary and 
reproductive systems. Some common symptoms of chronic overexposure 
include loss of appetite, metallic taste in the mouth, anxiety, 
constipation, nausea, pallor, excessive tiredness, weakness, insomnia, 
headache, nervous irritability, muscle and joint pain or soreness, fine 
tremors, numbness, dizziness, hyperactivity and colic. In lead colic 
there may be severe abdominal pain. Damage to the central nervous system 
in general and the brain (encephalopathy) in particular is one of the 
most severe forms of lead poisoning. The most severe, often fatal, form 
of encephalopathy may be preceded by vomiting, a feeling of dullness 
progressing to drowsiness and stupor, poor memory, restlessness, 
irritability, tremor, and convulsions. It may arise suddenly with the 
onset of seizures, followed by coma, and death. There is a tendency for 
muscular weakness to develop at the same time. This weakness may 
progress to paralysis often observed as a characteristic ``wrist drop'' 
or ``foot drop'' and is a manifestation of a disease to the nervous 
system called peripheral neuropathy. Chronic overexposure to lead also 
results in kidney disease with few, if any, symptoms appearing until 
extensive and most likely permanent kidney damage has occurred. Routine 
laboratory tests reveal the presence of this kidney disease only after 
about two-thirds of kidney function is lost. When overt symptoms of 
urinary dysfunction arise, it is often too late to correct or prevent 
worsening conditions, and progression to kidney dialysis or death is 
possible. Chronic overexposure to lead impairs the reproductive systems 
of both men and women. Overexposure to lead may result in decreased sex 
drive, impotence and sterility in men. Lead can alter the structure of 
sperm cells raising the risk of birth defects. There is evidence of 
miscarriage and stillbirth in women whose husbands were exposed to lead 
or who were exposed to lead themselves. Lead exposure also may result in 
decreased fertility, and abnormal menstrual cycles in women. The course 
of pregnancy may be adversely affected by exposure to lead since lead 
crosses the placental barrier and poses risks to developing fetuses. 
Children born of parents either one of whom were exposed to excess lead 
levels are more likely to have birth defects, mental retardation, 
behavioral disorders or die during the first year of childhood. 
Overexposure to lead also disrupts the blood-forming system resulting in 
decreased hemoglobin (the substance in the blood that carries oxygen to 
the cells) and ultimately anemia. Anemia is characterized by weakness, 
pallor and fatigability as a result of decreased oxygen carrying 
capacity in the blood.
    (3) Health protection goals of the standard. Prevention of adverse 
health effects for most workers from exposure to lead throughout a 
working lifetime requires that a worker's blood lead level (BLL, also 
expressed as PbB) be maintained at or below forty micrograms per 
deciliter of whole blood (40 <greek-m>g/dl). The blood lead levels of 
workers (both male and female workers) who intend to have children 
should be maintained below 30 <greek-m>g/dl to minimize adverse 
reproductive health effects to the parents and to the developing fetus. 
The measurement of your blood lead level (BLL) is the most useful 
indicator of the amount of lead being absorbed by your body. Blood lead 
levels are most often reported in units of milligrams (mg) or micrograms 
(<greek-m>g) of lead (1 mg=1000 <greek-m>g) per 100 grams (100g), 100 
milliliters (100 ml) or deciliter (dl) of blood. These three units are 
essentially the same. Sometime BLLs are expressed in the form of mg% or 
<greek-m>g%. This is a shorthand notation for 100g, 100 ml, or dl. 
(References to BLL measurements in this standard are expressed in the 
form of <greek-m>g/dl.)
    BLL measurements show the amount of lead circulating in your blood 
stream, but do not give any information about the amount of lead stored 
in your various tissues. BLL measurements merely show current absorption 
of lead, not the effect that lead is having on your body or the effects 
that past lead exposure may have already caused. Past research into 
lead-related diseases, however, has focused heavily on associations 
between BLLs and various diseases. As a result, your

[[Page 101]]

BLL is an important indicator of the likelihood that you will gradually 
acquire a lead-related health impairment or disease.
    Once your blood lead level climbs above 40 <greek-m>g/dl, your risk 
of disease increases. There is a wide variability of individual response 
to lead, thus it is difficult to say that a particular BLL in a given 
person will cause a particular effect. Studies have associated fatal 
encephalopathy with BLLs as low as 150 <greek-m>g/dl. Other studies have 
shown other forms of diseases in some workers with BLLs well below 80 
<greek-m>g/dl. Your BLL is a crucial indicator of the risks to your 
health, but one other factor is also extremely important. This factor is 
the length of time you have had elevated BLLs. The longer you have an 
elevated BLL, the greater the risk that large quantities of lead are 
being gradually stored in your organs and tissues (body burden). The 
greater your overall body burden, the greater the chances of substantial 
permanent damage. The best way to prevent all forms of lead-related 
impairments and diseases--both short term and long term--is to maintain 
your BLL below 40 <greek-m>g/dl. The provisions of the standard are 
designed with this end in mind.
    Your employer has prime responsibility to assure that the provisions 
of the standard are complied with both by the company and by individual 
workers. You, as a worker, however, also have a responsibility to assist 
your employer in complying with the standard. You can play a key role in 
protecting your own health by learning about the lead hazards and their 
control, learning what the standard requires, following the standard 
where it governs your own actions, and seeing that your employer 
complies with provisions governing his or her actions.
    (4) Reporting signs and symptoms of health problems. You should 
immediately notify your employer if you develop signs or symptoms 
associated with lead poisoning or if you desire medical advice 
concerning the effects of current or past exposure to lead or your 
ability to have a healthy child. You should also notify your employer if 
you have difficulty breathing during a respirator fit test or while 
wearing a respirator. In each of these cases, your employer must make 
available to you appropriate medical examinations or consultations. 
These must be provided at no cost to you and at a reasonable time and 
place. The standard contains a procedure whereby you can obtain a second 
opinion by a physician of your choice if your employer selected the 
initial physician.

          Appendix B to Sec. 1926.62--Employee Standard Summary

    This appendix summarizes key provisions of the interim final 
standard for lead in construction that you as a worker should become 
familiar with.

           I. Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL)--Paragraph (C)

    The standard sets a permissible exposure limit (PEL) of 50 
micrograms of lead per cubic meter of air (50 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP>), 
averaged over an 8-hour workday which is referred to as a time-weighted 
average (TWA). This is the highest level of lead in air to which you may 
be permissibly exposed over an 8-hour workday. However, since this is an 
8-hour average, short exposures above the PEL are permitted so long as 
for each 8-hour work day your average exposure does not exceed this 
level. This interim final standard, however, takes into account the fact 
that your daily exposure to lead can extend beyond a typical 8-hour 
workday as the result of overtime or other alterations in your work 
schedule. To deal with this situation, the standard contains a formula 
which reduces your permissible exposure when you are exposed more than 8 
hours. For example, if you are exposed to lead for 10 hours a day, the 
maximum permitted average exposure would be 40 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP>.

                 II. Exposure Assessment--Paragraph (D)

    If lead is present in your workplace in any quantity, your employer 
is required to make an initial determination of whether any employee's 
exposure to lead exceeds the action level (30 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> 
averaged over an 8-hour day). Employee exposure is that exposure which 
would occur if the employee were not using a respirator. This initial 
determination requires your employer to monitor workers' exposures 
unless he or she has objective data which can demonstrate conclusively 
that no employee will be exposed to lead in excess of the action level. 
Where objective data is used in lieu of actual monitoring the employer 
must establish and maintain an accurate record, documenting its 
relevancy in assessing exposure levels for current job conditions. If 
such objective data is available, the employer need proceed no further 
on employee exposure assessment until such time that conditions have 
changed and the determination is no longer valid.
    Objective data may be compiled from various sources, e.g., insurance 
companies and trade associations and information from suppliers or 
exposure data collected from similar operations. Objective data may also 
comprise previously-collected sampling data including area monitoring. 
If it cannot be determined through using objective data that worker 
exposure is less than the action level, your employer must conduct 
monitoring or must rely on relevant previous personal sampling, if 
available. Where monitoring is required for the initial determination, 
it may be limited to a representative number of employees who are 
reasonably expected to have the highest exposure levels. If your 
employer has conducted appropriate air sampling for lead in the past 12 
months, he or she may use

[[Page 102]]

these results, provided they are applicable to the same employee tasks 
and exposure conditions and meet the requirements for accuracy as 
specified in the standard. As with objective data, if such results are 
relied upon for the initial determination, your employer must establish 
and maintain a record as to the relevancy of such data to current job 
conditions.
    If there have been any employee complaints of symptoms which may be 
attributable to exposure to lead or if there is any other information or 
observations which would indicate employee exposure to lead, this must 
also be considered as part of the initial determination.
    If this initial determination shows that a reasonable possibility 
exists that any employee may be exposed, without regard to respirators, 
over the action level, your employer must set up an air monitoring 
program to determine the exposure level representative of each employee 
exposed to lead at your workplace. In carrying out this air monitoring 
program, your employer is not required to monitor the exposure of every 
employee, but he or she must monitor a representative number of 
employees and job types. Enough sampling must be done to enable each 
employee's exposure level to be reasonably represent full shift 
exposure. In addition, these air samples must be taken under conditions 
which represent each employee's regular, daily exposure to lead. 
Sampling performed in the past 12 months may be used to determine 
exposures above the action level if such sampling was conducted during 
work activities essentially similar to present work conditions.
    The standard lists certain tasks which may likely result in 
exposures to lead in excess of the PEL and, in some cases, exposures in 
excess of 50 times the PEL. If you are performing any of these tasks, 
your employer must provide you with appropriate respiratory protection, 
protective clothing and equipment, change areas, hand washing 
facilities, biological monitoring, and training until such time that an 
exposure assessment is conducted which demonstrates that your exposure 
level is below the PEL.
    If you are exposed to lead and air sampling is performed, your 
employer is required to notify you in writing within 5 working days of 
the air monitoring results which represent your exposure. If the results 
indicate that your exposure exceeds the PEL (without regard to your use 
of a respirator), then your employer must also notify you of this in 
writing, and provide you with a description of the corrective action 
that has been taken or will be taken to reduce your exposure.
    Your exposure must be rechecked by monitoring, at least every six 
months if your exposure is at or over the action level but below the 
PEL. Your employer may discontinue monitoring for you if 2 consecutive 
measurements, taken at least 7 days apart, are at or below the action 
level. Air monitoring must be repeated every 3 months if you are exposed 
over the PEL. Your employer must continue monitoring for you at this 
frequency until 2 consecutive measurements, taken at least 7 days apart, 
are below the PEL but above the action level, at which time your 
employer must repeat monitoring of your exposure every six months and 
may discontinue monitoring only after your exposure drops to or below 
the action level. However, whenever there is a change of equipment, 
process, control, or personnel or a new type of job is added at your 
workplace which may result in new or additional exposure to lead, your 
employer must perform additional monitoring.

                III. Methods of Compliance--Paragraph (E)

    Your employer is required to assure that no employee is exposed to 
lead in excess of the PEL as an 8-hour TWA. The interim final standard 
for lead in construction requires employers to institute engineering and 
work practice controls including administrative controls to the extent 
feasible to reduce employee exposure to lead. Where such controls are 
feasible but not adequate to reduce exposures below the PEL they must be 
used nonetheless to reduce exposures to the lowest level that can be 
accomplished by these means and then supplemented with appropriate 
respiratory protection.
    Your employer is required to develop and implement a written 
compliance program prior to the commencement of any job where employee 
exposures may reach the PEL as an 8-hour TWA. The interim final standard 
identifies the various elements that must be included in the plan. For 
example, employers are required to include a description of operations 
in which lead is emitted, detailing other relevant information about the 
operation such as the type of equipment used, the type of material 
involved, employee job responsibilities, operating procedures and 
maintenance practices. In addition, your employer's compliance plan must 
specify the means that will be used to achieve compliance and, where 
engineering controls are required, include any engineering plans or 
studies that have been used to select the control methods. If 
administrative controls involving job rotation are used to reduce 
employee exposure to lead, the job rotation schedule must be included in 
the compliance plan. The plan must also detail the type of protective 
clothing and equipment, including respirators, housekeeping and hygiene 
practices that will be used to protect you from the adverse effects of 
exposure to lead.
    The written compliance program must be made available, upon request, 
to affected

[[Page 103]]

employees and their designated representatives, the Assistant Secretary 
and the Director.
    Finally, the plan must be reviewed and updated at least every 6 
months to assure it reflects the current status in exposure control.

                IV. Respiratory Protection--Paragraph (F)

    Your employer is required to provide and assure your use of 
respirators when your exposure to lead is not controlled below the PEL 
by other means. The employer must pay the cost of the respirator. 
Whenever you request one, your employer is also required to provide you 
a respirator even if your air exposure level is not above the PEL. You 
might desire a respirator when, for example, you have received medical 
advice that your lead absorption should be decreased. Or, you may intend 
to have children in the near future, and want to reduce the level of 
lead in your body to minimize adverse reproductive effects. While 
respirators are the least satisfactory means of controlling your 
exposure, they are capable of providing significant protection if 
properly chosen, fitted, worn, cleaned, maintained, and replaced when 
they stop providing adequate protection.
    Your employer is required to select respirators from the types 
listed in Table I of the Respiratory Protection section of the standard 
(Sec. 1926.62 (f)). Any respirator chosen must be approved by the 
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) under the 
provisions of 42 CFR part 84. This respirator selection table will 
enable your employer to choose a type of respirator that will give you a 
proper amount of protection based on your airborne lead exposure. Your 
employer may select a type of respirator that provides greater 
protection than that required by the standard; that is, one recommended 
for a higher concentration of lead than is present in your workplace. 
For example, a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) is much more 
protective than a typical negative pressure respirator, and may also be 
more comfortable to wear. A PAPR has a filter, cartridge, or canister to 
clean the air, and a power source that continuously blows filtered air 
into your breathing zone. Your employer might make a PAPR available to 
you to ease the burden of having to wear a respirator for long periods 
of time. The standard provides that you can obtain a PAPR upon request.
    Your employer must also start a Respiratory Protection Program. This 
program must include written procedures for the proper selection, use, 
cleaning, storage, and maintenance of respirators.
    Your employer must ensure that your respirator facepiece fits 
properly. Proper fit of a respirator facepiece is critical to your 
protection from airborne lead. Obtaining a proper fit on each employee 
may require your employer to make available several different types of 
respirator masks. To ensure that your respirator fits properly and that 
facepiece leakage is minimal, your employer must give you either a 
qualitative or quantitative fit test as specified in Appendix A of the 
Respiratory Protection standard located at 29 CFR 1910.134.
    You must also receive from your employer proper training in the use 
of respirators. Your employer is required to teach you how to wear a 
respirator, to know why it is needed, and to understand its limitations.
    The standard provides that if your respirator uses filter elements, 
you must be given an opportunity to change the filter elements whenever 
an increase in breathing resistance is detected. You also must be 
permitted to periodically leave your work area to wash your face and 
respirator facepiece whenever necessary to prevent skin irritation. If 
you ever have difficulty in breathing during a fit test or while using a 
respirator, your employer must make a medical examination available to 
you to determine whether you can safely wear a respirator. The result of 
this examination may be to give you a positive pressure respirator 
(which reduces breathing resistance) or to provide alternative means of 
protection.

        V. Protective Work Clothing and Equipment--Paragraph (G)

    If you are exposed to lead above the PEL as an 8-hour TWA, without 
regard to your use of a respirator, or if you are exposed to lead 
compounds such as lead arsenate or lead azide which can cause skin and 
eye irritation, your employer must provide you with protective work 
clothing and equipment appropriate for the hazard. If work clothing is 
provided, it must be provided in a clean and dry condition at least 
weekly, and daily if your airborne exposure to lead is greater than 200 
<greek-m>g/m<SUP>3.</SUP> Appropriate protective work clothing and 
equipment can include coveralls or similar full-body work clothing, 
gloves, hats, shoes or disposable shoe coverlets, and face shields or 
vented goggles. Your employer is required to provide all such equipment 
at no cost to you. In addition, your employer is responsible for 
providing repairs and replacement as necessary, and also is responsible 
for the cleaning, laundering or disposal of protective clothing and 
equipment.
    The interim final standard requires that your employer assure that 
you follow good work practices when you are working in areas where your 
exposure to lead may exceed the PEL. With respect to protective clothing 
and equipment, where appropriate, the following procedures should be 
observed prior to beginning work:
    1. Change into work clothing and shoe covers in the clean section of 
the designated changing areas;

[[Page 104]]

    2. Use work garments of appropriate protective gear, including 
respirators before entering the work area; and
    3. Store any clothing not worn under protective clothing in the 
designated changing area.
    Workers should follow these procedures upon leaving the work area:
    1. HEPA vacuum heavily contaminated protective work clothing while 
it is still being worn. At no time may lead be removed from protective 
clothing by any means which result in uncontrolled dispersal of lead 
into the air;
    2. Remove shoe covers and leave them in the work area;
    3. Remove protective clothing and gear in the dirty area of the 
designated changing area. Remove protective coveralls by carefully 
rolling down the garment to reduce exposure to dust.
    4. Remove respirators last; and
    5. Wash hands and face.
    Workers should follow these procedures upon finishing work for the 
day (in addition to procedures described above):
    1. Where applicable, place disposal coveralls and shoe covers with 
the abatement waste;
    2. Contaminated clothing which is to be cleaned, laundered or 
disposed of must be placed in closed containers in the change room.
    3. Clean protective gear, including respirators, according to 
standard procedures;
    4. Wash hands and face again. If showers are available, take a 
shower and wash hair. If shower facilities are not available at the work 
site, shower immediately at home and wash hair.

                     VI. Housekeeping--Paragraph (H)

    Your employer must establish a housekeeping program sufficient to 
maintain all surfaces as free as practicable of accumulations of lead 
dust. Vacuuming is the preferred method of meeting this requirement, and 
the use of compressed air to clean floors and other surfaces is 
generally prohibited unless removal with compressed air is done in 
conjunction with ventilation systems designed to contain dispersal of 
the lead dust. Dry or wet sweeping, shoveling, or brushing may not be 
used except where vacuuming or other equally effective methods have been 
tried and do not work. Vacuums must be used equipped with a special 
filter called a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter and 
emptied in a manner which minimizes the reentry of lead into the 
workplace.

          VII. Hygiene Facilities and Practices--Paragraph (I)

    The standard requires that hand washing facilities be provided where 
occupational exposure to lead occurs. In addition, change areas, showers 
(where feasible), and lunchrooms or eating areas are to be made 
available to workers exposed to lead above the PEL. Your employer must 
assure that except in these facilities, food and beverage is not present 
or consumed, tobacco products are not present or used, and cosmetics are 
not applied, where airborne exposures are above the PEL. Change rooms 
provided by your employer must be equipped with separate storage 
facilities for your protective clothing and equipment and street clothes 
to avoid cross-contamination. After showering, no required protective 
clothing or equipment worn during the shift may be worn home. It is 
important that contaminated clothing or equipment be removed in change 
areas and not be worn home or you will extend your exposure and expose 
your family since lead from your clothing can accumulate in your house, 
car, etc.
    Lunchrooms or eating areas may not be entered with protective 
clothing or equipment unless surface dust has been removed by vacuuming, 
downdraft booth, or other cleaning method. Finally, workers exposed 
above the PEL must wash both their hands and faces prior to eating, 
drinking, smoking or applying cosmetics.
    All of the facilities and hygiene practices just discussed are 
essential to minimize additional sources of lead absorption from 
inhalation or ingestion of lead that may accumulate on you, your 
clothes, or your possessions. Strict compliance with these provisions 
can virtually eliminate several sources of lead exposure which 
significantly contribute to excessive lead absorption.

                VIII. Medical Surveillance--Paragraph (J)

    The medical surveillance program is part of the standard's 
comprehensive approach to the prevention of lead-related disease. Its 
purpose is to supplement the main thrust of the standard which is aimed 
at minimizing airborne concentrations of lead and sources of ingestion. 
Only medical surveillance can determine if the other provisions of the 
standard have affectively protected you as an individual. Compliance 
with the standard's provision will protect most workers from the adverse 
effects of lead exposure, but may not be satisfactory to protect 
individual workers (1) who have high body burdens of lead acquired over 
past years, (2) who have additional uncontrolled sources of non-
occupational lead exposure, (3) who exhibit unusual variations in lead 
absorption rates, or (4) who have specific non-work related medical 
conditions which could be aggravated by lead exposure (e.g., renal 
disease, anemia). In

[[Page 105]]

addition, control systems may fail, or hygiene and respirator programs 
may be inadequate. Periodic medical surveillance of individual workers 
will help detect those failures. Medical surveillance will also be 
important to protect your reproductive ability-regardless of whether you 
are a man or woman.
    All medical surveillance required by the interim final standard must 
be performed by or under the supervision of a licensed physician. The 
employer must provide required medical surveillance without cost to 
employees and at a reasonable time and place. The standard's medical 
surveillance program has two parts--periodic biological monitoring and 
medical examinations. Your employer's obligation to offer you medical 
surveillance is triggered by the results of the air monitoring program. 
Full medical surveillance must be made available to all employees who 
are or may be exposed to lead in excess of the action level for more 
than 30 days a year and whose blood lead level exceeds 40 <greek-m>g/dl. 
Initial medical surveillance consisting of blood sampling and analysis 
for lead and zinc protoporphyrin must be provided to all employees 
exposed at any time (1 day) above the action level.
    Biological monitoring under the standard must be provided at least 
every 2 months for the first 6 months and every 6 months thereafter 
until your blood lead level is below 40 <greek-m>g/dl. A zinc 
protoporphyrin (ZPP) test is a very useful blood test which measures an 
adverse metabolic effect of lead on your body and is therefore an 
indicator of lead toxicity.
    If your BLL exceeds 40 <greek-m>g/dl the monitoring frequency must 
be increased from every 6 months to at least every 2 months and not 
reduced until two consecutive BLLs indicate a blood lead level below 40 
<greek-m>g/dl. Each time your BLL is determined to be over 40 
<greek-m>g/dl, your employer must notify you of this in writing within 
five working days of his or her receipt of the test results. The 
employer must also inform you that the standard requires temporary 
medical removal with economic protection when your BLL exceeds 50 
<greek-m>g/dl. (See Discussion of Medical Removal Protection-Paragraph 
(k).) Anytime your BLL exceeds 50 <greek-m>g/dl your employer must make 
available to you within two weeks of receipt of these test results a 
second follow-up BLL test to confirm your BLL. If the two tests both 
exceed 50 <greek-m>g/dl, and you are temporarily removed, then your 
employer must make successive BLL tests available to you on a monthly 
basis during the period of your removal.
    Medical examinations beyond the initial one must be made available 
on an annual basis if your blood lead level exceeds 40 <greek-m>g/dl at 
any time during the preceding year and you are being exposed above the 
airborne action level of 30 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> for 30 or more days 
per year. The initial examination will provide information to establish 
a baseline to which subsequent data can be compared.
    An initial medical examination to consist of blood sampling and 
analysis for lead and zinc protoporphyrin must also be made available 
(prior to assignment) for each employee being assigned for the first 
time to an area where the airborne concentration of lead equals or 
exceeds the action level at any time. In addition, a medical examination 
or consultation must be made available as soon as possible if you notify 
your employer that you are experiencing signs or symptoms commonly 
associated with lead poisoning or that you have difficulty breathing 
while wearing a respirator or during a respirator fit test. You must 
also be provided a medical examination or consultation if you notify 
your employer that you desire medical advice concerning the effects of 
current or past exposure to lead on your ability to procreate a healthy 
child.
    Finally, appropriate follow-up medical examinations or consultations 
may also be provided for employees who have been temporarily removed 
from exposure under the medical removal protection provisions of the 
standard. (See Part IX, below.)
    The standard specifies the minimum content of pre-assignment and 
annual medical examinations. The content of other types of medical 
examinations and consultations is left up to the sound discretion of the 
examining physician. Pre-assignment and annual medical examinations must 
include (1) a detailed work history and medical history; (2) a thorough 
physical examination, including an evaluation of your pulmonary status 
if you will be required to use a respirator; (3) a blood pressure 
measurement; and (4) a series of laboratory tests designed to check your 
blood chemistry and your kidney function. In addition, at any time upon 
your request, a laboratory evaluation of male fertility will be made 
(microscopic examination of a sperm sample), or a pregnancy test will be 
given.
    The standard does not require that you participate in any of the 
medical procedures, tests, etc. which your employer is required to make 
available to you. Medical surveillance can, however, play a very 
important role in protecting your health. You are strongly encouraged, 
therefore, to participate in a meaningful fashion. The standard contains 
a multiple physician review mechanism which will give you a chance to 
have a physician of your choice directly participate in the medical 
surveillance program. If you are dissatisfied with an examination by a 
physician chosen by your employer, you can select a second physician to 
conduct an independent analysis. The two doctors would attempt to 
resolve any differences of opinion, and select a third physician to 
resolve any firm dispute. Generally your employer will choose the 
physician who conducts medical

[[Page 106]]

surveillance under the lead standard-unless you and your employer can 
agree on the choice of a physician or physicians. Some companies and 
unions have agreed in advance, for example, to use certain independent 
medical laboratories or panels of physicians. Any of these arrangements 
are acceptable so long as required medical surveillance is made 
available to workers.
    The standard requires your employer to provide certain information 
to a physician to aid in his or her examination of you. This information 
includes (1) the standard and its appendices, (2) a description of your 
duties as they relate to occupational lead exposure, (3) your exposure 
level or anticipated exposure level, (4) a description of any personal 
protective equipment you wear, (5) prior blood lead level results, and 
(6) prior written medical opinions concerning you that the employer has. 
After a medical examination or consultation the physician must prepare a 
written report which must contain (1) the physician's opinion as to 
whether you have any medical condition which places you at increased 
risk of material impairment to health from exposure to lead, (2) any 
recommended special protective measures to be provided to you, (3) any 
blood lead level determinations, and (4) any recommended limitation on 
your use of respirators. This last element must include a determination 
of whether you can wear a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) if you 
are found unable to wear a negative pressure respirator.
    The medical surveillance program of the interim lead standard may at 
some point in time serve to notify certain workers that they have 
acquired a disease or other adverse medical condition as a result of 
occupational lead exposure. If this is true, these workers might have 
legal rights to compensation from public agencies, their employers, 
firms that supply hazardous products to their employers, or other 
persons. Some states have laws, including worker compensation laws, that 
disallow a worker who learns of a job-related health impairment to sue, 
unless the worker sues within a short period of time after learning of 
the impairment. (This period of time may be a matter of months or 
years.) An attorney can be consulted about these possibilities. It 
should be stressed that OSHA is in no way trying to either encourage or 
discourage claims or lawsuits. However, since results of the standard's 
medical surveillance program can significantly affect the legal remedies 
of a worker who has acquired a job-related disease or impairment, it is 
proper for OSHA to make you aware of this.
    The medical surveillance section of the standard also contains 
provisions dealing with chelation. Chelation is the use of certain drugs 
(administered in pill form or injected into the body) to reduce the 
amount of lead absorbed in body tissues. Experience accumulated by the 
medical and scientific communities has largely confirmed the 
effectiveness of this type of therapy for the treatment of very severe 
lead poisoning. On the other hand, it has also been established that 
there can be a long list of extremely harmful side effects associated 
with the use of chelating agents. The medical community has balanced the 
advantages and disadvantages resulting from the use of chelating agents 
in various circumstances and has established when the use of these 
agents is acceptable. The standard includes these accepted limitations 
due to a history of abuse of chelation therapy by some lead companies. 
The most widely used chelating agents are calcium disodium EDTA, (Ca Na2 
EDTA), Calcium Disodium Versenate (Versenate), and d-penicillamine 
(pencillamine or Cupramine).
    The standard prohibits ``prophylactic chelation'' of any employee by 
any person the employer retains, supervises or controls. Prophylactic 
chelation is the routine use of chelating or similarly acting drugs to 
prevent elevated blood levels in workers who are occupationally exposed 
to lead, or the use of these drugs to routinely lower blood lead levels 
to predesignated concentrations believed to be ``safe''. It should be 
emphasized that where an employer takes a worker who has no symptoms of 
lead poisoning and has chelation carried out by a physician (either 
inside or outside of a hospital) solely to reduce the worker's blood 
lead level, that will generally be considered prophylactic chelation. 
The use of a hospital and a physician does not mean that prophylactic 
chelation is not being performed. Routine chelation to prevent increased 
or reduce current blood lead levels is unacceptable whatever the 
setting.
    The standard allows the use of ``therapeutic'' or ``diagnostic'' 
chelation if administered under the supervision of a licensed physician 
in a clinical setting with thorough and appropriate medical monitoring. 
Therapeutic chelation responds to severe lead poisoning where there are 
marked symptoms. Diagnostic chelation involved giving a patient a dose 
of the drug then collecting all urine excreted for some period of time 
as an aid to the diagnosis of lead poisoning.
    In cases where the examining physician determines that chelation is 
appropriate, you must be notified in writing of this fact before such 
treatment. This will inform you of a potentially harmful treatment, and 
allow you to obtain a second opinion.

              IX. Medical Removal Protection--Paragraph (K)

    Excessive lead absorption subjects you to increased risk of disease. 
Medical removal protection (MRP) is a means of protecting

[[Page 107]]

you when, for whatever reasons, other methods, such as engineering 
controls, work practices, and respirators, have failed to provide the 
protection you need. MRP involves the temporary removal of a worker from 
his or her regular job to a place of significantly lower exposure 
without any loss of earnings, seniority, or other employment rights or 
benefits. The purpose of this program is to cease further lead 
absorption and allow your body to naturally excrete lead which has 
previously been absorbed. Temporary medical removal can result from an 
elevated blood lead level, or a medical opinion. For up to 18 months, or 
for as long as the job the employee was removed from lasts, protection 
is provided as a result of either form of removal. The vast majority of 
removed workers, however, will return to their former jobs long before 
this eighteen month period expires.
    You may also be removed from exposure even if your blood lead level 
is below 50 <greek-m>g/dl if a final medical determination indicates 
that you temporarily need reduced lead exposure for medical reasons. If 
the physician who is implementing your employers medical program makes a 
final written opinion recommending your removal or other special 
protective measures, your employer must implement the physician's 
recommendation. If you are removed in this manner, you may only be 
returned when the doctor indicates that it is safe for you to do so.
    The standard does not give specific instructions dealing with what 
an employer must do with a removed worker. Your job assignment upon 
removal is a matter for you, your employer and your union (if any) to 
work out consistent with existing procedures for job assignments. Each 
removal must be accomplished in a manner consistent with existing 
collective bargaining relationships. Your employer is given broad 
discretion to implement temporary removals so long as no attempt is made 
to override existing agreements. Similarly, a removed worker is provided 
no right to veto an employer's choice which satisfies the standard.
    In most cases, employers will likely transfer removed employees to 
other jobs with sufficiently low lead exposure. Alternatively, a 
worker's hours may be reduced so that the time weighted average exposure 
is reduced, or he or she may be temporarily laid off if no other 
alternative is feasible.
    In all of these situation, MRP benefits must be provided during the 
period of removal--i.e., you continue to receive the same earnings, 
seniority, and other rights and benefits you would have had if you had 
not been removed. Earnings includes more than just your base wage; it 
includes overtime, shift differentials, incentives, and other 
compensation you would have earned if you had not been removed. During 
the period of removal you must also be provided with appropriate follow-
up medical surveillance. If you were removed because your blood lead 
level was too high, you must be provided with a monthly blood test. If a 
medical opinion caused your removal, you must be provided medical tests 
or examinations that the doctor believes to be appropriate. If you do 
not participate in this follow up medical surveillance, you may lose 
your eligibility for MRP benefits.
    When you are medically eligible to return to your former job, your 
employer must return you to your ``former job status.'' This means that 
you are entitled to the position, wages, benefits, etc., you would have 
had if you had not been removed. If you would still be in your old job 
if no removal had occurred that is where you go back. If not, you are 
returned consistent with whatever job assignment discretion your 
employer would have had if no removal had occurred. MRP only seeks to 
maintain your rights, not expand them or diminish them.
    If you are removed under MRP and you are also eligible for worker 
compensation or other compensation for lost wages, your employer's MRP 
benefits obligation is reduced by the amount that you actually receive 
from these other sources. This is also true if you obtain other 
employment during the time you are laid off with MRP benefits.
    The standard also covers situations where an employer voluntarily 
removes a worker from exposure to lead due to the effects of lead on the 
employee's medical condition, even though the standard does not require 
removal. In these situations MRP benefits must still be provided as 
though the standard required removal. Finally, it is important to note 
that in all cases where removal is required, respirators cannot be used 
as a substitute. Respirators may be used before removal becomes 
necessary, but not as an alternative to a transfer to a low exposure 
job, or to a lay-off with MRP benefits.

           X. Employee Information and Training--Paragraph (L)

    Your employer is required to provide an information and training 
program for all employees exposed to lead above the action level or who 
may suffer skin or eye irritation from lead compounds such as lead 
arsenate or lead azide. The program must train these employees regarding 
the specific hazards associated with their work environment, protective 
measures which can be taken, including the contents of any compliance 
plan in effect, the danger of lead to their bodies (including their 
reproductive systems), and their rights under the standard. All 
employees must be trained prior to initial assignment to areas where 
there is a possibility of exposure over the action level.

[[Page 108]]

    This training program must also be provided at least annually 
thereafter unless further exposure above the action level will not 
occur.

                        XI. Signs--Paragraph (M)

    The standard requires that the following warning sign be posted in 
work areas where the exposure to lead exceeds the PEL:

WARNING
LEAD WORK AREA
POISON
NO SMOKING OR EATING

    These signs are to be posted and maintained in a manner which 
assures that the legend is readily visible.

                    XII. Recordkeeping--Paragraph (N)

    Your employer is required to keep all records of exposure monitoring 
for airborne lead. These records must include the name and job 
classification of employees measured, details of the sampling and 
analytical techniques, the results of this sampling, and the type of 
respiratory protection being worn by the person sampled. Such records 
are to be retained for at least 30 years. Your employer is also required 
to keep all records of biological monitoring and medical examination 
results. These records must include the names of the employees, the 
physician's written opinion, and a copy of the results of the 
examination. Medical records must be preserved and maintained for the 
duration of employment plus 30 years. However, if the employee's 
duration of employment is less than one year, the employer need not 
retain that employee's medical records beyond the period of employment 
if they are provided to the employee upon termination of employment.
    Recordkeeping is also required if you are temporarily removed from 
your job under the medical removal protection program. This record must 
include your name and social security number, the date of your removal 
and return, how the removal was or is being accomplished, and whether or 
not the reason for the removal was an elevated blood lead level. Your 
employer is required to keep each medical removal record only for as 
long as the duration of an employee's employment.
    The standard requires that if you request to see or copy 
environmental monitoring, blood lead level monitoring, or medical 
removal records, they must be made available to you or to a 
representative that you authorize. Your union also has access to these 
records. Medical records other than BLL's must also be provided upon 
request to you, to your physician or to any other person whom you may 
specifically designate. Your union does not have access to your personal 
medical records unless you authorize their access.

             XIII. Observation of Monitoring--Paragraph (O)

    When air monitoring for lead is performed at your workplace as 
required by this standard, your employer must allow you or someone you 
designate to act as an observer of the monitoring. Observers are 
entitled to an explanation of the measurement procedure, and to record 
the results obtained. Since results will not normally be available at 
the time of the monitoring, observers are entitled to record or receive 
the results of the monitoring when returned by the laboratory. Your 
employer is required to provide the observer with any personal 
protective devices required to be worn by employees working in the area 
that is being monitored. The employer must require the observer to wear 
all such equipment and to comply with all other applicable safety and 
health procedures.

                   XIV. Effective Date--Paragraph (P)

    The standard's effective date is June 3, 1993. Employer obligations 
under the standard begin as of that date with full implementation of 
engineering controls as soon as possible but no later than within 4 
months, and all other provisions completed as soon as possible, but no 
later than within 2 months from the effective date.

       Appendix C to Sec. 1926.62--Medical Surveillance Guidelines

                              Introduction

    The primary purpose of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 
1970 is to assure, so far as possible, safe and healthful working 
conditions for every working man and woman. The interim final 
occupational health standard for lead in construction is designed to 
protect workers exposed to inorganic lead including metallic lead, all 
inorganic lead compounds and organic lead soaps.
    Under this interim final standard occupational exposure to inorganic 
lead is to be limited to 50 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> (micrograms per 
cubic meter) based on an 8 hour time-weighted average (TWA). This 
permissible exposure limit

[[Page 109]]

(PEL) must be achieved through a combination of engineering, work 
practice and administrative controls to the extent feasible. Where these 
controls are in place but are found not to reduce employee exposures to 
or below the PEL, they must be used nonetheless, and supplemented with 
respirators to meet the 50 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> exposure limit.
    The standard also provides for a program of biological monitoring 
for employees exposed to lead above the action level at any time, and 
additional medical surveillance for all employees exposed to levels of 
inorganic lead above 30 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> (TWA) for more than 30 
days per year and whose BLL exceeds 40 <greek-m>g/dl.
    The purpose of this document is to outline the medical surveillance 
provisions of the interim standard for inorganic lead in construction, 
and to provide further information to the physician regarding the 
examination and evaluation of workers exposed to inorganic lead.
    Section 1 provides a detailed description of the monitoring 
procedure including the required frequency of blood testing for exposed 
workers, provisions for medical removal protection (MRP), the 
recommended right of the employee to a second medical opinion, and 
notification and recordkeeping requirements of the employer. A 
discussion of the requirements for respirator use and respirator 
monitoring and OSHA's position on prophylactic chelation therapy are 
also included in this section.
    Section 2 discusses the toxic effects and clinical manifestations of 
lead poisoning and effects of lead intoxication on enzymatic pathways in 
heme synthesis. The adverse effects on both male and female reproductive 
capacity and on the fetus are also discussed.
    Section 3 outlines the recommended medical evaluation of the worker 
exposed to inorganic lead, including details of the medical history, 
physical examination, and recommended laboratory tests, which are based 
on the toxic effects of lead as discussed in Section 2.
    Section 4 provides detailed information concerning the laboratory 
tests available for the monitoring of exposed workers. Included also is 
a discussion of the relative value of each test and the limitations and 
precautions which are necessary in the interpretation of the laboratory 
results.

I. Medical Surveillance and Monitoring Requirements for Workers Exposed 
                            to Inorganic Lead

    Under the interim final standard for inorganic lead in the 
construction industry, initial medical surveillance consisting of 
biological monitoring to include blood lead and ZPP level determination 
shall be provided to employees exposed to lead at or above the action 
level on any one day. In addition, a program of biological monitoring is 
to be made available to all employees exposed above the action level at 
any time and additional medical surveillance is to be made available to 
all employees exposed to lead above 30 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> TWA for 
more than 30 days each year and whose BLL exceeds 40 <greek-m>g/dl. This 
program consists of periodic blood sampling and medical evaluation to be 
performed on a schedule which is defined by previous laboratory results, 
worker complaints or concerns, and the clinical assessment of the 
examining physician.
    Under this program, the blood lead level (BLL) of all employees who 
are exposed to lead above 30 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> for more than 30 
days per year or whose blood lead is above 40 <greek-m>g/dl but exposed 
for no more than 30 days per year is to be determined at least every two 
months for the first six months of exposure and every six months 
thereafter. The frequency is increased to every two months for employees 
whose last blood lead level was 40 <greek-m>g/dl or above. For employees 
who are removed from exposure to lead due to an elevated blood lead, a 
new blood lead level must be measured monthly. A zinc protoporphyrin 
(ZPP) measurement is strongly recommended on each occasion that a blood 
lead level measurement is made.
    An annual medical examination and consultation performed under the 
guidelines discussed in Section 3 is to be made available to each 
employee exposed above 30 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> for more than 30 days 
per year for whom a blood test conducted at any time during the 
preceding 12 months indicated a blood lead level at or above 40 
<greek-m>g/dl. Also, an examination is to be given to all employees 
prior to their assignment to an area in which airborne lead 
concentrations reach or exceed the 30 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> for more 
than 30 days per year. In addition, a medical examination must be 
provided as soon as possible after notification by an employee that the 
employee has developed signs or symptoms commonly associated with lead 
intoxication, that the employee desires medical advice regarding lead 
exposure and the ability to procreate a healthy child, or that the 
employee has demonstrated difficulty in breathing during a respirator 
fitting test or during respirator use. An examination is also to be made 
available to each employee removed from exposure to lead due to a risk 
of sustaining material impairment to health, or otherwise limited or 
specially protected pursuant to medical recommendations.
    Results of biological monitoring or the recommendations of an 
examining physician may necessitate removal of an employee from further 
lead exposure pursuant to the standard's medical removal protection 
(MRP) program. The object of the MRP program is to provide temporary 
medical removal to workers either with substantially elevated blood lead 
levels or otherwise at

[[Page 110]]

risk of sustaining material health impairment from continued substantial 
exposure to lead.
    Under the standard's ultimate worker removal criteria, a worker is 
to be removed from any work having an eight hour TWA exposure to lead of 
30 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> when his or her blood lead level reaches 50 
<greek-m>g/dl and is confirmed by a second follow-up blood lead level 
performed within two weeks after the employer receives the results of 
the first blood sampling test. Return of the employee to his or her job 
status depends on a worker's blood lead level declining to 40 
<greek-m>g/dl.
    As part of the interim standard, the employer is required to notify 
in writing each employee whose blood lead level exceeds 40 <greek-m>g/
dl. In addition each such employee is to be informed that the standard 
requires medical removal with MRP benefits, discussed below, when an 
employee's blood lead level exceeds the above defined limit.
    In addition to the above blood lead level criterion, temporary 
worker removal may also take place as a result of medical determinations 
and recommendations. Written medical opinions must be prepared after 
each examination pursuant to the standard. If the examining physician 
includes a medical finding, determination or opinion that the employee 
has a medical condition which places the employee at increased risk of 
material health impairment from exposure to lead, then the employee must 
be removed from exposure to lead at or above 30 <greek-m>g/
m<SUP>3</SUP>. Alternatively, if the examining physician recommends 
special protective measures for an employee (e.g., use of a powered air 
purifying respirator) or recommends limitations on an employee's 
exposure to lead, then the employer must implement these 
recommendations.
    Recommendations may be more stringent than the specific provisions 
of the standard. The examining physician, therefore, is given broad 
flexibility to tailor special protective procedures to the needs of 
individual employees. This flexibility extends to the evaluation and 
management of pregnant workers and male and female workers who are 
planning to raise children. Based on the history, physical examination, 
and laboratory studies, the physician might recommend special protective 
measures or medical removal for an employee who is pregnant or who is 
planning to conceive a child when, in the physician's judgment, 
continued exposure to lead at the current job would pose a significant 
risk. The return of the employee to his or her former job status, or the 
removal of special protections or limitations, depends upon the 
examining physician determining that the employee is no longer at 
increased risk of material impairment or that special measures are no 
longer needed.
    During the period of any form of special protection or removal, the 
employer must maintain the worker's earnings, seniority, and other 
employment rights and benefits (as though the worker had not been 
removed) for a period of up to 18 months or for as long as the job the 
employee was removed from lasts if less than 18 months. This economic 
protection will maximize meaningful worker participation in the medical 
surveillance program, and is appropriate as part of the employer's 
overall obligation to provide a safe and healthful workplace. The 
provisions of MRP benefits during the employee's removal period may, 
however, be conditioned upon participation in medical surveillance.
    The lead standard provides for a multiple physician review in cases 
where the employee wishes a second opinion concerning potential lead 
poisoning or toxicity. If an employee wishes a second opinion, he or she 
can make an appointment with a physician of his or her choice. This 
second physician will review the findings, recommendations or 
determinations of the first physician and conduct any examinations, 
consultations or tests deemed necessary in an attempt to make a final 
medical determination. If the first and second physicians do not agree 
in their assessment they must try to resolve their differences. If they 
cannot reach an agreement then they must designate a third physician to 
resolve the dispute.
    The employer must provide examining and consulting physicians with 
the following specific information: A copy of the lead regulations and 
all appendices, a description of the employee's duties as related to 
exposure, the exposure level or anticipated level to lead and any other 
toxic substances (if applicable), a description of personal protective 
equipment used, blood lead levels, and all prior written medical 
opinions regarding the employee in the employer's possession or control. 
The employer must also obtain from the physician and provide the 
employee with a written medical opinion containing blood lead levels, 
the physicians's opinion as to whether the employee is at risk of 
material impairment to health, any recommended protective measures for 
the employee if further exposure is permitted, as well as any 
recommended limitations upon an employee's use of respirators.
    Employers must instruct each physician not to reveal to the employer 
in writing or in any other way his or her findings, laboratory results, 
or diagnoses which are felt to be unrelated to occupational lead 
exposure. They must also instruct each physician to advise the employee 
of any occupationally or non-occupationally related medical condition 
requiring further treatment or evaluation.
    The standard provides for the use of respirators where engineering 
and other primary controls are not effective. However, the use of 
respirator protection shall not be used in lieu of temporary medical 
removal

[[Page 111]]

due to elevated blood lead levels or findings that an employee is at 
risk of material health impairment. This is based on the numerous 
inadequacies of respirators including skin rash where the facepiece 
makes contact with the skin, unacceptable stress to breathing in some 
workers with underlying cardiopulmonary impairment, difficulty in 
providing adequate fit, the tendency for respirators to create 
additional hazards by interfering with vision, hearing, and mobility, 
and the difficulties of assuring the maximum effectiveness of a 
complicated work practice program involving respirators. Respirators do, 
however, serve a useful function where engineering and work practice 
controls are inadequate by providing supplementary, interim, or short-
term protection, provided they are properly selected for the environment 
in which the employee will be working, properly fitted to the employee, 
maintained and cleaned periodically, and worn by the employee when 
required.
    In its interim final standard on occupational exposure to inorganic 
lead in the construction industry, OSHA has prohibited prophylactic 
chelation. Diagnostic and therapeutic chelation are permitted only under 
the supervision of a licensed physician with appropriate medical 
monitoring in an acceptable clinical setting. The decision to initiate 
chelation therapy must be made on an individual basis and take into 
account the severity of symptoms felt to be a result of lead toxicity 
along with blood lead levels, ZPP levels, and other laboratory tests as 
appropriate. EDTA and penicillamine which are the primary chelating 
agents used in the therapy of occupational lead poisoning have 
significant potential side effects and their use must be justified on 
the basis of expected benefits to the worker. Unless frank and severe 
symptoms are present, therapeutic chelation is not recommended, given 
the opportunity to remove a worker from exposure and allow the body to 
naturally excrete accumulated lead. As a diagnostic aid, the chelation 
mobilization test using CA-EDTA has limited applicability. According to 
some investigators, the test can differentiate between lead-induced and 
other nephropathies. The test may also provide an estimation of the 
mobile fraction of the total body lead burden.
    Employers are required to assure that accurate records are 
maintained on exposure assessment, including environmental monitoring, 
medical surveillance, and medical removal for each employee. Exposure 
assessment records must be kept for at least 30 years. Medical 
surveillance records must be kept for the duration of employment plus 30 
years except in cases where the employment was less than one year. If 
duration of employment is less than one year, the employer need not 
retain this record beyond the term of employment if the record is 
provided to the employee upon termination of employment. Medical removal 
records also must be maintained for the duration of employment. All 
records required under the standard must be made available upon request 
to the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health 
and the Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health. Employers must also make environmental and biological monitoring 
and medical removal records available to affected employees and to 
former employees or their authorized employee representatives. Employees 
or their specifically designated representatives have access to their 
entire medical surveillance records.
    In addition, the standard requires that the employer inform all 
workers exposed to lead at or above 30 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> of the 
provisions of the standard and all its appendices, the purpose and 
description of medical surveillance and provisions for medical removal 
protection if temporary removal is required. An understanding of the 
potential health effects of lead exposure by all exposed employees along 
with full understanding of their rights under the lead standard is 
essential for an effective monitoring program.

              II. Adverse Health Effects of Inorganic Lead

    Although the toxicity of lead has been known for 2,000 years, the 
knowledge of the complex relationship between lead exposure and human 
response is still being refined. Significant research into the toxic 
properties of lead continues throughout the world, and it should be 
anticipated that our understanding of thresholds of effects and margins 
of safety will be improved in future years. The provisions of the lead 
standard are founded on two prime medical judgments: First, the 
prevention of adverse health effects from exposure to lead throughout a 
working lifetime requires that worker blood lead levels be maintained at 
or below 40 <greek-m>g/dl and second, the blood lead levels of workers, 
male or female, who intend to parent in the near future should be 
maintained below 30 <greek-m>g/dl to minimize adverse reproductive 
health effects to the parents and developing fetus. The adverse effects 
of lead on reproduction are being actively researched and OSHA 
encourages the physician to remain abreast of recent developments in the 
area to best advise pregnant workers or workers planning to conceive 
children.
    The spectrum of health effects caused by lead exposure can be 
subdivided into five developmental stages: Normal, physiological changes 
of uncertain significance, pathophysiological changes, overt symptoms 
(morbidity), and mortality. Within this process there are no sharp 
distinctions, but rather a continuum of effects. Boundaries between 
categories overlap due to the wide variation of individual responses and 
exposures

[[Page 112]]

in the working population. OSHA's development of the lead standard 
focused on pathophysiological changes as well as later stages of 
disease.
    1. Heme Synthesis Inhibition. The earliest demonstrated effect of 
lead involves its ability to inhibit at least two enzymes of the heme 
synthesis pathway at very low blood levels. Inhibition of delta 
aminolevulinic acid dehydrase (ALA-D) which catalyzes the conversion of 
delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to protoporphyrin is observed at a blood 
lead level below 20 <greek-m>g/dl. At a blood lead level of 40 
<greek-m>g/dl, more than 20% of the population would have 70% inhibition 
of ALA-D. There is an exponential increase in ALA excretion at blood 
lead levels greater than 40 <greek-m>g/dl.
    Another enzyme, ferrochelatase, is also inhibited at low blood lead 
levels. Inhibition of ferrochelatase leads to increased free erythrocyte 
protoporphyrin (FEP) in the blood which can then bind to zinc to yield 
zinc protoporphyrin. At a blood lead level of 50 <greek-m>g/dl or 
greater, nearly 100% of the population will have an increase in FEP. 
There is also an exponential relationship between blood lead levels 
greater than 40 <greek-m>g/dl and the associated ZPP level, which has 
led to the development of the ZPP screening test for lead exposure.
    While the significance of these effects is subject to debate, it is 
OSHA's position that these enzyme disturbances are early stages of a 
disease process which may eventually result in the clinical symptoms of 
lead poisoning. Whether or not the effects do progress to the later 
stages of clinical disease, disruption of these enzyme processes over a 
working lifetime is considered to be a material impairment of health.
    One of the eventual results of lead-induced inhibition of enzymes in 
the heme synthesis pathway is anemia which can be asymptomatic if mild 
but associated with a wide array of symptoms including dizziness, 
fatigue, and tachycardia when more severe. Studies have indicated that 
lead levels as low as 50 <greek-m>g/dl can be associated with a definite 
decreased hemoglobin, although most cases of lead-induced anemia, as 
well as shortened red-cell survival times, occur at lead levels 
exceeding 80 <greek-m>g/dl. Inhibited hemoglobin synthesis is more 
common in chronic cases whereas shortened erythrocyte life span is more 
common in acute cases.
    In lead-induced anemias, there is usually a reticulocytosis along 
with the presence of basophilic stippling, and ringed sideroblasts, 
although none of the above are pathognomonic for lead-induced anemia.
    2. Neurological Effects. Inorganic lead has been found to have toxic 
effects on both the central and peripheral nervous systems. The earliest 
stages of lead-induced central nervous system effects first manifest 
themselves in the form of behavioral disturbances and central nervous 
system symptoms including irritability, restlessness, insomnia and other 
sleep disturbances, fatigue, vertigo, headache, poor memory, tremor, 
depression, and apathy. With more severe exposure, symptoms can progress 
to drowsiness, stupor, hallucinations, delirium, convulsions and coma.
    The most severe and acute form of lead poisoning which usually 
follows ingestion or inhalation of large amounts of lead is acute 
encephalopathy which may arise precipitously with the onset of 
intractable seizures, coma, cardiorespiratory arrest, and death within 
48 hours.
    While there is disagreement about what exposure levels are needed to 
produce the earliest symptoms, most experts agree that symptoms 
definitely can occur at blood lead levels of 60 <greek-m>g/dl whole 
blood and therefore recommend a 40 <greek-m>g/dl maximum. The central 
nervous system effects frequently are not reversible following 
discontinued exposure or chelation therapy and when improvement does 
occur, it is almost always only partial.
    The peripheral neuropathy resulting from lead exposure 
characteristically involves only motor function with minimal sensory 
damage and has a marked predilection for the extensor muscles of the 
most active extremity. The peripheral neuropathy can occur with varying 
degrees of severity. The earliest and mildest form which can be detected 
in workers with blood lead levels as low as 50 <greek-m>g/dl is 
manifested by slowing of motor nerve conduction velocity often without 
clinical symptoms. With progression of the neuropathy there is 
development of painless extensor muscle weakness usually involving the 
extensor muscles of the fingers and hand in the most active upper 
extremity, followed in severe cases by wrist drop or, much less 
commonly, foot drop.
    In addition to slowing of nerve conduction, electromyographical 
studies in patients with blood lead levels greater than 50 <greek-m>g/dl 
have demonstrated a decrease in the number of acting motor unit 
potentials, an increase in the duration of motor unit potentials, and 
spontaneous pathological activity including fibrillations and 
fasciculations. Whether these effects occur at levels of 40 <greek-m>g/
dl is undetermined.
    While the peripheral neuropathies can occasionally be reversed with 
therapy, again such recovery is not assured particularly in the more 
severe neuropathies and often improvement is only partial. The lack of 
reversibility is felt to be due in part to segmental demyelination.
    3. Gastrointestinal. Lead may also affect the gastrointestinal 
system producing abdominal colic or diffuse abdominal pain, 
constipation, obstipation, diarrhea, anorexia, nausea and vomiting. Lead 
colic rarely develops at blood lead levels below 80 <greek-m>g/dl.

[[Page 113]]

    4. Renal. Renal toxicity represents one of the most serious health 
effects of lead poisoning. In the early stages of disease nuclear 
inclusion bodies can frequently be identified in proximal renal tubular 
cells. Renal function remains normal and the changes in this stage are 
probably reversible. With more advanced disease there is progressive 
interstitial fibrosis and impaired renal function. Eventually extensive 
interstitial fibrosis ensues with sclerotic glomeruli and dilated and 
atrophied proximal tubules; all represent end stage kidney disease. 
Azotemia can be progressive, eventually resulting in frank uremia 
necessitating dialysis. There is occasionally associated hypertension 
and hyperuricemia with or without gout.
    Early kidney disease is difficult to detect. The urinalysis is 
normal in early lead nephropathy and the blood urea nitrogen and serum 
creatinine increase only when two-thirds of kidney function is lost. 
Measurement of creatinine clearance can often detect earlier disease as 
can other methods of measurement of glomerular filtration rate. An 
abnormal Ca-EDTA mobilization test has been used to differentiate 
between lead-induced and other nephropathies, but this procedure is not 
widely accepted. A form of Fanconi syndrome with aminoaciduria, 
glycosuria, and hyperphosphaturia indicating severe injury to the 
proximal renal tubules is occasionally seen in children.
    5. Reproductive effects. Exposure to lead can have serious effects 
on reproductive function in both males and females. In male workers 
exposed to lead there can be a decrease in sexual drive, impotence, 
decreased ability to produce healthy sperm, and sterility. Malformed 
sperm (teratospermia), decreased number of sperm (hypospermia), and 
sperm with decreased motility (asthenospermia) can all occur. 
Teratospermia has been noted at mean blood lead levels of 53 <greek-m>g/
dl and hypospermia and asthenospermia at 41 <greek-m>g/dl. Furthermore, 
there appears to be a dose-response relationship for teratospermia in 
lead exposed workers.
    Women exposed to lead may experience menstrual disturbances 
including dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia and amenorrhea. Following exposure 
to lead, women have a higher frequency of sterility, premature births, 
spontaneous miscarriages, and stillbirths.
    Germ cells can be affected by lead and cause genetic damage in the 
egg or sperm cells before conception and result in failure to implant, 
miscarriage, stillbirth, or birth defects.
    Infants of mothers with lead poisoning have a higher mortality 
during the first year and suffer from lowered birth weights, slower 
growth, and nervous system disorders.
    Lead can pass through the placental barrier and lead levels in the 
mother's blood are comparable to concentrations of lead in the umbilical 
cord at birth. Transplacental passage becomes detectable at 12-14 weeks 
of gestation and increases until birth.
    There is little direct data on damage to the fetus from exposure to 
lead but it is generally assumed that the fetus and newborn would be at 
least as susceptible to neurological damage as young children. Blood 
lead levels of 50-60 <greek-m>g/dl in children can cause significant 
neurobehavioral impairments and there is evidence of hyperactivity at 
blood levels as low as 25 <greek-m>g/dl. Given the overall body of 
literature concerning the adverse health effects of lead in children, 
OSHA feels that the blood lead level in children should be maintained 
below 30 <greek-m>g/dl with a population mean of 15 <greek-m>g/dl. Blood 
lead levels in the fetus and newborn likewise should not exceed 30 
<greek-m>g/dl.
    Because of lead's ability to pass through the placental barrier and 
also because of the demonstrated adverse effects of lead on reproductive 
function in both the male and female as well as the risk of genetic 
damage of lead on both the ovum and sperm, OSHA recommends a 30 
<greek-m>g/dl maximum permissible blood lead level in both males and 
females who wish to bear children.
    6. Other toxic effects. Debate and research continue on the effects 
of lead on the human body. Hypertension has frequently been noted in 
occupationally exposed individuals although it is difficult to assess 
whether this is due to lead's adverse effects on the kidney or if some 
other mechanism is involved. Vascular and electrocardiographic changes 
have been detected but have not been well characterized. Lead is thought 
to impair thyroid function and interfere with the pituitary-adrenal 
axis, but again these effects have not been well defined.

                         III. Medical Evaluation

    The most important principle in evaluating a worker for any 
occupational disease including lead poisoning is a high index of 
suspicion on the part of the examining physician. As discussed in 
Section 2, lead can affect numerous organ systems and produce a wide 
array of signs and symptoms, most of which are non-specific and subtle 
in nature at least in the early stages of disease. Unless serious 
concern for lead toxicity is present, many of the early clues to 
diagnosis may easily be overlooked.
    The crucial initial step in the medical evaluation is recognizing 
that a worker's employment can result in exposure to lead. The worker 
will frequently be able to define exposures to lead and lead containing 
materials but often will not volunteer this information unless 
specifically asked. In other situations the worker may not know of any 
exposures to lead but the suspicion might be raised on the part of the 
physician because of the industry or occupation of the worker.

[[Page 114]]

Potential occupational exposure to lead and its compounds occur in many 
occupations in the construction industry, including demolition and 
salvaging operations, removal or encapsulation of materials containing 
lead, construction, alteration, repair or renovation of structures 
containing lead, transportation, disposal, storage or containment of 
lead or lead-containing materials on construction sites, and maintenance 
operations associated with construction activities.
    Once the possibility for lead exposure is raised, the focus can then 
be directed toward eliciting information from the medical history, 
physical exam, and finally from laboratory data to evaluate the worker 
for potential lead toxicity.
    A complete and detailed work history is important in the initial 
evaluation. A listing of all previous employment with information on job 
description, exposure to fumes or dust, known exposures to lead or other 
toxic substances, a description of any personal protective equipment 
used, and previous medical surveillance should all be included in the 
worker's record. Where exposure to lead is suspected, information 
concerning on-the-job personal hygiene, smoking or eating habits in work 
areas, laundry procedures, and use of any protective clothing or 
respiratory protection equipment should be noted. A complete work 
history is essential in the medical evaluation of a worker with 
suspected lead toxicity, especially when long term effects such as 
neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity are considered.
    The medical history is also of fundamental importance and should 
include a listing of all past and current medical conditions, current 
medications including proprietary drug intake, previous surgeries and 
hospitalizations, allergies, smoking history, alcohol consumption, and 
also non-occupational lead exposures such as hobbies (hunting, riflery). 
Also known childhood exposures should be elicited. Any previous history 
of hematological, neurological, gastrointestinal, renal, psychological, 
gynecological, genetic, or reproductive problems should be specifically 
noted.
    A careful and complete review of systems must be performed to assess 
both recognized complaints and subtle or slowly acquired symptoms which 
the worker might not appreciate as being significant. The review of 
symptoms should include the following:
    1. General--weight loss, fatigue, decreased appetite.
    2. Head, Eyes, Ears, Nose, Throat (HEENT)--headaches, visual 
disturbances or decreased visual acuity, hearing deficits or tinnitus, 
pigmentation of the oral mucosa, or metallic taste in mouth.
    3. Cardio-pulmonary--shortness of breath, cough, chest pains, 
palpitations, or orthopnea.
    4. Gastrointestinal--nausea, vomiting, heartburn, abdominal pain, 
constipation or diarrhea.
    5. Neurologic--irritability, insomnia, weakness (fatigue), 
dizziness, loss of memory, confusion, hallucinations, incoordination, 
ataxia, decreased strength in hands or feet, disturbances in gait, 
difficulty in climbing stairs, or seizures.
    6. Hematologic--pallor, easy fatigability, abnormal blood loss, 
melena.
    7. Reproductive (male and female and spouse where relevant)--history 
of infertility, impotence, loss of libido, abnormal menstrual periods, 
history of miscarriages, stillbirths, or children with birth defects.
    8. Musculo-skeletal--muscle and joint pains.
    The physical examination should emphasize the neurological, 
gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular systems. The worker's weight and 
blood pressure should be recorded and the oral mucosa checked for 
pigmentation characteristic of a possible Burtonian or lead line on the 
gingiva. It should be noted, however, that the lead line may not be 
present even in severe lead poisoning if good oral hygiene is practiced.
    The presence of pallor on skin examination may indicate an anemia 
which, if severe, might also be associated with a tachycardia. If an 
anemia is suspected, an active search for blood loss should be 
undertaken including potential blood loss through the gastrointestinal 
tract.
    A complete neurological examination should include an adequate 
mental status evaluation including a search for behavioral and 
psychological disturbances, memory testing, evaluation for irritability, 
insomnia, hallucinations, and mental clouding. Gait and coordination 
should be examined along with close observation for tremor. A detailed 
evaluation of peripheral nerve function including careful sensory and 
motor function testing is warranted. Strength testing particularly of 
extensor muscle groups of all extremities is of fundamental importance.
    Cranial nerve evaluation should also be included in the routine 
examination.
    The abdominal examination should include auscultation for bowel 
sounds and abdominal bruits and palpation for organomegaly, masses, and 
diffuse abdominal tenderness.
    Cardiovascular examination should evaluate possible early signs of 
congestive heart failure. Pulmonary status should be addressed 
particularly if respirator protection is contemplated.
    As part of the medical evaluation, the interim lead standard 
requires the following laboratory studies:

    1. Blood lead level
    2. Hemoglobin and hematocrit determinations, red cell indices, and 
examination of the peripheral blood smear to evaluate red blood cell 
morphology

[[Page 115]]

    3. Blood urea nitrogen
    4. Serum creatinine
    5. Routine urinalysis with microscopic examination.
    6. A zinc protoporphyrin level.

    In addition to the above, the physician is authorized to order any 
further laboratory or other tests which he or she deems necessary in 
accordance with sound medical practice. The evaluation must also include 
pregnancy testing or laboratory evaluation of male fertility if 
requested by the employee. Additional tests which are probably not 
warranted on a routine basis but may be appropriate when blood lead and 
ZPP levels are equivocal include delta aminolevulinic acid and 
coproporphyrin concentrations in the urine, and dark-field illumination 
for detection of basophilic stippling in red blood cells.
    If an anemia is detected further studies including a careful 
examination of the peripheral smear, reticulocyte count, stool for 
occult blood, serum iron, total iron binding capacity, bilirubin, and, 
if appropriate, vitamin B12 and folate may be of value in attempting to 
identify the cause of the anemia.
    If a peripheral neuropathy is suspected, nerve conduction studies 
are warranted both for diagnosis and as a basis to monitor any therapy.
    If renal disease is questioned, a 24 hour urine collection for 
creatinine clearance, protein, and electrolytes may be indicated. 
Elevated uric acid levels may result from lead-induced renal disease and 
a serum uric acid level might be performed.
    An electrocardiogram and chest x-ray may be obtained as deemed 
appropriate.
    Sophisticated and highly specialized testing should not be done 
routinely and where indicated should be under the direction of a 
specialist.

                        IV. Laboratory Evaluation

    The blood lead level at present remains the single most important 
test to monitor lead exposure and is the test used in the medical 
surveillance program under the lead standard to guide employee medical 
removal. The ZPP has several advantages over the blood lead level. 
Because of its relatively recent development and the lack of extensive 
data concerning its interpretation, the ZPP currently remains an 
ancillary test.
    This section will discuss the blood lead level and ZPP in detail and 
will outline their relative advantages and disadvantages. Other blood 
tests currently available to evaluate lead exposure will also be 
reviewed.
    The blood lead level is a good index of current or recent lead 
absorption when there is no anemia present and when the worker has not 
taken any chelating agents. However, blood lead levels along with 
urinary lead levels do not necessarily indicate the total body burden of 
lead and are not adequate measures of past exposure. One reason for this 
is that lead has a high affinity for bone and up to 90% of the body's 
total lead is deposited there. A very important component of the total 
lead body burden is lead in soft tissue (liver, kidney, and brain). This 
fraction of the lead body burden, the biologically active lead, is not 
entirely reflected by blood lead levels since it is a function of the 
dynamics of lead absorption, distribution, deposition in bone and 
excretion. Following discontinuation of exposure to lead, the excess 
body burden is only slowly mobilized from bone and other relatively 
stable body stores and excreted. Consequently, a high blood lead level 
may only represent recent heavy exposure to lead without a significant 
total body excess and likewise a low blood lead level does not exclude 
an elevated total body burden of lead.
    Also due to its correlation with recent exposures, the blood lead 
level may vary considerably over short time intervals.
    To minimize laboratory error and erroneous results due to 
contamination, blood specimens must be carefully collected after 
thorough cleaning of the skin with appropriate methods using lead-free 
blood containers and analyzed by a reliable laboratory. Under the 
standard, samples must be analyzed in laboratories which are approved by 
OSHA. Analysis is to be made using atomic absorption spectrophotometry, 
anodic stripping voltammetry or any method which meets the accuracy 
requirements set forth by the standard.
    The determination of lead in urine is generally considered a less 
reliable monitoring technique than analysis of whole blood primarily due 
to individual variability in urinary excretion capacity as well as the 
technical difficulty of obtaining accurate 24 hour urine collections. In 
addition, workers with renal insufficiency, whether due to lead or some 
other cause, may have decreased lead clearance and consequently urine 
lead levels may underestimate the true lead burden. Therefore, urine 
lead levels should not be used as a routine test.
    The zinc protoporphyrin test, unlike the blood lead determination, 
measures an adverse metabolic effect of lead and as such is a better 
indicator of lead toxicity than the level of blood lead itself. The 
level of ZPP reflects lead absorption over the preceding 3 to 4 months, 
and therefore is a better indicator of lead body burden. The ZPP 
requires more time than the blood lead to read significantly elevated 
levels; the return to normal after discontinuing lead exposure is also 
slower. Furthermore, the ZPP test is simpler, faster, and less expensive 
to perform and no contamination is possible. Many investigators believe 
it is the most reliable

[[Page 116]]

means of monitoring chronic lead absorption.
    Zinc protoporphyrin results from the inhibition of the enzyme 
ferrochelatase which catalyzes the insertion of an iron molecule into 
the protoporphyrin molecule, which then becomes heme. If iron is not 
inserted into the molecule then zinc, having a greater affinity for 
protoporphyrin, takes the place of the iron, forming ZPP.
    An elevation in the level of circulating ZPP may occur at blood lead 
levels as low as 20-30 <greek-m>g/dl in some workers. Once the blood 
lead level has reached 40 <greek-m>g/dl there is more marked rise in the 
ZPP value from its normal range of less than 100 <greek-m>g/dl100 ml. 
Increases in blood lead levels beyond 40 <greek-m>g/100 g are associated 
with exponential increases in ZPP.
    Whereas blood lead levels fluctuate over short time spans, ZPP 
levels remain relatively stable. ZPP is measured directly in red blood 
cells and is present for the cell's entire 120 day life-span. Therefore, 
the ZPP level in blood reflects the average ZPP production over the 
previous 3-4 months and consequently the average lead exposure during 
that time interval.
    It is recommended that a hematocrit be determined whenever a 
confirmed ZPP of 50 <greek-m>g/100 ml whole blood is obtained to rule 
out a significant underlying anemia. If the ZPP is in excess of 100 
<greek-m>g/100 ml and not associated with abnormal elevations in blood 
lead levels, the laboratory should be checked to be sure that blood 
leads were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometry anodic 
stripping voltammetry, or any method which meets the accuracy 
requirements set forth by the standard by an OSHA approved laboratory 
which is experienced in lead level determinations. Repeat periodic blood 
lead studies should be obtained in all individuals with elevated ZPP 
levels to be certain that an associated elevated blood lead level has 
not been missed due to transient fluctuations in blood leads.
    ZPP has a characteristic fluorescence spectrum with a peak at 594 nm 
which is detectable with a hematofluorimeter. The hematofluorimeter is 
accurate and portable and can provide on-site, instantaneous results for 
workers who can be frequently tested via a finger prick.
    However, careful attention must be given to calibration and quality 
control procedures. Limited data on blood lead-ZPP correlations and the 
ZPP levels which are associated with the adverse health effects 
discussed in Section 2 are the major limitations of the test. Also it is 
difficult to correlate ZPP levels with environmental exposure and there 
is some variation of response with age and sex. Nevertheless, the ZPP 
promises to be an important diagnostic test for the early detection of 
lead toxicity and its value will increase as more data is collected 
regarding its relationship to other manifestations of lead poisoning.
    Levels of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in the urine are also used 
as a measure of lead exposure. Increasing concentrations of ALA are 
believed to result from the inhibition of the enzyme delta-
aminolevulinic acid dehydrase (ALA-D). Although the test is relatively 
easy to perform, inexpensive, and rapid, the disadvantages include 
variability in results, the necessity to collect a complete 24 hour 
urine sample which has a specific gravity greater than 1.010, and also 
the fact that ALA decomposes in the presence of light.
    The pattern of porphyrin excretion in the urine can also be helpful 
in identifying lead intoxication. With lead poisoning, the urine 
concentrations of coproporphyrins I and II, porphobilinogen and 
uroporphyrin I rise. The most important increase, however, is that of 
coproporphyrin III; levels may exceed 5,000 <greek-m>g/l in the urine in 
lead poisoned individuals, but its correlation with blood lead levels 
and ZPP are not as good as those of ALA. Increases in urinary porphyrins 
are not diagnostic of lead toxicity and may be seen in porphyria, some 
liver diseases, and in patients with high reticulocyte counts.
    Summary. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration's interim 
standard for inorganic lead in the construction industry places 
significant emphasis on the medical surveillance of all workers exposed 
to levels of inorganic lead above 30 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP> TWA. The 
physician has a fundamental role in this surveillance program, and in 
the operation of the medical removal protection program.
    Even with adequate worker education on the adverse health effects of 
lead and appropriate training in work practices, personal hygiene and 
other control measures, the physician has a primary responsibility for 
evaluating potential lead toxicity in the worker. It is only through a 
careful and detailed medical and work history, a complete physical 
examination and appropriate laboratory testing that an accurate 
assessment can be made. Many of the adverse health effects of lead 
toxicity are either irreversible or only partially reversible and 
therefore early detection of disease is very important.
    This document outlines the medical monitoring program as defined by 
the occupational safety and health standard for inorganic lead. It 
reviews the adverse health effects of lead poisoning and describes the 
important elements of the history and physical examinations as they 
relate to these adverse effects. Finally, the appropriate laboratory 
testing for evaluating lead exposure and toxicity is presented.
    It is hoped that this review and discussion will give the physician 
a better understanding of the OSHA standard with the ultimate goal of 
protecting the health and well-being

of the worker exposed to lead under his or her care.

Sec. 1926.64  Process safety management of highly hazardous chemicals.

    Purpose. This section contains requirements for preventing or 
minimizing the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, 
flammable, or explosive chemicals. These releases may result in toxic, 
fire or explosion hazards.
    (a) Application. (1) This section applies to the following:
    (i) A process which involves a chemical at or above the specified 
threshold quantities listed in Appendix A to this section;
    (ii) A process which involves a flammable liquid or gas (as defined 
in Sec. 1926.59(c) of this part) on site in one location, in a quantity 
of 10,000 pounds (4535.9 kg) or more except for:
    (A) Hydrocarbon fuels used solely for workplace consumption as a 
fuel (e.g., propane used for comfort heating, gasoline for vehicle 
refueling), if such fuels are not a part of a process containing another 
highly hazardous chemical covered by this standard;
    (B) Flammable liquids stored in atmospheric tanks or transferred 
which are kept below their normal boiling point without benefit of 
chilling or refrigeration.
    (2) This section does not apply to:
    (i) Retail facilities;
    (ii) Oil or gas well drilling or servicing operations; or,
    (iii) Normally unoccupied remote facilities.
    (b) Definitions. Atmospheric tank means a storage tank which has 
been designed to operate at pressures from atmospheric through 0.5 
p.s.i.g. (pounds per square inch gauge, 3.45 Kpa).
    Boiling point means the boiling point of a liquid at a pressure of 
14.7 pounds per square inch absolute (p.s.i.a.) (760 mm.). For the 
purposes of this section, where an accurate boiling point is unavailable 
for the material in question, or for mixtures which do not have a 
constant boiling point, the 10 percent point of a distillation performed 
in accordance with the Standard Method of Test for Distillation of 
Petroleum Products, ASTM D-86-62, may be used as the boiling point of 
the liquid.
    Catastrophic release means a major uncontrolled emission, fire, or 
explosion, involving one or more highly hazardous chemicals, that 
presents serious danger to employees in the workplace.
    Facility means the buildings, containers or equipment which contain 
a process.
    Highly hazardous chemical means a substance possessing toxic, 
reactive, flammable, or explosive properties and specified by paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section.
    Hot work means work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, 
brazing, or similar flame or spark-producing operations.
    Normally unoccupied remote facility means a facility which is 
operated, maintained or serviced by employees who visit the facility 
only periodically to check its operation and to perform necessary 
operating or maintenance tasks. No employees are permanently stationed 
at the facility. Facilities meeting this definition are not contiguous 
with, and must be geographically remote from all other buildings, 
processes or persons.
    Process means any activity involving a highly hazardous chemical 
including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site 
movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. For 
purposes of this definition, any group of vessels which are 
interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a highly 
hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be 
considered a single process.
    Replacement in kind means a replacement which satisfies the design 
specification.
    Trade secret means any confidential formula, pattern, process, 
device, information or compilation of information that is used in an 
employer's business, and that gives the employer an opportunity to 
obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it. Appendix 
D contained in Sec. 1926.59 sets out the criteria to be used in 
evaluating trade secrets.

 Appendix C to Sec. 1926.64--Compliance Guidelines and Recommendations 
              for Process Safety Management (Nonmandatory)

    This appendix serves as a nonmandatory guideline to assist employers 
and employees in complying with the requirements of this section, as 
well as provides other helpful recommendations and information. Examples 
presented in this appendix are not the only means of achieving the 
performance goals in the standard. This appendix neither adds nor 
detracts from the requirements of the standard.
    1. Introduction to Process Safety Management. The major objective of 
process safety management of highly hazardous chemicals is to prevent 
unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals especially into locations which 
could expose employees and others to serious hazards. An effective 
process safety management program requires a systematic approach to 
evaluating the whole process. Using this approach the process design, 
process technology, operational and maintenance activities and 
procedures, nonroutine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness 
plans and procedures, training programs, and other elements which impact 
the process are all considered in the evaluation. The various lines of 
defense that have been incorporated into the design and operation of the 
process to prevent or mitigate the release of hazardous chemicals need 
to be evaluated and strengthened to assure their effectiveness at each 
level. Process safety management is the proactive identification, 
evaluation and mitigation or prevention of chemical releases that could 
occur as a result of failures in process, procedures or equipment.
    The process safety management standard targets highly hazardous 
chemicals that have the potential to cause a catastrophic incident. This 
standard as a whole is to aid employers in their efforts to prevent or 
mitigate episodic chemical releases that could lead to a catastrophe in 
the workplace and possibly to the surrounding community. To control 
these types of hazards, employers need to develop the necessary 
expertise, experiences, judgement and proactive initiative within their 
workforce to properly implement and maintain an effective process safety 
management program as envisioned in the OSHA standard. This OSHA 
standard is required by the Clean Air Act Amendments as is the 
Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Plan. Employers, who 
merge the two sets of requirements into their process safety management 
program, will better assure full compliance with each as well as 
enhancing their relationship with the local community.
    While OSHA believes process safety management will have a positive 
effect on the safety of employees in workplaces and also offers other 
potential benefits to employers (increased productivity), smaller 
businesses which may have limited resources available to them at this 
time, might consider alternative avenues of decreasing the risks 
associated with highly hazardous chemicals at their workplaces. One 
method which might be considered is the reduction in the inventory of 
the highly hazardous chemical. This reduction in inventory will result 
in a reduction of the risk or potential for a catastrophic incident. 
Also, employers including small employers may be able to establish more 
efficient inventory control by reducing the quantities of highly 
hazardous chemicals on site below the established threshold quantities. 
This reduction can be accomplished by ordering smaller shipments and 
maintaining the minimum inventory necessary for efficient and safe 
operation. When reduced inventory is not feasible, then the employer 
might consider dispersing inventory to several locations on site. 
Dispersing storage into locations where a release in one location will 
not cause a release in another location is a practical method to also 
reduce the risk or potential for catastrophic incidents.
    2. Employee Involvement in Process Safety Management. Section 304 of 
the Clean Air Act Amendments states that employers are to consult with 
their employees and their representatives regarding the employers 
efforts in the development and implementation of the process safety 
management program elements and hazard assessments. Section 304 also 
requires employers to train and educate their employees and to inform 
affected employees of the findings from incident investigations required 
by the process safety management program. Many employers, under their 
safety and health programs, have already established means and methods 
to keep employees and their representatives informed about relevant 
safety and health issues and employers may be able to adapt these 
practices and procedures to meet their obligations under this standard. 
Employers who have not implemented an occupational safety and health 
program may wish to form a safety and health committee of employees and 
management representatives to help the employer meet the obligations 
specified by this standard. These committees can become a significant 
ally in helping the employer to implement and maintain an effective 
process safety management program for all employees.
    3. Process Safety Information. Complete and accurate written 
information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and 
process equipment is essential to an effective process safety management 
program and to a process hazards analysis. The compiled information will 
be a necessary resource to a variety of users including the team that 
will

[[Page 129]]

perform the process hazards analysis as required under paragraph (e); 
those developing the training programs and the operating procedures; 
contractors whose employees will be working with the process; those 
conducting the pre-startup reviews; local emergency preparedness 
planners; and insurance and enforcement officials.
    The information to be compiled about the chemicals, including 
process intermediates, needs to be comprehensive enough for an accurate 
assessment of the fire and explosion characteristics, reactivity 
hazards, the safety and health hazards to workers, and the corrosion and 
erosion effects on the process equipment and monitoring tools. Current 
material safety data sheet (MSDS) information can be used to help meet 
this requirement which must be supplemented with process chemistry 
information including runaway reaction and over pressure hazards if 
applicable.
    Process technology information will be a part of the process safety 
information package and it is expected that it will include diagrams of 
the type shown in Appendix B of this section as well as employer 
established criteria for maximum inventory levels for process chemicals; 
limits beyond which would be considered upset conditions; and a 
qualitative estimate of the consequences or results of deviation that 
could occur if operating beyond the established process limits. 
Employers are encouraged to use diagrams which will help users 
understand the process.
    A block flow diagram is used to show the major process equipment and 
interconnecting process flow lines and show flow rates, stream 
composition, temperatures, and pressures when necessary for clarity. The 
block flow diagram is a simplified diagram.
    Process flow diagrams are more complex and will show all main flow 
streams including valves to enhance the understanding of the process, as 
well as pressures and temperatures on all feed and product lines within 
all major vessels, in and out of headers and heat exchangers, and points 
of pressure and temperature control. Also, materials of construction 
information, pump capacities and pressure heads, compressor horsepower 
and vessel design pressures and temperatures are shown when necessary 
for clarity. In addition, major components of control loops are usually 
shown along with key utilities on process flow diagrams.
    Piping and instrument diagrams (P&Ids) may be the more appropriate 
type of diagrams to show some of the above details and to display the 
information for the piping designer and engineering staff. The P&IDs are 
to be used to describe the relationships between equipment and 
instrumentation as well as other relevant information that will enhance 
clarity. Computer software programs which do P&Ids or other diagrams 
useful to the information package, may be used to help meet this 
requirement.
    The information pertaining to process equipment design must be 
documented. In other words, what were the codes and standards relied on 
to establish good engineering practice. These codes and standards are 
published by such organizations as the American Society of Mechanical 
Engineers, American Petroleum Institute, American National Standards 
Institute, National Fire Protection Association, American Society for 
Testing and Materials, National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel 
Inspectors, National Association of Corrosion Engineers, American 
Society of Exchange Manufacturers Association, and model building code 
groups.
    In addition, various engineering societies issue technical reports 
which impact process design. For example, the American Institute of 
Chemical Engineers has published technical reports on topics such as two 
phase flow for venting devices. This type of technically recognized 
report would constitute good engineering practice.
    For existing equipment designed and constructed many years ago in 
accordance with the codes and standards available at that time and no 
longer in general use today, the employer must document which codes and 
standards were used and that the design and construction along with the 
testing, inspection and operation are still suitable for the intended 
use. Where the process technology requires a design which departs from 
the applicable codes and standards, the employer must document that the 
design and construction is suitable for the intended purpose.
    4. Process Hazard Analysis. A process hazard analysis (PHA), 
sometimes called a process hazard evaluation, is one of the most 
important elements of the process safety management program. A PHA is an 
organized and systematic effort to identify and analyze the significance 
of potential hazards associated with the processing or handling of 
highly hazardous chemicals. A PHA provides information which will assist 
employers and employees in making decisions for improving safety and 
reducing the consequences of unwanted or unplanned releases of hazardous 
chemicals. A PHA is directed toward analyzing potential causes and 
consequences of fires, explosions, releases of toxic or flammable 
chemicals and major spills of hazardous chemicals. The PHA focuses on 
equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions (routine and 
nonroutine), and external factors that might impact the process. These 
considerations assist in determining the hazards and potential failure 
points or failure modes in a process.
    The selection of a PHA methodology or technique will be influenced 
by many factors including the amount of existing knowledge about the 
process. Is it a process that has

[[Page 130]]

been operated for a long period of time with little or no innovation and 
extensive experience has been generated with its use? Or, is it a new 
process or one which has been changed frequently by the inclusion of 
innovative features? Also, the size and complexity of the process will 
influence the decision as to the appropriate PHA methodology to use. All 
PHA methodologies are subject to certain limitations. For example, the 
checklist methodology works well when the process is very stable and no 
changes are made, but it is not as effective when the process has 
undergone extensive change. The checklist may miss the most recent 
changes and consequently the changes would not be evaluated. Another 
limitation to be considered concerns the assumptions made by the team or 
analyst. The PHA is dependent on good judgement and the assumptions made 
during the study need to be documented and understood by the team and 
reviewer and kept for a future PHA.
    The team conducting the PHA need to understand the methodology that 
is going to be used. A PHA team can vary in size from two people to a 
number of people with varied operational and technical backgrounds. Some 
team members may only be a part of the team for a limited time. The team 
leader needs to be fully knowledgeable in the proper implementation of 
the PHA methodology that is to be used and should be impartial in the 
evaluation. The other full or part time team members need to provide the 
team with expertise in areas such as process technology, process design, 
operating procedures and practices, including how the work is actually 
performed, alarms, emergency procedures, instrumentation, maintenance 
procedures, both routine and nonroutine tasks, including how the tasks 
are authorized, procurement of parts and supplies, safety and health, 
and any other relevant subject as the need dictates. At least one team 
member must be familiar with the process.
    The ideal team will have an intimate knowledge of the standards, 
codes, specifications and regulations applicable to the process being 
studied. The selected team members need to be compatible and the team 
leader needs to be able to manage the team and the PHA study. The team 
needs to be able to work together while benefiting from the expertise of 
others on the team or outside the team, to resolve issues, and to forge 
a consensus on the findings of the study and the recommendations.
    The application of a PHA to a process may involve the use of 
different methodologies for various parts of the process. For example, a 
process involving a series of unit operations of varying sizes, 
complexities, and ages may use different methodologies and team members 
for each operation. Then the conclusions can be integrated into one 
final study and evaluation. A more specific example is the use of a 
checklist PHA for a standard boiler or heat exchanger and the use of a 
Hazard and Operability PHA for the overall process. Also, for batch type 
processes like custom batch operations, a generic PHA of a 
representative batch may be used where there are only small changes of 
monomer or other ingredient ratios and the chemistry is documented for 
the full range and ratio of batch ingredients. Another process that 
might consider using a generic type of PHA is a gas plant. Often these 
plants are simply moved from site to site and therefore, a generic PHA 
may be used for these movable plants. Also, when an employer has several 
similar size gas plants and no sour gas is being processed at the site, 
then a generic PHA is feasible as long as the variations of the 
individual sites are accounted for in the PHA. Finally, when an employer 
has a large continuous process which has several control rooms for 
different portions of the process such as for a distillation tower and a 
blending operation, the employer may wish to do each segment separately 
and then integrate the final results.
    Additionally, small businesses which are covered by this rule, will 
often have processes that have less storage volume, less capacity, and 
less complicated than processes at a large facility. Therefore, OSHA 
would anticipate that the less complex methodologies would be used to 
meet the process hazard analysis criteria in the standard. These process 
hazard analyses can be done in less time and with a few people being 
involved. A less complex process generally means that less data, P&IDs, 
and process information is needed to perform a process hazard analysis.
    Many small businesses have processes that are not unique, such as 
cold storage lockers or water treatment facilities. Where employer 
associations have a number of members with such facilities, a generic 
PHA, evolved from a checklist or what-if questions, could be developed 
and used by each employer effectively to reflect his/her particular 
process; this would simplify compliance for them.
    When the employer has a number of processes which require a PHA, the 
employer must set up a priority system of which PHAs to conduct first. A 
preliminary or gross hazard analysis may be useful in prioritizing the 
processes that the employer has determined are subject to coverage by 
the process safety management standard. Consideration should first be 
given to those processes with the potential of adversely affecting the 
largest number of employees. This prioritizing should consider the 
potential severity of a chemical release, the number of potentially 
affected employees, the operating history of the process such as the 
frequency of chemical releases, the age of the process and any other 
relevant factors. These factors would suggest a ranking order and would 
suggest

[[Page 131]]

either using a weighing factor system or a systematic ranking method. 
The use of a preliminary hazard analysis would assist an employer in 
determining which process should be of the highest priority and thereby 
the employer would obtain the greatest improvement in safety at the 
facility.
    Detailed guidance on the content and application of process hazard 
analysis methodologies is available from the American Institute of 
Chemical Engineers' Center for Chemical Process Safety (see Appendix D).
    5. Operating Procedures and Practices. Operating procedures describe 
tasks to be performed, data to be recorded, operating conditions to be 
maintained, samples to be collected, and safety and health precautions 
to be taken. The procedures need to be technically accurate, 
understandable to employees, and revised periodically to ensure that 
they reflect current operations. The process safety information package 
is to be used as a resource to better assure that the operating 
procedures and practices are consistent with the known hazards of the 
chemicals in the process and that the operating parameters are accurate. 
Operating procedures should be reviewed by engineering staff and 
operating personnel to ensure that they are accurate and provide 
practical instructions on how to actually carry out job duties safely.
    Operating procedures will include specific instructions or details 
on what steps are to be taken or followed in carrying out the stated 
procedures. These operating instructions for each procedure should 
include the applicable safety precautions and should contain appropriate 
information on safety implications. For example, the operating 
procedures addressing operating parameters will contain operating 
instructions about pressure limits, temperature ranges, flow rates, what 
to do when an upset condition occurs, what alarms and instruments are 
pertinent if an upset condition occurs, and other subjects. Another 
example of using operating instructions to properly implement operating 
procedures is in starting up or shutting down the process. In these 
cases, different parameters will be required from those of normal 
operation. These operating instructions need to clearly indicate the 
distinctions between startup and normal operations such as the 
appropriate allowances for heating up a unit to reach the normal 
operating parameters. Also the operating instructions need to describe 
the proper method for increasing the temperature of the unit until the 
normal operating temperature parameters are achieved.
    Computerized process control systems add complexity to operating 
instructions. These operating instructions need to describe the logic of 
the software as well as the relationship between the equipment and the 
control system; otherwise, it may not be apparent to the operator.
    Operating procedures and instructions are important for training 
operating personnel. The operating procedures are often viewed as the 
standard operating practices (SOPs) for operations. Control room 
personnel and operating staff, in general, need to have a full 
understanding of operating procedures. If workers are not fluent in 
English then procedures and instructions need to be prepared in a second 
language understood by the workers. In addition, operating procedures 
need to be changed when there is a change in the process as a result of 
the management of change procedures. The consequences of operating 
procedure changes need to be fully evaluated and the information 
conveyed to the personnel. For example, mechanical changes to the 
process made by the maintenance department (like changing a valve from 
steel to brass or other subtle changes) need to be evaluated to 
determine if operating procedures and practices also need to be changed. 
All management of change actions must be coordinated and integrated with 
current operating procedures and operating personnel must be oriented to 
the changes in procedures before the change is made. When the process is 
shutdown in order to make a change, then the operating procedures must 
be updated before startup of the process.
    Training in how to handle upset conditions must be accomplished as 
well as what operating personnel are to do in emergencies such as when a 
pump seal fails or a pipeline ruptures. Communication between operating 
personnel and workers performing work within the process area, such as 
nonroutine tasks, also must be maintained. The hazards of the tasks are 
to be conveyed to operating personnel in accordance with established 
procedures and to those performing the actual tasks. When the work is 
completed, operating personnel should be informed to provide closure on 
the job.
    6. Employee Training. All employees, including maintenance and 
contractor employees, involved with highly hazardous chemicals need to 
fully understand the safety and health hazards of the chemicals and 
processes they work with for the protection of themselves, their fellow 
employees and the citizens of nearby communities. Training conducted in 
compliance with 1926.59, the Hazard Communication standard, will help 
employees to be more knowledgeable about the chemicals they work with as 
well as familiarize them with reading and understanding MSDS. However, 
additional training in subjects such as operating procedures and safety 
work practices, emergency evacuation and response, safety procedures, 
routine and nonroutine work authorization activities, and other areas 
pertinent to process safety and health will need to be covered by an 
employer's training program.

[[Page 132]]

    In establishing their training programs, employers must clearly 
define the employees to be trained and what subjects are to be covered 
in their training. Employers in setting up their training program will 
need to clearly establish the goals and objectives they wish to achieve 
with the training that they provide to their employees. The learning 
goals or objectives should be written in clear measurable terms before 
the training begins. These goals and objectives need to be tailored to 
each of the specific training modules or segments. Employers should 
describe the important actions and conditions under which the employee 
will demonstrate competence or knowledge as well as what is acceptable 
performance.
    Hands-on-training where employees are able to use their senses 
beyond listening, will enhance learning. For example, operating 
personnel, who will work in a control room or at control panels, would 
benefit by being trained at a simulated control panel or panels. Upset 
conditions of various types could be displayed on the simulator, and 
then the employee could go through the proper operating procedures to 
bring the simulator panel back to the normal operating parameters. A 
training environment could be created to help the trainee feel the full 
reality of the situation but, of course, under controlled conditions. 
This realistic type of training can be very effective in teaching 
employees correct procedures while allowing them to also see the 
consequences of what might happens if they do not follow established 
operating procedures. Other training techniques using videos or on-the-
job training can also be very effective for teaching other job tasks, 
duties, or other important information. An effective training program 
will allow the employee to fully participate in the training process and 
to practice their skill or knowledge.
    Employers need to periodically evaluate their training programs to 
see if the necessary skills, knowledge, and routines are being properly 
understood and implemented by their trained employees. The means or 
methods for evaluating the training should be developed along with the 
training program goals and objectives. Training program evaluation will 
help employers to determine the amount of training their employees 
understood, and whether the desired results were obtained. If, after the 
evaluation, it appears that the trained employees are not at the level 
of knowledge and skill that was expected, the employer will need to 
revise the training program, provide retraining, or provide more 
frequent refresher training sessions until the deficiency is resolved. 
Those who conducted the training and those who received the training 
should also be consulted as to how best to improve the training process. 
If there is a language barrier, the language known to the trainees 
should be used to reinforce the training messages and information.
    Careful consideration must be given to assure that employees 
including maintenance and contract employees receive current and updated 
training. For example, if changes are made to a process, impacted 
employees must be trained in the changes and understand the effects of 
the changes on their job tasks (e.g., any new operating procedures 
pertinent to their tasks). Additionally, as already discussed the 
evaluation of the employee's absorption of training will certainly 
influence the need for training.
    7. Contractors. Employers who use contractors to perform work in and 
around processes that involve highly hazardous chemicals, will need to 
establish a screening process so that they hire and use contractors who 
accomplish the desired job tasks without compromising the safety and 
health of employees at a facility. For contractors, whose safety 
performance on the job is not known to the hiring employer, the employer 
will need to obtain information on injury and illness rates and 
experience and should obtain contractor references. Additionally, the 
employer must assure that the contractor has the appropriate job skills, 
knowledge and certifications (such as for pressure vessel welders). 
Contractor work methods and experiences should be evaluated. For 
example, does the contractor conducting demolition work swing loads over 
operating processes or does the contractor avoid such hazards?
    Maintaining a site injury and illness log for contractors is another 
method employers must use to track and maintain current knowledge of 
work activities involving contract employees working on or adjacent to 
covered processes. Injury and illness logs of both the employer's 
employees and contract employees allow an employer to have full 
knowledge of process injury and illness experience. This log will also 
contain information which will be of use to those auditing process 
safety management compliance and those involved in incident 
investigations.
    Contract employees must perform their work safely. Considering that 
contractors often perform very specialized and potentially hazardous 
tasks such as confined space entry activities and nonroutine repair 
activities it is quite important that their activities be controlled 
while they are working on or near a covered process. A permit system or 
work authorization system for these activities would also be helpful to 
all affected employers. The use of a work authorization system keeps an 
employer informed of contract employee activities, and as a benefit the 
employer will have better coordination and more management control over 
the work being performed in the process area. A well run and well 
maintained process where employee safety is fully recognized will 
benefit all of those who work in the facility whether

[[Page 133]]

they be contract employees or employees of the owner.
    8. Pre-Startup Safety. For new processes, the employer will find a 
PHA helpful in improving the design and construction of the process from 
a reliability and quality point of view. The safe operation of the new 
process will be enhanced by making use of the PHA recommendations before 
final installations are completed. P&IDs are to be completed along with 
having the operating procedures in place and the operating staff trained 
to run the process before startup. The initial startup procedures and 
normal operating procedures need to be fully evaluated as part of the 
pre-startup review to assure a safe transfer into the normal operating 
mode for meeting the process parameters.
    For existing processes that have been shutdown for turnaround, or 
modification, etc., the employer must assure that any changes other than 
``replacement in kind'' made to the process during shutdown go through 
the management of change procedures. P&IDs will need to be updated as 
necessary, as well as operating procedures and instructions. If the 
changes made to the process during shutdown are significant and impact 
the training program, then operating personnel as well as employees 
engaged in routine and nonroutine work in the process area may need some 
refresher or additional training in light of the changes. Any incident 
investigation recommendations, compliance audits or PHA recommendations 
need to be reviewed as well to see what impacts they may have on the 
process before beginning the startup.
    9. Mechanical Integrity. Employers will need to review their 
maintenance programs and schedules to see if there are areas where 
``breakdown'' maintenance is used rather than an on-going mechanical 
integrity program. Equipment used to process, store, or handle highly 
hazardous chemicals needs to be designed, constructed, installed and 
maintained to minimize the risk of releases of such chemicals. This 
requires that a mechanical integrity program be in place to assure the 
continued integrity of process equipment. Elements of a mechanical 
integrity program include the identification and categorization of 
equipment and instrumentation, inspections and tests, testing and 
inspection frequencies, development of maintenance procedures, training 
of maintenance personnel, the establishment of criteria for acceptable 
test results, documentation of test and inspection results, and 
documentation of manufacturer recommendations as to meantime to failure 
for equipment and instrumentation.
    The first line of defense an employer has available is to operate 
and maintain the process as designed, and to keep the chemicals 
contained. This line of defense is backed up by the next line of defense 
which is the controlled release of chemicals through venting to 
scrubbers or flares, or to surge or overflow tanks which are designed to 
receive such chemicals, etc. These lines of defense are the primary 
lines of defense or means to prevent unwanted releases. The secondary 
lines of defense would include fixed fire protection systems like 
sprinklers, water spray, or deluge systems, monitor guns, etc., dikes, 
designed drainage systems, and other systems which would control or 
mitigate hazardous chemicals once an unwanted release occurs. These 
primary and secondary lines of defense are what the mechanical integrity 
program needs to protect and strengthen these primary and secondary 
lines of defenses where appropriate.
    The first step of an effective mechanical integrity program is to 
compile and categorize a list of process equipment and instrumentation 
for inclusion in the program. This list would include pressure vessels, 
storage tanks, process piping, relief and vent systems, fire protection 
system components, emergency shutdown systems and alarms and interlocks 
and pumps. For the categorization of instrumentation and the listed 
equipment the employer would prioritize which pieces of equipment 
require closer scrutiny than others. Meantime to failure of various 
instrumentation and equipment parts would be known from the 
manufacturers data or the employer's experience with the parts, which 
would then influence the inspection and testing frequency and associated 
procedures. Also, applicable codes and standards such as the National 
Board Inspection Code, or those from the American Society for Testing 
and Material, American Petroleum Institute, National Fire Protection 
Association, American National Standards Institute, American Society of 
Mechanical Engineers, and other groups, provide information to help 
establish an effective testing and inspection frequency, as well as 
appropriate methodologies.
    The applicable codes and standards provide criteria for external 
inspections for such items as foundation and supports, anchor bolts, 
concrete or steel supports, guy wires, nozzles and sprinklers, pipe 
hangers, grounding connections, protective coatings and insulation, and 
external metal surfaces of piping and vessels, etc. These codes and 
standards also provide information on methodologies for internal 
inspection, and a frequency formula based on the corrosion rate of the 
materials of construction. Also, erosion both internal and external 
needs to be considered along with corrosion effects for piping and 
valves. Where the corrosion rate is not known, a maximum inspection 
frequency is recommended, and methods of developing the corrosion rate 
are available in the codes. Internal inspections need to cover items 
such as vessel shell, bottom and head; metallic linings; nonmetallic 
linings; thickness

[[Page 134]]

measurements for vessels and piping; inspection for erosion, corrosion, 
cracking and bulges; internal equipment like trays, baffles, sensors and 
screens for erosion, corrosion or cracking and other deficiencies. Some 
of these inspections may be performed by state or local government 
inspectors under state and local statutes. However, each employer needs 
to develop procedures to ensure that tests and inspections are conducted 
properly and that consistency is maintained even where different 
employees may be involved. Appropriate training is to be provided to 
maintenance personnel to ensure that they understand the preventive 
maintenance program procedures, safe practices, and the proper use and 
application of special equipment or unique tools that may be required. 
This training is part of the overall training program called for in the 
standard.
    A quality assurance system is needed to help ensure that the proper 
materials of construction are used, that fabrication and inspection 
procedures are proper, and that installation procedures recognize field 
installation concerns. The quality assurance program is an essential 
part of the mechanical integrity program and will help to maintain the 
primary and secondary lines of defense that have been designed into the 
process to prevent unwanted chemical releases or those which control or 
mitigate a release. ``As built'' drawings, together with certifications 
of coded vessels and other equipment, and materials of construction need 
to be verified and retained in the quality assurance documentation. 
Equipment installation jobs need to be properly inspected in the field 
for use of proper materials and procedures and to assure that qualified 
craftsmen are used to do the job. The use of appropriate gaskets, 
packing, bolts, valves, lubricants and welding rods need to be verified 
in the field. Also, procedures for installation of safety devices need 
to be verified, such as the torque on the bolts on ruptured disc 
installations, uniform torque on flange bolts, proper installation of 
pump seals, etc. If the quality of parts is a problem, it may be 
appropriate to conduct audits of the equipment supplier's facilities to 
better assure proper purchases of required equipment which is suitable 
for its intended service. Any changes in equipment that may become 
necessary will need to go through the management of change procedures.
    10. Nonroutine Work Authorizations. Nonroutine work which is 
conducted in process areas needs to be controlled by the employer in a 
consistent manner. The hazards identified involving the work that is to 
be accomplished must be communicated to those doing the work, but also 
to those operating personnel whose work could affect the safety of the 
process. A work authorization notice or permit must have a procedure 
that describes the steps the maintenance supervisor, contractor 
representative or other person needs to follow to obtain the necessary 
clearance to get the job started. The work authorization procedures need 
to reference and coordinate, as applicable, lockout/tagout procedures, 
line breaking procedures, confined space entry procedures and hot work 
authorizations. This procedure also needs to provide clear steps to 
follow once the job is completed in order to provide closure for those 
that need to know the job is now completed and equipment can be returned 
to normal.
    11. Managing Change. To properly manage changes to process 
chemicals, technology, equipment and facilities, one must define what is 
meant by change. In this process safety management standard, change 
includes all modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials and 
processing conditions other than ``replacement in kind.'' These changes 
need to be properly managed by identifying and reviewing them prior to 
implementation of the change. For example, the operating procedures 
contain the operating parameters (pressure limits, temperature ranges, 
flow rates, etc.) and the importance of operating within these limits. 
While the operator must have the flexibility to maintain safe operation 
within the established parameters, any operation outside of these 
parameters requires review and approval by a written management of 
change procedure.
    Management of change covers such as changes in process technology 
and changes to equipment and instrumentation. Changes in process 
technology can result from changes in production rates, raw materials, 
experimentation, equipment unavailability, new equipment, new product 
development, change in catalyst and changes in operating conditions to 
improve yield or quality. Equipment changes include among others change 
in materials of construction, equipment specifications, piping pre-
arrangements, experimental equipment, computer program revisions and 
changes in alarms and interlocks. Employers need to establish means and 
methods to detect both technical changes and mechanical changes.
    Temporary changes have caused a number of catastrophes over the 
years, and employers need to establish ways to detect temporary changes 
as well as those that are permanent. It is important that a time limit 
for temporary changes be established and monitored since, without 
control, these changes may tend to become permanent. Temporary changes 
are subject to the management of change provisions. In addition, the 
management of change procedures are used to insure that the equipment 
and procedures are returned to their original or designed conditions at 
the end of the temporary change. Proper documentation and review of 
these changes is invaluable in assuring that the safety and health 
considerations are being

[[Page 135]]

incorporated into the operating procedures and the process.
    Employers may wish to develop a form or clearance sheet to 
facilitate the processing of changes through the management of change 
procedures. A typical change form may include a description and the 
purpose of the change, the technical basis for the change, safety and 
health considerations, documentation of changes for the operating 
procedures, maintenance procedures, inspection and testing, P&IDs, 
electrical classification, training and communications, pre-startup 
inspection, duration if a temporary change, approvals and authorization. 
Where the impact of the change is minor and well understood, a check 
list reviewed by an authorized person with proper communication to 
others who are affected may be sufficient. However, for a more complex 
or significant design change, a hazard evaluation procedure with 
approvals by operations, maintenance, and safety departments may be 
appropriate. Changes in documents such as P&IDs, raw materials, 
operating procedures, mechanical integrity programs, electrical 
classifications, etc., need to be noted so that these revisions can be 
made permanent when the drawings and procedure manuals are updated. 
Copies of process changes need to be kept in an accessible location to 
ensure that design changes are available to operating personnel as well 
as to PHA team members when a PHA is being done or one is being updated.
    12. Investigation of Incidents. Incident investigation is the 
process of identifying the underlying causes of incidents and 
implementing steps to prevent similar events from occurring. The intent 
of an incident investigation is for employers to learn from past 
experiences and thus avoid repeating past mistakes. The incidents for 
which OSHA expects employers to become aware and to investigate are the 
types of events which result in or could reasonably have resulted in a 
catastrophic release. Some of the events are sometimes referred to as 
``near misses,'' meaning that a serious consequence did not occur, but 
could have.
    Employers need to develop in-house capability to investigate 
incidents that occur in their facilities. A team needs to be assembled 
by the employer and trained in the techniques of investigation including 
how to conduct interviews of witnesses, needed documentation and report 
writing. A multi-disciplinary team is better able to gather the facts of 
the event and to analyze them and develop plausible scenarios as to what 
happened, and why. Team members should be selected on the basis of their 
training, knowledge and ability to contribute to a team effort to fully 
investigate the incident. Employees in the process area where the 
incident occurred should be consulted, interviewed or made a member of 
the team. Their knowledge of the events form a significant set of facts 
about the incident which occurred. The report, its findings and 
recommendations are to be shared with those who can benefit from the 
information. The cooperation of employees is essential to an effective 
incident investigation. The focus of the investigation should be to 
obtain facts, and not to place blame. The team and the investigation 
process should clearly deal with all involved individuals in a fair, 
open and consistent manner.
    13. Emergency Preparedness. Each employer must address what actions 
employees are to take when there is an unwanted release of highly 
hazardous chemicals. Emergency preparedness or the employer's tertiary 
(third) lines of defense are those that will be relied on along with the 
secondary lines of defense when the primary lines of defense which are 
used to prevent an unwanted release fail to stop the release. Employers 
will need to decide if they want employees to handle and stop small or 
minor incidental releases. Whether they wish to mobilize the available 
resources at the plant and have them brought to bear on a more 
significant release. Or whether employers want their employees to 
evacuate the danger area and promptly escape to a preplanned safe zone 
area, and allow the local community emergency response organizations to 
handle the release. Or whether the employer wants to use some 
combination of these actions. Employers will need to select how many 
different emergency preparedness or tertiary lines of defense they plan 
to have and then develop the necessary plans and procedures, and 
appropriately train employees in their emergency duties and 
responsibilities and then implement these lines of defense.
    Employers at a minimum must have an emergency action plan which will 
facilitate the prompt evacuation of employees when an unwanted release 
of highly hazardous chemical. This means that the employer will have a 
plan that will be activated by an alarm system to alert employees when 
to evacuate and, that employees who are physically impaired, will have 
the necessary support and assistance to get them to the safe zone as 
well. The intent of these requirements is to alert and move employees to 
a safe zone quickly. Delaying alarms or confusing alarms are to be 
avoided. The use of process control centers or similar process buildings 
in the process area as safe areas is discouraged. Recent catastrophes 
have shown that a large life loss has occurred in these structures 
because of where they have been sited and because they are not 
necessarily designed to withstand over-pressures from shockwaves 
resulting from explosions in the process area.
    Unwanted incidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals in the 
process area must be addressed by the employer as to

[[Page 136]]

what actions employees are to take. If the employer wants employees to 
evacuate the area, then the emergency action plan will be activated. For 
outdoor processes where wind direction is important for selecting the 
safe route to a refuge area, the employer should place a wind direction 
indicator such as a wind sock or pennant at the highest point that can 
be seen throughout the process area. Employees can move in the direction 
of cross wind to upwind to gain safe access to the refuge area by 
knowing the wind direction.
    If the employer wants specific employees in the release area to 
control or stop the minor emergency or incidental release, these actions 
must be planned for in advance and procedures developed and implemented. 
Preplanning for handling incidental releases for minor emergencies in 
the process area needs to be done, appropriate equipment for the hazards 
must be provided, and training conducted for those employees who will 
perform the emergency work before they respond to handle an actual 
release. The employer's training program, including the Hazard 
Communication standard training is to address the training needs for 
employees who are expected to handle incidental or minor releases.
    Preplanning for releases that are more serious than incidental 
releases is another important line of defense to be used by the 
employer. When a serious release of a highly hazardous chemical occurs, 
the employer through preplanning will have determined in advance what 
actions employees are to take. The evacuation of the immediate release 
area and other areas as necessary would be accomplished under the 
emergency action plan. If the employer wishes to use plant personnel 
such as a fire brigade, spill control team, a hazardous materials team, 
or use employees to render aid to those in the immediate release area 
and control or mitigate the incident, these actions are covered by 
1926.65, the Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response 
(HAZWOPER) standard. If outside assistance is necessary, such as through 
mutual aid agreements between employers or local government emergency 
response organizations, these emergency responders are also covered by 
HAZWOPER. The safety and health protections required for emergency 
responders are the responsibility of their employers and of the on-scene 
incident commander.
    Responders may be working under very hazardous conditions and 
therefore the objective is to have them competently led by an on-scene 
incident commander and the commander's staff, properly equipped to do 
their assigned work safely, and fully trained to carry out their duties 
safely before they respond to an emergency. Drills, training exercises, 
or simulations with the local community emergency response planners and 
responder organizations is one means to obtain better preparedness. This 
close cooperation and coordination between plant and local community 
emergency preparedness managers will also aid the employer in complying 
with the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Plan 
criteria.
    One effective way for medium to large facilities to enhance 
coordination and communication during emergencies for on plant 
operations and with local community organizations is for employers to 
establish and equip an emergency control center. The emergency control 
center would be sited in a safe zone area so that it could be occupied 
throughout the duration of an emergency. The center would serve as the 
major communication link between the on-scene incident commander and 
plant or corporate management as well as with the local community 
officials. The communication equipment in the emergency control center 
should include a network to receive and transmit information by 
telephone, radio or other means. It is important to have a backup 
communication network in case of power failure or one communication 
means fails. The center should also be equipped with the plant layout 
and community maps, utility drawings including fire water, emergency 
lighting, appropriate reference materials such as a government agency 
notification list, company personnel phone list, SARA Title III reports 
and material safety data sheets, emergency plans and procedures manual, 
a listing with the location of emergency response equipment, mutual aid 
information, and access to meteorological or weather condition data and 
any dispersion modeling data.
    14. Compliance Audits. Employers need to select a trained individual 
or assemble a trained team of people to audit the process safety 
management system and program. A small process or plant may need only 
one knowledgeable person to conduct an audit. The audit is to include an 
evaluation of the design and effectiveness of the process safety 
management system and a field inspection of the safety and health 
conditions and practices to verify that the employer's systems are 
effectively implemented. The audit should be conducted or lead by a 
person knowledgeable in audit techniques and who is impartial towards 
the facility or area being audited. The essential elements of an audit 
program include planning, staffing, conducting the audit, evaluation and 
corrective action, follow-up and documentation.
    Planning in advance is essential to the success of the auditing 
process. Each employer needs to establish the format, staffing, 
scheduling and verification methods prior to conducting the audit. The 
format should be designed to provide the lead auditor with a procedure 
or checklist which details the requirements of each section of the 
standard. The names of the audit team members

[[Page 137]]

should be listed as part of the format as well. The checklist, if 
properly designed, could serve as the verification sheet which provides 
the auditor with the necessary information to expedite the review and 
assure that no requirements of the standard are omitted. This 
verification sheet format could also identify those elements that will 
require evaluation or a response to correct deficiencies. This sheet 
could also be used for developing the follow-up and documentation 
requirements.
    The selection of effective audit team members is critical to the 
success of the program. Team members should be chosen for their 
experience, knowledge, and training and should be familiar with the 
processes and with auditing techniques, practices and procedures. The 
size of the team will vary depending on the size and complexity of the 
process under consideration. For a large, complex, highly instrumented 
plant, it may be desirable to have team members with expertise in 
process engineering and design, process chemistry, instrumentation and 
computer controls, electrical hazards and classifications, safety and 
health disciplines, maintenance, emergency preparedness, warehousing or 
shipping, and process safety auditing. The team may use part-time 
members to provide for the depth of expertise required as well as for 
what is actually done or followed, compared to what is written.
    An effective audit includes a review of the relevant documentation 
and process safety information, inspection of the physical facilities, 
and interviews with all levels of plant personnel. Utilizing the audit 
procedure and checklist developed in the preplanning stage, the audit 
team can systematically analyze compliance with the provisions of the 
standard and any other corporate policies that are relevant. For 
example, the audit team will review all aspects of the training program 
as part of the overall audit. The team will review the written training 
program for adequacy of content, frequency of training, effectiveness of 
training in terms of its goals and objectives as well as to how it fits 
into meeting the standard's requirements, documentation, etc. Through 
interviews, the team can determine the employee's knowledge and 
awareness of the safety procedures, duties, rules, emergency response 
assignments, etc. During the inspection, the team can observe actual 
practices such as safety and health policies, procedures, and work 
authorization practices. This approach enables the team to identify 
deficiencies and determine where corrective actions or improvements are 
necessary.
    An audit is a technique used to gather sufficient facts and 
information, including statistical information, to verify compliance 
with standards. Auditors should select as part of their preplanning a 
sample size sufficient to give a degree of confidence that the audit 
reflects the level of compliance with the standard. The audit team, 
through this systematic analysis, should document areas which require 
corrective action as well as those areas where the process safety 
management system is effective and working in an effective manner. This 
provides a record of the audit procedures and findings, and serves as a 
baseline of operation data for future audits. It will assist future 
auditors in determining changes or trends from previous audits.
    Corrective action is one of the most important parts of the audit. 
It includes not only addressing the identified deficiencies, but also 
planning, followup, and documentation. The corrective action process 
normally begins with a management review of the audit findings. The 
purpose of this review is to determine what actions are appropriate, and 
to establish priorities, timetables, resource allocations and 
requirements and responsibilities. In some cases, corrective action may 
involve a simple change in procedure or minor maintenance effort to 
remedy the concern. Management of change procedures need to be used, as 
appropriate, even for what may seem to be a minor change. Many of the 
deficiencies can be acted on promptly, while some may require 
engineering studies or indepth review of actual procedures and 
practices. There may be instances where no action is necessary and this 
is a valid response to an audit finding. All actions taken, including an 
explanation where no action is taken on a finding, needs to be 
documented as to what was done and why.
    It is important to assure that each deficiency identified is 
addressed, the corrective action to be taken noted, and the audit person 
or team responsible be properly documented by the employer. To control 
the corrective action process, the employer should consider the use of a 
tracking system. This tracking system might include periodic status 
reports shared with affected levels of management, specific reports such 
as completion of an engineering study, and a final implementation report 
to provide closure for audit findings that have been through management 
of change, if appropriate, and then shared with affected employees and 
management. This type of tracking system provides the employer with the 
status of the corrective action. It also provides the documentation 
required to verify that appropriate corrective actions were taken on 
deficiencies identified in the audit.

Sec. 1926.65  Hazardous waste operations and emergency response.

    (a) Scope, application, and definitions--(1) Scope. This section 
covers the following operations, unless the employer can demonstrate 
that the operation does not involve employee exposure or the reasonable 
possibility for employee exposure to safety or health hazards:
    (i) Clean-up operations required by a governmental body, whether 
Federal, state, local or other involving hazardous substances that are 
conducted at uncontrolled hazardous waste sites (including, but not 
limited to, the EPA's National Priority Site List (NPL), state priority 
site lists, sites recommended for the EPA NPL, and initial 
investigations of government identified sites which are conducted before 
the presence or absence of hazardous substances has been ascertained);
    (ii) Corrective actions involving clean-up operations at sites 
covered by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) as 
amended (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.);
    (iii) Voluntary clean-up operations at sites recognized by Federal, 
state, local or other governmental bodies as uncontrolled hazardous 
waste sites;
    (iv) Operations involving hazardous wastes that are conducted at 
treatment, storage, and disposal (TSD) facilities regulated by 40 CFR 
parts 264 and 265 pursuant to RCRA; or by agencies under agreement with 
U.S.E.P.A. to implement RCRA regulations; and
    (v) Emergency response operations for releases of, or substantial 
threats of releases of, hazardous substances without regard to the 
location of the hazard.
    (2) Application. (i) All requirements of part 1910 and part 1926 of 
title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations apply pursuant to their 
terms to hazardous waste and emergency response operations whether 
covered by this section or not. If there is a conflict or overlap,

[[Page 139]]

the provision more protective of employee safety and health shall apply 
without regard to 29 CFR 1926.20(e)(1).
    (ii) Hazardous substance clean-up operations within the scope of 
paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iii) of this section must comply 
with all paragraphs of this section except paragraphs (p) and (q).
    (iii) Operations within the scope of paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this 
section must comply only with the requirements of paragraph (p) of this 
section.

    Notes and Exceptions: (A) All provisions of paragraph (p) of this 
section cover any treatment, storage or disposal (TSD) operation 
regulated by 40 CFR parts 264 and 265 or by state law authorized under 
RCRA, and required to have a permit or interim status from EPA pursuant 
to 40 CFR 270.1 or from a state agency pursuant to RCRA.
    (B) Employers who are not required to have a permit or interim 
status because they are conditionally exempt small quantity generators 
under 40 CFR 261.5 or are generators who qualify under 40 CFR 262.34 for 
exemptions from regulation under 40 CFR parts 264, 265 and 270 
(``excepted employers'') are not covered by paragraphs (p)(1) through 
(p)(7) of this section. Excepted employers who are required by the EPA 
or state agency to have their employees engage in emergency response or 
who direct their employees to engage in emergency response are covered 
by paragraph (p)(8) of this section, and cannot be exempted by (p)(8)(i) 
of this section. Excepted employers who are not required to have 
employees engage in emergency response, who direct their employees to 
evacuate in the case of such emergencies and who meet the requirements 
of paragraph (p)(8)(i) of this section are exempt from the balance of 
paragraph (p)(8) of this section.
    (C) If an area is used primarily for treatment, storage or disposal, 
any emergency response operations in that area shall comply with 
paragraph (p)(8) of this section. In other areas not used primarily for 
treatment, storage, or disposal, any emergency response operations shall 
comply with paragraph (q) of this section. Compliance with the 
requirements of paragraph (q) of this section shall be deemed to be in 
compliance with the requirements of paragraph (p)(8) of this section.

    (iv) Emergency response operations for releases of, or substantial 
threats of releases of, hazardous substances which are not covered by 
paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iv) of this section must only comply 
with the requirements of paragraph (q) of this section.
    (3) Definitions--Buddy system means a system of organizing employees 
into work groups in such a manner that each employee of the work group 
is designated to be observed by at least one other employee in the work 
group. The purpose of the buddy system is to provide rapid assistance to 
employees in the event of an emergency.
    Clean-up operation means an operation where hazardous substances are 
removed, contained, incinerated, neutralized, stabilized, cleared-up, or 
in any other manner processed or handled with the ultimate goal of 
making the site safer for people or the environment.
    Decontamination means the removal of hazardous substances from 
employees and their equipment to the extent necessary to preclude the 
occurrence of foreseeable adverse health affects.
    Emergency response or responding to emergencies means a response 
effort by employees from outside the immediate release area or by other 
designated responders (i.e., mutual-aid groups, local fire departments, 
etc.) to an occurrence which results, or is likely to result, in an 
uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance. Responses to incidental 
releases of hazardous substances where the substance can be absorbed, 
neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees 
in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel are not 
considered to be emergency responses within the scope of this standard. 
Responses to releases of hazardous substances where there is no 
potential safety or health hazard (i.e., fire, explosion, or chemical 
exposure) are not considered to be emergency responses.
    Facility means (A) any building, structure, installation, equipment, 
pipe or pipeline (including any pipe into a sewer or publicly owned 
treatment works), well, pit, pond, lagoon, impoundment, ditch, storage 
container, motor vehicle, rolling stock, or aircraft, or (B) any site or 
area where a hazardous substance has been deposited, stored, disposed 
of, or placed, or otherwise come to be located; but does not include any 
consumer product in consumer use or any water-borne vessel.

[[Page 140]]

    Hazardous materials response (HAZMAT) team means an organized group 
of employees, designated by the employer, who are expected to perform 
work to handle and control actual or potential leaks or spills of 
hazardous substances requiring possible close approach to the substance. 
The team members perform responses to releases or potential releases of 
hazardous substances for the purpose of control or stabilization of the 
incident. A HAZMAT team is not a fire brigade nor is a typical fire 
brigade a HAZMAT team. A HAZMAT team, however, may be a separate 
component of a fire brigade or fire department.
    Hazardous substance means any substance designated or listed under 
paragraphs (A) through (D) of this definition, exposure to which results 
or may result in adverse affects on the health or safety of employees:
    (A) Any substance defined under section 101(14) of CERCLA;
    (B) Any biological agent and other disease-causing agent which after 
release into the environment and upon exposure, ingestion, inhalation, 
or assimilation into any person, either directly from the environment or 
indirectly by ingestion through food chains, will or may reasonably be 
anticipated to cause death, disease, behavioral abnormalities, cancer, 
genetic mutation, physiological malfunctions (including malfunctions in 
reproduction) or physical deformations in such persons or their 
offspring;
    (C) Any substance listed by the U.S. Department of Transportation as 
hazardous materials under 49 CFR 172.101 and appendices; and
    (D) Hazardous waste as herein defined.
    Hazardous waste means--(A) A waste or combination of wastes as 
defined in 40 CFR 261.3, or
    (B) Those substances defined as hazardous wastes in 49 CFR 171.8.
    Hazardous waste operation means any operation conducted within the 
scope of this standard.
    Hazardous waste site or Site means any facility or location within 
the scope of this standard at which hazardous waste operations take 
place.
    Health hazard means a chemical, mixture of chemicals or a pathogen 
for which there is statistically significant evidence based on at least 
one study conducted in accordance with established scientific principles 
that acute or chronic health effects may occur in exposed employees. The 
term health hazard includes chemicals which are carcinogens, toxic or 
highly toxic agents, reproductive toxins, irritants, corrosives, 
sensitizers, heptaotoxins, nephrotoxins, neurotoxins, agents which act 
on the hematopoietic system, and agents which damage the lungs, skin, 
eyes, or mucous membranes. It also includes stress due to temperature 
extremes. Further definition of the terms used above can be found in 
appendix A to 29 CFR 1926.59.
    IDLH or Immediately dangerous to life or health means an atmospheric 
concentration of any toxic, corrosive or asphyxiant substance that poses 
an immediate threat to life or would cause irreversible or delayed 
adverse health effects or would interfere with an individual's ability 
to escape from a dangerous atmosphere.
    Oxygen deficiency means that concentration of oxygen by volume below 
which atmosphere supplying respiratory protection must be provided. It 
exists in atmospheres where the percentage of oxygen by volume is less 
than 19.5 percent oxygen.
    Permissible exposure limit means the exposure, inhalation or dermal 
permissible exposure limit specified either in Sec. 1926.55, elsewhere 
in subpart D, or in other pertinent sections of this part.
    Published exposure level means the exposure limits published in 
``NIOSH Recommendations for Occupational Health Standards'' dated 1986 
incorporated by reference, or if none is specified, the exposure limits 
published in the standards specified by the American Conference of 
Governmental Industrial Hygienists in their publication ``Threshold 
Limit Values and Biological Exposure Indices for 1987-88'' dated 1987 
incorporated by reference.
    Post emergency response means that portion of an emergency response 
performed after the immediate threat of a release has been stabilized or 
eliminated and clean-up of the site has begun. If post emergency 
response is performed by an employer's own employees who were part of 
the initial

[[Page 141]]

emergency response, it is considered to be part of the initial response 
and not post emergency response. However, if a group of an employer's 
own employees, separate from the group providing initial response, 
performs the clean-up operation, then the separate group of employees 
would be considered to be performing post-emergency response and subject 
to paragraph (q)(11) of this section.
    Qualified person means a person with specific training, knowledge 
and experience in the area for which the person has the responsibility 
and the authority to control.
    Site safety and health supervisor (or official) means the individual 
located on a hazardous waste site who is responsible to the employer and 
has the authority and knowledge necessary to implement the site safety 
and health plan and verify compliance with applicable safety and health 
requirements.
    Small quantity qenerator means a generator of hazardous wastes who 
in any calendar month generates no more than 1,000 kilograms (2,205 
pounds) of hazardous waste in that month.
    Uncontrolled hazardous waste site, means an area identified as an 
uncontrolled hazardous waste site by a governmental body, whether 
Federal, state, local or other where an accumulation of hazardous 
substances creates a threat to the health and safety of individuals or 
the environment or both. Some sites are found on public lands such as 
those created by former municipal, county or state landfills where 
illegal or poorly managed waste disposal has taken place. Other sites 
are found on private property, often belonging to generators or former 
generators of hazardous substance wastes. Examples of such sites 
include, but are not limited to, surface impoundments, landfills, dumps, 
and tank or drum farms. Normal operations at TSD sites are not covered 
by this definition.

    (b) Safety and health program.

    Note to (b): Safety and health programs developed and implemented to 
meet other Federal, state, or local regulations are considered 
acceptable in meeting this requirement if they cover or are modified to 
cover the topics required in this paragraph. An additional or separate 
safety and health program is not required by this paragraph.

    (1) General. (i) Employers shall develop and implement a written

contractor or sub-contractor services for work in hazardous waste 
operations shall inform those contractors, sub-contractors, or their 
representatives of the site emergency response procedures and any 
potential fire, explosion, health, safety or other hazards of the 
hazardous waste operation that have been identified by the employer, 
including those identified in the employer's information program.
    (v) Program availability. The written safety and health program 
shall be made available to any contractor or subcontractor or their

that this plan is being followed. The information and data obtained from 
site characterization and analysis work required in paragraph (c) of 
this section shall be used to prepare and update the site safety and 
health plan.
    (iv) Effectiveness of site safety and health plan. Inspections shall 
be conducted by the site safety and health supervisor or, in the absence 
of that individual, another individual who is knowledgeable in 
occupational safety and health, acting on behalf of the employer as 
necessary to determine the effectiveness of the site safety and health 
plan. Any deficiencies in the effectiveness of the site safety and 
health plan shall be corrected by the employer.
    (c) Site characterization and analysis--(1) General. Hazardous waste 
sites shall be evaluated in accordance with this paragraph to identify 
specific site hazards and to determine the appropriate safety and health 
control procedures needed to protect employees from the identified 
hazards.
    (2) Preliminary evaluation. A preliminary evaluation of a site's 
characteristics shall be performed prior to site entry by a qualified 
person in order to aid in the selection of appropriate employee 
protection methods prior to site entry. Immediately after initial site 
entry, a more detailed evaluation of the site's specific characteristics 
shall be performed by a qualified person in order to further identify 
existing site hazards and to further aid in the selection of the 
appropriate engineering controls and personal protective equipment for 
the tasks to be performed.
    (3) Hazard identification. All suspected conditions that may pose 
inhalation or skin absorption hazards that are immediately dangerous to 
life or health (IDLH), or other conditions that may cause death or 
serious harm, shall be identified during the preliminary survey and 
evaluated during the detailed survey. Examples of such hazards include, 
but are not limited to, confined space entry, potentially explosive or 
flammable situations, visible vapor clouds, or areas where biological 
indicators such as dead animals or vegetation are located.
    (4) Required information. The following information to the extent 
available shall be obtained by the employer prior to allowing employees

ensemble of PPE shall be selected and used during initial site entry 
which will provide protection to a level of exposure below permissible 
exposure limits and published exposure levels for known or suspected 
hazardous substances and health hazards, and which will provide 
protection against other known and suspected hazards identified during 
the preliminary site evaluation. If there is no permissible exposure 
limit or published exposure level, the employer may use other published 
studies and information as a guide to appropriate personal protective 
equipment.
    (ii) If positive-pressure self-contained breathing apparatus is not 
used as part of the entry ensemble, and if respiratory protection is 
warranted by the potential hazards identified during the preliminary 
site evaluation, an escape self-contained breathing apparatus of at 
least five minute's duration shall be carried by employees during 
initial site entry.
    (iii) If the preliminary site evaluation does not produce sufficient 
information to identify the hazards or suspected hazards of the site, an 
ensemble

[[Page 144]]

providing protection equivalent to Level B PPE shall be provided as 
minimum protection, and direct reading instruments shall be used as 
appropriate for identifying IDLH conditions. (See appendix B for a 
description of Level B hazards and the recommendations for Level B 
protective equipment.)

appropriate PPE shall be selected and used in accordance with paragraph 
(g) of this section.
    (6) Monitoring. The following monitoring shall be conducted during 
initial site entry when the site evaluation produces information that 
shows the potential for ionizing radiation or IDLH conditions, or when 
the site information is not sufficient reasonably to eliminate these 
possible conditions:
    (i) Monitoring with direct reading instruments for hazardous levels 
of ionizing radiation.
    (ii) Monitoring the air with appropriate direct reading test 
equipment (i.e., combustible gas meters, detector tubes) for IDLH and 
other conditions that may cause death or serious harm (combustible or 
explosive atmospheres, oxygen deficiency, toxic substances).
    (iii) Visually observing for signs of actual or potential IDLH or 
other dangerous conditions.
    (iv) An ongoing air monitoring program in accordance with paragraph 
(h) of this section shall be implemented after site characterization has 
determined the site is safe for the start-up of operations.
    (7) Risk identification. Once the presence and concentrations of 
specific hazardous substances and health hazards have been established, 
the risks associated with these substances shall be identified. 
Employees who will be working on the site shall be informed of any risks 
that have been identified. In situations covered by the Hazard

[[Page 148]]

these shall be implemented in accordance with this paragraph to protect 
employees from exposure to hazardous substances and safety and health 
hazards.
    (1) Engineering controls, work practices and PPE for substances 
regulated either in Sec. 1926.55, elsewhere in subpart D, or in other 
pertinent sections of this part. (i) Engineering controls and work 
practices shall be instituted to reduce and maintain employee exposure 
to or below the permissible exposure limits for substances regulated 
either in Sec. 1926.55 or other pertinent sections of this part, except 
to the extent that such controls and practices are not feasible.

    Note to (g)(1)(i): Engineering controls which may be feasible 
include the use of pressurized cabs or control booths on equipment, and/
or the use of remotely operated material handling equipment. Work 
practices which may be feasible are removing all non-essential employees 
from potential exposure during opening of drums, wetting down dusty 
operations and locating employees upwind of possible hazards.

    (ii) Whenever engineering controls and work practices are not 
feasible or not required, any reasonable combination of engineering 
controls, work practices and PPE shall be used to reduce and maintain 
employee exposures to or below the permissible exposure limits or dose 
limits for substances regulated either in Sec. 1926.55 or other 
pertinent sections of this part.
    (iii) The employer shall not implement a schedule of employee 
rotation as a means of compliance with permissible exposure limits or 
dose limits except when there is no other feasible way of complying with 
the airborne or dermal dose limits for ionizing radiation.
    (iv) The provisions of subpart D shall be followed.
    (2) Engineering controls, work practices, and PPE for substances not 
regulated either in Sec. 1926.55, elsewhere in subpart D, or in other 
pertinent sections of this part. An appropriate combination of 
engineering controls, work practices and personal protective equipment 
shall be used to reduce and maintain employee exposure to or below 
published exposure levels for hazardous substances and health hazards 
not regulated either in Sec. 1926.55, elsewhere in subpart D, or in 
other pertinent sections of this part. The employer may use the 
published literature and MSDS as a guide in making the employer's 
determination as to what level of protection the employer believes is 
appropriate for hazardous substances and health hazards for which there 
is no permissible exposure limit or published exposure limit.
    (3) Personal protective equipment selection. (i) Personal protective 
equipment (PPE) shall be selected and used which will protect employees 
from the hazards and potential hazards they are likely to encounter as 
identified during the site characterization and analysis.
    (ii) Personal protective equipment selection shall be based on an 
evaluation of the performance characteristics of the PPE relative to the 
requirements and limitations of the site, the task-specific conditions 
and duration, and the hazards and potential hazards identified at the 
site.
    (iii) Positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus, or 
positive pressure air-line respirators equipped with an escape air 
supply, shall be used when chemical exposure levels present will create 
a substantial possibility of immediate death, immediate serious illness 
or injury, or impair the ability to escape.
    (iv) Totally-encapsulating chemical protective suits (protection 
equivalent to Level A protection as recommended in appendix B) shall be 
used in conditions where skin absorption of a hazardous substance may 
result in a substantial possibility of immediate death, immediate 
serious illness or injury, or impair the ability to escape.
    (v) The level of protection provided by PPE selection shall be 
increased when additional information on site conditions indicates that 
increased protection is necessary to reduce employee exposures below 
permissible exposure limits and published exposure levels for hazardous 
substances and health hazards. (See appendix B for guidance on selecting 
PPE ensembles.)

    Note to (g)(3): The level of employee protection provided may be 
decreased when additional information or site conditions show that 
decreased protection will not result in hazardous exposures to 
employees.

    (vi) Personal protective equipment shall be selected and used to 
meet the

[[Page 149]]

requirements of subpart E of this part and additional requirements 
specified in this section.
    (4) Totally-encapsulating chemical protective suits. (i) Totally-
encapsulating suits shall protect employees from the particular hazards 
which are identified during site characterization and analysis.
    (ii) Totally-encapsulating suits shall be capable of maintaining 
positive air pressure. (See appendix A for a test method which may be 
used to evaluate this requirement.)
    (iii) Totally-encapsulating suits shall be capable of preventing 
inward test gas leakage of more than 0.5 percent. (See appendix A for a 
test method which may be used to evaluate this requirement.)
    (5) Personal protective equipment (PPE) program. A written personal 
protective equipment program, which is part of the employer's safety and 
health program required in paragraph (b) of this section or required in 
paragraph (p)(1) of this section and which is also a part of the site-
specific safety and health plan shall be established. The PPE program 
shall address the elements listed below. When elements, such as donning 
and doffing procedures, are provided by the manufacturer of a piece of 
equipment and are attached to the plan, they need not be rewritten into 
the plan as long as they adequately address the procedure or element.
    (i) PPE selection based upon site hazards,
    (ii) PPE use and limitations of the equipment,
    (iii) Work mission duration,
    (iv) PPE maintenance and storage,
    (v) PPE decontamination and disposal,
    (vi) PPE training and proper fitting,
    (vii) PPE donning and doffing procedures,
    (viii) PPE inspection procedures prior to, during, and after use,
    (ix) Evaluation of the effectiveness of the PPE program, and
    (x) Limitations during temperature extremes, heat stress, and other 
appropriate medical considerations.
    (h) Monitoring--(1) General. (i) Monitoring shall be performed in 
accordance with this paragraph where there may be a question of employee 
exposure to hazardous concentrations of hazardous substances in order to 
assure proper selection of engineering controls, work practices and 
personal protective equipment so that employees are not exposed to 
levels which exceed permissible exposure limits, or published exposure 
levels if there are no permissible exposure limits, for hazardous 
substances.
    (ii) Air monitoring shall be used to identify and quantify airborne 
levels of hazardous substances and safety and health hazards in order to 
determine the appropriate level of employee protection needed on site.
    (2) Initial entry. Upon initial entry, representative air monitoring 
shall be conducted to identify any IDLH condition, exposure over 
permissible exposure limits or published exposure levels, exposure over 
a radioactive material's dose limits or other dangerous condition such 
as the presence of flammable atmospheres or oxygen-deficient 
environments.
    (3) Periodic monitoring. Periodic monitoring shall be conducted when 
the possibility of an IDLH condition or flammable atmosphere has 
developed or when there is indication that exposures may have risen over 
permissible exposure limits or published exposure levels since prior 
monitoring. Situations where it shall be considered whether the 
possibility that exposures have risen are as follows:
    (i) When work begins on a different portion of the site.
    (ii) When contaminants other than those previously identified are 
being handled.
    (iii) When a different type of operation is initiated (e.g., drum 
opening as opposed to exploratory well drilling).
    (iv) When employees are handling leaking drums or containers or 
working in areas with obvious liquid contamination (e.g., a spill or 
lagoon).
    (4) Monitoring of high-risk employees. After the actual clean-up 
phase of any hazardous waste operation commences; for example, when 
soil, surface water or containers are moved or disturbed; the employer 
shall monitor those employees likely to have the highest exposures to 
hazardous substances and health hazards likely to be present above 
permissible exposure limits or

[[Page 150]]

published exposure levels by using personal sampling frequently enough 
to characterize employee exposures. If the employees likely to have the 
highest exposure are over permissible exposure limits or published 
exposure limits, then monitoring shall continue to determine all 
employees likely to be above those limits. The employer may utilize a 
representative sampling approach by documenting that the employees and 
chemicals chosen for monitoring are based on the criteria stated above.

    Note to (h): It is not required to monitor employees engaged in site 
characterization operations covered by paragraph (c) of this section.

    (i) Informational programs. Employers shall develop and implement a 
program, which is part of the employer's safety and health program 
required in paragraph (b) of this section, to inform employees, 
contractors, and subcontractors (or their representative) actually 
engaged in hazardous waste operations of the nature, level and degree of 
exposure likely as a result of participation in such hazardous waste 
operations. Employees, contractors and subcontractors working outside of 
the operations part of a site are not covered by this standard.
    (j) Handling drums and containers--(1) General. (i) Hazardous 
substances and contaminated soils, liquids, and other residues shall be 
handled, transported, labeled, and disposed of in accordance with this 
paragraph.
    (ii) Drums and containers used during the clean-up shall meet the 
appropriate DOT, OSHA, and EPA regulations for the wastes that they 
contain.
    (iii) When practical, drums and containers shall be inspected and 
their integrity shall be assured prior to being moved. Drums or 
containers that cannot be inspected before being moved because of 
storage conditions (i.e., buried beneath the earth, stacked behind other 
drums, stacked several tiers high in a pile, etc.) shall be moved to an 
accessible location and inspected prior to further handling.
    (iv) Unlabelled drums and containers shall be considered to contain 
hazardous substances and handled accordingly until the contents are 
positively identified and labeled.
    (v) Site operations shall be organized to minimize the amount of 
drum or container movement.
    (vi) Prior to movement of drums or containers, all employees exposed 
to the transfer operation shall be warned of the potential hazards 
associated with the contents of the drums or containers.
    (vii) U.S. Department of Transportation specified salvage drums or 
containers and suitable quantities of proper absorbent shall be kept 
available and used in areas where spills, leaks, or ruptures may occur.
    (viii) Where major spills may occur, a spill containment program, 
which is part of the employer's safety and health program required in 
paragraph (b) of this section, shall be implemented to contain and 
isolate the entire volume of the hazardous substance being transferred.
    (ix) Drums and containers that cannot be moved without rupture, 
leakage, or spillage shall be emptied into a sound container using a 
device classified for the material being transferred.
    (x) A ground-penetrating system or other type of detection system or 
device shall be used to estimate the location and depth of buried drums 
or containers.
    (xi) Soil or covering material shall be removed with caution to 
prevent drum or container rupture.
    (xii) Fire extinguishing equipment meeting the requirements of 
subpart F of this part shall be on hand and ready for use to control 
incipient fires.
    (2) Openinq drums and containers. The following procedures shall be 
followed in areas where drums or containers are being opened:
    (i) Where an airline respirator system is used, connections to the 
source of air supply shall be protected from contamination and the 
entire system shall be protected from physical damage.
    (ii) Employees not actually involved in opening drums or containers 
shall be kept a safe distance from the drums or containers being opened.
    (iii) If employees must work near or adjacent to drums or containers 
being opened, a suitable shield that does not interfere with the work 
operation shall be placed between the employee and the drums or 
containers being opened

[[Page 151]]

to protect the employee in case of accidental explosion.
    (iv) Controls for drum or container opening equipment, monitoring 
equipment, and fire suppression equipment shall be located behind the 
explosion-resistant barrier.
    (v) When there is a reasonable possibility of flammable atmospheres 
being present, material handling equipment and hand tools shall be of 
the type to prevent sources of ignition.
    (vi) Drums and containers shall be opened in such a manner that 
excess interior pressure will be safely relieved. If pressure can not be 
relieved from a remote location, appropriate shielding shall be placed 
between the employee and the drums or containers to reduce the risk of 
employee injury.
    (vii) Employees shall not stand upon or work from drums or 
containers.
    (3) Material handling equipment. Material handiing equipment used to 
transfer drums and containers shall be selected, positioned and operated 
to minimize sources of ignition related to the equipment from igniting 
vapors released from ruptured drums or containers.
    (4) Radioactive wastes. Drums and containers containing radioactive 
wastes shall not be handled until such time as their hazard to employees 
is properly assessed.
    (5) Shock sensitive wastes. As a minimum, the following special 
precautions shall be taken when drums and containers containing or 
suspected of containing shock-sensitive wastes are handled:
    (i) All non-essential employees shall be evacuated from the area of 
transfer.
    (ii) Material handling equipment shall be provided with explosive 
containment devices or protective shields to protect equipment operators 
from exploding containers.
    (iii) An employee alarm system capable of being perceived above 
surrounding light and noise conditions shall be used to signal the 
commencement and completion of explosive waste handling activities.

response plan or the state emergency response plan or both, as part of 
their emergency response plan to avoid duplication. Those items of the 
emergency response plan that are being properly addressed by the SARA 
Title III plans may be substituted into their emergency plan or 
otherwise kept together for the employer and employee's use.
    (3) Procedures for handlinq emergency response. (i) The senior 
emergency response official responding to an emergency shall become the 
individual in charge of a site-specific Incident Command System (ICS). 
All emergency responders and their communications shall be coordinated 
and controlled through the individual in charge of the

[[Page 158]]

ICS assisted by the senior official present for each employer.

    Note to (q)(3)(i).--The senior official at an emergency response is 
the most senior official on the site who has the responsibility for 
controlling the operations at the site. Initially it is the senior 
officer on the first-due piece of responding emergency apparatus to 
arrive on the incident scene. As more senior officers arrive (i.e., 
battalion chief, fire chief, state law enforcement official, site 
coordinator, etc.) the position is passed up the line of authority which 
has been previously established.

    (ii) The individual in charge of the ICS shall identify, to the 
extent possible, all hazardous substances or conditions present and 
shall address as appropriate site analysis, use of engineering controls, 
maximum exposure limits, hazardous substance handling procedures, and 
use of any new technologies.
    (iii) Based on the hazardous substances and/or conditions present, 
the individual in charge of the ICS shall implement appropriate 
emergency operations, and assure that the personal protective equipment 
worn is appropriate for the hazards to be encountered. However, personal 
protective equipment shall meet, at a minimum, the criteria contained in 
29 CFR 1926.97 when worn while performing fire fighting operations 
beyond the incipient stage for any incident.
    (iv) Employees engaged in emergency response and exposed to 
hazardous substances presenting an inhalation hazard or potential 
inhalation hazard shall wear positive pressure self-contained breathing 
apparatus while engaged in emergency response, until such time that the 
individual in charge of the ICS determines through the use of air 
monitoring that a decreased level of respiratory protection will not 
result in hazardous exposures to employees.
    (v) The individual in charge of the ICS shall limit the number of 
emergency response personnel at the emergency site, in those areas of 
potential or actual exposure to incident or site hazards, to those who 
are actively performing emergency operations. However, operations in 
hazardous areas shall be performed using the buddy system in groups of 
two or more.
    (vi) Back-up personnel shall stand by with equipment ready to 
provide assistance or rescue. Advance first aid support personnel, as a 
minimum, shall also stand by with medical equipment and transportation 
capability.
    (vii) The individual in charge of the ICS shall designate a safety 
official, who is knowledgable in the operations being implemented at the 
emergency response site, with specific responsibility to identify and 
evaluate hazards and to provide direction with respect to the safety of 
operations for the emergency at hand.
    (viii) When activities are judged by the safety official to be an 
IDLH condition and/or to involve an imminent danger condition, the 
safety official shall have the authority to alter, suspend, or terminate 
those activities. The safety official shall immediately inform the 
individual in charge of the ICS of any actions needed to be taken to 
correct these hazards at the emergency scene.
    (ix) After emergency operations have terminated, the individual in 
charge of the ICS shall implement appropriate decontamination 
procedures.
    (x) When deemed necessary for meeting the tasks at hand, approved 
self-contained compressed air breathing apparatus may be used with 
approved cylinders from other approved self-contained compressed air 
breathing apparatus provided that such cylinders are of the same 
capacity and pressure rating. All compressed air cylinders used with 
self-contained breathing apparatus shall meet U.S. Department of 
Transportation and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 
criteria.
    (4) Skilled support personnel. Personnel, not necessarily an 
employer's own employees, who are skilled in the operation of certain 
equipment, such as mechanized earth moving or digging equipment or crane 
and hoisting equipment, and who are needed temporarily to perform 
immediate emergency support work that cannot reasonably be performed in 
a timely fashion by an employer's own employees, and who will be or may 
be exposed to the hazards at an emergency response scene, are not 
required to meet the training required in this paragraph for the 
employer's regular employees. However,

[[Page 159]]

these personnel shall be given an initial briefing at the site prior to 
their participation in any emergency response. The initial briefing 
shall include instruction in the wearing of appropriate personal 
protective equipment, what chemical hazards are involved, and what 
duties are to be performed. All other appropriate safety and health 
precautions provided to the employer's own employees shall be used to 
assure the safety and health of these personnel.
    (5) Specialist employees. Employees who, in the course of their 
regular job duties, work with and are trained in the hazards of specific 
hazardous substances, and who will be called upon to provide technical 
advice or assistance at a hazardous substance release incident to the 
individual in charge, shall receive training or demonstrate competency 
in the area of their specialization annually.
    (6) Training. Training shall be based on the duties and function to 
be performed by each responder of an emergency response organization. 
The skill and knowledge levels required for all new responders, those 
hired after the effective date of this standard, shall be conveyed to 
them through training before they are permitted to take part in actual 
emergency operations on an incident. Employees who participate, or are 
expected to participate, in emergency response, shall be given training 
in accordance with the following paragraphs:
    (i) First responder awareness level. First responders at the 
awareness level are individuals who are likely to witness or discover a 
hazardous substance release and who have been trained to initiate an 
emergency response sequence by notifying the proper authorities of the 
release. They would take no further action beyond notifying the 
authorities of the release. First responders at the awareness level 
shall have sufficient training or have had sufficient experience to 
objectively demonstrate competency in the following areas:
    (A) An understanding of what hazardous substances are, and the risks 
associated with them in an incident.
    (B) An understanding of the potential outcomes associated with an 
emergency created when hazardous substances are present.
    (C) The ability to recognize the presence of hazardous substances in 
an emergency.
    (D) The ability to identify the hazardous substances, if possible.
    (E) An understanding of the role of the first responder awareness 
individual in the employer's emergency response plan including site 
security and control and the U.S. Department of Transportation's 
Emergency Response Guidebook.
    (F) The ability to realize the need for additional resources, and to 
make appropriate notifications to the communication center.
    (ii) First responder operations level. First responders at the 
operations level are individuals who respond to releases or potential 
releases of hazardous substances as part of the initial response to the 
site for the purpose of protecting nearby persons, property, or the 
environment from the effects of the release. They are trained to respond 
in a defensive fashion without actually trying to stop the release. 
Their function is to contain the release from a safe distance, keep it 
from spreading, and prevent exposures. First responders at the 
operational level shall have received at least eight hours of training 
or have had sufficient experience to objectively demonstrate competency 
in the following areas in addition to those listed for the awareness 
level and the employer shall so certify:
    (A) Knowledge of the basic hazard and risk assessment techniques.
    (B) Know how to select and use proper personal protective equipment 
provided to the first responder operational level.
    (C) An understanding of basic hazardous materials terms.
    (D) Know how to perform basic control, containment and/or 
confinement operations within the capabilities of the resources and 
personal protective equipment available with their unit.
    (E) Know how to implement basic decontamination procedures.
    (F) An understanding of the relevant standard operating procedures 
and termination procedures.
    (iii) Hazardous materials technician. Hazardous materials 
technicians are

[[Page 160]]

individuals who respond to releases or potential releases for the 
purpose of stopping the release. They assume a more aggressive role than 
a first responder at the operations level in that they will approach the 
point of release in order to plug, patch or otherwise stop the release 
of a hazardous substance. Hazardous materials technicians shall have 
received at least 24 hours of training equal to the first responder 
operations level and in addition have competency in the following areas 
and the employer shall so certify:
    (A) Know how to implement the employer's emergency response plan.
    (B) Know the classification, identification and verification of 
known and unknown materials by using field survey instruments and 
equipment.
    (C) Be able to function within an assigned role in the Incident 
Command System.
    (D) Know how to select and use proper specialized chemical personal 
protective equipment provided to the hazardous materials technician.
    (E) Understand hazard and risk assessment techniques.
    (F) Be able to perform advance control, containment, and/or 
confinement operations within the capabilities of the resources and 
personal protective equipment available with the unit.
    (G) Understand and implement decontamination procedures.
    (H) Understand termination procedures.
    (I) Understand basic chemical and toxicological terminology and 
behavior.
    (iv) Hazardous materials specialist. Hazardous materials specialists 
are individuals who respond with and provide support to hazardous 
materials technicians. Their duties parallel those of the hazardous 
materials technician, however, those duties require a more directed or 
specific knowledge of the various substances they may be called upon to 
contain. The hazardous materials specialist would also act as the site 
liaison with Federal, state, local and other government authorities in 
regards to site activities. Hazardous materials specialists shall have 
received at least 24 hours of training equal to the technician level and 
in addition have competency in the following areas and the employer 
shall so certify:
    (A) Know how to implement the local emergency response plan.
    (B) Understand classification, identification and verification of 
known and unknown materials by using advanced survey instruments and 
equipment.
    (C) Know of the state emergency response plan.
    (D) Be able to select and use proper specialized chemical personal 
protective equipment provided to the hazardous materials specialist.
    (E) Understand in-depth hazard and risk techniques.
    (F) Be able to perform specialized control, containment, and/or 
confinement operations within the capabilities of the resources and 
personal protective equipment available.
    (G) Be able to determine and implement decontamination procedures.
    (H) Have the ability to develop a site safety and control plan.
    (I) Understand chemical, radiological and toxicological terminology 
and behavior.
    (v) On scene incident commander. Incident commanders, who will 
assume control of the incident scene beyond the first responder 
awareness level, shall receive at least 24 hours of training equal to 
the first responder operations level and in addition have competency in 
the following areas and the employer shall so certify:
    (A) Know and be able to implement the employer's incident command 
system.
    (B) Know how to implement the employer's emergency response plan.
    (C) Know and understand the hazards and risks associated with 
employees working in chemical protective clothing.
    (D) Know how to implement the local emergency response plan.
    (E) Know of the state emergency response plan and of the Federal 
Regional Response Team.
    (F) Know and understand the importance of decontamination 
procedures.
    (7) Trainers. Trainers who teach any of the above training subjects 
shall have satisfactorily completed a training course for teaching the 
subjects they are expected to teach, such as the courses offered by the 
U.S. National

[[Page 161]]

Fire Academy, or they shall have the training and/or academic 
credentials and instructional experience necessary to demonstrate 
competent instructional skills and a good command of the subject matter 
of the courses they are to teach.
    (8) Refresher training. (i) Those employees who are trained in 
accordance with paragraph (q)(6) of this section shall receive annual 
refresher training of sufficient content and duration to maintain their 
competencies, or shall demonstrate competency in those areas at least 
yearly.
    (ii) A statement shall be made of the training or competency, and if 
a statement of competency is made, the employer shall keep a record of 
the methodology used to demonstrate competency.
    (9) Medical surveillance and consultation. (i) Members of an 
organized and designated HAZMAT team and hazardous materials specialists 
shall receive a baseline physical examination and be provided with 
medical surveillance as required in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (ii) Any emergency response employees who exhibits signs or symptoms 
which may have resulted from exposure to hazardous substances during the 
course of an emergency incident, either immediately or subsequently, 
shall be provided with medical consultation as required in paragraph 
(f)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (10) Chemical protective clothing. Chemical protective clothing and 
equipment to be used by organized and designated HAZMAT team members, or 
to be used by hazardous materials specialists, shall meet the 
requirements of paragraphs (g) (3) through (5) of this section.
    (11) Post-emergency response operations. Upon completion of the 
emergency response, if it is determined that it is necessary to remove 
hazardous substances, health hazards, and materials contaminated with 
them (such as contaminated soil or other elements of the natural 
environment) from the site of the incident, the employer conducting the 
clean-up shall comply with one of the following:
    (i) Meet all of the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (o) of 
this section; or
    (ii) Where the clean-up is done on plant property using plant or 
workplace employees, such employees shall have completed the training 
requirements of the following: 29 CFR 1926.35, 1926.59, and 1926.103, 
and other appropriate safety and health training made necessary by the 
tasks that they are expected to be performed such as personal protective 
equipment and decontamination procedures. All equipment to be used in 
the performance of the clean-up work shall be in serviceable condition 
and shall have been inspected prior to use.

  Appendices to Sec. 1926.65--Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency 
                                Response

    Note: The following appendices serve as non-mandatory guidelines to 
assist employees and employers in complying with the appropriate 
requirements of this section. However Sec. 1926.65(g) makes mandatory in 
certain circumstances the use of Level A and Level B PPE protection.

 Appendix A to Sec. 1926.65--Personal Protective Equipment Test Methods

    This appendix sets forth the non-mandatory examples of tests which 
may be used to evaluate compliance with Sec. 1926.65(g)(4) (ii) and 
(iii). Other tests and other challenge agents may be used to evaluate 
compliance.

     A. Totally-encapsulating chemical protective suit pressure test

    1.0--Scope
    1.1  This practice measures the ability of a gas tight totally-
encapsulating chemical protective suit material, seams, and closures to 
maintain a fixed positive pressure. The results of this practice allow 
the gas tight integrity of a totally-encapsulating chemical protective 
suit to be evaluated.
    1.2  Resistance of the suit materials to permeation, penetration, 
and degradation by specific hazardous substances is not determined by 
this test method.
    2.0--Definition of terms
    2.1 Totally-encapsulated chemical protective suit (TECP suit) means 
a full body garment which is constructed of protective clothing 
materials; covers the wearer's torso, head, arms, legs and respirator; 
may cover the wearer's hands and feet with tightly attached gloves and 
boots; completely encloses the wearer and respirator by itself or in 
combination with the wearer's gloves and boots.

[[Page 162]]

    2.2 Protective clothing material means any material or combination 
of materials used in an item of clothing for the purpose of isolating 
parts of the body from direct contact with a potentially hazardous 
liquid or gaseous chemicals.
    2.3 Gas tight means, for the purpose of this test method, the 
limited flow of a gas under pressure from the inside of a TECP suit to 
atmosphere at a prescribed pressure and time interval.
    3.0--Summary of test method
    3.1 The TECP suit is visually inspected and modified for the test. 
The test apparatus is attached to the suit to permit inflation to the 
pre-test suit expansion pressure for removal of suit wrinkles and 
creases. The pressure is lowered to the test pressure and monitored for 
three minutes. If the pressure drop is excessive, the TECP suit fails 
the test and is removed from service. The test is repeated after leak 
location and repair.
    4.0--Required Supplies
    4.1 Source of compressed air.
    4.2 Test apparatus for suit testing, including a pressure 
measurement device with a sensitivity of at least \1/4\ inch water 
gauge.
    4.3 Vent valve closure plugs or sealing tape.
    4.4 Soapy water solution and soft brush.
    4.5 Stop watch or appropriate timing device.
    5.0--Safety Precautions
    5.1 Care shall be taken to provide the correct pressure safety 
devices required for the source of compressed air used.
    6.0--Test Procedure
    6.1 Prior to each test, the tester shall perform a visual inspection 
of the suit. Check the suit for seam integrity by visually examining the 
seams and gently pulling on the seams. Ensure that all air supply lines, 
fittings, visor, zippers, and valves are secure and show no signs of 
deterioration.
    6.1.1 Seal off the vent valves along with any other normal inlet or 
exhaust points (such as umbilical air line fittings or face piece 
opening) with tape or other appropriate means (caps, plugs, fixture, 
etc.). Care should be exercised in the sealing process not to damage any 
of the suit components.
    6.1.2 Close all closure assemblies.
    6.1.3 Prepare the suit for inflation by providing an improvised 
connection point on the suit for connecting an airline. Attach the 
pressure test apparatus to the suit to permit suit inflation from a 
compressed air source equipped with a pressure indicating regulator. The 
leak tightness of the pressure test apparatus should be tested before 
and after each test by closing off the end of the tubing attached to the 
suit and assuring a pressure of three inches water gauge for three 
minutes can be maintained. If a component is removed for the test, that 
component shall be replaced and a second test conducted with another 
component removed to permit a complete test of the ensemble.
    6.1.4 The pre-test expansion pressure (A) and the suit test pressure 
(B) shall be supplied by the suit manufacturer, but in no case shall 
they be less than: (A)=three inches water gauge; and (B)=two inches 
water gauge. The ending suit pressure (C) shall be no less than 80 
percent of the test pressure (B); i.e., the pressure drop shall not 
exceed 20 percent of the test pressure (B).
    6.1.5 Inflate the suit until the pressure inside is equal to 
pressure (A), the pre-test expansion suit pressure. Allow at least one 
minute to fill out the wrinkles in the suit. Release sufficient air to 
reduce the suit pressure to pressure (B), the suit test pressure. Begin 
timing. At the end of three minutes, record the suit pressure as 
pressure (C), the ending suit pressure. The difference between the suit 
test pressure and the ending suit test pressure (B-C) shall be defined 
as the suit pressure drop.
    6.1.6 If the suit pressure drop is more than 20 percent of the suit 
test pressure (B) during the three-minute test period, the suit fails 
the test and shall be removed from service.
    7.0--Retest Procedure
    7.1 If the suit fails the test check for leaks by inflating the suit 
to pressure (A) and brushing or wiping the entire suit (including seams, 
closures, lens gaskets, glove-to-sleeve joints, etc.) with a mild soap 
and water solution. Observe the suit for the formation of soap bubbles, 
which is an indication of a leak. Repair all identified leaks.
    7.2 Retest the TECP suit as outlined in Test procedure 6.0.
    8.0--Report
    8.1 Each TECP suit tested by this practice shall have the following 
information recorded:
    8.1.1 Unique identification number, identifying brand name, date of 
purchase, material of construction, and unique fit features, e.g., 
special breathing apparatus.
    8.1.2 The actual values for test pressures (A), (B), and (C) shall 
be recorded along with the specific observation times. If the ending 
pressure (C) is less than 80 percent of the test pressure (B), the suit 
shall be identified as failing the test. When possible, the specific 
leak location shall be identified in the test records. Retest pressure 
data shall be recorded as an additional test.
    8.1.3 The source of the test apparatus used shall be identified and 
the sensitivity of the pressure gauge shall be recorded.
    8.1.4 Records shall be kept for each pressure test even if repairs 
are being made at the test location.

                                 CAUTION

    Visually inspect all parts of the suit to be sure they are 
positioned correctly and secured tightly before putting the suit back 
into service. Special care should be taken to

[[Page 163]]

examine each exhaust valve to make sure it is not blocked.
    Care should also be exercised to assure that the inside and outside 
of the suit is completely dry before it is put into storage.

 B. Totally-encapsulating chemical protective suit qualitative leak test

    1.0--Scope
    1.1 This practice semi-qualitatively tests gas tight totally-
encapsulating chemical protective suit integrity by detecting inward 
leakage of ammonia vapor. Since no modifications are made to the suit to 
carry out this test, the results from this practice provide a realistic 
test for the integrity of the entire suit.
    1.2 Resistance of the suit materials to permeation, penetration, and 
degradation is not determined by this test method. ASTM test methods are 
available to test suit materials for these characteristics and the tests 
are usually conducted by the manufacturers of the suits.
    2.0--Definition of terms
    2.1 Totally-encapsulated chemical protective suit (TECP suit) means 
a full body garment which is constructed of protective clothing 
materials; covers the wearer's torso, head, arms, legs and respirator; 
may cover the wearer's hands and feet with tightly attached gloves and 
boots; completely encloses the wearer and respirator by itself or in 
combination with the wearer's gloves, and boots.
    2.2 Protective clothing material means any material or combination 
of materials used in an item of clothing for the purpose of isolating 
parts of the body from direct contact with a potentially hazardous 
liquid or gaseous chemicals.
    2.3 Gas tight means, for the purpose of this test method, the 
limited flow of a gas under pressure from the inside of a TECP suit to 
atmosphere at a prescribed pressure and time interval.
    2.4 Intrusion Coefficient means a number expressing the level of 
protection provided by a gas tight totally-encapsulating chemical 
protective suit. The intrusion coefficient is calculated by dividing the 
test room challenge agent concentration by the concentration of 
challenge agent found inside the suit. The accuracy of the intrusion 
coefficient is dependent on the challenge agent monitoring methods. The 
larger the intrusion coefficient the greater the protection provided by 
the TECP suit.
    3.0--Summary of recommended practice
    3.1 The volume of concentrated aqueous ammonia solution (ammonia 
hydroxide NH<INF>4</INF> OH) required to generate the test atmosphere is 
determined using the directions outlined in 6.1. The suit is donned by a 
person wearing the appropriate respiratory equipment (either a positive 
pressure self-contained breathing apparatus or a positive pressure 
supplied air respirator) and worn inside the enclosed test room. The 
concentrated aqueous ammonia solution is taken by the suited individual 
into the test room and poured into an open plastic pan. A two-minute 
evaporation period is observed before the test room concentration is 
measured, using a high range ammonia length of stain detector tube. When 
the ammonia vapor reaches a concentration of between 1000 and 1200 ppm, 
the suited individual starts a standardized exercise protocol to stress 
and flex the suit. After this protocol is completed, the test room 
concentration is measured again. The suited individual exits the test 
room and his stand-by person measures the ammonia concentration inside 
the suit using a low range ammonia length of stain detector tube or 
other more sensitive ammonia detector. A stand-by person is required to 
observe the test individual during the test procedure; aid the person in 
donning and doffing the TECP suit; and monitor the suit interior. The 
intrusion coefficient of the suit can be calculated by dividing the 
average test area concentration by the interior suit concentration. A 
colorimetric ammonia indicator strip of bromophenol blue or equivalent 
is placed on the inside of the suit face piece lens so that the suited 
individual is able to detect a color change and know if the suit has a 
significant leak. If a color change is observed the individual shall 
leave the test room immediately.
    4.0--Required supplies
    4.1 A supply of concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide (58% by 
weight).
    4.2 A supply of bromophenol/blue indicating paper or equivalent, 
sensitive to 5-10 ppm ammonia or greater over a two-minute period of 
exposure. [pH 3.0 (yellow) to pH 4.6 (blue)]
    4.3 A supply of high range (0.5-10 volume percent) and low range (5-
700 ppm) detector tubes for ammonia and the corresponding sampling pump. 
More sensitive ammonia detectors can be substituted for the low range 
detector tubes to improve the sensitivity of this practice.
    4.4 A shallow plastic pan (PVC) at least 
12<SUP><gr-thn-eq></SUP>:14<SUP><gr-thn-eq></SUP>:1<SUP><gr-thn-eq></SUP>
and a half pint plastic container (PVC) with tightly closing lid.
    4.5 A graduated cylinder or other volumetric measuring device of at 
least 50 milliliters in volume with an accuracy of at least 
<plus-minus>1 milliliters.

                         5.0--Safety precautions

    5.1  Concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide, NH<INF>4</INF> OH, is 
a corrosive volatile liquid requiring eye, skin, and respiratory 
protection. The person conducting the test shall review the MSDS for 
aqueous ammonia.
    5.2  Since the established permissible exposure limit for ammonia is 
35 ppm as a 15

[[Page 164]]

minute STEL, only persons wearing a positive pressure self-contained 
breathing apparatus or a positive pressure supplied air respirator shall 
be in the chamber. Normally only the person wearing the totally-
encapsulating suit will be inside the chamber. A stand-by person shall 
have a positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus, or a 
positive pressure supplied air respirator available to enter the test 
area should the suited individual need assistance.
    5.3  A method to monitor the suited individual must be used during 
this test. Visual contact is the simplest but other methods using 
communication devices are acceptable.
    5.4  The test room shall be large enough to allow the exercise 
protocol to be carried out and then to be ventilated to allow for easy 
exhaust of the ammonia test atmosphere after the test(s) are completed.
    5.5  Individuals shall be medically screened for the use of 
respiratory protection and checked for allergies to ammonia before 
participating in this test procedure.

                           6.0--Test procedure

    6.1.1  Measure the test area to the nearest foot and calculate its 
volume in cubic feet. Multiply the test area volume by 0.2 milliliters 
of concentrated aqueous ammonia solution per cubic foot of test area 
volume to determine the approximate volume of concentrated aqueous 
ammonia required to generate 1000 ppm in the test area.
    6.1.2  Measure this volume from the supply of concentrated aqueous 
ammonia and place it into a closed plastic container.
    6.1.3  Place the container, several high range ammonia detector 
tubes, and the pump in the clean test pan and locate it near the test 
area entry door so that the suited individual has easy access to these 
supplies.
    6.2.1  In a non-contaminated atmosphere, open a pre-sealed ammonia 
indicator strip and fasten one end of the strip to the inside of the 
suit face shield lens where it can be seen by the wearer. Moisten the 
indicator strip with distilled water. Care shall be taken not to 
contaminate the detector part of the indicator paper by touching it. A 
small piece of masking tape or equivalent should be used to attach the 
indicator strip to the interior of the suit face shield.
    6.2.2  If problems are encountered with this method of attachment, 
the indicator strip can be attached to the outside of the respirator 
face piece lens being used during the test.
    6.3  Don the respiratory protective device normally used with the 
suit, and then don the TECP suit to be tested. Check to be sure all 
openings which are intended to be sealed (zippers, gloves, etc.) are 
completely sealed. DO NOT, however, plug off any venting valves.
    6.4  Step into the enclosed test room such as a closet, bathroom, or 
test booth, equipped with an exhaust fan. No air should be exhausted 
from the chamber during the test because this will dilute the ammonia 
challenge concentrations.
    6.5  Open the container with the pre-measured volume of concentrated 
aqueous ammonia within the enclosed test room, and pour the liquid into 
the empty plastic test pan. Wait two minutes to allow for adequate 
volatilization of the concentrated aqueous ammonia. A small mixing fan 
can be used near the evaporation pan to increase the evaporation rate of 
the ammonia solution.
    6.6  After two minutes a determination of the ammonia concentration 
within the chamber should be made using the high range colorimetric 
detector tube. A concentration of 1000 ppm ammonia or greater shall be 
generated before the exercises are started.
    6.7  To test the integrity of the suit the following four minute 
exercise protocol should be followed:
    6.7.1  Raising the arms above the head with at least 15 raising 
motions completed in one minute.
    6.7.2  Walking in place for one minute with at least 15 raising 
motions of each leg in a one-minute period.
    6.7.3  Touching the toes with a least 10 complete motions of the 
arms from above the head to touching of the toes in a one-minute period.
    6.7.4  Knee bends with at least 10 complete standing and squatting 
motions in a one-minute period.
    6.8  If at any time during the test the colorimetric indicating 
paper should change colors, the test should be stopped and section 6.10 
and 6.12 initiated (See para.4.2).
    6.9  After completion of the test exercise, the test area 
concentration should be measured again using the high range colorimetric 
detector tube.
    6.10  Exit the test area.
    6.11  The opening created by the suit zipper or other appropriate 
suit penetration should be used to determine the ammonia concentration 
in the suit with the low range length of stain detector tube or other 
ammonia monitor. The internal TECP suit air should be sampled far enough 
from the enclosed test area to prevent a false ammonia reading.
    6.12  After completion of the measurement of the suit interior 
ammonia concentration the test is concluded and the suit is doffed and 
the respirator removed.
    6.13  The ventilating fan for the test room should be turned on and 
allowed to run for enough time to remove the ammonia gas. The fan shall 
be vented to the outside of the building.
    6.14  Any detectable ammonia in the suit interior (five ppm ammonia 
(NH<INF>3</INF>) or more for the length of stain detector tube) 
indicates that the suit has failed the test. When

[[Page 165]]

other ammonia detectors are used a lower level of detection is possible, 
and it should be specified as the pass/fail criteria.
    6.15  By following this test method, an intrusion coefficient of 
approximately 200 or more can be measured with the suit in a completely 
operational condition. If the intrusion coefficient is 200 or more, then 
the suit is suitable for emergency response and field use.

                         7.0--Retest procedures

    7.1  If the suit fails this test, check for leaks by following the 
pressure test in test A above.
    7.2  Retest the TECP suit as outlined in the test procedure 6.0.

                               8.0--Report

    8.1  Each gas tight totally-encapsulating chemical protective suit 
tested by this practice shall have the following information recorded.
    8.1.1  Unique identification number, identifying brand name, date of 
purchase, material of construction, and unique suit features; e.g., 
special breathing apparatus.
    8.1.2  General description of test room used for test.
    8.1.3  Brand name and purchase date of ammonia detector strips and 
color change data.
    8.1.4  Brand name, sampling range, and expiration date of the length 
of stain ammonia detector tubes. The brand name and model of the 
sampling pump should also be recorded. If another type of ammonia 
detector is used, it should be identified along with its minimum 
detection limit for ammonia.
    8.1.5  Actual test results shall list the two test area 
concentrations, their average, the interior suit concentration, and the 
calculated intrusion coefficient. Retest data shall be recorded as an 
additional test.
    8.2  The evaluation of the data shall be specified as ``suit 
passed'' or ``suit failed,'' and the date of the test. Any detectable 
ammonia (five ppm or greater for the length of stain detector tube) in 
the suit interior indicates the suit has failed this test. When other 
ammonia detectors are used, a lower level of detection is possible and 
it should be specified as the pass fail criteria.

                                 CAUTION

    Visually inspect all parts of the suit to be sure they are 
positioned correctly and secured tightly before putting the suit back 
into service. Special care should be taken to examine each exhaust valve 
to make sure it is not blocked.
    Care should also be exercised to assure that the inside and outside 
of the suit is completely dry before it is put into storage.

 Appendix B to Sec. 1926.65--General Description and Discussion of the 
                Levels of Protection and Protective Gear

    This appendix sets forth information about personal protective 
equipment (PPE) protection levels which may be used to assist employers 
in complying with the PPE requirements of this section.
    As required by the standard, PPE must be selected which will protect 
employees from the specific hazards which they are likely to encounter 
during their work on-site.
    Selection of the appropriate PPE is a complex process which should 
take into consideration a variety of factors. Key factors involved in 
this process are identification of the hazards, or suspected hazards; 
their routes of potential hazard to employees (inhalation, skin 
absorption, ingestion, and eye or skin contact); and the performance of 
the PPE materials (and seams) in providing a barrier to these hazards. 
The amount of protection provided by PPE is material-hazard specific. 
That is, protective equipment materials will protect well against some 
hazardous substances and poorly, or not at all, against others. In many 
instances, protective equipment materials cannot be found which will 
provide continuous protection from the particular hazardous substance. 
In these cases the breakthrough time of the protective material should 
exceed the work durations.
    Other factors in this selection process to be considered are 
matching the PPE to the employee's work requirements and task-specific 
conditions. The durability of PPE materials, such as tear strength and 
seam strength, should be considered in relation to the employee's tasks. 
The effects of PPE in relation to heat stress and task duration are a 
factor in selecting and using PPE. In some cases layers of PPE may be 
necessary to provide sufficient protection, or to protect expensive PPE 
inner garments, suits or equipment.
    The more that is known about the hazards at the site, the easier the 
job of PPE selection becomes. As more information about the hazards and 
conditions at the site becomes available, the site supervisor can make 
decisions to up-grade or down-grade the level of PPE protection to match 
the tasks at hand.
    The following are guidelines which an employer can use to begin the 
selection of the appropriate PPE. As noted above, the site information 
may suggest the use of combinations of PPE selected from the different 
protection levels (i.e., A, B, C, or D) as being more suitable to the 
hazards of the work. It should be cautioned that the listing below does 
not fully address the performance of the specific PPE material in 
relation to the specific hazards at the job site, and that PPE

[[Page 166]]

selection, evaluation and re-selection is an ongoing process until 
sufficient information about the hazards and PPE performance is 
obtained.
    Part A. Personal protective equipment is divided into four 
categories based on the degree of protection afforded. (See Part B of 
this appendix for further explanation of Levels A, B, C, and D hazards.)
    I. Level A-- To be selected when the greatest level of skin, 
respiratory, and eye protection is required.
    The following constitute Level A equipment; it may be used as 
appropriate;
    1. Positive pressure, full face-piece self-contained breathing 
apparatus (SCBA), or positive pressure supplied air respirator with 
escape SCBA, approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety 
and Health (NIOSH).
    2. Totally-encapsulating chemical-protective suit.
    3. Coveralls.\1\
    4. Long underwear.\1\
    5. Gloves, outer, chemical-resistant.
    6. Gloves, inner, chemical-resistant.
    7. Boots, chemical-resistant, steel toe and shank.
    8. Hard hat (under suit).\1\
    9. Disposable protective suit, gloves and boots (depending on suit 
construction, may be worn over totally-encapsulating suit).
    II. Level B--The highest level of respiratory protection is 
necessary but a lesser level of skin protection is needed.
    The following constitute Level B equipment; it may be used as 
appropriate.
    1. Positive pressure, full-facepiece self-contained breathing 
apparatus (SCBA), or positive pressure supplied air respirator with 
escape SCBA (NIOSH approved).
    2. Hooded chemical-resistant clothing (overalls and long-sleeved 
jacket; coveralls; one or two-piece chemical-splash suit; disposable 
chemical-resistant overalls).
    3. Coveralls. \1\
    4. Gloves, outer, chemical-resistant.
    5. Gloves, inner, chemical-resistant.
    6. Boots, outer, chemical-resistant steel toe and shank.
    7. Boot-covers, outer, chemical-resistant (disposable).\1\
    8. Hard hat. \1\
    9. [Reserved]
    10. Face shield. \1\
    III. Level C--The concentration(s) and type(s) of airborne 
substance(s) is known and the criteria for using air purifying 
respirators are met.
    The following constitute Level C equipment; it may be used as 
appropriate.
    1. Full-face or half-mask, air purifying respirators (NIOSH 
approved).
    2. Hooded chemical-resistant clothing (overalls; two-piece chemical-
splash suit; disposable chemical-resistant overalls).
    3. Coveralls. \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


    \1\ Optional, as applicable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    4. Gloves, outer, chemical-resistant.
    5. Gloves, inner, chemical-resistant.
    6. Boots (outer), chemical-resistant steel toe and shank. \1\
    7. Boot-covers, outer, chemical-resistant (disposable) \1\.
    8. Hard hat. \1\
    9. Escape mask. \1\
    10. Face shield. \1\
    IV. Level D--A work uniform affording minimal protection, used for 
nuisance contamination only.
    The following constitute Level D equipment; it may be used as 
appropriate:
    1. Coveralls.
    2. Gloves. \1\
    3. Boots/shoes, chemical-resistant steel toe and shank.
    4. Boots, outer, chemical-resistant (disposable). \1\
    5. Safety glasses or chemical splash goggles*.
    6. Hard hat. \1\
    7. Escape mask. \1\
    8. Face shield. \1\
    Part B. The types of hazards for which levels A, B, C, and D 
protection are appropriate are described below:
    I. Level A--Level A protection should be used when:
    1. The hazardous substance has been identified and requires the 
highest level of protection for skin, eyes, and the respiratory system 
based on either the measured (or potential for) high concentration of 
atmospheric vapors, gases, or particulates; or the site operations and 
work functions involve a high potential for splash, immersion, or 
exposure to unexpected vapors, gases, or particulates of materials that 
are harmful to skin or capable of being absorbed through the skin;
    2. Substances with a high degree of hazard to the skin are known or 
suspected to be present, and skin contact is possible; or
    3. Operations are being conducted in confined, poorly ventilated 
areas, and the absence of conditions requiring Level A have not yet been 
determined.
    II. Level B--Level B protection should be used when:
    1. The type and atmospheric concentration of substances have been 
identified and require a high level of respiratory protection, but less 
skin protection;
    2. The atmosphere contains less than 19.5 percent oxygen; or
    3. The presence of incompletely identified vapors or gases is 
indicated by a direct-reading organic vapor detection instrument, but 
vapors and gases are not suspected of containing high levels of 
chemicals harmful to skin or capable of being absorbed through the skin.


[[Page 167]]


    Note: This involves atmospheres with IDLH concentrations of specific 
substances that present severe inhalation hazards and that do not 
represent a severe skin hazard; or that do not meet the criteria for use 
of air-purifying respirators.

    III. Level C--Level C protection should be used when:
    1. The atmospheric contaminants, liquid splashes, or other direct 
contact will not adversely affect or be absorbed through any exposed 
skin;
    2. The types of air contaminants have been identified, 
concentrations measured, and an air-purifying respirator is available 
that can remove the contaminants; and
    3. All criteria for the use of air-purifying respirators are met.
    IV. Level D--Level D protection should be used when:
    1. The atmosphere contains no known hazard; and
    2. Work functions preclude splashes, immersion, or the potential for 
unexpected inhalation of or contact with hazardous levels of any 
chemicals.

    Note: As stated before, combinations of personal protective 
equipment other than those described for Levels A, B, C, and D 
protection may be more appropriate and may be used to provide the proper 
level of protection.

    As an aid in selecting suitable chemical protective clothing, it 
should be noted that the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has 
developed standards on chemical protective clothing. The standards that 
have been adopted by include:
    NFPA 1991--Standard on Vapor-Protective Suits for Hazardous Chemical 
Emergencies (EPA Level A Protective Clothing).
    NFPA 1992--Standard on Liquid Splash-Protective Suits for Hazardous 
Chemical Emergencies (EPA Level B Protective Clothing).
    NFPA 1993--Standard on Liquid Splash-Protective Suits for Non-
emergency, Non-flammable Hazardous Chemical Situations (EPA Level B 
Protective Clothing).
    These standards apply documentation and performance requirements to 
the manufacture of chemical protective suits. Chemical protective suits 
meeting these requirements are labelled as compliant with the 
appropriate standard. It is recommended that chemical protective suits 
that meet these standards be used.

            Appendix C to Sec. 1926.65--Compliance Guidelines

    1. Occupational Safety and Health Program. Each hazardous waste site 
clean-up effort will require an occupational safety and health program 
headed by the site coordinator or the employer's representative. The 
purpose of the program will be the protection of employees at the site 
and will be an extension of the employer's overall safety and health 
program. The program will need to be developed before work begins on the 
site and implemented as work proceeds as stated in paragraph (b). The 
program is to facilitate coordination and communication of safety and 
health issues among personnel responsible for the various activities 
which will take place at the site. It will provide the overall means for 
planning and implementing the needed safety and health training and job 
orientation of employees who will be working at the site. The program 
will provide the means for identifying and controlling worksite hazards 
and the means for monitoring program effectiveness. The program will 
need to cover the responsibilities and authority of the site coordinator 
or the employer's manager on the site for the safety and health of 
employees at the site, and the relationships with contractors or support 
services as to what each employer's safety and health responsibilities 
are for their employees on the site. Each contractor on the site needs 
to have its own safety and health program so structured that it will 
smoothly interface with the program of the site coordinator or principal 
contractor.
    Also those employers involved with treating, storing or disposal of 
hazardous waste as covered in paragraph (p) must have implemented a 
safety and health program for their employees. This program is to 
include the hazard communication program required in paragraph (p)(1) 
and the training required in paragraphs (p)(7) and (p)(8) as parts of 
the employers comprehensive overall safety and health program. This 
program is to be in writing.
    Each site or workplace safety and health program will need to 
include the following: (1) Policy statements of the line of authority 
and accountability for implementing the program, the objectives of the 
program and the role of the site safety and health supervisor or manager 
and staff; (2) means or methods for the development of procedures for 
identifying and controlling workplace hazards at the site; (3) means or 
methods for the development and communication to employees of the 
various plans, work rules, standard operating procedures and practices 
that pertain to individual employees and supervisors; (4) means for the 
training of supervisors and employees to develop the needed skills and 
knowledge to perform their work in a safe and healthful manner; (5) 
means to anticipate and prepare for emergency situations; and (6) means 
for obtaining information feedback to aid in evaluating the program and 
for improving the effectiveness of the program. The management and 
employees should be trying continually to improve

[[Page 168]]

the effectiveness of the program thereby enhancing the protection being 
afforded those working on the site.
    Accidents on the site or workplace should be investigated to provide 
information on how such occurrences can be avoided in the future. When 
injuries or illnesses occur on the site or workplace, they will need to 
be investigated to determine what needs to be done to prevent this 
incident from occurring again. Such information will need to be used as 
feedback on the effectiveness of the program and the information turned 
into positive steps to prevent any reoccurrence. Receipt of employee 
suggestions or complaints relating to safety and health issues involved 
with site or workplace activities is also a feedback mechanism that can 
be used effectively to improve the program and may serve in part as an 
evaluative tool(s).
    For the development and implementation of the program to be the most 
effective, professional safety and health personnel should be used. 
Certified Safety Professionals, Board Certified Industrial Hygienists or 
Registered Professional Safety Engineers are good examples of 
professional stature for safety and health managers who will administer 
the employer's program.
    2. Training. The training programs for employees subject to the 
requirements of paragraph (e) of this standard should address: the 
safety and health hazards employees should expect to find on hazardous 
waste clean-up sites; what control measures or techniques are effective 
for those hazards; what monitoring procedures are effective in 
characterizing exposure levels; what makes an effective employer's 
safety and health program; what a site safety and health plan should 
include; hands on training with personal protective equipment and 
clothing they may be expected to use; the contents of the OSHA standard 
relevant to the employee's duties and function; and, employee's 
responsibilities under OSHA and other regulations. Supervisors will need 
training in their responsibilities under the safety and health program 
and its subject areas such as the spill containment program, the 
personal protective equipment program, the medical surveillance program, 
the emergency response plan and other areas.
    The training programs for employees subject to the requirements of 
paragraph (p) of this standard should address: the employers safety and 
health program elements impacting employees; the hazard communication 
program; the medical surveillance program; the hazards and the controls 
for such hazards that employees need to know for their job duties and 
functions. All require annual refresher training.
    The training programs for employees covered by the requirements of 
paragraph (q) of this standard should address those competencies 
required for the various levels of response such as: the hazards 
associated with hazardous substances; hazard identification and 
awareness; notification of appropriate persons; the need for and use of 
personal protective equipment including respirators; the decontamination 
procedures to be used; preplanning activities for hazardous substance 
incidents including the emergency reponse plan; company standard 
operating procedures for hazardous substance emergency responses; the 
use of the incident command system and other subjects. Hands-on training 
should be stressed whenever possible. Critiques done after an incident 
which include an evaluation of what worked and what did not and how 
could the incident be better handled the next time may be counted as 
training time.
    For hazardous materials specialists (usually members of hazardous 
materials teams), the training should address the care, use and/or 
testing of chemical protective clothing including totally encapsulating 
suits, the medical surveillance program, the standard operating 
procedures for the hazardous materials team including the use of 
plugging and patching equipment and other subject areas.
    Officers and leaders who may be expected to be in charge at an 
incident should be fully knowledgeable of their company's incident 
command system. They should know where and how to obtain additional 
assistance and be familiar with the local district's emergency response 
plan and the state emergency response plan.
    Specialist employees such as technical experts, medical experts or 
environmental experts that work with hazardous materials in their 
regular jobs, who may be sent to the incident scene by the shipper, 
manufacturer or governmental agency to advise and assist the person in 
charge of the incident should have training on an annual basis. Their 
training should include the care and use of personal protective 
equipment including respirators; knowledge of the incident command 
system and how they are to relate to it; and those areas needed to keep 
them current in their respective field as it relates to safety and 
health involving specific hazardous substances.
    Those skilled support personnel, such as employees who work for 
public works departments or equipment operators who operate bulldozers, 
sand trucks, backhoes, etc., who may be called to the incident scene to 
provide emergency support assistance, should have at least a safety and 
health briefing before entering the area of potential or actual 
exposure. These skilled support personnel, who have not been a part of 
the emergency response plan and do not meet the training requirements, 
should be made aware of the hazards they face and should be provided all 
necessary protective clothing and equipment required for their tasks.

[[Page 169]]

    There are two National Fire Protection Association standards, NFPA 
472--``Standard for Professional Competence of Responders to Hazardous 
Material Incidents'' and NFPA 471--``Recommended Practice for Responding 
to Hazardous Material Incidents'', which are excellent resource 
documents to aid fire departments and other emergency response 
organizations in developing their training program materials. NFPA 472 
provides guidance on the skills and knowledge needed for first responder 
awareness level, first responder operations level, hazmat technicians, 
and hazmat specialist. It also offers guidance for the officer corp who 
will be in charge of hazardous substance incidents.
    3. Decontamination. Decontamination procedures should be tailored to 
the specific hazards of the site, and may vary in complexity and number 
of steps, depending on the level of hazard and the employee's exposure 
to the hazard. Decontamination procedures and PPE decontamination 
methods will vary depending upon the specific substance, since one 
procedure or method may not work for all substances. Evaluation of 
decontamination methods and procedures should be performed, as 
necessary, to assure that employees are not exposed to hazards by re-
using PPE. References in appendix D may be used for guidance in 
establishing an effective decontamination program. In addition, the U.S. 
Coast Guard's Manual, ``Policy Guidance for Response to Hazardous 
Chemical Releases,'' U.S. Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 
(COMDTINST M16465.30) is a good reference for establishing an effective 
decontamination program.
    4. Emergency response plans. States, along with designated districts 
within the states, will be developing or have developed local emergency 
response plans. These state and district plans should be utilized in the 
emergency response plans called for in the standard. Each employer 
should assure that its emergency response plan is compatible with the 
local plan. The major reference being used to aid in developing the 
state and local district plans is the Hazardous Materials Emergency 
Planning Guide, NRT-1. The current Emergency Response Guidebook from the 
U.S. Department of Transportation, CMA's CHEMTREC and the Fire Service 
Emergency Management Handbook may also be used as resources.
    Employers involved with treatment, storage, and disposal facilities 
for hazardous waste, which have the required contingency plan called for 
by their permit, would not need to duplicate the same planning elements. 
Those items of the emergency response plan that are properly addressed 
in the contingency plan may be substituted into the emergency response 
plan required in 1926.65 or otherwise kept together for employer and 
employee use.
    5. Personal protective equipment programs. The purpose of personal 
protective clothing and equipment (PPE) is to shield or isolate 
individuals from the chemical, physical, and biologic hazards that may 
be encountered at a hazardous substance site.
    As discussed in appendix B, no single combination of protective 
equipment and clothing is capable of protecting against all hazards. 
Thus PPE should be used in conjunction with other protective methods and 
its effectiveness evaluated periodically.
    The use of PPE can itself create significant worker hazards, such as 
heat stress, physical and psychological stress, and impaired vision, 
mobility, and communication. For any given situation, equipment and 
clothing should be selected that provide an adequate level of 
protection. However, over-protection, as well as under-protection, can 
be hazardous and should be avoided where possible.
    Two basic objectives of any PPE program should be to protect the 
wearer from safety and health hazards, and to prevent injury to the 
wearer from incorrect use and/or malfunction of the PPE. To accomplish 
these goals, a comprehensive PPE program should include hazard 
identification, medical monitoring, environmental surveillance, 
selection, use, maintenance, and decontamination of PPE and its 
associated training.
    The written PPE program should include policy statements, 
procedures, and guidelines. Copies should be made available to all 
employees, and a reference copy should be made available at the 
worksite. Technical data on equipment, maintenance manuals, relevant 
regulations, and other essential information should also be collected 
and maintained.
    6. Incident command system (ICS). Paragraph 1926.65(q)(3)(ii) 
requires the implementation of an ICS. The ICS is an organized approach 
to effectively control and manage operations at an emergency incident. 
The individual in charge of the ICS is the senior official responding to 
the incident. The ICS is not much different than the ``command post'' 
approach used for many years by the fire service. During large complex 
fires involving several companies and many pieces of apparatus, a 
command post would be established. This enabled one individual to be in 
charge of managing the incident, rather than having several officers 
from different companies making separate, and sometimes conflicting, 
decisions. The individual in charge of the command post would delegate 
responsibility for performing various tasks to subordinate officers. 
Additionally, all communications were routed through the command post to 
reduce the number of radio transmissions and eliminate confusion. 
However, strategy, tactics, and all decisions were made by one 
individual.
    The ICS is a very similar system, except it is implemented for 
emergency response to

[[Page 170]]

all incidents, both large and small, that involve hazardous substances.
    For a small incident, the individual in charge of the ICS may 
perform many tasks of the ICS. There may not be any, or little, 
delegation of tasks to subordinates. For example, in response to a small 
incident, the individual in charge of the ICS, in addition to normal 
command activities, may become the safety officer and may designate only 
one employee (with proper equipment) as a back-up to provide assistance 
if needed. OSHA does recommend, however, that at least two employees be 
designated as back-up personnel since the assistance needed may include 
rescue.
    To illustrate the operation of the ICS, the following scenario might 
develop during a small incident, such as an overturned tank truck with a 
small leak of flammable liquid.
    The first responding senior officer would implement and take command 
of the ICS. That person would size-up the incident and determine if 
additional personnel and apparatus were necessary; would determine what 
actions to take to control the leak; and, determine the proper level of 
personal protective equipment. If additional assistance is not needed, 
the individual in charge of the ICS would implement actions to stop and 
control the leak using the fewest number of personnel that can 
effectively accomplish the tasks. The individual in charge of the ICS 
then would designate himself as the safety officer and two other 
employees as a back-up in case rescue may become necessary. In this 
scenario, decontamination procedures would not be necessary.
    A large complex incident may require many employees and difficult, 
time-consuming efforts to control. In these situations, the individual 
in charge of the ICS will want to delegate different tasks to 
subordinates in order to maintain a span of control that will keep the 
number of subordinates, that are reporting, to a manageable level.
    Delegation of task at large incidents may be by location, where the 
incident scene is divided into sectors, and subordinate officers 
coordinate activities within the sector that they have been assigned.
    Delegation of tasks can also be by function. Some of the functions 
that the individual in charge of the ICS may want to delegate at a large 
incident are: medical services; evacuation; water supply; resources 
(equipment, apparatus); media relations; safety; and, site control 
(integrate activities with police for crowd and traffic control). Also 
for a large incident, the individual in charge of the ICS will designate 
several employees as back-up personnel; and a number of safety officers 
to monitor conditions and recommend safety precautions.
    Therefore, no matter what size or complexity an incident may be, by 
implementing an ICS there will be one individual in charge who makes the 
decisions and gives directions; and, all actions, and communications are 
coordinated through one central point of command. Such a system should 
reduce confusion, improve safety, organize and coordinate actions, and 
should facilitate effective management of the incident.
    7. Site Safety and Control Plans. The safety and security of 
response personnel and others in the area of an emergeny response 
incident site should be of primary concern to the incident commander. 
The use of a site safety and control plan could greatly assist those in 
charge of assuring the safety and health of employees on the site.
    A comprehensive site safety and control plan should include the 
following: summary analysis of hazards on the site and a risk analysis 
of those hazards; site map or sketch; site work zones (clean zone, 
transition or decontamination zone, work or hot zone); use of the buddy 
system; site communications; command post or command center; standard 
operating procedures and safe work practices; medical assistance and 
triage area; hazard monitoring plan (air contaminate monitoring, etc.); 
decontamination procedures and area; and other relevant areas. This plan 
should be a part of the employer's emergency response plan or an 
extension of it to the specific site.
    8. Medical surveillance programs. Workers handling hazardous 
substances may be exposed to toxic chemicals, safety hazards, biologic 
hazards, and radiation. Therefore, a medical surveillance program is 
essential to assess and monitor workers' health and fitness for 
employment in hazardous waste operations and during the course of work; 
to provide emergency and other treatment as needed; and to keep accurate 
records for future reference.
    The Occupational Safety and Health Guidance Manual for Hazardous 
Waste Site Activities developed by the National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration (OSHA), the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), and the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); October 1985 provides an 
excellent example of the types of medical testing that should be done as 
part of a medical surveillance program.
    9. New Technology and Spill Containment Programs. Where hazardous 
substances may be released by spilling from a container that will expose 
employees to the hazards of the materials, the employer will need to 
implement a program to contain and control the spilled material. Diking 
and ditching, as well as use of absorbents like diatomaceous earth, are 
traditional techniques which have proven to be effective over the years. 
However, in recent years new products have come into the marketplace, 
the use of which complement and increase the effectiveness of

[[Page 171]]

these traditional methods. These new products also provide emergency 
responders and others with additional tools or agents to use to reduce 
the hazards of spilled materials.
    These agents can be rapidly applied over a large area and can be 
uniformly applied or otherwise can be used to build a small dam, thus 
improving the workers' ability to control spilled material. These 
application techniques enhance the intimate contact between the agent 
and the spilled material allowing for the quickest effect by the agent 
or quickest control of the spilled material. Agents are available to 
solidify liquid spilled materials, to suppress vapor generation from 
spilled materials, and to do both. Some special agents, which when 
applied as recommended by the manufacturer, will react in a controlled 
manner with the spilled material to neutralize acids or caustics, or 
greatly reduce the level of hazard of the spilled material.
    There are several modern methods and devices for use by emergency 
response personnel or others involved with spill control efforts to 
safely apply spill control agents to control spilled material hazards. 
These include portable pressurized applicators similar to hand-held 
portable fire extinguishing devices, and nozzle and hose systems similar 
to portable fire fighting foam systems which allow the operator to apply 
the agent without having to come into contact with the spilled material. 
The operator is able to apply the agent to the spilled material from a 
remote position.
    The solidification of liquids provides for rapid containment and 
isolation of hazardous substance spills. By directing the agent at run-
off points or at the edges of the spill, the reactant solid will 
automatically create a barrier to slow or stop the spread of the 
material. Clean-up of hazardous substances is greatly improved when 
solidifying agents, acid or caustic neutralizers, or activated carbon 
adsorbents are used. Properly applied, these agents can totally solidify 
liquid hazardous substances or neutralize or absorb them, which results 
in materials which are less hazardous and easier to handle, transport, 
and dispose of. The concept of spill treatment, to create less hazardous 
substances, will improve the safety and level of protection of employees 
working at spill clean-up operations or emergency response operations to 
spills of hazardous substances.
    The use of vapor suppression agents for volatile hazardous 
substances, such as flammable liquids and those substances which present 
an inhalation hazard, is important for protecting workers. The rapid and 
uniform distribution of the agent over the surface of the spilled 
material can provide quick vapor knockdown. There are temporary and 
long-term foam-type agents which are effective on vapors and dusts, and 
activated carbon adsorption agents which are effective for vapor control 
and soaking-up of the liquid. The proper use of hose lines or hand-held 
portable pressurized applicators provides good mobility and permits the 
worker to deliver the agent from a safe distance without having to step 
into the untreated spilled material. Some of these systems can be 
recharged in the field to provide coverage of larger spill areas than 
the design limits of a single charged applicator unit. Some of the more 
effective agents can solidify the liquid flammable hazardous substances 
and at the same time elevate the flashpoint above 140 deg. F so the 
resulting substance may be handled as a nonhazardous waste material if 
it meets the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's 40 CFR part 261 
requirements (See particularly Sec. 261.21).
    All workers performing hazardous substance spill control work are 
expected to wear the proper protective clothing and equipment for the 
materials present and to follow the employer's established standard 
operating procedures for spill control. All involved workers need to be 
trained in the established operating procedures; in the use and care of 
spill control equipment; and in the associated hazards and control of 
such hazards of spill containment work.
    These new tools and agents are the things that employers will want 
to evaluate as part of their new technology program. The treatment of 
spills of hazardous substances or wastes at an emergency incident as 
part of the immediate spill containment and control efforts is sometimes 
acceptable to EPA and a permit exception is described in 40 CFR 
264.1(g)(8) and 265.1(c)(11).

        Appendix to Sec. 1926.65--Training Curriculum Guidelines

    The following non-mandatory general criteria may be used for 
assistance in developing site-specific training curriculum used to meet 
the training requirements of 29 CFR 1926.65(e); 29 CFR 1926.65(p)(7), 
(p)(8)(iii); and 29 CFR 1926.65(q)(6), (q)(7), and (q)(8). These are 
generic guidelines and they are not presented as a complete training 
curriculum for any specific employer. Site-specific training programs 
must be developed on the basis of a needs assessment of the hazardous 
waste site, RCRA/TSDF, or emergency response operation in accordance 
with 29 CFR 1926.65.

    It is noted that the legal requirements are set forth in the 
regulatory text of Sec. 1926.65. The guidance set forth here presents a 
highly effective program that in the areas covered would meet or exceed 
the regulatory requirements. In addition, other approaches could meet 
the regulatory requirements.

documented by the use of a written assessment and a skill demonstration 
selected and developed by the Training Director and training staff. The 
assessment and demonstration should evaluate the knowledge and 
individual skills developed in the course of training. The level of 
minimum achievement necessary for proficiency shall be specified in 
writing by the Training Director.
    If a written test is used, there should be a minimum of 50 
questions. If a written test is used in combination with a skills 
demonstration, a minimum of 25 questions should be used. If a skills 
demonstration is used, the tasks chosen and the means to rate successful 
completion should be fully documented by the Training Director.
    The content of the written test or of the skill demonstration shall 
be relevant to the objectives of the course. The written test and skill 
demonstration should be updated as necessary to reflect changes in the 
curriculum and any update should be approved by the Training Director.
    The proficiency assessment methods, regardless of the approach or 
combination of approaches used, should be justified, document and 
approved by the Training Director.
    The proficiency of those taking the additional courses for 
supervisors should be evaluated and document by using proficiency 
assessment methods acceptable to the Training Director. These 
proficiency assessment methods must reflect the additional 
responsibilities borne by supervisory personnel in hazardous waste 
operations or emergency response.

    This documentation may include a certificate and an appropriate 
wallet-sized laminated card with a photograph of the student and the 
above information. When such course certificate cards are used, the 
individual identification number for the training certificate should be 
shown on the card.
    9. Recordkeeping. Training providers should maintain records listing 
the dates courses were presented, the names of the individual

[[Page 174]]

course attenders, the names of those students successfully completing 
each course, and the number of training certificates issued to each 
successful student. These records should be maintained for a minimum of 
five years after the date an individual participated in a training 
program offered by the training provider. These records should be 
available and provided upon the student's request or as mandated by law.
    10. Program quality control. The Training Director should conduct or 
direct an annual written audit of the training program. Program 
modifications to address deficiencies, if any, should be documented, 
approved, and implemented by the training provider. The audit and the 
program modification documents should be maintained at the training 
facility.

    C. Emergency response training.
    Federal OSHA standards in 29 CFR 1926.65(q) are directed toward 
private sector emergency responders. Therefore, the guidelines provided 
in this portion of the appendix are directed toward that employee 
population. However, they also impact indirectly through State OSHA or 
USEPA regulations some public sector emergency responders. Therefore, 
the guidelines provided in this portion of the appendix may be applied 
to both employee populations.
    States with OSHA state plans must cover their employees with 
regulations at least as effective as the Federal OSHA standards. Public 
employees in states without approved state OSHA programs covering 
hazardous waste operations and emergency response are covered by the 
U.S. EPA under 40 CFR 311, a regulation virtually identical to 
Sec. 1926.65.
    Since this is a non-mandatory appendix and therefore not an 
enforceable standard, OSHA recommends that those employers, employees or 
volunteers in public sector emergency response organizations outside 
Federal OSHA jurisdiction consider the following criteria in developing 
their own training programs. A unified approach to training at the 
community level between emergency response organizations covered by 
Federal OSHA and those not covered directly by Federal OSHA can help 
ensure an effective community response to the release or potential 
release of hazardous substances in the community.
    a. General considerations.
    Emergency response organizations are required to consider the topics 
listed in Sec. 1926.65(q)(6). Emergency response organizations may use 
some or all of the following topics to supplement those mandatory topics 
when developing their response training programs. Many of the topics 
would require an interaction between the response provider and the 
individuals responsible for the site where the response would be 
expected.
    (1) Hazard recognition, including:
    (A) Nature of hazardous substances present,
    (B) Practical applications of hazard recognition, including 
presentations on biology, chemistry, and physics.
    (2) Principles of toxicology, biological monitoring, and risk 
assessment.
    (3) Safe work practices and general site safety.
    (4) Engineering controls and hazardous waste operations.
    (5) Site safety plans and standard operating procedures.
    (6) Decontamination procedures and practices.
    (7) Emergency procedures, first aid, and self-rescue.
    (8) Safe use of field equipment.
    (9) Storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous 
substances.
    (10) Use, care, and limitations of personal protective equipment.
    (11) Safe sampling techniques.
    (12) Rights and responsibilities of employees under OSHA and other 
related laws concerning right-to-know, safety and health, compensations 
and liability.
    (13) Medical monitoring requirements.
    (14) Community relations.
    b. Suggested criteria for specific courses.

    (5) Incident commander.
    The incident commander is the individual who, at any one time, is 
responsible for and in control of the response effort. This individual 
is the person responsible for the direction and coordination of the 
response effort. An incident commander's position should be occupied by 
the most senior, appropriately trained individual present at the 
response site. Yet, as necessary and appropriate by the level of 
response provided, the position may be occupied by many individuals 
during a particular response as the need for greater authority, 
responsibility, or training increases. It is possible for the first 
responder at the awareness level to assume the duties of incident 
commander until a more senior and appropriately trained individual 
arrives at the response site.
    Therefore, any emergency responder expected to perform as an 
incident commander should be trained to fulfill the obligations of the 
position at the level of response they will be providing including the 
following:
    (A) Ability to analyze a hazardous substance incident to determine 
the magnitude of the response problem.
    (B) Ability to plan and implement an appropriate response plan 
within the capabilities of available personnel and equipment.
    (C) Ability to implement a response to favorably change the outcome 
of the incident in a manner consistent with the local emergency response 
plan and the organization's standard operating procedures.
    (D) Ability to evaluate the progress of the emergency response to 
ensure that the response objectives are being met safely, effectively, 
and efficiently.
    (E) Ability to adjust the response plan to the conditions of the 
response and to notify higher levels of response when required by the 
changes to the response plan.

powders. Aerated powders shall mean any powdered material used as a 
coating material which shall be fluidized within a container by passing 
air uniformly from below. It is common practice to fluidize such 
materials to form a fluidized powder bed and then dip the part to be 
coated into the bed in a manner similar to that used in liquid dipping. 
Such beds are also used as sources for powder spray operations.
    (2) Spraying area. Any area in which dangerous quantities of 
flammable vapors or mists, or combustible residues, dusts, or deposits 
are present due to the operation of spraying processes.
    (3) Spray booth. A power-ventilated structure provided to enclose or 
accommodate a spraying operation to confine and limit the escape of 
spray, vapor, and residue, and to safely conduct or direct them to an 
exhaust system.
    (4) Waterwash spray booth. A spray booth equipped with a water 
washing system designed to minimize dusts or residues entering exhaust 
ducts and to

[[Page 181]]

permit the recovery of overspray finishing material.
    (5) Dry spray booth. A spray booth not equipped with a water washing 
system as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. A dry spray 
booth may be equipped with

corrosion loss expected during the design life of the tank.
    (2) Installation of outside aboveground tanks. (i) [Reserved]
    (ii) Spacing (shell-to-shell) between aboveground tanks. (A) The 
distance between any two flammable or combustible liquid storage tanks 
shall not be less than 3 feet (0.912 m).
    (B) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, 
the distance between any two adjacent tanks shall not be less than one-
sixth the sum of their diameters. When the diameter of one tank is less 
than one-half the diameter of the adjacent tank, the distance between 
the two tanks shall not be less than one-half the diameter of the 
smaller tank.
    (C) Where crude petroleum in conjunction with production facilities 
are located in noncongested areas and have capacities not exceeding 
126,000 gallons (3,000 barrels), the distance between such tanks shall 
not be less than 3 feet (0.912 m).
    (D) Where unstable flammable or combustible liquids are stored, the 
distance between such tanks shall not be less than one-half the sum of 
their diameters.
    (E) When tanks are compacted in three or more rows or in an 
irregular pattern, greater spacing or other means shall be provided so 
that inside tanks are accessible for firefighting purposes.
    (F) The minimum separation between a liquefied petroleum gas 
container and a flammable or combustible liquid storage tank shall be 20

tanks operating at pressures exceeding 2.5 p.s.i.g. or equipped with 
emergency venting which will permit pressures to exceed 2.5 p.s.i.g. in 
which case the provisions of paragraphs (i)(2)(ii) (A) and (B) of this 
section shall apply. Suitable means shall be taken to prevent the 
accumulation of flammable or combustible liquids under adjacent 
liquefied petroleum gas containers such as by diversion curbs or 
grading. When flammable or combustible liquid storage tanks are within a 
diked area, the liquefied petroleum gas containers shall be outside the 
diked area and at least 10 feet (3.04 m) away from the centerline of the 
wall of the diked area. The foregoing provisions shall not apply when 
liquefied petroleum gas containers of 125 gallons (473.125 L) or less 
capacity are installed adjacent to fuel oil supply tanks of 550 gallons 
(2,081.75 L) or less capacity.
    (iii) [Reserved]
    (iv) Normal venting for aboveground tanks. (A) Atmospheric storage 
tanks shall be adequately vented to prevent the development of vacuum or 
pressure sufficient to distort the roof of a cone

[[Page 199]]

roof tank or exceeding the design pressure in the case of other 
atmospheric tanks, as a result of filling or emptying, and atmospheric 
temperature changes.
    (B) Normal vents shall be sized either in accordance with: (1) The 
American Petroleum Institute Standard 2000 (1968), Venting Atmospheric 
and Low-Pressure Storage Tanks; or (2) other accepted standard; or (3) 
shall be at least as large as the filling or withdrawal connection, 
whichever is larger but in no case less than 1\1/4\ inch (3.175 cm) 
nominal inside diameter.
    (C) Low-pressure tanks and pressure vessels shall be adequately 
vented to prevent development of pressure or vacuum, as a result of 
filling or emptying and atmospheric temperature changes, from exceeding 
the design pressure of the tank or vessel. Protection shall also be 
provided to prevent overpressure from any pump discharging into the tank 
or vessel when the pump discharge pressure can exceed the design 
pressure of the tank or vessel.
    (D) If any tank or pressure vessel has more than one fill or 
withdrawal connection and simultaneous filling or withdrawal can be 
made, the vent size shall be based on the maximum anticipated 
simultaneous flow.
    (E) Unless the vent is designed to limit the internal pressure 2.5 
p.s.i. or less, the outlet of vents and vent drains shall be arranged to 
discharge in such a manner as to prevent localized overheating of any 
part of the tank in the event vapors from such vents are ignited.
    (F) Tanks and pressure vessels storing Class IA liquids shall be 
equipped with venting devices which shall be normally closed except when 
venting to pressure or vacuum conditions. Tanks and pressure vessels 
storing Class IB and IC liquids shall be equipped with venting devices 
which shall be normally closed except when venting under pressure or 
vacuum conditions, or with approved flame arresters.
    Exemption: Tanks of 3,000 bbls. (84 m\3\) capacity or less 
containing crude petroleum in crude-producing areas; and, outside 
aboveground atmospheric tanks under 1,000 gallons (3,785 L) capacity 
containing other than Class IA flammable liquids may have open vents. 
(See paragraph (i)(2)(vi)(B) of this section.)
    (G) Flame arresters or venting devices required in paragraph 
(i)(2)(iv)(F) of this section may be omitted for Class IB and IC liquids 
where conditions are such that their use may, in case of obstruction, 
result in tank damage.
    (v) Emergency relief venting for fire exposure for aboveground 
tanks. (A) Every aboveground storage tank shall have some form of 
construction or device that will relieve excessive internal pressure 
caused by exposure fires.
    (B) In a vertical tank the construction referred to in paragraph 
(i)(2)(v)(A) of this section may take the form of a floating roof, 
lifter roof, a weak roof-to-shell seam, or other approved pressure 
relieving construction. The weak roof-to-shell seam shall be constructed 
to fail preferential to any other seam.
    (C) Where entire dependence for emergency relief is placed upon 
pressure relieving devices, the total venting capacity of both normal 
and emergency vents shall be enough to prevent rupture of the shell or 
bottom of the tank if vertical, or of the shell or heads if horizontal. 
If unstable liquids are stored, the effects of heat or gas resulting 
from polymerization, decomposition, condensation, or self-reactivity 
shall be taken into account. The total capacity of both normal and 
emergency venting devices shall be not less than that derived from Table 
F-10 except as provided in paragraph (i)(2)(v) (E) or (F) of this 
section. Such device may be a self-closing manhole cover, or one using 
long bolts that permit the cover to lift under internal pressure, or an 
additional or larger relief valve or valves. The wetted area of the tank 
shall be calculated on the basis of 55 percent of the total exposed area 
of a sphere or spheroid, 75 percent of the total exposed area of a 
horizontal tank and the first 30 feet (9.12 m) above grade of the 
exposed shell area of a vertical tank.

    (D) For tanks and storage vessels designed for pressure over 1 
p.s.i.g., the total rate of venting shall be determined in accordance 
with Table F-10, except that when the exposed wetted area of the surface 
is greater than 2,800 square feet (257.6 m\2\), the total rate of 
venting shall be calculated by the following formula:


CFH=1,107A <SUP>0.82

</SUP>Where:

    CFH=Venting requirement, in cubic feet (meters) of free air per 
hour.
    A=Exposed wetted surface, in square feet (m\2\).

    Note: The foregoing formula is based on Q=21,000A <SUP>0.82</SUP>.

    (E) The total emergency relief venting capacity for any specific 
stable liquid may be determined by the following formula:


V=1337<divide>L<radical>  M

    V=Cubic feet (meters) of free air per hour from Table F-10.
    L=Latent heat of vaporization of specific liquid in B.t.u. per 
pound.
    M=Molecular weight of specific liquids.

    (F) The required airflow rate of paragraph (i)(2)(v) (C) or (E) of 
this section may be multiplied by the appropriate factor listed in the 
following schedule when protection is provided as indicated. Only one 
factor may be used for any one tank.

    0.5 for drainage in accordance with paragraph (i)(2)(vii)(B) of this 
section for tanks over 200 square feet (18.4 m\2\) of wetted area.
    0.3 for approved water spray.
    0.3 for approved insulation.
    0.15 for approved water spray with approved insulation.

    (G) The outlet of all vents and vent drains on tanks equipped with 
emergency venting to permit pressures exceeding 2.5 p.s.i.g. shall be 
arranged to discharge in such a way as to prevent localized overheating 
of any part of the tank, in the event vapors from such vents are 
ignited.
    (H) Each commercial tank venting device shall have stamped on it the 
opening pressure, the pressure at which the valve reaches the full open 
position, and the flow capacity at the latter pressure, expressed in 
cubic feet (meters) per hour of air at 60 deg.F. (15.55 deg.C) and at a 
pressure of 14.7 p.s.i.a.
    (I) The flow capacity of tank venting devices 12 inches (30.48 cm) 
and smaller in nominal pipe size shall be determined by actual test of 
each type and size of vent. These flow tests may be conducted by the 
manufacturer if certified by a qualified impartial observer, or may be 
conducted by an outside agency. The flow capacity of tank venting 
devices larger than 12 inches (30.48 cm) nominal pipe size, including 
manhole covers with long bolts or equivalent, may be calculated provided 
that the opening pressure is actually measured, the rating pressure and 
corresponding free orifice area are stated, the word ``calculated'' 
appears on the nameplate, and the computation is based on a flow 
coefficient of 0.5 applied to the rated orifice area.
    (vi) Vent piping for aboveground tanks. (A) Vent piping shall be 
constructed in

[[Page 201]]

accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
    (B) Where vent pipe outlets for tanks storing Class I liquids are 
adjacent to buildings or public ways, they shall be located so that the 
vapors are released at a safe point outside of buildings and not less 
than 12 feet (3.648 m) above the adjacent ground level. In order to aid 
their dispersion, vapors shall be discharged upward or horizontally away 
from closely adjacent walls. Vent outlets shall be located so that 
flammable vapors will not be trapped by eaves or other obstructions and 
shall be at least 5 feet (1.52 m) from building openings.
    (C) When tank vent piping is manifolded, pipe sizes shall be such as 
to discharge, within the pressure limitations of the system, the vapors 
they may be required to handle when manifolded tanks are subject to the 
same fire exposure.
    (vii) Drainage, dikes, and walls for aboveground tanks--(A) Drainage 
and diked areas. The area surrounding a tank or a group of tanks shall 
be provided with drainage as in paragraph (i)(2)(vii)(B) of this 
section, or shall be diked as provided in (i)(2)(vii)(C) of this 
section, to prevent accidental discharge of liquid from endangering 
adjoining property or reaching waterways.
    (B) Drainage. Where protection of adjoining property or waterways is 
by means of a natural or manmade drainage system, such systems shall 
comply with the following:
    (1) [Reserved]
    (2) The drainage system shall terminate in vacant land or other area 
or in an impounding basin having a capacity not smaller than that of the 
largest tank served. This termination area and the route of the drainage 
system shall be so located that, if the flammable or combustible liquids 
in the drainage system are ignited, the fire will not seriously expose 
tanks or adjoining property.
    (C) Diked areas. Where protection of adjoining property or waterways 
is accomplished by retaining the liquid around the tank by means of a 
dike, the volume of the diked area shall comply with the following 
requirements:
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(2)(vii)(C)(2) of this 
section, the volumetric capacity of the diked area shall not be less 
than the greatest amount of liquid that can be released from the largest 
tank within the diked area, assuming a full tank. The capacity of the 
diked area enclosing more than one tank shall be calculated by deducting 
the volume of the tanks other than the largest tank below the height of 
the dike.
    (2) For a tank or group of tanks with fixed roofs containing crude 
petroleum with boilover characteristics, the volumetric capacity of the 
diked area shall be not less than the capacity of the largest tank 
served by the enclosure, assuming a full tank. The capacity of the diked 
enclosure shall be calculated by deducting the volume below the height 
of the dike of all tanks within the enclosure.
    (3) Walls of the diked area shall be of earth, steel, concrete or 
solid masonry designed to be liquidtight and to withstand a full 
hydrostatic head. Earthen walls 3 feet (0.912 m) or more in height shall 
have a flat section at the top not less than 2 feet (0.608 m) wide. The 
slope of an earthen wall shall be consistent with the angle of repose of 
the material of which the wall is constructed.
    (4) The walls of the diked area shall be restricted to an average 
height of 6 feet (1.824 m) above interior grade.
    (5) [Reserved]
    (6) No loose combustible material, empty or full drum or barrel, 
shall be permitted within the diked area.
    (viii) Tank openings other than vents for aboveground tanks.
    (A)-(C) [Reserved]
    (D) Openings for gaging shall be provided with a vaportight cap or 
cover.
    (E) For Class IB and Class IC liquids other than crude oils, 
gasolines, and asphalts, the fill pipe shall be so designed and 
installed as to minimize the possibility of generating static 
electricity. A fill pipe entering the top of a tank shall terminate 
within 6 inches (15.24 cm) of the bottom of the tank and shall be 
installed to avoid excessive vibration.
    (F) Filling and emptying connections which are made and broken shall 
be located outside of buildings at a location

[[Page 202]]

free from any source of ignition and not less than 5 feet (1.52 m) away 
from any building opening. Such connection shall be closed and 
liquidtight when not in use. The connection shall be properly 
identified.
    (3) Installation of underground tanks--(i) Location. Excavation for 
underground storage tanks shall be made with due care to avoid 
undermining of foundations of existing structures. Underground tanks or 
tanks under buildings shall be so located with respect to existing 
building foundations and supports that the loads carried by the latter 
cannot be transmitted to the tank. The distance from any part of a tank 
storing Class I liquids to the nearest wall of any basement or pit shall 
be not less than 1 foot (0.304 m), and to any property line that may be 
built upon, not less than 3 feet (0.912 m). The distance from any part 
of a tank storing Class II or Class III liquids to the nearest wall of 
any basement, pit or property line shall be not less than 1 foot (0.304 
m).
    (ii) Depth and cover. Underground tanks shall be set on firm 
foundations and surrounded with at least 6 inches (15.24 cm) of 
noncorrosive, inert materials such as clean sand, earth, or gravel well 
tamped in place. The tank shall be placed in the hole with care since 
dropping or rolling the tank into the hole can break a weld, puncture or 
damage the tank, or scrape off the protective coating of coated tanks. 
Tanks shall be covered with a minimum of 2 feet (0.608 m) of earth, or 
shall be covered with not less than 1 foot (0.304 m) of earth, on top of 
which shall be placed a slab of reinforced concrete not less than 4 
inches (10.16 cm) thick. When underground tanks are, or are likely to 
be, subject to traffic, they shall be protected against damage from 
vehicles passing over them by at least 3 feet (0.912 m) of earth cover, 
or 18 inches (45.72 cm) of well-tamped earth, plus 6 inches (15.24 cm) 
of reinforced concrete or 8 inches (20.32 cm) of asphaltic concrete. 
When asphaltic or reinforced concrete paving is used as part of the 
protection, it shall extend at least 1 foot (0.304 m) horizontally 
beyond the outline of the tank in all directions.
    (iii) Corrosion protection. Corrosion protection for the tank and 
its piping shall be provided by one or more of the following methods:
    (A) Use of protective coatings or wrappings;
    (B) Cathodic protection; or,
    (C) Corrosion resistant materials of construction.
    (iv) Vents. (A) Location and arrangement of vents for Class I 
liquids. Vent pipes from tanks storing Class I liquids shall be so 
located that the discharge point is outside of buildings, higher than 
the fill pipe opening, and not less than 12 feet (3.648 m) above the 
adjacent ground level. Vent pipes shall discharge only upward in order 
to disperse vapors. Vent pipes 2 inches (5.08 cm) or less in nominal 
inside diameter shall not be obstructed by devices that will cause 
excessive back pressure. Vent pipe outlets shall be so located that 
flammable vapors will not enter building openings, or be trapped under 
eaves or other obstructions. If the vent pipe is less than 10 feet (3.04 
m) in length, or greater than 2 inches (5.08 cm) in nominal inside 
diameter, the outlet shall be provided with a vacuum and pressure relief 
device or there shall be an approved flame arrester located in the vent 
line at the outlet or within the approved distance from the outlet.
    (B) Size of vents. Each tank shall be vented through piping adequate 
in size to prevent blow-back of vapor or liquid at the fill opening 
while the tank is being filled. Vent pipes shall be not less than 1\1/4\ 
inch (3.175 cm) nominal inside diameter.

pipe opening. Vent outlets shall be above normal snow level. They may be 
fitted with return bends, coarse screens or other devices to minimize 
ingress of foreign material.
    (D) Vent piping shall be constructed in accordance with paragraph 
(3)(iv)(C) of this section. Vent pipes shall be so laid as to drain 
toward the tank without sags or traps in which liquid can collect. They 
shall be located so that they will not be subjected to physical damage. 
The tank end of the vent pipe shall enter the tank through the top.
    (E) When tank vent piping is manifolded, pipe sizes shall be such as 
to discharge, within the pressure limitations of the system, the vapors 
they may be required to handle when manifolded tanks are filled 
simultaneously.
    (v) Tank openings other than vents. (A) Connections for all tank 
openings shall be vapor or liquid tight.
    (B) Openings for manual gaging, if independent of the fill pipe, 
shall be provided with a liquid-tight cap or cover. If inside a 
building, each such opening shall be protected against liquid overflow 
and possible vapor release by means of a spring loaded check valve or 
other approved device.
    (C) Fill and discharge lines shall enter tanks only through the top. 
Fill lines shall be sloped toward the tank.
    (D) For Class IB and Class IC liquids other than crude oils,

Such valves, when external, and their connections to the tank shall be 
of steel except when the chemical characteristics of the liquid stored 
are incompatible with steel. When materials other than steel are 
necessary, they shall be suitable for the pressures, structural 
stresses, and temperatures involved, including fire exposures.

[[Page 204]]

    (C) Flammable or combustible liquid tanks located inside of 
buildings, except in one-story buildings designed and protected for 
flammable or combustible liquid storage, shall be provided with an 
automatic-closing heat-actuated valve on each withdrawal connection 
below the liquid level, except for connections used for emergency 
disposal, to prevent continued flow in the event of fire in the vicinity 
of the tank. This function may be incorporated in the valve required in 
paragraph (i)(4)(iv)(B) of this section, and if a separate valve, shall 
be located adjacent to the valve required in paragraph (i)(4)(iv)(B) of 
this section.
    (D) Openings for manual gaging, if independent of the fill pipe (see

shall be properly identified.
    (H) Tanks inside buildings shall be equipped with a device, or other 
means shall be provided, to prevent overflow into the building.
    (5) Supports, foundations, and anchorage for all tank locations--(i) 
General. Tank supports shall be installed on firm foundations. Tank 
supports shall be of concrete, masonry, or protected steel. Single wood 
timber supports (not cribbing) laid horizontally may be used for outside 
aboveground tanks if not more than 12 inches (30.48 cm) high at their 
lowest point.
    (ii) Fire resistance. Steel supports or exposed piling shall be 
protected by materials having a fire resistance rating of not less than 
2 hours, except that steel saddles need not be protected if less than 12 
inches (30.48 cm) high at their lowest point. Water spray protection or 
its equivalent may be used in lieu of fire-resistive materials to 
protect supports.
    (iii) Spheres. The design of the supporting structure for tanks such 
as spheres shall receive special engineering consideration.
    (iv) Load distribution. Every tank shall be so supported as to 
prevent the excessive concentration of loads on the supporting portion 
of the shell.
    (v) Foundations. Tanks shall rest on the ground or on foundations 
made of concrete, masonry, piling, or steel. Tank foundations shall be 
designed to minimize the possibility of uneven settling of the tank and 
to minimize corrosion in any part of the tank resting on the foundation.
    (vi) Flood areas. Where a tank is located in an area that may be 
subjected to flooding, the applicable precautions outlined in this 
subdivision shall be observed.
    (A) No aboveground vertical storage tank containing a flammable or 
combustible liquid shall be located so that the allowable liquid level 
within the tank is below the established maximum flood stage, unless the 
tank is provided with a guiding structure such as described in 
paragraphs (i)(5)(vi) (M), (N), and (O) of this section.
    (B) Independent water supply facilities shall be provided at 
locations where there is no ample and dependable public water supply 
available for loading partially empty tanks with water.
    (C) In addition to the preceding requirements, each tank so located 
that more than 70 percent, but less than 100 percent, of its allowable 
liquid storage capacity will be submerged at the established maximum 
flood stage, shall be safeguarded by one of the following methods: Tank 
shall be raised, or its height shall be increased, until its top extends 
above the maximum flood stage a distance equivalent to 30 percent or 
more of its allowable liquid storage capacity: Provided, however, That 
the submerged part of the tank

[[Page 205]]

shall not exceed two and one-half times the diameter. Or, as an 
alternative to the foregoing, adequate noncombustible structural guides, 
designed to permit the tank to float vertically without loss of product, 
shall be provided.
    (D) Each horizontal tank so located that more than 70 percent of its 
storage capacity will be submerged at the established flood stage, shall 
be anchored, attached to a foundation of concrete or of steel and 
concrete, of sufficient weight to provide adequate load for the tank 
when filled with flammable or combustible liquid and submerged by flood 
waters to the established flood stage, or adequately secured by other 
means.
    (E) [Reserved]
    (F) At locations where there is no ample and dependable water 
supply, or where filling of underground tanks with liquids is 
impracticable because of the character of their contents, their use, or 
for other reasons, each tank shall be safeguarded against movement when 
empty and submerged by high ground water or flood waters by anchoring, 
weighting with concrete or other approved solid loading material, or 
securing by other means. Each such tank shall be so constructed and 
installed that it will safely resist external pressures due to high 
ground water or flood waters.
    (G) At locations where there is an ample and dependable water supply 
available, underground tanks containing flammable or combustible 
liquids, so installed that more than 70 percent of their storage 
capacity will be submerged at the maximum flood stage, shall be so 
anchored, weighted, or secured by other means, as to prevent movement of 
such tanks when filled with flammable or combustible liquids, and 
submerged by flood waters to the established flood stage.
    (H) Pipe connections below the allowable liquid level in a tank 
shall be provided with valves or cocks located as closely as practicable 
to the tank shell. Such valves and their connections to tanks shall be 
of steel or other material suitable for use with the liquid being 
stored. Cast iron shall not be permitted.
    (I) At locations where an independent water supply is required, it 
shall be entirely independent of public power and water supply. 
Independent source of water shall be available when flood waters reach a 
level not less than 10 feet (3.04 m) below the bottom of the lowest tank 
on a property.
    (J) The self-contained power and pumping unit shall be so located or 
so designed that pumping into tanks may be carried on continuously 
throughout the rise in flood waters from a level 10 feet (3.04 m) below 
the lowest tank to the level of the potential flood stage.
    (K) Capacity of the pumping unit shall be such that the rate of rise 
of water in all tanks shall be equivalent to the established potential 
average rate of rise of flood waters at any stage.
    (L) Each independent pumping unit shall be tested periodically to 
insure that it is in satisfactory operating condition.
    (M) Structural guides for holding floating tanks above their 
foundations shall be so designed that there will be no resistance to the 
free rise of a tank, and shall be constructed of noncombustible 
material.
    (N) The strength of the structure shall be adequate to resist 
lateral movement of a tank subject to a horizontal force in any 
direction equivalent to not less than 25 pounds per square foot (1.05 kg 
m\2\) acting on the projected vertical cross-sectional area of the tank.
    (O) Where tanks are situated on exposed points or bends in a 
shoreline where swift currents in flood waters will be present, the 
structures shall be designed to withstand a unit force of not less than 
50 pounds per square foot (2.1 kg m\2\).
    (P) The filling of a tank to be protected by water loading shall be 
started as soon as flood waters reach a dangerous flood stage. The rate 
of filling shall be at least equal to the rate of rise of the 
floodwaters (or the established average potential rate of rise).
    (Q) Sufficient fuel to operate the water pumps shall be available at 
all times to insure adequate power to fill all tankage with water.
    (R) All valves on connecting pipelines shall be closed and locked in 
closed position when water loading has been completed.

[[Page 206]]

    (S) Where structural guides are provided for the protection of 
floating tanks, all rigid connections between tanks and pipelines shall 
be disconnected and blanked off or blinded before the floodwaters reach 
the bottom of the tank, unless control valves and their connections to 
the tank are of a type designed to prevent breakage between the valve 
and the tank shell.
    (T) All valves attached to tanks other than those used in connection 
with water loading operations shall be closed and locked.
    (U) If a tank is equipped with a swing line, the swing pipe shall be 
raised to and secured at its highest position.
    (V) Inspections. The Assistant Secretary or his designated 
representative shall make periodic inspections of all plants where the 
storage of flammable or combustible liquids is such as to require 
compliance with the foregoing requirements, in order to assure the 
following:
    (1) That all flammable or combustible liquid storage tanks are in 
compliance with these requirements and so maintained.
    (2) That detailed printed instructions of what to do in flood 
emergencies are properly posted.
    (3) That station operators and other employees depended upon to 
carry out such instructions are thoroughly informed as to the location 
and operation of such valves and other equipment necessary to effect 
these requirements.
    (vii) Earthquake areas. In areas subject to earthquakes, the tank 
supports and connections shall be designed to resist damage as a result 
of such shocks.
    (6) Sources of ignition. In locations where flammable vapors may be 
present, precautions shall be taken to prevent ignition by eliminating 
or controlling sources of ignition. Sources of ignition may include open 
flames, lightning, smoking, cutting and welding, hot surfaces, 
frictional heat, sparks (static, electrical, and mechanical), 
spontaneous ignition, chemical and physical-chemical reactions, and 
radiant heat.
    (7) Testing--(i) General. All tanks, whether shop built or field 
erected, shall be strength tested before they are placed in service in 
accordance with the applicable paragraphs of the code under which they 
were built. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) code 
stamp, American Petroleum Institute (API) monogram, or the label of the 
Underwriters' Laboratories, Inc., on a tank shall be evidence of 
compliance with this strength test. Tanks not marked in accordance with 
the above codes shall be strength tested before they are placed in 
service in accordance with good engineering principles and reference 
shall be made to the sections on testing in the codes listed in 
paragraphs (i)(1) (iii)(A), (iv)(B), or (v)(B) of this section.
    (ii) Strength. When the vertical length of the fill and vent pipes 
is such that when filled with liquid the static head imposed upon the 
bottom of the tank exceeds 10 pounds per square inch (68.94 kPa), the 
tank and related piping shall be tested hydrostatically to a pressure 
equal to the static head thus imposed.
    (iii) Tightness. In addition to the strength test called for in 
paragraphs (i)(7) (i) and (ii) of this section, all tanks and 
connections shall be tested for tightness. Except for underground tanks, 
this tightness test shall be made at operating pressure with air, inert 
gas, or water prior to placing the tank in service. In the case of 
field-erected tanks the strength test may be considered to be the test 
for tank tightness. Underground tanks and piping, before being covered, 
enclosed, or placed in use, shall be tested for tightness 
hydrostatically, or with air pressure at not less than 3 pounds per 
square inch (20.68 kPa) and not more than 5 pounds per square inch 
(34.47 kPa).
    (iv) Repairs. All leaks or deformations shall be corrected in an 
acceptable manner before the tank is placed in service. Mechanical 
caulking is not permitted for correcting leaks in welded tanks except 
pinhole leaks in the roof.
    (v) Derated operations. Tanks to be operated at pressures below 
their design pressure may be tested by the applicable provisions of 
paragraphs (i)(7) (i) or (ii) of this section, based upon the pressure 
developed under full emergency venting of the tank.
    (j) Piping, valves, and fittings--(1) General--(i) Design. The 
design (including

[[Page 207]]

selection of materials) fabrication, assembly, test, and inspection of 
piping systems containing flammable or combustible liquids shall be 
suitable for the expected working pressures and structural stresses. 
Conformity with the applicable provisions of Pressure Piping, ANSI B31 
series and the provisions of this paragraph, shall be considered prima 
facie evidence of compliance with the foregoing provisions.
    (ii) Exceptions. This paragraph does not apply to any of the 
following:
    (A) Tubing or casing on any oil or gas wells and any piping 
connected directly thereto.
    (B) Motor vehicle, aircraft, boat, or portable or stationary 
engines.
    (C) Piping within the scope of any applicable boiler and pressures 
vessel code.
    (iii) Definitions. As used in this paragraph, piping systems consist 
of pipe, tubing, flanges, bolting, gaskets, valves, fittings, the 
pressure containing parts of other components such as expansion joints 
and strainers, and devices which serve such purposes as mixing, 
separating, snubbing, distributing, metering, or controlling flow.
    (2) Materials for piping, valves, and fittings--(i) Required 
materials. Materials for piping, valves, or fittings shall be steel, 
nodular iron, or malleable iron, except as provided in paragraphs (j)(2) 
(ii), (iii) and (iv) of this section.
    (ii) Exceptions. Materials other than steel, nodular iron, or 
malleable iron may be used underground, or if required by the properties 
of the flammable or combustible liquid handled. Material other than 
steel, nodular iron, or malleable iron shall be designed to 
specifications embodying principles recognized as good engineering 
practices for the material used.
    (iii) Linings. Piping, valves, and fittings may have combustible or 
noncombustible linings.
    (iv) Low-melting materials. When low-melting point materials such as 
aluminum and brass or materials that soften on fire exposure such as 
plastics, or non-ductile materials such as cast iron, are necessary, 
special consideration shall be given to their behavior on fire exposure. 
If such materials are used in above ground piping systems or inside 
buildings, they shall be suitably protected against fire exposure or so 
located that any spill resulting from the failure of these materials 
could not unduly expose persons, important buildings or structures or 
can be readily controlled by remote valves.
    (3) Pipe joints. Joints shall be made liquid tight. Welded or 
screwed joints or approved connectors shall be used. Threaded joints and 
connections shall be made up tight with a suitable lubricant or piping 
compound. Pipe joints dependent upon the friction characteristics of 
combustible materials for mechanical continuity of piping shall not be 
used inside buildings. They may be used outside of buildings above or 
below ground. If used above ground, the piping shall either be secured 
to prevent disengagement at the fitting or the piping system shall be so 
designed that any spill resulting from such disengagement could not 
unduly expose persons, important buildings or structures, and could be 
readily controlled by remote valves.
    (4) Supports. Piping systems shall be substantially supported and 
protected against physical damage and excessive stresses arising from 
settlement, vibration, expansion, or contraction.
    (5) Protection against corrosion. All piping for flammable or 
combustible liquids, both aboveground and underground, where subject to 
external corrosion, shall be painted or otherwise protected.
    (6) Valves. Piping systems shall contain a sufficient number of 
valves to operate the system properly and to protect the plant. Piping 
systems in connection with pumps shall contain a sufficient number of 
valves to control properly the flow of liquid in normal operation and in 
the event of physical damage. Each connection to pipelines, by which 
equipments such as tankcars or tank vehicles discharge liquids by means 
of pumps into storage tanks, shall be provided with a check valve for 
automatic protection against backflow if the piping arrangement is such 
that backflow from the system is possible.
    (7) Testing. All piping before being covered, enclosed, or placed in 
use shall be hydrostatically tested to 150 percent of the maximum 
anticipated

[[Page 208]]

pressure of the system, or pneumatically tested to 110 percent of the 
maximum anticipated pressure of the system, but not less than 5 pounds 
per square inch gage at the highest point of the system. This test shall 
be maintained for a sufficient time to complete visual inspection of all 
joints and connections, but for at least 10 minutes.
    (k) Marine service stations--(1) Dispensing. (i) The dispensing area 
shall be located away from other structures so as to provide room for 
safe ingress and egress of craft to be fueled. Dispensing units shall in 
all cases be at least 20 feet (6.08 m) from any activity involving fixed 
sources of ignition.
    (ii) Dispensing shall be by approved dispensing units with or 
without integral pumps and may be located on open piers, wharves, or 
floating docks or on shore or on piers of the solid fill type.
    (iii) Dispensing nozzles shall be automatic-closing without a hold-
open latch.
    (2) Tanks and pumps. (i) Tanks, and pumps not integral with the 
dispensing unit, shall be on shore or on a pier of the solid fill type, 
except as provided in paragraphs (k)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section.
    (ii) Where shore location would require excessively long supply 
lines to dispensers, tanks may be installed on a pier provided that 
applicable portions of paragraph (b) of this section relative to 
spacing, diking, and piping are complied with and the quantity so stored 
does not exceed 1,100 gallons (4,163.5 L) aggregate capacity.
    (iii) Shore tanks supplying marine service stations may be located 
above ground, where rock ledges or high water table make underground 
tanks impractical.
    (iv) Where tanks are at an elevation which would produce gravity 
head on the dispensing unit, the tank outlet shall be equipped with a 
pressure control valve positioned adjacent to and outside the tank block 
valve specified in Sec. 1926.152(c)(8) of this section, so adjusted that 
liquid cannot flow by gravity from the tank in case of piping or hose 
failure.
    (3) Piping. (i) Piping between shore tanks and dispensing units 
shall be as described in paragraph (k)(2)(iii) of this section, except 
that, where dispensing is from a floating structure, suitable lengths of 
oil-resistant flexible hose may be employed between the shore piping and 
the piping on the floating structure as made necessary by change in 
water level or shoreline.

Sec. 1926.251  Rigging equipment for material handling.

    (a) General. (1) Rigging equipment for material handling shall be 
inspected prior to use on each shift and as necessary during its use to 
ensure that it is safe. Defective rigging equipment shall be removed 
from service.
    (2) Rigging equipment shall not be loaded in excess of its 
recommended safe working load, as prescribed in Tables H-1 through H-20 
in this subpart, following Sec. 1926.252(e) for the specific equipment.
    (3) Rigging equipment, when not in use, shall be removed from the 
immediate work area so as not to present a hazard to employees.
    (4) Special custom design grabs, hooks, clamps, or other lifting 
accessories, for such units as modular panels, prefabricated structures 
and similar materials, shall be marked to indicate the safe working 
loads and shall be proof-tested prior to use to 125 percent of their 
rated load.
    (5) Scope. This section applies to slings used in conjunction with 
other material handling equipment for the movement of material by 
hoisting, in employments covered by this part. The types of slings 
covered are those made from alloy steel chain, wire rope, metal mesh, 
natural or synthetic fiber rope (conventional three strand 
construction), and synthetic web (nylon, polyester, and polypropylene).
    (6) Inspections. Each day before being used, the sling and all 
fastenings and attachments shall be inspected for damage or defects by a 
competent person designated by the employer. Additional inspections 
shall be performed during sling use, where service conditions warrant. 
Damaged or defective slings shall be immediately removed from service.
    (b) Alloy steel chains. (1) Welded alloy steel chain slings shall 
have permanently affixed durable identification stating size, grade, 
rated capacity, and sling manufacturer.
    (2) Hooks, rings, oblong links, pear-shaped links, welded or 
mechanical coupling links, or other attachments, when used with alloy 
steel chains, shall have a rated capacity at least equal to that of the 
chain.
    (3) Job or shop hooks and links, or makeshift fasteners, formed from 
bolts, rods, etc., or other such attachments, shall not be used.
    (4) Rated capacity (working load limit) for alloy steel chain slings 
shall conform to the values shown in Table H-1.

[[Page 218]]

    (5) Whenever wear at any point of any chain link exceeds that shown 
in Table H-2, the assembly shall be removed from service.
    (6) Inspections. (i) In addition to the inspection required by other 
paragraphs of this section, a thorough periodic inspection of alloy 
steel chain slings in use shall be made on a regular basis, to be 
determined on the basis of (A) frequency of sling use; (B) severity of 
service conditions; (C) nature of lifts being made; and (D) experience 
gained on the service life of slings used in similar circumstances. Such 
inspections shall in no event be at intervals greater than once every 12 
months.
    (ii) The employer shall make and maintain a record of the most 
recent month in which each alloy steel chain sling was thoroughly 
inspected, and shall make such record available for examination.
    (c) Wire rope. (1) Tables H-3 through H-14 shall be used to 
determine the safe working loads of various sizes and classifications of 
improved plow steel wire rope and wire rope slings with various types of 
terminals. For sizes, classifications, and grades not included in these 
tables, the safe working load recommended by the manufacturer for 
specific, identifiable products shall be followed, provided that a 
safety factor of not less than 5 is maintained.
    (2) Protruding ends of strands in splices on slings and bridles 
shall be covered or blunted.
    (3) Wire rope shall not be secured by knots, except on haul back 
lines on scrapers.
    (4) The following limitations shall apply to the use of wire rope:
    (i) An eye splice made in any wire rope shall have not less than 
three full tucks. However, this requirement shall not operate to 
preclude the use of another form of splice or connection which can be 
shown to be as efficient and which is not otherwise prohibited.
    (ii) Except for eye splices in the ends of wires and for endless 
rope slings, each wire rope used in hoisting or lowering, or in pulling 
loads, shall consist of one continuous piece without knot or splice.
    (iii) Eyes in wire rope bridles, slings, or bull wires shall not be 
formed by wire rope clips or knots.
    (iv) Wire rope shall not be used if, in any length of eight 
diameters, the total number of visible broken wires exceeds 10 percent 
of the total number of wires, or if the rope shows other signs of 
excessive wear, corrosion, or defect.
    (5) When U-bolt wire rope clips are used to form eyes, Table H-20 
shall be used to determine the number and spacing of clips.
    (i) When used for eye splices, the U-bolt shall be applied so that 
the ``U'' section is in contact with the dead end of the rope.
    (6) Slings shall not be shortened with knots or bolts or other 
makeshift devices.
    (7) Sling legs shall not be kinked.
    (8) Slings used in a basket hitch shall have the loads balanced to 
prevent slippage.
    (9) Slings shall be padded or protected from the sharp edges of 
their loads.
    (10) Hands or fingers shall not be placed between the sling and its 
load while the sling is being tightened around the load.
    (11) Shock loading is prohibited.
    (12) A sling shall not be pulled from under a load when the load is 
resting on the sling.
    (13) Minimum sling lengths. (i) Cable laid and 6  x  19 and 6  x  37 
slings shall have a minimum clear length of wire rope 10 times the 
component rope diameter between splices, sleeves or end fittings.
    (ii) Braided slings shall have a minimum clear length of wire rope 
40 times the component rope diameter between the loops or end fittings.
    (iii) Cable laid grommets, strand laid grommets and endless slings 
shall have a minimum circumferential length of 96 times their body 
diameter.
    (14) Safe operating temperatures. Fiber core wire rope slings of all 
grades shall be permanently removed from service if they are exposed to 
temperatures in excess of 200 deg.F (93.33 deg.C). When nonfiber core 
wire rope slings of any grade are used at temperatures above 400 deg.F 
(204.44 deg.C) or below minus 60 deg.F (15.55 deg.C), recommendations of 
the sling manufacturer regarding use at that temperature shall be 
followed.

[[Page 219]]

    (15) End attachments. (i) Welding of end attachments, except covers 
to thimbles, shall be performed prior to the assembly of the sling.
    (ii) All welded end attachments shall not be used unless proof 
tested by the manufacturer or equivalent entity at twice their rated 
capacity prior to initial use. The employer shall retain a certificate 
of the proof test, and make it available for examination.
    (d) Natural rope, and synthetic fiber--(1) General. When using 
natural or synthetic fiber rope slings, Tables H-15, 16, 17, and 18 
shall apply.
    (2) All splices in rope slings provided by the employer shall be 
made in accordance with fiber rope manufacturers recommendations.
    (i) In manila rope, eye splices shall contain at least three full 
tucks, and short splices shall contain at least six full tucks (three on 
each side of the centerline of the splice).
    (ii) In layed synthetic fiber rope, eye splices shall contain at 
least four full tucks, and short splices shall contain at least eight 
full tucks (four on each side of the centerline of the splice).
    (iii) Strand end tails shall not be trimmed short (flush with the 
surface of the rope) immediately adjacent to the full tucks. This 
precaution applies to both eye and short splices and all types of fiber 
rope. For fiber ropes under 1-inch diameter, the tails shall project at 
least six rope diameters beyond the last full tuck. For fiber ropes 1-
inch diameter and larger, the tails shall project at least 6 inches 
beyond the last full tuck. In applications where the projecting tails 
may be objectionable, the tails shall be tapered and spliced into the 
body of the rope using at least two additional tucks (which will require 
a tail length of approximately six rope diameters beyond the last full 
tuck).
    (iv) For all eye splices, the eye shall be sufficiently large to 
provide an included angle of not greater than 60 deg. at the splice when 
the eye is placed over the load or support.
    (v) Knots shall not be used in lieu of splices.
    (3) Safe operating temperatures. Natural and synthetic fiber rope 
slings, except for wet frozen slings, may be used in a temperature range 
from minus 20 deg.F (-28.88 deg.C) to plus 180 deg.F (82.2 deg.C) 
without decreasing the working load limit. For operations outside this 
temperature range and for wet frozen slings, the sling manufacturer's 
recommendations shall be followed.
    (4) Splicing. Spliced fiber rope slings shall not be used unless 
they have been spliced in accordance with the following minimum 
requirements and in accordance with any additional recommendations of 
the manufacturer:
    (i) In manila rope, eye splices shall consist of at least three full 
tucks, and short splices shall consist of at least six full tucks, three 
on each side of the splice center line.
    (ii) In synthetic fiber rope, eye splices shall consist of at least 
four full tucks, and short splices shall consist of at least eight full 
tucks, four on each side of the center line.
    (iii) Strand end tails shall not be trimmed flush with the surface 
of the rope immediately adjacent to the full tucks. This applies to all 
types of fiber rope and both eye and short splices. For fiber rope under 
1 inch (2.54 cm) in diameter, the tail shall project at least six rope 
diameters beyond the last full tuck. For fiber rope 1 inch (2.54 cm) in 
diameter and larger, the tail shall project at least 6 inches (15.24 cm) 
beyond the last full tuck. Where a projecting tail interferes with the 
use of the sling, the tail shall be tapered and spliced into the body of 
the rope using at least two additional tucks (which will require a tail 
length of approximately six rope diameters beyond the last full tuck).
    (iv) Fiber rope slings shall have a minimum clear length of rope 
between eye splices equal to 10 times the rope diameter.
    (v) Knots shall not be used in lieu of splices.
    (vi) Clamps not designed specifically for fiber ropes shall not be 
used for splicing.
    (vii) For all eye splices, the eye shall be of such size to provide 
an included angle of not greater than 60 degrees at the splice when the 
eye is placed over the load or support.
    (5) End attachments. Fiber rope slings shall not be used if end 
attachments in contact with the rope have sharp edges or projections.

[[Page 220]]

    (6) Removal from service. Natural and synthetic fiber rope slings 
shall be immediately removed from service if any of the following 
conditions are present:
    (i) Abnormal wear.
    (ii) Powdered fiber between strands.
    (iii) Broken or cut fibers.
    (iv) Variations in the size or roundness of strands.
    (v) Discoloration or rotting.
    (vi) Distortion of hardware in the sling.
    (e) Synthetic webbing (nylon, polyester, and polypropylene). (1) The 
employer shall have each synthetic web sling marked or coded to show:
    (i) Name or trademark of manufacturer.
    (ii) Rated capacities for the type of hitch.
    (iii) Type of material.
    (2) Rated capacity shall not be exceeded.
    (3) Webbing. Synthetic webbing shall be of uniform thickness and 
width and selvage edges shall not be split from the webbing's width.
    (4) Fittings. Fittings shall be:
    (i) Of a minimum breaking strength equal to that of the sling; and
    (ii) Free of all sharp edges that could in any way damage the 
webbing.
    (5) Attachment of end fittings to webbing and formation of eyes. 
Stitching shall be the only method used to attach end fittings to 
webbing and to form eyes. The thread shall be in an even pattern and 
contain a sufficient number of stitches to develop the full breaking 
strength of the sling.
    (6) Environmental conditions. When synthetic web slings are used, 
the following precautions shall be taken:
    (i) Nylon web slings shall not be used where fumes, vapors, sprays, 
mists or liquids of acids or phenolics are present.
    (ii) Polyester and polypropylene web slings shall not be used where 
fumes, vapors, sprays, mists or liquids of caustics are present.
    (iii) Web slings with aluminum fittings shall not be used where 
fumes, vapors, sprays, mists or liquids of caustics are present.
    (7) Safe operating temperatures. Synthetic web slings of polyester 
and nylon shall not be used at temperatures in excess of 180 deg.F 
(82.2 deg.C). Polypropylene web slings shall not be used at temperatures 
in excess of 200 deg.F (93.33 deg.C).
    (8) Removal from service. Synthetic web slings shall be immediately 
removed from service if any of the following conditions are present:
    (i) Acid or caustic burns;
    (ii) Melting or charring of any part of the sling surface;
    (iii) Snags, punctures, tears or cuts;
    (iv) Broken or worn stitches; or
    (v) Distortion of fittings.
    (f) Shackles and hooks. (1) Table H-19 shall be used to determine 
the safe working loads of various sizes of shackles, except that higher 
safe working loads are permissible when recommended by the manufacturer 
for specific, identifiable products, provided that a safety factor of 
not less than 5 is maintained.
    (2) The manufacturer's recommendations shall be followed in 
determining the safe working loads of the various sizes and types of 
specific and identifiable hooks. All hooks for which no applicable 
manufacturer's recommendations are available shall be tested to twice 
the intended safe working load before they are initially put into use. 
The employer shall maintain a record of the dates and results of such 
tests.

Sec. 1926.252  Disposal of waste materials.

    (a) Whenever materials are dropped more than 20 feet to any point 
lying outside the exterior walls of the building, an enclosed chute of 
wood, or equivalent material, shall be used. For the purpose of this 
paragraph, an enclosed chute is a slide, closed in on all sides, through 
which material is moved from a high place to a lower one.
    (b) When debris is dropped through holes in the floor without the 
use of chutes, the area onto which the material is dropped shall be 
completely enclosed with barricades not less than 42 inches high and not 
less than 6 feet back from the projected edge of the opening above. 
Signs warning of the hazard of falling materials shall be posted at each 
level. Removal shall not be permitted in this lower area until debris 
handling ceases above.
    (c) All scrap lumber, waste material, and rubbish shall be removed 
from the immediate work area as the work progresses.
    (d) Disposal of waste material or debris by burning shall comply 
with local fire regulations.
    (e) All solvent waste, oily rags, and flammable liquids shall be 
kept in fire resistant covered containers until removed from worksite.

<R05>
Sec. 1926.300  General requirements.

    (a) Condition of tools. All hand and power tools and similar 
equipment, whether furnished by the employer or the employee, shall be 
maintained in a safe condition.
    (b) Guarding. (1) When power operated tools are designed to 
accommodate guards, they shall be equipped with such guards when in use.
    (2) Belts, gears, shafts, pulleys, sprockets, spindles, drums, fly 
wheels, chains, or other reciprocating, rotating or moving parts of 
equipment shall be guarded if such parts are exposed to contact by 
employees or otherwise create a hazard. Guarding shall meet the 
requirements as set forth in American National Standards Institute, 
B15.1-1953 (R1958), Safety Code for Mechanical Power-Transmission 
Apparatus.
    (3) Types of guarding. One or more methods of machine guarding shall 
be provided to protect the operator and other employees in the machine 
area from hazards such as those created by point of operation, ingoing 
nip points, rotating parts, flying chips and sparks. Examples of 
guarding methods are--barrier guards, two-hand tripping devices, 
electronic safety devices, etc.
    (4) Point of operation guarding. (i) Point of operation is the area 
on a machine where work is actually performed upon the material being 
processed.
    (ii) The point of operation of machines whose operation exposes an 
employee to injury, shall be guarded. The

[[Page 231]]

guarding device shall be in conformity with any appropriate standards 
therefor, or, in the absence of applicable specific standards, shall be 
so designed and constructed as to prevent the operator from having any 
part of his body in the danger zone during the operating cycle.
    (iii) Special handtools for placing and removing material shall be 
such as to permit easy handling of material without the operator placing 
a hand in the danger zone. Such tools shall not be in lieu of other 
guarding required by this section, but can only be used to supplement 
protection provided.
    (iv) The following are some of the machines which usually require 
point of operation guarding:
    (a) Guillotine cutters.
    (b) Shears.
    (c) Alligator shears.
    (d) Power presses.
    (e) Milling machines.
    (f) Power saws.
    (g) Jointers.
    (h) Portable power tools.
    (i) Forming rolls and calenders.
    (5) Exposure of blades. When the periphery of the blades of a fan is 
less than 7 feet (2.128 m) above the floor or working level, the blades 
shall be guarded. The guard shall have openings no larger than 1/2 inch 
(1.27 cm).
    (6) Anchoring fixed machinery. Machines designed for a fixed 
location shall be securely anchored to prevent walking or moving.
    (7) Guarding of abrasive wheel machinery--exposure adjustment. 
Safety guards of the types described in paragraphs (b) (8) and (9) of 
this section, where the operator stands in front of the opening, shall 
be constructed so that the peripheral protecting member can be adjusted 
to the constantly decreasing diameter of the wheel. The maximum angular 
exposure above the horizontal plane of the wheel spindle as specified in 
paragraphs (b) (8) and (9) of this section shall never be exceeded, and 
the distance between the wheel periphery and the adjustable tongue or 
the end of the peripheral member at the top shall never exceed \1/4\ 
inch (0.635 cm). (See Figures I-1 through I-6.)

barrier. The upper run shall be so guarded as to prevent contact 
therewith either by the worker or by objects carried by him. In 
powerplants only the lower run of the belt need be guarded.
    (iv) Overhead chain and link belt drives are governed by the same 
rules as overhead horizontal belts and shall be guarded in the same 
manner as belts.
    (3) Vertical and inclined belts. (i) Vertical and inclined belts 
shall be enclosed by a guard conforming to standards in paragraphs (m) 
and (o) of this section.
    (ii) All guards for inclined belts shall be arranged in such a 
manner that a minimum clearance of 7 feet (2.128 m) is maintained 
between belt and floor at any point outside of guard.
    (4) Vertical belts. Vertical belts running over a lower pulley more 
than 7 feet (2.128 m) above floor or platform shall be guarded at the 
bottom in the same manner as horizontal overhead belts, if conditions 
are as stated in paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) (a) and (c) of this section.
    (5) Cone-pulley belts. (i) The cone belt and pulley shall be 
equipped with a belt shifter so constructed as to adequately guard the 
nip point of the belt and pulley. If the frame of the belt shifter does 
not adequately guard the nip point of the belt and pulley, the nip point 
shall be further protected by means of a vertical guard placed in front 
of the pulley and extending at least to the top of the largest step of 
the cone.
    (ii) If the belt is of the endless type or laced with rawhide laces, 
and a belt shifter is not desired, the belt will be considered guarded 
if the nip point of the belt and pulley is protected by a nip point 
guard located in front of the cone extending at least to the top of the 
largest step of the cone, and formed to show the contour of the cone in 
order to give the nip point of the belt and pulley the maximum 
protection.
    (iii) If the cone is located less than 3 feet (0.912 m) from the 
floor or working platform, the cone pulley and belt shall

[[Page 240]]

be guarded to a height of 3 feet (0.912 m) regardless of whether the 
belt is endless or laced with rawhide.
    (6) Belt tighteners. (i) Suspended counterbalanced tighteners and 
all parts thereof shall be of substantial construction and securely 
fastened; the bearings shall be securely capped. Means must be provided 
to prevent tightener from falling, in case the belt breaks.
    (ii) Where suspended counterweights are used and not guarded by 
location, they shall be so encased as to prevent accident.
    (f) Gears, sprockets, and chains--(1) Gears. Gears shall be guarded 
in accordance with one of the following methods:
    (i) By a complete enclosure; or
    (ii) By a standard guard as described in paragraph (o) of this 
section, at least 7 feet (2.128 m) high extending 6 inches (15.24 cm) 
above the mesh point of the gears; or
    (iii) By a band guard covering the face of gear and having flanges 
extended inward beyond the root of the teeth on the exposed side or 
sides. Where any portion of the train of gears guarded by a band guard 
is less than 6 feet (1.824 m) from the floor a disk guard or a complete 
enclosure to the height of 6 feet (1.824 m) shall be required.
    (2) Hand-operated gears. Paragraph (f)(1) of this section does not 
apply to hand-operated gears used only to adjust machine parts and which 
do not continue to move after hand power is removed. However, the 
guarding of these gears is highly recommended.
    (3) Sprockets and chains. All sprocket wheels and chains shall be 
enclosed unless they are more than 7 feet (2.128 m) above the floor or 
platform. Where the drive extends over other machine or working areas, 
protection against falling shall be provided. This subparagraph does not 
apply to manually operated sprockets.
    (4) Openings for oiling. When frequent oiling must be done, openings 
with hinged or sliding self-closing covers shall be provided. All points 
not readily accessible shall have oil feed tubes if lubricant is to be 
added while machinery is in motion.
    (g) Guarding friction drives. The driving point of all friction 
drives when exposed to contact shall be guarded, all arm or spoke 
friction drives and all web friction drives with holes in the web shall 
be entirely enclosed, and all projecting belts on friction drives where 
exposed to contact shall be guarded.
    (h) Keys, setscrews, and other projections. (1) All projecting keys, 
setscrews, and other projections in revolving parts shall be removed or 
made flush or guarded by metal cover. This subparagraph does not apply 
to keys or setscrews within gear or sprocket casings or other 
enclosures, nor to keys, setscrews, or oilcups in hubs of pulleys less 
than 20 inches (50.8 cm) in diameter where they are within the plane of 
the rim of the pulley.
    (2) It is recommended, however, that no projecting setscrews or 
oilcups be used in any revolving pulley or part of machinery.
    (i) Collars and couplings--(1) Collars. All revolving collars, 
including split collars, shall be cylindrical, and screws or bolts used 
in collars shall not project beyond the largest periphery of the collar.
    (2) Couplings. Shaft couplings shall be so constructed as to present 
no hazard from bolts, nuts, setscrews, or revolving surfaces. Bolts, 
nuts, and setscrews will, however, be permitted where they are covered 
with safety sleeves or where they are used parallel with the shafting 
and are countersunk or else do not extend beyond the flange of the 
coupling.
    (j) Bearings and facilities for oiling. All drip cups and pans shall 
be securely fastened.
    (k) Guarding of clutches, cutoff couplings, and clutch pulleys--(1) 
Guards. Clutches, cutoff couplings, or clutch pulleys having projecting 
parts, where such clutches are located 7 feet (2.128 m) or less above 
the floor or working platform, shall be enclosed by a stationary guard 
constructed in accordance with this section. A ``U'' type guard is 
permissible.
    (2) Engine rooms. In engine rooms a guardrail, preferably with 
toeboard,

[[Page 241]]

may be used instead of the guard required by paragraph (k)(1) of this 
section, provided such a room is occupied only by engine room 
attendants.
    (l) Belt shifters, clutches, shippers, poles, perches, and 
fasteners--(1) Belt shifters. (i) Tight and loose pulleys on all new 
installations made on or after August 31, 1971, shall be equipped with a 
permanent belt shifter provided with mechanical means to prevent belt 
from creeping from loose to tight pulley. It is recommended that old 
installations be changed to conform to this rule.
    (ii) Belt shifter and clutch handles shall be rounded and be located 
as far as possible from danger of accidental contact, but within easy 
reach of the operator. Where belt shifters are not directly located over 
a machine or bench, the handles shall be cut off 6 ft. 6 in. (1.976 m) 
above floor level.
    (2) Belt shippers and shipper poles. The use of belt poles as 
substitutes for mechanical shifters is not recommended.
    (3) Belt perches. Where loose pulleys or idlers are not practicable, 
belt perches in form of brackets, rollers, etc., shall be used to keep 
idle belts away from the shafts.
    (4) Belt fasteners. Belts which of necessity must be shifted by hand 
and belts within 7 feet (2.128 m) of the floor or working platform which 
are not guarded in accordance with this section shall not be fastened 
with metal in any case, nor with any other fastening which by 
construction or wear will constitute an accident hazard.
    (m) Standard guards--general requirements--(1) Materials. (i) 
Standard conditions shall be secured by the use of the following 
materials. Expanded metal, perforated or solid sheet metal, wire mesh on 
a frame of angle iron, or iron pipe securely fastened to floor or to 
frame of machine.
    (ii) All metal should be free from burrs and sharp edges.
    (2) Methods of manufacture. (i) Expanded metal, sheet or perforated 
metal, and wire mesh shall be securely fastened to frame.

horizontal overhead belts, rope, cable, or chain guards more than 7 feet 
(2.128 m) above floor, or platform.
    (i) [Reserved]
    (a) All guards shall be rigidly braced every 3 feet (0.912 m) or 
fractional part of their height to some fixed part of machinery or 
building structure. Where guard is exposed to contact with moving 
equipment additional strength may be necessary.
    (2) Wood guards. (i) Wood guards may be used in the woodworking and 
chemical industries, in industries where the presence of fumes or where 
manufacturing conditions would cause the rapid deterioration of metal 
guards; also in construction work and in locations outdoors where 
extreme cold or extreme heat make metal guards and railings undesirable. 
In all other industries, wood guards shall not be used.
    (3) Guards for horizontal overhead belts. (i) Guards for horizontal 
overhead belts shall run the entire length of the belt and follow the 
line of the pulley to the ceiling or be carried to the nearest wall, 
thus enclosing the belt effectively. Where belts are so located as to 
make it impracticable to carry the guard to wall or ceiling, 
construction of guard shall be such as to enclose completely the top and 
bottom runs of belt and the face of pulleys.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (iii) Suitable reinforcement shall be provided for the ceiling 
rafters or overhead floor beams, where such is necessary, to sustain 
safely the weight and stress likely to be imposed by the guard. The 
interior surface of all guards, by which is meant the surface of the 
guard with which a belt will come in contact, shall be smooth and free 
from all projections of any character, except where construction demands 
it; protruding shallow roundhead rivets may be used. Overhead belt 
guards shall be at least one-quarter wider than belt which they protect, 
except that this clearance need not in any case exceed 6 inches (15.24 
cm) on each side. Overhead rope drive and block and roller-chain-drive 
guards shall be not less than 6 inches (15.24 cm) wider than the drive 
on each side. In overhead silent chain-drive guards where the chain is 
held from lateral displacement on the sprockets, the side clearances 
required on drives of 20 inch

(50.8 cm) centers or under shall be not less than \1/4\ inch (0.635 cm) 
from the nearest moving chain part, and on drives of over 20 inch (50.8 
cm) centers a minimum of \1/2\ inch (1.27 cm) from the nearest moving 
chain part.
    (4) Guards for horizontal overhead rope and chain drives. Overhead-
rope and chain-drive guard construction shall conform to the rules for 
overhead-belt guard.
    (5) Guardrails and toeboards. (i) Guardrail shall be 42 inches 
(106.68 cm) in height, with midrail between top rail and floor.
    (ii) Posts shall be not more than 8 feet (2.432 m) apart; they are 
to be permanent and substantial, smooth, and free from protruding nails, 
bolts, and splinters. If made of pipe, the post shall be 1\1/4\ inches 
(3.175 cm) inside diameter, or larger. If made of metal shapes or bars, 
their section shall be equal in strength to that of 1\1/2\ (3.81 cm) by

shall be two by four (2  x  4) inches or larger. The upper rail shall be 
two by four (2  x  4) inches, or two one by four (1  x  4) strips, one 
at the top and one at the side of posts. The midrail may be one by four 
(1  x  4) inches or more. Where panels are fitted with expanded metal or 
wire mesh as noted in Table O-12 the middle rails may be omitted. Where 
guard is exposed to contact with moving equipment, additional strength 
may be necessary.
    (iii) Toeboards shall be 4 inches (10.16 cm) or more in height, of 
wood, metal, or of metal grill not exceeding 1 inch (2.54 cm) mesh.
    (p) Care of equipment--(1) General. All power-transmission equipment 
shall be inspected at intervals not exceeding 60 days and be kept in 
good working condition at all times.
    (2) Shafting. (i) Shafting shall be kept in alignment, free from 
rust and excess oil or grease.
    (ii) Where explosives, explosive dusts, flammable vapors or 
flammable liquids exist, the hazard of static sparks from shafting shall 
be carefully considered.
    (3) Bearings. Bearings shall be kept in alignment and properly 
adjusted.

<R05>
Sec. 1926.350  Gas welding and cutting.

    (a) Transporting, moving, and storing compressed gas cylinders. (1) 
Valve protection caps shall be in place and secured.
    (2) When cylinders are hoisted, they shall be secured on a cradle, 
slingboard, or pallet. They shall not be hoisted or transported by means 
of magnets or choker slings.
    (3) Cylinders shall be moved by tilting and rolling them on their 
bottom edges. They shall not be intentionally dropped, struck, or 
permitted to strike each other violently.
    (4) When cylinders are transported by powered vehicles, they shall 
be secured in a vertical position.
    (5) Valve protection caps shall not be used for lifting cylinders 
from one vertical position to another. Bars shall not be used under 
valves or valve protection caps to pry cylinders loose when frozen. 
Warm, not boiling, water shall be used to thaw cylinders loose.
    (6) Unless cylinders are firmly secured on a special carrier 
intended for this purpose, regulators shall be removed and valve 
protection caps put in place before cylinders are moved.
    (7) A suitable cylinder truck, chain, or other steadying device 
shall be used

[[Page 243]]

to keep cylinders from being knocked over while in use.
    (8) When work is finished, when cylinders are empty, or when 
cylinders are moved at any time, the cylinder valve shall be closed.
    (9) Compressed gas cylinders shall be secured in an upright position 
at all times except, if necessary, for short periods of time while 
cylinders are actually being hoisted or carried.
    (10) Oxygen cylinders in storage shall be separated from fuel-gas 
cylinders or combustible materials (especially oil or grease), a minimum 
distance of 20 feet (6.1 m) or by a noncombustible barrier at least 5 
feet (1.5 m) high having a fire-resistance rating of at least one-half 
hour.
    (11) Inside of buildings, cylinders shall be stored in a well-
protected, well-ventilated, dry location, at least 20 feet (6.1 m) from 
highly combustible materials such as oil or excelsior. Cylinders should 
be stored in definitely assigned places away from elevators, stairs, or 
gangways. Assigned storage places shall be located where cylinders will 
not be knocked over or damaged by passing or falling objects, or subject 
to tampering by unauthorized persons. Cylinders shall not be kept in 
unventilated enclosures such as lockers and cupboards.
    (12) The in-plant handling, storage, and utilization of all 
compressed gases in cylinders, portable tanks, rail tankcars, or motor 
vehicle cargo tanks shall be in accordance with Compressed Gas 
Association Pamphlet P-1-1965.
    (b) Placing cylinders. (1) Cylinders shall be kept far enough away 
from the actual welding or cutting operation so that sparks, hot slag, 
or flame will not reach them. When this is impractical, fire resistant 
shields shall be provided.
    (2) Cylinders shall be placed where they cannot become part of an 
electrical circuit. Electrodes shall not be struck against a cylinder to 
strike an arc.
    (3) Fuel gas cylinders shall be placed with valve end up whenever 
they are in use. They shall not be placed in a location where they would 
be subject to open flame, hot metal, or other sources of artificial 
heat.
    (4) Cylinders containing oxygen or acetylene or other fuel gas shall 
not be taken into confined spaces.
    (c) Treatment of cylinders. (1) Cylinders, whether full or empty, 
shall not be used as rollers or supports.
    (2) No person other than the gas supplier shall attempt to mix gases 
in a cylinder. No one except the owner of the cylinder or person 
authorized by him, shall refill a cylinder. No one shall use a 
cylinder's contents for purposes other than those intended by the 
supplier. All cylinders used shall meet the Department of Transportation 
requirements published in 49 CFR part 178, subpart C, Specification for 
Cylinders.
    (3) No damaged or defective cylinder shall be used.
    (d) Use of fuel gas. The employer shall thoroughly instruct 
employees in the safe use of fuel gas, as follows:
    (1) Before a regulator to a cylinder valve is connected, the valve 
shall be opened slightly and closed immediately. (This action is 
generally termed ``cracking'' and is intended to clear the valve of dust 
or dirt that might otherwise enter the regulator.) The person cracking 
the valve shall stand to one side of the outlet, not in front of it. The 
valve of a fuel gas cylinder shall not be cracked where the gas would 
reach welding work, sparks, flame, or other possible sources of 
ignition.
    (2) The cylinder valve shall always be opened slowly to prevent 
damage to the regulator. For quick closing, valves on fuel gas cylinders 
shall not be opened more than 1\1/2\ turns. When a special wrench is 
required, it shall be left in position on the stem of the valve while 
the cylinder is in use so that the fuel gas flow can be shut off quickly 
in case of an emergency. In the case of manifolded or coupled cylinders, 
at least one such wrench shall always be available for immediate use. 
Nothing shall be placed on top of a fuel gas cylinder, when in use, 
which may damage the safety device or interfere with the quick closing 
of the valve.
    (3) Fuel gas shall not be used from cylinders through torches or 
other devices which are equipped with shutoff valves without reducing 
the pressure

[[Page 244]]

through a suitable regulator attached to the cylinder valve or manifold.
    (4) Before a regulator is removed from a cylinder valve, the 
cylinder valve shall always be closed and the gas released from the 
regulator.
    (5) If, when the valve on a fuel gas cylinder is opened, there is 
found to be a leak around the valve stem, the valve shall be closed and 
the gland nut tightened. If this action does not stop the leak, the use 
of the cylinder shall be discontinued, and it shall be properly tagged 
and removed from the work area. In the event that fuel gas should leak 
from the cylinder valve, rather than from the valve stem, and the gas 
cannot be shut off, the cylinder shall be properly tagged and removed 
from the work area. If a regulator attached to a cylinder valve will 
effectively stop a leak through the valve seat, the cylinder need not be 
removed from the work area.
    (6) If a leak should develop at a fuse plug or other safety device, 
the cylinder shall be removed from the work area.
    (e) Fuel gas and oxygen manifolds. (1) Fuel gas and oxygen manifolds 
shall bear the name of the substance they contain in letters at least 1-
inch high which shall be either painted on the manifold or on a sign 
permanently attached to it.
    (2) Fuel gas and oxygen manifolds shall be placed in safe, well 
ventilated, and accessible locations. They shall not be located within 
enclosed spaces.
    (3) Manifold hose connections, including both ends of the supply 
hose that lead to the manifold, shall be such that the hose cannot be 
interchanged between fuel gas and oxygen manifolds and supply header 
connections. Adapters shall not be used to permit the interchange of 
hose. Hose connections shall be kept free of grease and oil.
    (4) When not in use, manifold and header hose connections shall be 
capped.
    (5) Nothing shall be placed on top of a manifold, when in use, which 
will damage the manifold or interfere with the quick closing of the 
valves.
    (f) Hose. (1) Fuel gas hose and oxygen hose shall be easily 
distinguishable from each other. The contrast may be made by different 
colors or by surface characteristics readily distinguishable by the 
sense of touch. Oxygen and fuel gas hoses shall not be interchangeable. 
A single hose having more than one gas passage shall not be used.
    (2) When parallel sections of oxygen and fuel gas hose are taped 
together, not more than 4 inches out of 12 inches shall be covered by 
tape.
    (3) All hose in use, carrying acetylene, oxygen, natural or 
manufactured fuel gas, or any gas or substance which may ignite or enter 
into combustion, or be in any way harmful to employees, shall be 
inspected at the beginning of each working shift. Defective hose shall 
be removed from service.
    (4) Hose which has been subject to flashback, or which shows 
evidence of severe wear or damage, shall be tested to twice the normal 
pressure to which it is subject, but in no case less than 300 p.s.i. 
Defective hose, or hose in doubtful condition, shall not be used.
    (5) Hose couplings shall be of the type that cannot be unlocked or 
disconnected by means of a straight pull without rotary motion.
    (6) Boxes used for the storage of gas hose shall be ventilated.
    (7) Hoses, cables, and other equipment shall be kept clear of 
passageways, ladders and stairs.
    (g) Torches. (1) Clogged torch tip openings shall be cleaned with 
suitable cleaning wires, drills, or other devices designed for such 
purpose.
    (2) Torches in use shall be inspected at the beginning of each 
working shift for leaking shutoff valves, hose couplings, and tip 
connections. Defective torches shall not be used.
    (3) Torches shall be lighted by friction lighters or other approved 
devices, and not by matches or from hot work.
    (h) Regulators and gauges. Oxygen and fuel gas pressure regulators, 
including their related gauges, shall be in proper working order while 
in use.
    (i) Oil and grease hazards. Oxygen cylinders and fittings shall be 
kept away from oil or grease. Cylinders, cylinder caps and valves, 
couplings, regulators, hose, and apparatus shall be kept free from oil 
or greasy substances and shall not be handled with oily hands or gloves. 
Oxygen shall not be directed at oily surfaces, greasy clothes, or within

[[Page 245]]

a fuel oil or other storage tank or vessel.
    (j) Additional rules. For additional details not covered in this 
subpart, applicable technical portions of American National Standards 
Institute, Z49.1-1967, Safety in Welding and Cutting, shall apply.

FR 42328, Oct. 18, 1990; 58 FR 35179, June 30, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 1926.351  Arc welding and cutting.

    (a) Manual electrode holders. (1) Only manual electrode holders 
which are specifically designed for arc welding and cutting, and are of 
a capacity capable of safely handling the maximum rated current required 
by the electrodes, shall be used.
    (2) Any current-carrying parts passing through the portion of the 
holder which the arc welder or cutter grips in his hand, and the outer 
surfaces of the jaws of the holder, shall be fully insulated against the 
maximum voltage encountered to ground.
    (b) Welding cables and connectors. (1) All arc welding and cutting 
cables shall be of the completely insulated, flexible type, capable of 
handling the maximum current requirements of the work in progress, 
taking into account the duty cycle under which the arc welder or cutter 
is working.
    (2) Only cable free from repair or splices for a minimum distance of 
10 feet from the cable end to which the electrode holder is connected 
shall be used, except that cables with standard insulated connectors or 
with splices whose insulating quality is equal to that of the cable are 
permitted.
    (3) When it becomes necessary to connect or splice lengths of cable 
one to another, substantial insulated connectors of a capacity at least 
equivalent to that of the cable shall be used. If connections are 
effected by means of cable lugs, they shall be securely fastened 
together to give good electrical contact, and the exposed metal parts of 
the lugs shall be completely insulated.
    (4) Cables in need of repair shall not be used. When a cable, other 
than the cable lead referred to in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
becomes worn to the extent of exposing bare conductors, the portion thus 
exposed shall be protected by means of rubber and friction tape or other 
equivalent insulation.
    (c) Ground returns and machine grounding. (1) A ground return cable 
shall have a safe current carrying capacity equal to or exceeding the 
specified maximum output capacity of the arc welding or cutting unit 
which it services. When a single ground return cable services more than 
one unit, its safe current-carrying capacity shall equal or exceed the 
total specified maximum output capacities of all the units which it 
services.
    (2) Pipelines containing gases or flammable liquids, or conduits 
containing electrical circuits, shall not be used as a ground return. 
For welding on natural gas pipelines, the technical portions of 
regulations issued by the Department of Transportation, Office of 
Pipeline Safety, 49 CFR Part 192, Minimum Federal Safety Standards for 
Gas Pipelines, shall apply.
    (3) When a structure or pipeline is employed as a ground return 
circuit, it shall be determined that the required electrical contact 
exists at all joints. The generation of an arc, sparks, or heat at any 
point shall cause rejection of the structures as a ground circuit.
    (4) When a structure or pipeline is continuously employed as a 
ground return circuit, all joints shall be bonded, and periodic 
inspections shall be conducted to ensure that no condition of 
electrolysis or fire hazard exists by virtue of such use.
    (5) The frames of all arc welding and cutting machines shall be 
grounded either through a third wire in the cable containing the circuit 
conductor or through a separate wire which is grounded at the source of 
the current. Grounding circuits, other than by means of the structure, 
shall be checked to ensure that the circuit between the ground and the 
grounded power conductor has resistance low enough to permit sufficient 
current to flow to cause the fuse or circuit breaker to interrupt the 
current.
    (6) All ground connections shall be inspected to ensure that they 
are mechanically strong and electrically adequate for the required 
current.
    (d) Operating instructions. Employers shall instruct employees in 
the safe

[[Page 246]]

means of arc welding and cutting as follows:
    (1) When electrode holders are to be left unattended, the electrodes 
shall be removed and the holders shall be so placed or protected that 
they cannot make electrical contact with employees or conducting 
objects.
    (2) Hot electrode holders shall not be dipped in water; to do so may 
expose the arc welder or cutter to electric shock.
    (3) When the arc welder or cutter has occasion to leave his work or 
to stop work for any appreciable length of time, or when the arc welding 
or cutting machine is to be moved, the power supply switch to the 
equipment shall be opened.
    (4) Any faulty or defective equipment shall be reported to the 
supervisor.
    (5) See Sec. 1926.406(c) for additional requirements.
    (e) Shielding. Whenever practicable, all arc welding and cutting 
operations shall be shielded by noncombustible or flameproof screens 
which will protect employees and other persons working in the vicinity 
from the direct rays of the arc.
[44 FR 8577, Feb. 9, 1979; 44 FR 20940, Apr. 6, 1979, as amended at 51 
FR 25318, July 11, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 1926.352  Fire prevention.

    (a) When practical, objects to be welded, cut, or heated shall be 
moved to a designated safe location or, if the objects to be welded, 
cut, or heated cannot be readily moved, all movable fire hazards in the 
vicinity shall be taken to a safe place, or otherwise protected.
    (b) If the object to be welded, cut, or heated cannot be moved and 
if all the fire hazards cannot be removed, positive means shall be taken 
to confine the heat, sparks, and slag, and to protect the immovable fire 
hazards from them.
    (c) No welding, cutting, or heating shall be done where the 
application of flammable paints, or the presence of other flammable 
compounds, or heavy dust concentrations creates a hazard.
    (d) Suitable fire extinguishing equipment shall be immediately 
available in the work area and shall be maintained in a state of 
readiness for instant use.
    (e) When the welding, cutting, or heating operation is such that 
normal fire prevention precautions are not sufficient, additional 
personnel shall be assigned to guard against fire while the actual 
welding, cutting, or heating operation is being performed, and for a 
sufficient period of time after completion of the work to ensure that no 
possibility of fire exists. Such personnel shall be instructed as to the 
specific anticipated fire hazards and how the firefighting equipment 
provided is to be used.
    (f) When welding, cutting, or heating is performed on walls, floors, 
and ceilings, since direct penetration of sparks or heat transfer may 
introduce a fire hazard to an adjacent area, the same precautions shall 
be taken on the opposite side as are taken on the side on which the 
welding is being performed.
    (g) For the elimination of possible fire in enclosed spaces as a 
result of gas escaping through leaking or improperly closed torch 
valves, the gas supply to the torch shall be positively shut off at some 
point outside the enclosed space whenever the torch is not to be used or 
whenever the torch is left unattended for a substantial period of time, 
such as during the lunch period. Overnight and at the change of shifts, 
the torch and hose shall be removed from the confined space. Open end 
fuel gas and oxygen hoses shall be immediately removed from enclosed 
spaces when they are disconnected from the torch or other gas-consuming 
device.
    (h) Except when the contents are being removed or transferred, 
drums, pails, and other containers which contain or have contained 
flammable liquids shall be kept closed. Empty containers shall be 
removed to a safe area apart from hot work operations or open flames.
    (i) Drums containers, or hollow structures which have contained 
toxic or flammable substances shall, before welding, cutting, or heating 
is undertaken on them, either be filled with water or thoroughly cleaned 
of such substances and ventilated and tested. For welding, cutting and 
heating on steel pipelines containing natural gas, the pertinent 
portions of regulations issued by the Department of Transportation, 
Office of Pipeline Safety, 49

[[Page 247]]

CFR Part 192, Minimum Federal Safety Standards for Gas Pipelines, shall 
apply.
    (j) Before heat is applied to a drum, container, or hollow 
structure, a vent or opening shall be provided for the release of any 
built-up pressure during the application of heat.

Sec. 1926.353  Ventilation and protection in welding, cutting, and heating.

    (a) Mechanical ventilation. For purposes of this section, mechanical 
ventilation shall meet the following requirements:
    (1) Mechanical ventilation shall consist of either general 
mechanical ventilation systems or local exhaust systems.
    (2) General mechanical ventilation shall be of sufficient capacity 
and so arranged as to produce the number of air changes necessary to 
maintain welding fumes and smoke within safe limits, as defined in 
subpart D of this part.
    (3) Local exhaust ventilation shall consist of freely movable hoods 
intended to be placed by the welder or burner as close as practicable to 
the work. This system shall be of sufficient capacity and so arranged as 
to remove fumes and smoke at the source and keep the concentration of 
them in the breathing zone within safe limits as defined in subpart D of 
this part.
    (4) Contaminated air exhausted from a working space shall be 
discharged into the open air or otherwise clear of the source of intake 
air.
    (5) All air replacing that withdrawn shall be clean and respirable.
    (6) Oxygen shall not be used for ventilation purposes, comfort 
cooling, blowing dust from clothing, or for cleaning the work area.
    (b) Welding, cutting, and heating in confined spaces. (1) Except as 
provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section, either general mechanical or local exhaust ventilation 
meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section shall be 
provided whenever welding, cutting, or heating is performed in a 
confined space.
    (2) When sufficient ventilation cannot be obtained without blocking 
the means of access, employees in the confined space shall be protected 
by air line respirators in accordance with the requirements of subpart E 
of this part, and an employee on the outside of such a confined space 
shall be assigned to maintain communication with those working within it 
and to aid them in an emergency.
    (3) Lifelines. Where a welder must enter a confined space through a 
manhole or other small opening, means shall be provided for quickly 
removing him in case of emergency. When safety belts and lifelines are 
used for this purpose they shall be so attached to the welder's body 
that his body cannot be jammed in a small exit opening. An attendant 
with a pre-planned rescue procedure shall be stationed outside to 
observe the welder at all times and be capable of putting rescue 
operations into effect.
    (c) Welding, cutting, or heating of metals of toxic significance. 
(1) Welding, cutting, or heating in any enclosed spaces involving the 
metals specified in this subparagraph shall be performed with either 
general mechanical or local exhaust ventilation meeting the requirements 
of paragraph (a) of this section:
    (i) Zinc-bearing base or filler metals or metals coated with zinc-
bearing materials;
    (ii) Lead base metals;
    (iii) Cadmium-bearing filler materials;
    (iv) Chromium-bearing metals or metals coated with chromium-bearing 
materials.
    (2) Welding, cutting, or heating in any enclosed spaces involving 
the metals specified in this subparagraph shall be performed with local 
exhaust ventilation in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a) 
of this section, or employees shall be protected by air line respirators 
in accordance with the requirements of subpart E of this part:
    (i) Metals containing lead, other than as an impurity, or metals 
coated with lead-bearing materials;
    (ii) Cadmium-bearing or cadmium-coated base metals;
    (iii) Metals coated with mercury-bearing metals;
    (iv) Beryllium-containing base or filler metals. Because of its high 
toxicity, work involving beryllium shall

[[Page 248]]

be done with both local exhaust ventilation and air line respirators.
    (3) Employees performing such operations in the open air shall be 
protected by filter-type respirators in accordance with the requirements 
of subpart E of this part, except that employees performing such 
operations on beryllium-containing base or filler metals shall be 
protected by air line respirators in accordance with the requirements of 
subpart E of this part.
    (4) Other employees exposed to the same atmosphere as the welders or 
burners shall be protected in the same manner as the welder or burner.
    (d) Inert-gas metal-arc welding. (1) Since the inert-gas metal-arc 
welding process involves the production of ultra-violet radiation of 
intensities of 5 to 30 times that produced during shielded metal-arc 
welding, the decomposition of chlorinated solvents by ultraviolet rays, 
and the liberation of toxic fumes and gases, employees shall not be 
permitted to engage in, or be exposed to the process until the following 
special precautions have been taken:
    (i) The use of chlorinated solvents shall be kept at least 200 feet, 
unless shielded, from the exposed arc, and surfaces prepared with 
chlorinated solvents shall be thoroughly dry before welding is permitted 
on such surfaces.
    (ii) Employees in the area not protected from the arc by screening 
shall be protected by filter lenses meeting the requirements of subpart 
E of this part. When two or more welders are exposed to each other's 
arc, filter lens goggles of a suitable type, meeting the requirements of 
subpart E of this part, shall be worn under welding helmets. Hand 
shields to protect the welder against flashes and radiant energy shall 
be used when either the helmet is lifted or the shield is removed.
    (iii) Welders and other employees who are exposed to radiation shall 
be suitably protected so that the skin is covered completely to prevent 
burns and other damage by ultraviolet rays. Welding helmets and hand 
shields shall be free of leaks and openings, and free of highly 
reflective surfaces.
    (iv) When inert-gas metal-arc welding is being performed on 
stainless steel, the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section 
shall be met to protect against dangerous concentrations of nitrogen 
dioxide.
    (e) General welding, cutting, and heating. (1) Welding, cutting, and 
heating, not involving conditions or materials described in paragraph 
(b), (c), or (d) of this section, may normally be done without 
mechanical ventilation or respiratory protective equipment, but where, 
because of unusual physical or atmospheric conditions, an unsafe 
accumulation of contaminants exists, suitable mechanical ventilation or 
respiratory protective equipment shall be provided.
    (2) Employees performing any type of welding, cutting, or heating 
shall be protected by suitable eye protective equipment in accordance 
with the requirements of subpart E of this part.

Sec. 1926.354  Welding, cutting, and heating in way of preservative coatings.

    (a) Before welding, cutting, or heating is commenced on any surface 
covered by a preservative coating whose flammability is not known, a 
test shall be made by a competent person to determine its flammability. 
Preservative coatings shall be considered to be highly flammable when 
scrapings burn with extreme rapidity.
    (b) Precautions shall be taken to prevent ignition of highly 
flammable hardened preservative coatings. When coatings are determined 
to be highly flammable, they shall be stripped from the area to be 
heated to prevent ignition.
    (c) Protection against toxic preservative coatings: (1) In enclosed 
spaces, all surfaces covered with toxic preservatives shall be stripped 
of all toxic coatings for a distance of at least 4 inches from the area 
of heat application, or the employees shall be protected by air line 
respirators, meeting the requirements of subpart E of this part.
    (2) In the open air, employees shall be protected by a respirator, 
in accordance with requirements of subpart E of this part.
    (d) The preservative coatings shall be removed a sufficient distance 
from the area to be heated to ensure that the temperature of the 
unstripped metal

[[Page 249]]

will not be appreciably raised. Artificial cooling of the metal 
surrounding the heating area may be used to limit the size of the area 
required to be cleaned.

<R05>
Sec. 1926.401  [Reserved]

                    Installation Safety Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 1926.402  Applicability.

    (a) Covered. Sections 1926.402 through 1926.408 contain installation 
safety requirements for electrical equipment and installations used to 
provide electric power and light at the jobsite. These sections apply to 
installations, both temporary and permanent, used on the jobsite; but 
these sections do not apply to existing permanent installations that 
were in place before the construction activity commenced.

    Note: If the electrical installation is made in accordance with the 
National Electrical Code ANSI/NFPA 70-1984, exclusive of Formal 
Interpretations and Tentative Interim Amendments, it will be deemed to 
be in compliance with Secs. 1926.403 through 1926.408, except for 
Secs. 1926.404(b)(1) and 1926.405(a)(2)(ii) (E), (F), (G), and (J).


    (b) Not covered. Sections 1926.402 through 1926.408 do not cover 
installations used for the generation, transmission, and distribution of 
electric energy, including related communication, metering, control, and 
transformation installations. (However, these regulations do cover 
portable and vehicle-mounted generators used to provide power for 
equipment used at the jobsite.) See subpart V of this part for the 
construction of power distribution and transmission lines.

surfaces shall be installed so that room air flow over such surfaces is 
not prevented by walls or by adjacent installed equipment. For equipment 
designed for floor mounting, clearance between top surfaces and adjacent 
surfaces shall be provided to dissipate rising warm air. Electrical 
equipment provided with ventilating openings shall be installed so that 
walls or other obstructions do not prevent the free circulation of air 
through the equipment.
    (e) Splices. Conductors shall be spliced or joined with splicing 
devices designed for the use or by brazing, welding, or soldering with a 
fusible metal or alloy. Soldered splices shall first be so spliced or 
joined as to be mechanically and electrically secure without solder and 
then soldered. All splices and joints and the free ends of conductors 
shall be covered with an insulation equivalent to that of the conductors 
or with an insulating device designed for the purpose.
    (f) Arcing parts. Parts of electric equipment which in ordinary 
operation produce arcs, sparks, flames, or molten metal shall be 
enclosed or separated and isolated from all combustible material.
    (g) Marking. Electrical equipment shall not be used unless the 
manufacturer's name, trademark, or other descriptive marking by which 
the organization responsible for the product may be identified is placed 
on the equipment and unless other markings are provided giving voltage, 
current, wattage, or other ratings as necessary. The marking shall be of 
sufficient durability to withstand the environment involved.
    (h) Identification of disconnecting means and circuits. Each 
disconnecting means required by this subpart for motors and appliances 
shall be legibly marked to indicate its purpose, unless located and 
arranged so the purpose is evident. Each service, feeder, and branch 
circuit, at its disconnecting means or overcurrent device, shall be 
legibly marked to indicate its purpose, unless located and arranged so 
the purpose is evident. These markings shall be of sufficient durability 
to withstand the environment involved.
    (i) 600 Volts, nominal, or less. This paragraph applies to equipment 
operating at 600 volts, nominal, or less.
    (1) Working space about electric equipment. Sufficient access and 
working space shall be provided and maintained about all electric 
equipment to permit ready and safe operation and maintenance of such 
equipment.
    (i) Working clearances. Except as required or permitted elsewhere in 
this subpart, the dimension of the working space in the direction of 
access to live parts operating at 600 volts or less and likely to 
require examination, adjustment, servicing, or maintenance while alive 
shall not be less than indicated in Table K-1. In addition to the 
dimensions shown in Table K-1, workspace shall not be less than 30 
inches (762 mm) wide in front of the electric equipment. Distances shall 
be measured from the live parts if they are exposed, or from the 
enclosure front or opening if the live parts are enclosed. Walls 
constructed of concrete, brick, or tile are considered to be grounded.

protection, overcurrent devices shall not interrupt the continuity of 
the grounded conductor unless all conductors of the circuit are opened 
simultaneously.
    (iii) Disconnection of fuses and thermal cutouts. Except for devices 
provided for current-limiting on the supply side of the service 
disconnecting means, all cartridge fuses which are accessible to other 
than qualified persons and all fuses and thermal cutouts on circuits 
over 150 volts to ground shall be provided with disconnecting means. 
This disconnecting means shall be installed so that the fuse or thermal 
cutout can be disconnected from its supply without disrupting service to 
equipment and circuits unrelated to those protected by the overcurrent 
device.
    (iv) Location in or on premises. Overcurrent devices shall be 
readily accessible. Overcurrent devices shall not be located where they

Sec. 1926.407  Hazardous (classified) locations.

    (a) Scope. This section sets forth requirements for electric 
equipment and wiring in locations which are classified depending on the 
properties of the flammable vapors, liquids or gases, or combustible 
dusts or fibers which may be present therein and the likelihood that a 
flammable or combustible concentration or quantity is present. Each 
room, section or area shall be considered individually in determining 
its classification. These hazardous (classified) locations are assigned 
six designations as follows:

Class I, Division 1
Class I, Division 2
Class II, Division 1
Class II, Division 2
Class III, Division l
Class III, Division 2

    For definitions of these locations see Sec. 1926.449. All applicable 
requirements in this subpart apply to all hazardous (classified) 
locations, unless modified by provisions of this section.
    (b) Electrical installations. Equipment, wiring methods, and 
installations of equipment in hazardous (classified) locations shall be 
approved as intrinsically safe or approved for the hazardous 
(classified) location or safe for the hazardous (classified) location. 
Requirements for each of these options are as follows:
    (1) Intrinsically safe. Equipment and associated wiring approved as 
intrinsically safe is permitted in any hazardous (classified) location 
included in its listing or labeling.
    (2) Approved for the hazardous (classified) location--(i) General. 
Equipment shall be approved not only for the class of location but also 
for the ignitible or combustible properties of the specific

[[Page 266]]

gas, vapor, dust, or fiber that will be present.

    Note: NFPA 70, the National Electrical Code, lists or defines 
hazardous gases, vapors, and dusts by ``Groups'' characterized by their 
ignitible or combustible properties.


    (ii) Marking. Equipment shall not be used unless it is marked to 
show the class, group, and operating temperature or temperature range, 
based on operation in a 40-degree C ambient, for which it is approved. 
The temperature marking shall not exceed the ignition temperature of the 
specific gas, vapor, or dust to be encountered. However, the following 
provisions modify this marking requirement for specific equipment:
    (A) Equipment of the non-heat-producing type (such as junction 
boxes, conduit, and fitting) and equipment of the heat-producing type 
having a maximum temperature of not more than 100 degrees C (212 degrees 
F) need not have a marked operating temperature or temperature range.
    (B) Fixed lighting fixtures marked for use only in Class I, Division 
2 locations need not be marked to indicate the group.
    (C) Fixed general-purpose equipment in Class I locations, other than 
lighting fixtures, which is acceptable for use in Class I, Division 2 
locations need not be marked with the class, group, division, or 
operating temperature.
    (D) Fixed dust-tight equipment, other than lighting fixtures, which 
is acceptable for use in Class II, Division 2 and Class III locations 
need not be marked with the class, group, division, or operating 
temperature.
    (3) Safe for the hazardous (classified) location. Equipment which is 
safe for the location shall be of a type and design which the employer 
demonstrates will provide protection from the hazards arising from the 
combustibility and flammability of vapors, liquids, gases, dusts, or 
fibers.

    Note: The National Electrical Code, NFPA 70, contains guidelines for 
determining the type and design of equipment and installations which 
will meet this requirement. The guidelines of this document address 
electric wiring, equipment, and systems installed in hazardous 
(classified) locations and contain specific provisions for the 
following: wiring methods, wiring connections, conductor insulation, 
flexible cords, sealing and drainage, transformers, capacitors, 
switches, circuit breakers, fuses, motor controllers, receptacles, 
attachment plugs, meters, relays, instruments, resistors, generators, 
motors, lighting fixtures, storage battery charging equipment, electric 
cranes, electric hoists and similar equipment, utilization equipment, 
signaling systems, alarm systems, remote control systems, local loud 
speaker and communication systems, ventilation piping, live parts, 
lightning surge protection, and grounding. Compliance with these 
guidelines will constitute one means, but not the only means, of 
compliance with this paragraph.


    (c) Conduits. All conduits shall be threaded and shall be made 
wrench-tight. Where it is impractical to make a threaded joint tight, a 
bonding jumper shall be utilized.

    Class I locations. Class I locations are those in which flammable 
gases or vapors are or may be present in the air in quantities 
sufficient to produce explosive or ignitible mixtures. Class I locations 
include the following:
    (a) Class I, Division 1. A Class I, Division 1 location is a 
location:

[[Page 272]]

    (1) In which ignitible concentrations of flammable gases or vapors 
may exist under normal operating conditions; or
    (2) In which ignitible concentrations of such gases or vapors may 
exist frequently because of repair or maintenance operations or because 
of leakage; or
    (3) In which breakdown or faulty operation of equipment or processes 
might release ignitible concentrations of flammable gases or vapors, and 
might also cause simultaneous failure of electric equipment.

    Note: This classification usually includes locations where volatile 
flammable liquids or liquefied flammable gases are transferred from one 
container to another; interiors of spray booths and areas in the 
vicinity of spraying and painting operations where volatile flammable 
solvents are used; locations containing open tanks or vats of volatile 
flammable liquids; drying rooms or compartments for the evaporation of 
flammable solvents; inadequately ventilated pump rooms for flammable gas 
or for volatile flammable liquids; and all other locations where 
ignitible concentrations of flammable vapors or gases are likely to 
occur in the course of normal operations.


    (b) Class I, Division 2. A Class I, Division 2 location is a 
location:
    (1) In which volatile flammable liquids or flammable gases are 
handled, processed, or used, but in which the hazardous liquids, vapors, 
or gases will normally be confined within closed containers or closed 
systems from which they can escape only in case of accidental rupture or 
breakdown of such containers or systems, or in case of abnormal 
operation of equipment; or
    (2) In which ignitible concentrations of gases or vapors are 
normally prevented by positive mechanical ventilation, and which might 
become hazardous through failure or abnormal operations of the 
ventilating equipment; or
    (3) That is adjacent to a Class I, Division 1 location, and to which 
ignitible concentrations of gases or vapors might occasionally be 
communicated unless such communication is prevented by adequate 
positive-pressure ventilation from a source of clean air, and effective 
safeguards against ventilation failure are provided.

    Note: This classification usually includes locations where volatile 
flammable liquids or flammable gases or vapors are used, but which would 
become hazardous only in case of an accident or of some unusual 
operating condition. The quantity of flammable material that might 
escape in case of accident, the adequacy of ventilating equipment, the 
total area involved, and the record of the industry or business with 
respect to explosions or fires are all factors that merit consideration 
in determining the classification and extent of each location.
    Piping without valves, checks, meters, and similar devices would not 
ordinarily introduce a hazardous condition even though used for 
flammable liquids or gases. Locations used for the storage of flammable 
liquids or of liquefied or compressed gases in sealed containers would 
not normally be considered hazardous unless also subject to other 
hazardous conditions.

    Electrical conduits and their associated enclosures separated from 
process fluids by a single seal or barrier are classed as a Division 2 
location if the outside of the conduit and enclosures is a nonhazardous 
location.


    Class II locations. Class II locations are those that are hazardous 
because of the presence of combustible dust. Class II locations include 
the following:
    (a) Class II, Division 1. A Class II, Division 1 location is a 
location:
    (1) In which combustible dust is or may be in suspension in the air 
under normal operating conditions, in quantities sufficient to produce 
explosive or ignitible mixtures; or
    (2) Where mechanical failure or abnormal operation of machinery or 
equipment might cause such explosive or ignitible mixtures to be 
produced, and might also provide a source of ignition through 
simultaneous failure of electric equipment, operation of protection 
devices, or from other causes, or
    (3) In which combustible dusts of an electrically conductive nature 
may be present.

    Note: Combustible dusts which are electrically nonconductive include 
dusts produced in the handling and processing of grain and grain 
products, pulverized sugar and cocoa, dried egg and milk powders, 
pulverized spices, starch and pastes, potato and woodflour, oil meal 
from beans and seed, dried hay, and other organic materials which may 
produce combustible dusts when processed or handled. Dusts containing 
magnesium or aluminum are particularly hazardous and the use of extreme 
caution is necessary to avoid ignition and explosion.



[[Page 273]]


    (b) Class II, Division 2. A Class II, Division 2 location is a 
location in which:
    (1) Combustible dust will not normally be in suspension in the air 
in quantities sufficient to produce explosive or ignitible mixtures, and 
dust accumulations are normally insufficient to interfere with the 
normal operation of electrical equipment or other apparatus; or
    (2) Dust may be in suspension in the air as a result of infrequent 
malfunctioning of handling or processing equipment, and dust 
accumulations resulting therefrom may be ignitible by abnormal operation 
or failure of electrical equipment or other apparatus.

    Note: This classification includes locations where dangerous 
concentrations of suspended dust would not be likely but where dust 
accumulations might form on or in the vicinity of electric equipment. 
These areas may contain equipment from which appreciable quantities of 
dust would escape under abnormal operating conditions or be adjacent to 
a Class II Division 1 location, as described above, into which an 
explosive or ignitible concentration of dust may be put into suspension 
under abnormal operating conditions.


    Class III locations. Class III locations are those that are 
hazardous because of the presence of easily ignitible fibers or flyings 
but in which such fibers or flyings are not likely to be in suspension 
in the air in quantities sufficient to produce ignitible mixtures. Class 
111 locations include the following:
    (a) Class III, Division 1. A Class III, Division 1 location is a 
location in which easily ignitible fibers or materials producing 
combustible flyings are handled, manufactured, or used.

    Note: Easily ignitible fibers and flyings include rayon, cotton 
(including cotton linters and cotton waste), sisal or henequen, istle, 
jute, hemp, tow, cocoa fiber, oakum, baled waste kapok, Spanish moss, 
excelsior, sawdust, woodchips, and other material of similar nature.


    (b) Class III, Division 2. A Class III, Division 2 location is a 
location in which easily ignitible fibers are stored or handled, except 
in process of manufacture.

to balance adjustable suspension scaffolds, shall be capable of 
resisting at least 4 times the tipping moment imposed by the scaffold 
operating at the rated load of the hoist, or 1.5 (minimum) times the 
tipping moment imposed by the scaffold operating at the stall load of 
the hoist, whichever is greater.
    (3) Each suspension rope, including connecting hardware, used on 
non-adjustable suspension scaffolds shall be capable of supporting, 
without failure, at least 6 times the maximum intended load applied or 
transmitted to that rope.
    (4) Each suspension rope, including connecting hardware, used on 
adjustable suspension scaffolds shall be capable of supporting, without 
failure, at least 6 times the maximum intended load applied or 
transmitted to that rope with the scaffold operating at either the rated 
load of the hoist, or 2 (minimum) times the stall load of the hoist, 
whichever is greater.
    (5) The stall load of any scaffold hoist shall not exceed 3 times 
its rated load.
    (6) Scaffolds shall be designed by a qualified person and shall be 
constructed and loaded in accordance with that design. Non-mandatory 
Appendix A to this subpart contains examples of criteria that will 
enable an employer to comply with paragraph (a) of this section.
    (b) Scaffold platform construction. (1) Each platform on all working 
levels of scaffolds shall be fully planked or decked between the front 
uprights and the guardrail supports as follows:
    (i) Each platform unit (e.g., scaffold plank, fabricated plank, 
fabricated deck, or fabricated platform) shall be installed so that the 
space between adjacent units and the space between the platform and the 
uprights is no more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide, except where the employer 
can demonstrate that a wider space is necessary (for example, to fit 
around uprights when side brackets are used to extend the width of the 
platform).
    (ii) Where the employer makes the demonstration provided for in 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the platform shall be planked or 
decked as fully as possible and the remaining open space between the 
platform and the uprights shall not exceed 9\1/2\ inches (24.1 cm).
    Exception to paragraph (b)(1): The requirement in paragraph (b)(1) 
to provide full planking or decking does not apply to platforms used 
solely as walkways or solely by employees performing scaffold erection 
or dismantling. In these situations, only the planking that the employer 
establishes is necessary to provide safe working conditions is required.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) of 
this section, each scaffold platform and walkway shall be at least 18 
inches (46 cm) wide.
    (i) Each ladder jack scaffold, top plate bracket scaffold, roof 
bracket scaffold, and pump jack scaffold shall be at least 12 inches (30 
cm) wide. There is no minimum width requirement for boatswains' chairs.

    Note to paragraph (b)(2)(i): pursuant to an administrative stay 
effective November 29, 1996 and published in the Federal Register on 
November 25, 1996, the requirement in paragraph (b)(2)(i) that roof 
bracket scaffolds be at least 12 inches wide is stayed until November 
25, 1997 or until rulemaking regarding the minimum width of roof bracket 
scaffolds has been completed, whichever is later.



[[Page 283]]


    (ii) Where scaffolds must be used in areas that the employer can 
demonstrate are so narrow that platforms and walkways cannot be at least 
18 inches (46 cm) wide, such platforms and walkways shall be as wide as 
feasible, and employees on those platforms and walkways shall be 
protected from fall hazards by the use of guardrails and/or personal 
fall arrest systems.
    (3) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3) (i) and (ii) of this 
section, the front edge of all platforms shall not be more than 14 
inches (36 cm) from the face of the work, unless guardrail systems are 
erected along the front edge and/or personal fall arrest systems are 
used in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section to protect 
employees from falling.
    (i) The maximum distance from the face for outrigger scaffolds shall 
be 3 inches (8 cm);
    (ii) The maximum distance from the face for plastering and lathing 
operations shall be 18 inches (46 cm).
    (4) Each end of a platform, unless cleated or otherwise restrained 
by hooks or equivalent means, shall extend over the centerline of its 
support at least 6 inches (15 cm).
    (5)(i) Each end of a platform 10 feet or less in length shall not 
extend over its support more than 12 inches (30 cm) unless the platform 
is designed and installed so that the cantilevered portion of the 
platform is able to support employees and/or materials without tipping, 
or has guardrails which block employee access to the cantilevered end.
    (ii) Each platform greater than 10 feet in length shall not extend 
over its support more than 18 inches (46 cm), unless it is designed and 
installed so that the cantilevered portion of the platform is able to 
support employees without tipping, or has guardrails which block 
employee access to the cantilevered end.
    (6) On scaffolds where scaffold planks are abutted to create a long 
platform, each abutted end shall rest on a separate support surface. 
This provision does not preclude the use of common support members, such 
as ``T'' sections, to support abutting planks, or hook on platforms 
designed to rest on common supports.
    (7) On scaffolds where platforms are overlapped to create a long 
platform, the overlap shall occur only over supports, and shall not be 
less than 12 inches (30 cm) unless the platforms are nailed together or 
otherwise restrained to prevent movement.
    (8) At all points of a scaffold where the platform changes 
direction, such as turning a corner, any platform that rests on a bearer 
at an angle other than a right angle shall be laid first, and platforms 
which rest at right angles over the same bearer shall be laid second, on 
top of the first platform.
    (9) Wood platforms shall not be covered with opaque finishes, except 
that platform edges may be covered or marked for identification. 
Platforms may be coated periodically with wood preservatives, fire-
retardant finishes, and slip-resistant finishes; however, the coating 
may not obscure the top or bottom wood surfaces.
    (10) Scaffold components manufactured by different manufacturers 
shall not be intermixed unless the components fit together without force 
and the scaffold's structural integrity is maintained by the user. 
Scaffold components manufactured by different manufacturers shall not be 
modified in order to intermix them unless a competent person determines 
the resulting scaffold is structurally sound.
    (11) Scaffold components made of dissimilar metals shall not be used 
together unless a competent person has determined that galvanic action 
will not reduce the strength of any component to a level below that 
required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (c) Criteria for supported scaffolds. (1) Supported scaffolds with a 
height to base width (including outrigger supports, if used) ratio of 
more than four to one (4:1) shall be restrained from tipping by guying, 
tying, bracing, or equivalent means, as follows:
    (i) Guys, ties, and braces shall be installed at locations where 
horizontal members support both inner and outer legs.
    (ii) Guys, ties, and braces shall be installed according to the 
scaffold manufacturer's recommendations or at the closest horizontal 
member to the 4:1 height and be repeated vertically at locations of 
horizontal members every 20

less, and every 26 feet (7.9 m) or less thereafter for scaffolds greater 
than 3 feet (0.91 m) wide. The top guy, tie or brace of completed 
scaffolds shall be placed no further than the 4:1 height from the top. 
Such guys, ties and braces shall be installed at each end of the 
scaffold and at horizontal intervals not to exceed 30 feet (9.1 m) 
(measured from one end [not both] towards the other).
    (iii) Ties, guys, braces, or outriggers shall be used to prevent the 
tipping of supported scaffolds in all circumstances where an eccentric 
load, such as a cantilevered work platform, is applied or is transmitted 
to the scaffold.

not moved horizontally while the platform is occupied.
    (3) Supported scaffold poles, legs, posts, frames, and uprights 
shall be plumb and braced to prevent swaying and displacement.
    (d) Criteria for suspension scaffolds. (1) All suspension scaffold 
support devices, such as outrigger beams, cornice hooks, parapet clamps, 
and similar devices, shall rest on surfaces capable of supporting at 
least 4 times the load imposed on them by the scaffold operating at the 
rated load of the hoist (or at least 1.5 times the load imposed on them 
by the scaffold at the stall capacity of the hoist, whichever is 
greater).
    (2) Suspension scaffold outrigger beams, when used, shall be made of 
structural metal or equivalent strength material, and shall be 
restrained to prevent movement.
    (3) The inboard ends of suspension scaffold outrigger beams shall be 
stabilized by bolts or other direct connections to the floor or roof 
deck, or they shall have their inboard ends stabilized by 
counterweights, except masons' multi-point adjustable suspension 
scaffold outrigger beams shall not be stabilized by counterweights.
    (i) Before the scaffold is used, direct connections shall be 
evaluated by a competent person who shall confirm, based on the 
evaluation, that the supporting surfaces are capable of supporting the 
loads to be imposed. In addition, masons' multi-point adjustable 
suspension scaffold connections shall be designed by an engineer 
experienced in such scaffold design.
    (ii) Counterweights shall be made of non-flowable material. Sand, 
gravel and similar materials that can be easily dislocated shall not be

tiebacks.
    (vii) Tiebacks shall be equivalent in strength to the suspension 
ropes.
    (viii) Outrigger beams shall be placed perpendicular to its bearing 
support (usually the face of the building or structure). However, where 
the employer can demonstrate that it is not possible to place an 
outrigger beam perpendicular to the face of the building or structure 
because of obstructions that cannot be moved, the outrigger beam may be 
placed at some other angle, provided opposing angle tiebacks are used.

[[Page 285]]

    (ix) Tiebacks shall be secured to a structurally sound anchorage on 
the building or structure. Sound anchorages include structural members, 
but do not include standpipes, vents, other piping systems, or 
electrical conduit.

    (iii) Secured against movement by tiebacks installed at right angles 
to the face of the building or structure, or opposing angle tiebacks 
shall be installed and secured to a structurally sound point of 
anchorage on the building or structure. Sound points of anchorage 
include structural members, but do not include standpipes, vents, other 
piping systems, or electrical conduit.
    (iv) Tiebacks shall be equivalent in strength to the hoisting rope.
    (6) When winding drum hoists are used on a suspension scaffold, they 
shall contain not less than four wraps of the suspension rope at the 
lowest point of scaffold travel. When other types of hoists are used, 
the suspension ropes shall be long enough to allow the scaffold to be 
lowered to the level below without the rope end passing through the 
hoist, or the rope end shall be configured or provided with means to 
prevent the end from passing through the hoist.
    (7) The use of repaired wire rope as suspension rope is prohibited.
    (8) Wire suspension ropes shall not be joined together except 
through the use of eye splice thimbles connected with shackles or 
coverplates and bolts.
    (9) The load end of wire suspension ropes shall be equipped with 
proper size thimbles and secured by eyesplicing or equivalent means.
    (10) Ropes shall be inspected for defects by a competent person 
prior to each workshift and after every occurrence which could affect a 
rope's integrity. Ropes shall be replaced if any of the following 
conditions exist:
    (i) Any physical damage which impairs the function and strength of 
the rope.
    (ii) Kinks that might impair the tracking or wrapping of rope around 
the drum(s) or sheave(s).
    (iii) Six randomly distributed broken wires in one rope lay or three 
broken wires in one strand in one rope lay.
    (iv) Abrasion, corrosion, scrubbing, flattening or peening causing 
loss of more than one-third of the original diameter of the outside 
wires.
    (v) Heat damage caused by a torch or any damage caused by contact 
with electrical wires.
    (vi) Evidence that the secondary brake has been activated during an 
overspeed condition and has engaged the suspension rope.
    (11) Swaged attachments or spliced eyes on wire suspension ropes 
shall not be used unless they are made by the wire rope manufacturer or 
a qualified person.
    (12) When wire rope clips are used on suspension scaffolds:

power-operated hoists and manually operated hoists shall have a braking 
device or locking pawl which engages automatically when a hoist makes 
either of the following uncontrolled movements: an instantaneous change 
in momentum or an accelerated overspeed.
    (17) Manually operated hoists shall require a positive crank force 
to descend.
    (18) Two-point and multi-point suspension scaffolds shall be tied or 
otherwise secured to prevent them from swaying, as determined to be 
necessary based on an evaluation by a competent person. Window cleaners' 
anchors shall not be used for this purpose.
    (19) Devices whose sole function is to provide emergency escape and 
rescue shall not be used as working platforms. This provision does not 
preclude the use of systems which are designed to function both as 
suspension scaffolds and emergency systems.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Exception to paragraph (f)(6): Scaffolds and materials may be closer 
to power lines than specified above where such clearance is necessary 
for performance of work, and only after the utility company, or 
electrical system operator, has been notified of the need to work closer 
and the utility company, or electrical system operator, has deenergized 
the lines, relocated the lines, or installed protective coverings to 
prevent accidental contact with the lines.
    (7) Scaffolds shall be erected, moved, dismantled, or altered only 
under the supervision and direction of a competent person qualified in 
scaffold erection, moving, dismantling or alteration. Such activities 
shall be performed only by experienced and trained employees selected 
for such work by the competent person.
    (8) Employees shall be prohibited from working on scaffolds covered 
with snow, ice, or other slippery material except as necessary for 
removal of such materials.
    (9) Where swinging loads are being hoisted onto or near scaffolds 
such that the loads might contact the scaffold, tag lines or equivalent 
measures to control the loads shall be used.
    (10) Suspension ropes supporting adjustable suspension scaffolds 
shall be of a diameter large enough to provide sufficient surface area 
for the functioning of brake and hoist mechanisms.
    (11) Suspension ropes shall be shielded from heat-producing 
processes. When acids or other corrosive substances are used on a 
scaffold, the ropes shall be shielded, treated to protect against the 
corrosive substances, or shall be of a material that will not be damaged 
by the substance being used.
    (12) Work on or from scaffolds is prohibited during storms or high 
winds unless a competent person has determined that it is safe for 
employees to be on the scaffold and those employees are protected by a 
personal fall arrest system or wind screens. Wind screens shall not be 
used unless the scaffold is secured against the anticipated wind forces 
imposed.
    (13) Debris shall not be allowed to accumulate on platforms.
    (14) Makeshift devices, such as but not limited to boxes and 
barrels, shall not be used on top of scaffold platforms to increase the 
working level height of employees.
    (15) Ladders shall not be used on scaffolds to increase the working 
level height of employees, except on large area scaffolds where 
employers have satisfied the following criteria:
    (i) When the ladder is placed against a structure which is not a 
part of the scaffold, the scaffold shall be secured against the sideways 
thrust exerted by the ladder;
    (ii) The platform units shall be secured to the scaffold to prevent 
their movement;
    (iii) The ladder legs shall be on the same platform or other means 
shall be provided to stabilize the ladder against unequal platform 
deflection, and
    (iv) The ladder legs shall be secured to prevent them from slipping 
or being pushed off the platform.
    (16) Platforms shall not deflect more than \1/60\ of the span when 
loaded.
    (17) To reduce the possibility of welding current arcing through the 
suspension wire rope when performing welding from suspended scaffolds, 
the following precautions shall be taken, as applicable:
    (i) An insulated thimble shall be used to attach each suspension 
wire rope to its hanging support (such as cornice hook or outrigger). 
Excess suspension wire rope and any additional independent lines from 
grounding shall be insulated;
    (ii) The suspension wire rope shall be covered with insulating 
material extending at least 4 feet (1.2 m) above the hoist. If there is 
a tail line below the hoist, it shall be insulated to prevent contact 
with the platform. The portion of the tail line that hangs free below 
the scaffold shall be guided or retained, or both, so that it does not 
become grounded;
    (iii) Each hoist shall be covered with insulated protective covers;
    (iv) In addition to a work lead attachment required by the welding 
process, a grounding conductor shall be connected from the scaffold to 
the structure. The size of this conductor shall be at least the size of 
the welding process work lead, and this conductor

[[Page 291]]

shall not be in series with the welding process or the work piece;
    (v) If the scaffold grounding lead is disconnected at any time, the 
welding machine shall be shut off; and
    (vi) An active welding rod or uninsulated welding lead shall not be 
allowed to contact the scaffold or its suspension system.
    (g) Fall protection. (1) Each employee on a scaffold more than 10 
feet (3.1 m) above a lower level shall be protected from falling to that 
lower level. Paragraphs (g)(1) (i) through (vii) of this section 
establish the types of fall protection to be provided to the employees 
on each type of scaffold. Paragraph (g)(2) of this section addresses 
fall protection for scaffold erectors and dismantlers.

    Note to paragraph (g)(1): The fall protection requirements for 
employees installing suspension scaffold support systems on floors, 
roofs, and other elevated surfaces are set forth in subpart M of this 
part.


    (i) Each employee on a boatswains' chair, catenary scaffold, float 
scaffold, needle beam scaffold, or ladder jack scaffold shall be 
protected by a personal fall arrest system;
    (ii) Each employee on a single-point or two-point adjustable 
suspension scaffold shall be protected by both a personal fall arrest 
system and guardrail system;
    (iii) Each employee on a crawling board (chicken ladder) shall be 
protected by a personal fall arrest system, a guardrail system (with 
minimum 200 pound toprail capacity), or by a three-fourth inch (1.9 cm) 
diameter grabline or equivalent handhold securely fastened beside each 
crawling board;
    (iv) Each employee on a self-contained adjustable scaffold shall be 
protected by a guardrail system (with minimum 200 pound toprail 
capacity) when the platform is supported by the frame structure, and by 
both a personal fall arrest system and a guardrail system (with minimum 
200 pound toprail capacity) when the platform is supported by ropes;
    (v) Each employee on a walkway located within a scaffold shall be 
protected by a guardrail system (with minimum 200 pound toprail 
capacity) installed within 9\1/2\ inches (24.1 cm) of and along at least 
one side of the walkway.
    (vi) Each employee performing overhand bricklaying operations from a 
supported scaffold shall be protected from falling from all open sides 
and ends of the scaffold (except at the side next to the wall being 
laid) by the use of a personal fall arrest system or guardrail system 
(with minimum 200 pound toprail capacity).
    (vii) For all scaffolds not otherwise specified in paragraphs 
(g)(1)(i) through (g)(1)(vi) of this section, each employee shall be 
protected by the use of personal fall arrest systems or guardrail 
systems meeting the requirements of paragraph (g)(4) of this section.
    (2) Effective September 2, 1997, the employer shall have a competent 
person determine the feasibility and safety of providing fall protection 
for employees erecting or dismantling supported scaffolds. Employers are 
required to provide fall protection for employees erecting or 
dismantling supported scaffolds where the installation and use of such 
protection is feasible and does not create a greater hazard.
    (3) In addition to meeting the requirements of Sec. 1926.502(d), 
personal fall arrest systems used on scaffolds shall be attached by 
lanyard to a vertical lifeline, horizontal lifeline, or scaffold 
structural member. Vertical lifelines shall not be used when overhead 
components, such as overhead protection or additional platform levels, 
are part of a single-point or two-point adjustable suspension scaffold.
    (i) When vertical lifelines are used, they shall be fastened to a 
fixed safe point of anchorage, shall be independent of the scaffold, and 
shall be protected from sharp edges and abrasion. Safe points of 
anchorage include structural members of buildings, but do not include 
standpipes, vents, other piping systems, electrical conduit, outrigger 
beams, or counterweights.
    (ii) When horizontal lifelines are used, they shall be secured to 
two or more structural members of the scaffold, or they may be looped 
around both suspension and independent suspension lines (on scaffolds so 
equipped) above the hoist and brake attached to

[[Page 292]]

the end of the scaffold. Horizontal lifelines shall not be attached only 
to the suspension ropes.
    (iii) When lanyards are connected to horizontal lifelines or 
structural members on a single-point or two-point adjustable suspension 
scaffold, the scaffold shall be equipped with additional independent 
support lines and automatic locking devices capable of stopping the fall 
of the scaffold in the event one or both of the suspension ropes fail. 
The independent support lines shall be equal in number and strength to 
the suspension ropes.
    (iv) Vertical lifelines, independent support lines, and suspension 
ropes shall not be attached to each other, nor shall they be attached to 
or use the same point of anchorage, nor shall they be attached to the 
same point on the scaffold or personal fall arrest system.
    (4) Guardrail systems installed to meet the requirements of this 
section shall comply with the following provisions (guardrail systems 
built in accordance with Appendix A to this subpart will be deemed to 
meet the requirements of paragraphs (g)(4) (vii), (viii), and (ix) of 
this section):
    (i) Guardrail systems shall be installed along all open sides and 
ends of platforms. Guardrail systems shall be installed before the

above the platform surface. The top edge height on supported scaffolds 
manufactured and placed in service before January 1, 2000, and on all 
suspended scaffolds where both a guardrail and a personal fall arrest 
system are required shall be between 36 inches (0.9 m) and 45 inches 
(1.2 m). When conditions warrant, the height of the top edge may exceed 
the 45-inch height, provided the guardrail system meets all other 
criteria of paragraph (g)(4).
    (iii) When midrails, screens, mesh, intermediate vertical members, 
solid panels, or equivalent structural members are used, they shall be 
installed between the top edge of the guardrail system and the scaffold 
platform.
    (iv) When midrails are used, they shall be installed at a height 
approximately midway between the top edge of the guardrail system and 
the platform surface.
    (v) When screens and mesh are used, they shall extend from the top 
edge of the guardrail system to the scaffold platform, and along the 
entire opening between the supports.
    (vi) When intermediate members (such as balusters or additional 
rails) are used, they shall not be more than 19 inches (48 cm) apart.
    (vii) Each toprail or equivalent member of a guardrail system shall 
be capable of withstanding, without failure, a force applied in any 
downward or horizontal direction at any point along its top edge of at 
least 100 pounds (445 n) for guardrail systems installed on single-point 
adjustable suspension scaffolds or two-point adjustable suspension 
scaffolds, and at least 200 pounds (890 n) for guardrail systems 
installed on all other scaffolds.
    (viii) When the loads specified in paragraph (g)(4)(vii) of this 
section are applied in a downward direction, the top edge shall not drop 
below the height above the platform surface that is prescribed in 
paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this section.
    (ix) Midrails, screens, mesh, intermediate vertical members, solid 
panels, and equivalent structural members of a guardrail system shall be 
capable of withstanding, without failure, a force applied in any 
downward or horizontal direction at any point along the midrail or other 
member of at least 75 pounds (333 n) for guardrail systems with a 
minimum 100 pound toprail capacity, and at least 150 pounds (666 n) for 
guardrail systems with a minimum 200 pound toprail capacity.
    (x) Suspension scaffold hoists and non-walk-through stirrups may be 
used as end guardrails, if the space between the hoist or stirrup and 
the side guardrail or structure does not allow passage of an employee to 
the end of the scaffold.
    (xi) Guardrails shall be surfaced to prevent injury to an employee 
from punctures or lacerations, and to prevent snagging of clothing.
    (xii) The ends of all rails shall not overhang the terminal posts 
except

[[Page 293]]

when such overhang does not constitute a projection hazard to employees.
    (xiii) Steel or plastic banding shall not be used as a toprail or 
midrail.
    (xiv) Manila or plastic (or other synthetic) rope being used for 
toprails or midrails shall be inspected by a competent person as 
frequently as necessary to ensure that it continues to meet the strength 
requirements of paragraph (g) of this section.
    (xv) Crossbracing is acceptable in place of a midrail when the 
crossing point of two braces is between 20 inches (0.5 m) and 30 inches 
(0.8 m) above the work platform or as a toprail when the crossing point 
of two braces is between 38 inches (0.97 m) and 48 inches (1.3 m) above 
the work platform. The end points at each upright shall be no more than 
48 inches (1.3 m) apart.
    (h) Falling object protection. (1) In addition to wearing hardhats 
each employee on a scaffold shall be provided with additional protection 
from falling hand tools, debris, and other small objects through the 
installation of toeboards, screens, or guardrail systems, or through the 
erection of debris nets, catch platforms, or canopy structures that 
contain or deflect the falling objects. When the falling objects are too 
large, heavy or massive to be contained or deflected by any of the 
above-listed measures, the employer shall place such potential falling 
objects away from the edge of the surface from which they could fall and 
shall secure those materials as necessary to prevent their falling.
    (2) Where there is a danger of tools, materials, or equipment 
falling from a scaffold and striking employees below, the following 
provisions apply:
    (i) The area below the scaffold to which objects can fall shall be 
barricaded, and employees shall not be permitted to enter the hazard 
area; or
    (ii) A toeboard shall be erected along the edge of platforms more 
than 10 feet (3.1 m) above lower levels for a distance sufficient to 
protect employees below, except on float (ship) scaffolds where an 
edging of \3/4\  x  1\1/2\ inch (2  x  4 cm) wood or equivalent may be 
used in lieu of toeboards;
    (iii) Where tools, materials, or equipment are piled to a height 
higher than the top edge of the toeboard, paneling or screening 
extending from the toeboard or platform to the top of the guardrail 
shall be erected for a distance sufficient to protect employees below; 
or
    (iv) A guardrail system shall be installed with openings small 
enough to prevent passage of potential falling objects; or
    (v) A canopy structure, debris net, or catch platform strong enough

Sec. 1926.452  Additional requirements applicable to specific types of scaffolds.

    In addition to the applicable requirements of Sec. 1926.451, the 
following requirements apply to the specific types of scaffolds 
indicated. Scaffolds not specifically addressed by Sec. 1926.452, such 
as but not limited to systems scaffolds, must meet the requirements of 
Sec. 1926.451.
    (a) Pole scaffolds. (1) When platforms are being moved to the next 
level, the existing platform shall be left undisturbed until the new 
bearers have been set in place and braced, prior to receiving the new 
platforms.
    (2) Crossbracing shall be installed between the inner and outer sets 
of poles on double pole scaffolds.
    (3) Diagonal bracing in both directions shall be installed across 
the entire inside face of double-pole scaffolds used to support loads 
equivalent to a uniformly distributed load of 50 pounds (222 kg) or more 
per square foot (929 square cm).
    (4) Diagonal bracing in both directions shall be installed across 
the entire outside face of all double- and single-pole scaffolds.
    (5) Runners and bearers shall be installed on edge.
    (6) Bearers shall extend a minimum of 3 inches (7.6 cm) over the 
outside edges of runners.
    (7) Runners shall extend over a minimum of two poles, and shall be 
supported by bearing blocks securely attached to the poles.
    (8) Braces, bearers, and runners shall not be spliced between poles.
    (9) Where wooden poles are spliced, the ends shall be squared and 
the upper section shall rest squarely on the lower section. Wood splice 
plates shall be provided on at least two adjacent sides, and shall 
extend at least 2 feet (0.6 m) on either side of the splice, overlap the 
abutted ends equally, and have at least the same cross-sectional areas 
as the pole. Splice plates of other materials of equivalent strength may 
be used.
    (10) Pole scaffolds over 60 feet in height shall be designed by a 
registered professional engineer, and shall be constructed and loaded in 
accordance with that design. Non-mandatory Appendix A to this subpart 
contains examples of criteria that will enable an employer to comply 
with design and loading requirements for pole scaffolds under 60 feet in 
height.
    (b) Tube and coupler scaffolds. (1) When platforms are being moved 
to the next level, the existing platform shall be left undisturbed until 
the new bearers have been set in place and braced prior to receiving the 
new platforms.
    (2) Transverse bracing forming an ``X'' across the width of the 
scaffold shall be installed at the scaffold ends and at least at every 
third set of posts horizontally (measured from only one end) and every 
fourth runner vertically. Bracing shall extend diagonally from the inner 
or outer posts or runners upward to the next outer or inner posts or 
runners. Building ties shall be installed at the bearer levels between 
the transverse bracing and shall conform to the requirements of 
Sec. 1926.451(c)(1).
    (3) On straight run scaffolds, longitudinal bracing across the inner 
and outer rows of posts shall be installed diagonally in both 
directions, and shall extend from the base of the end posts upward to 
the top of the scaffold at approximately a 45 degree angle. On scaffolds 
whose length is greater than their height, such bracing shall be 
repeated beginning at least at every fifth post. On scaffolds whose 
length is less than their height, such bracing shall be installed from 
the base of the end posts upward to the opposite end posts, and then in 
alternating directions until reaching the top of the scaffold. Bracing 
shall be installed as close as possible to the intersection of the 
bearer and post or runner and post.
    (4) Where conditions preclude the attachment of bracing to posts, 
bracing shall be attached to the runners as close to the post as 
possible.
    (5) Bearers shall be installed transversely between posts, and when 
coupled to the posts, shall have the inboard coupler bear directly on 
the runner coupler. When the bearers are coupled to the runners, the 
couplers shall be as close to the posts as possible.
    (6) Bearers shall extend beyond the posts and runners, and shall 
provide full contact with the coupler.
    (7) Runners shall be installed along the length of the scaffold, 
located on

[[Page 295]]

both the inside and outside posts at level heights (when tube and 
coupler guardrails and midrails are used on outside posts, they may be 
used in lieu of outside runners).
    (8) Runners shall be interlocked on straight runs to form continuous 
lengths, and shall be coupled to each post. The bottom runners and 
bearers shall be located as close to the base as possible.
    (9) Couplers shall be of a structural metal, such as drop-forged 
steel, malleable iron, or structural grade aluminum. The use of gray 
cast iron is prohibited.
    (10) Tube and coupler scaffolds over 125 feet in height shall be 
designed by a registered professional engineer, and shall be constructed 
and loaded in accordance with such design. Non-mandatory Appendix A to 
this subpart contains examples of criteria that will enable an employer 
to comply with design and loading requirements for tube and coupler 
scaffolds under 125 feet in height.
    (c) Fabricated frame scaffolds (tubular welded frame scaffolds). (1) 
When moving platforms to the next level, the existing platform shall be 
left undisturbed until the new end frames have been set in place and 
braced prior to receiving the new platforms.
    (2) Frames and panels shall be braced by cross, horizontal, or 
diagonal braces, or combination thereof, which secure vertical members 
together laterally. The cross braces shall be of such length as will 
automatically square and align vertical members so that the erected 
scaffold is always plumb, level, and square. All brace connections shall 
be secured.
    (3) Frames and panels shall be joined together vertically by 
coupling or stacking pins or equivalent means.
    (4) Where uplift can occur which would displace scaffold end frames 
or panels, the frames or panels shall be locked together vertically by 
pins or equivalent means.
    (5) Brackets used to support cantilevered loads shall:
    (i) Be seated with side-brackets parallel to the frames and end-
brackets at 90 degrees to the frames;
    (ii) Not be bent or twisted from these positions; and
    (iii) Be used only to support personnel, unless the scaffold has 
been designed for other loads by a qualified engineer and built to 
withstand the tipping forces caused by those other loads being placed on 
the bracket-supported section of the scaffold.
    (6) Scaffolds over 125 feet (38.0 m) in height above their base 
plates shall be designed by a registered professional engineer, and 
shall be constructed and loaded in accordance with such design.
    (d) Plasterers', decorators', and large area scaffolds. Scaffolds 
shall be constructed in accordance with paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of 
this section, as appropriate.
    (e) Bricklayers' square scaffolds (squares). (1) Scaffolds made of 
wood shall be reinforced with gussets on both sides of each corner.
    (2) Diagonal braces shall be installed on all sides of each square.
    (3) Diagonal braces shall be installed between squares on the rear 
and front sides of the scaffold, and shall extend from the bottom of 
each square to the top of the next square.
    (4) Scaffolds shall not exceed three tiers in height, and shall be 
so constructed and arranged that one square rests directly above the 
other. The upper tiers shall stand on a continuous row of planks laid 
across the next lower tier, and shall be nailed down or otherwise 
secured to prevent displacement.
    (f) Horse scaffolds. (1) Scaffolds shall not be constructed or 
arranged more than two tiers or 10 feet (3.0 m) in height, whichever is 
less.
    (2) When horses are arranged in tiers, each horse shall be placed 
directly over the horse in the tier below.
    (3) When horses are arranged in tiers, the legs of each horse shall 
be nailed down or otherwise secured to prevent displacement.
    (4) When horses are arranged in tiers, each tier shall be 
crossbraced.
    (g) Form scaffolds and carpenters' bracket scaffolds. (1) Each 
bracket, except those for wooden bracket-form scaffolds, shall be 
attached to the supporting formwork or structure by means of one or more 
of the following: nails; a metal stud attachment device; welding; 
hooking over a secured structural supporting member, with the

[[Page 296]]

registered professional engineer and shall be constructed and loaded in 
accordance with such design.
    (j) Pump jack scaffolds. (1) Pump jack brackets, braces, and 
accessories shall be fabricated from metal plates and angles. Each pump 
jack bracket shall have two positive gripping mechanisms to prevent any 
failure or slippage.
    (2) Poles shall be secured to the structure by rigid triangular 
bracing or equivalent at the bottom, top, and other points as necessary. 
When the pump jack has to pass bracing already installed, an additional 
brace shall be installed approximately 4 feet (1.2 m) above the brace to 
be passed, and shall be left in place until the pump jack has been moved 
and the original brace reinstalled.
    (3) When guardrails are used for fall protection, a workbench may be 
used as the toprail only if it meets all the requirements in paragraphs 
(g)(4) (ii), (vii), (viii), and (xiii) of Sec. 1926.451.
    (4) Work benches shall not be used as scaffold platforms.
    (5) When poles are made of wood, the pole lumber shall be straight-
grained, free of shakes, large loose or dead knots, and other defects 
which might impair strength.

    (Non-mandatory) Appendix A to Subpart L--Scaffold Specifications

    This Appendix provides non-mandatory guidelines to assist employers 
in complying with the requirements of subpart L of this part. An 
employer may use these guidelines and tables as a starting point for 
designing scaffold systems. However, the guidelines do not provide all 
the information necessary to build a complete system, and the employer 
is still responsible for designing and assembling these components in 
such a way that the completed system will meet the requirements of 
Sec. 1926.451(a). Scaffold components which are not selected and loaded 
in accordance with this Appendix, and components for which no specific 
guidelines or tables are given in this Appendix (e.g., joints, ties, 
components for wood pole scaffolds more than 60 feet in height, 
components for heavy-duty horse scaffolds, components made with other 
materials, and components with other dimensions, etc.) must be designed 
and constructed in accordance with the capacity requirements of 
Sec. 1926.451(a), and loaded in accordance with Sec. 1926.451(d)(1).

    (p) Two-point adjustable suspension scaffolds. (1) In addition to 
direct connections to buildings (except window cleaners' anchors) 
acceptable ways to prevent scaffold sway include angulated roping and 
static lines. Angulated roping is a system of platform suspension in 
which the upper wire rope sheaves or suspension points are closer to the 
plane of the building face than the corresponding attachment points on 
the platform, thus causing the platform to press against the face of the 
building. Static lines are separate ropes secured at their top and 
bottom ends closer to the plane of the building face than the outermost 
edge of the platform. By drawing the static line taut, the platform is 
drawn against the face of the building.
    (2) On suspension scaffolds designed for a working load of 500 
pounds, no more than two employees shall be permitted on the scaffold at 
one time. On suspension scaffolds with a working load of 750 pounds, no 
more than three employees shall be permitted on the scaffold at one 
time.
    (3) Ladder-type platforms. The side stringer shall be of clear 
straight-grained spruce. The rungs shall be of straight-grained oak, 
ash, or hickory, at least 1\1/8\ inches in diameter, with \7/8\ inch 
tenons mortised into the side stringers at least \7/8\ inch. The 
stringers shall be tied together with tie rods not less than \1/4\ inch 
in diameter, passing through the stringers and riveted up tight against 
washers on both ends. The flooring strips shall be spaced not more than 
\5/8\ inch apart, except at the side rails where the space may be 1 
inch. Ladder-type platforms shall be constructed in accordance with the 
following table:

    (b) Definitions.
    Anchorage means a secure point of attachment for lifelines, lanyards 
or deceleration devices.
    Body belt (safety belt) means a strap with means both for securing 
it about the waist and for attaching it to a lanyard, lifeline, or 
deceleration device.
    Body harness means straps which may be secured about the employee in 
a manner that will distribute the fall arrest forces over at least the 
thighs, pelvis, waist, chest and shoulders with means for attaching it 
to other components of a personal fall arrest system.
    Buckle means any device for holding the body belt or body harness 
closed around the employee's body.
    Connector means a device which is used to couple (connect) parts of 
the personal fall arrest system and positioning device systems together. 
It may be an independent component of the system, such as a carabiner, 
or it may be an integral component of part of the system (such as a 
buckle or dee-ring sewn into a body belt or body harness, or a snap-hook 
spliced or sewn to a lanyard or self-retracting lanyard).
    Controlled access zone (CAZ) means an area in which certain work 
(e.g., overhand bricklaying) may take place without the use of guardrail 
systems, personal fall arrest systems, or safety net systems and access 
to the zone is controlled.
    Dangerous equipment means equipment (such as pickling or galvanizing 
tanks, degreasing units, machinery, electrical equipment, and other 
units) which, as a result of form or function, may be hazardous to 
employees who fall onto or into such equipment.
    Deceleration device means any mechanism, such as a rope grab, rip-
stitch lanyard, specially-woven lanyard, tearing or deforming lanyards, 
automatic self-retracting lifelines/lanyards, etc., which serves to 
dissipate a substantial amount of energy during a fall arrest, or 
otherwise limit the energy imposed on an employee during fall arrest.
    Deceleration distance means the additional vertical distance a 
falling employee travels, excluding lifeline elongation and free fall 
distance, before stopping, from the point at which the

[[Page 320]]

deceleration device begins to operate. It is measured as the distance 
between the location of an employee's body belt or body harness 
attachment point at the moment of activation (at the onset of fall 
arrest forces) of the deceleration device during a fall, and the 
location of that attachment point after the employee comes to a full 
stop.
    Equivalent means alternative designs, materials, or methods to 
protect against a hazard which the employer can demonstrate will provide 
an equal or greater degree of safety for employees than the methods, 
materials or designs specified in the standard.
    Failure means load refusal, breakage, or separation of component 
parts. Load refusal is the point where the ultimate strength is 
exceeded.
    Free fall means the act of falling before a personal fall arrest 
system begins to apply force to arrest the fall.
    Free fall distance means the vertical displacement of the fall 
arrest attachment point on the employee's body belt or body harness 
between onset of the fall and just before the system begins to apply 
force to arrest the fall. This distance excludes deceleration distance, 
and lifeline/lanyard elongation, but includes any deceleration device 
slide distance or self-retracting lifeline/lanyard extension before they 
operate and fall arrest forces occur.
    Guardrail system means a barrier erected to prevent employees from 
falling to lower levels.
    Hole means a gap or void 2 inches (5.1 cm) or more in its least 
dimension, in a floor, roof, or other walking/working surface.
    Infeasible means that it is impossible to perform the construction 
work using a conventional fall protection system (i.e., guardrail 
system, safety net system, or personal fall arrest system) or that it is 
technologically impossible to use any one of these systems to provide 
fall protection.
    Lanyard means a flexible line of rope, wire rope, or strap which 
generally has a connector at each end for connecting the body belt or 
body harness to a deceleration device, lifeline, or anchorage.
    Leading edge means the edge of a floor, roof, or formwork for a 
floor or other walking/working surface (such as the deck) which changes 
location as additional floor, roof, decking, or formwork sections are 
placed, formed, or constructed. A leading edge is considered to be an 
``unprotected side and edge'' during periods when it is not actively and 
continuously under construction.
    Lifeline means a component consisting of a flexible line for 
connection to an anchorage at one end to hang vertically (vertical 
lifeline), or for connection to anchorages at both ends to stretch 
horizontally (horizontal lifeline), and which serves as a means for 
connecting other components of a personal fall arrest system to the 
anchorage.
    Low-slope roof means a roof having a slope less than or equal to 4 
in 12 (vertical to horizontal).
    Lower levels means those areas or surfaces to which an employee can 
fall. Such areas or surfaces include, but are not limited to, ground 
levels, floors, platforms, ramps, runways, excavations, pits, tanks, 
material, water, equipment, structures, or portions thereof.
    Mechanical equipment means all motor or human propelled wheeled 
equipment used for roofing work, except wheelbarrows and mopcarts.
    Opening means a gap or void 30 inches (76 cm) or more high and 18 
inches (48 cm) or more wide, in a wall or partition, through which 
employees can fall to a lower level.
    Overhand bricklaying and related work means the process of laying 
bricks and masonry units such that the surface of the wall to be jointed 
is on the opposite side of the wall from the mason, requiring the mason 
to lean over the wall to complete the work. Related work includes mason 
tending and electrical installation incorporated into the brick wall 
during the overhand bricklaying process.
    Personal fall arrest system means a system used to arrest an 
employee in a fall from a working level. It consists of an anchorage, 
connectors, a body belt or body harness and may include a lanyard, 
deceleration device, lifeline, or suitable combinations of these. As of 
January 1, 1998, the use of a body belt for fall arrest is prohibited.

[[Page 321]]

    Positioning device system means a body belt or body harness system 
rigged to allow an employee to be supported on an elevated vertical 
surface, such as a wall, and work with both hands free while leaning.
    Rope grab means a deceleration device which travels on a lifeline 
and automatically, by friction, engages the lifeline and locks so as to 
arrest the fall of an employee. A rope grab usually employs the 
principle of inertial locking, cam/level locking, or both.
    Roof means the exterior surface on the top of a building. This does 
not include floors or formwork which, because a building has not been 
completed, temporarily become the top surface of a building.
    Roofing work means the hoisting, storage, application, and removal 
of roofing materials and equipment, including related insulation, sheet 
metal, and vapor barrier work, but not including the construction of the 
roof deck.
    Safety-monitoring system means a safety system in which a competent 
person is responsible for recognizing and warning employees of fall 
hazards.
    Self-retracting lifeline/lanyard means a deceleration device 
containing a drum-wound line which can be slowly extracted from, or 
retracted onto, the drum under slight tension during normal employee 
movement, and which, after onset of a fall, automatically locks the drum 
and arrests the fall.
    Snaphook means a connector comprised of a hook-shaped member with a 
normally closed keeper, or similar arrangement, which may be opened to 
permit the hook to receive an object and, when released, automatically 
closes to retain the object. Snaphooks are generally one of two types:
    (1) The locking type with a self-closing, self-locking keeper which 
remains closed and locked until unlocked and pressed open for connection 
or disconnection; or
    (2) The non-locking type with a self-closing keeper which remains 
closed until pressed open for connection or disconnection. As of January 
1, 1998, the use of a non-locking snaphook as part of personal fall 
arrest systems and positioning device systems is prohibited.
    Steep roof means a roof having a slope greater than 4 in 12 
(vertical to horizontal).
    Toeboard means a low protective barrier that will prevent the fall 
of materials and equipment to lower levels and provide protection from 
falls for personnel.
    Unprotected sides and edges means any side or edge (except at 
entrances to points of access) of a walking/working surface, e.g., 
floor, roof, ramp, or runway where there is no wall or guardrail system 
at least 39 inches (1.0 m) high.
    Walking/working surface means any surface, whether horizontal or 
vertical on which an employee walks or works, including, but not limited 
to, floors, roofs, ramps, bridges, runways, formwork and concrete 
reinforcing steel but not including ladders, vehicles, or trailers, on 
which employees must be located in order to perform their job duties.
    Warning line system means a barrier erected on a roof to warn 
employees that they are approaching an unprotected roof side or edge, 
and which designates an area in which roofing work may take place 
without the use of guardrail, body belt, or safety net systems to 
protect employees in the area.
    Work area means that portion of a walking/working surface where job 
duties are being performed.

Sec. 1926.501  Duty to have fall protection.

    (a) General. (1) This section sets forth requirements for employers 
to provide fall protection systems. All fall protection required by this 
section shall conform to the criteria set forth in Sec. 1926.502 of this 
subpart.
    (2) The employer shall determine if the walking/working surfaces on 
which its employees are to work have the strength and structural 
integrity to support employees safely. Employees shall be allowed to 
work on those surfaces only when the surfaces have the requisite 
strength and structural integrity.
    (b)(1) Unprotected sides and edges. Each employee on a walking/
working surface (horizontal and vertical surface) with an unprotected 
side or edge which is 6 feet (1.8 m) or more above a

[[Page 322]]

lower level shall be protected from falling by the use of guardrail 
systems, safety net systems, or personal fall arrest systems.
    (2) Leading edges. (i) Each employee who is constructing a leading 
edge 6 feet (1.8 m) or more above lower levels shall be protected from 
falling by guardrail systems, safety net systems, or personal fall 
arrest systems. Exception: When the employer can demonstrate that it is 
infeasible or creates a greater hazard to use these systems, the 
employer shall develop and implement a fall protection plan which meets 
the requirements of paragraph (k) of Sec. 1926.502.

    Note: There is a presumption that it is feasible and will not create 
a greater hazard to implement at least one of the above-listed fall 
protection systems. Accordingly, the employer has the burden of 
establishing that it is appropriate to implement a fall protection plan 
which complies with Sec. 1926.502(k) for a particular workplace 
situation, in lieu of implementing any of those systems.

    (ii) Each employee on a walking/working surface 6 feet (1.8 m) or 
more above a lower level where leading edges are under construction, but 
who is not engaged in the leading edge work, shall be protected from 
falling by a guardrail system, safety net system, or personal fall 
arrest system. If a guardrail system is chosen to provide the fall 
protection, and a controlled access zone has already been established 
for leading edge work, the control line may be used in lieu of a 
guardrail along the edge that parallels the leading edge.
    (3) Hoist areas. Each employee in a hoist area shall be protected 
from falling 6 feet (1.8 m) or more to lower levels by guardrail systems 
or personal fall arrest systems. If guardrail systems, [or chain, gate, 
or guardrail] or portions thereof, are removed to facilitate the 
hoisting operation (e.g., during landing of materials), and an employee 
must lean through the access opening or out over the edge of the access 
opening (to receive or guide equipment and materials, for example), that 
employee shall be protected from fall hazards by a personal fall arrest 
system.
    (4) Holes. (i) Each employee on walking/working surfaces shall be 
protected from falling through holes (including skylights) more than 6 
feet (1.8 m) above lower levels, by personal fall arrest systems, 
covers, or guardrail systems erected around such holes.
    (ii) Each employee on a walking/working surface shall be protected 
from tripping in or stepping into or through holes (including skylights) 
by covers.
    (iii) Each employee on a walking/working surface shall be protected 
from objects falling through holes (including skylights) by covers.
    (5) Formwork and reinforcing steel. Each employee on the face of 
formwork or reinforcing steel shall be protected from falling 6 feet 
(1.8 m) or more to lower levels by personal fall arrest systems, safety 
net systems, or positioning device systems.
    (6) Ramps, runways, and other walkways. Each employee on ramps, 
runways, and other walkways shall be protected from falling 6 feet (1.8 
m) or more to lower levels by guardrail systems.
    (7) Excavations. (i) Each employee at the edge of an excavation 6 
feet (1.8 m) or more in depth shall be protected from falling by 
guardrail systems, fences, or barricades when the excavations are not 
readily seen because of plant growth or other visual barrier;
    (ii) Each employee at the edge of a well, pit, shaft, and similar 
excavation 6 feet (1.8 m) or more in depth shall be protected from 
falling by guardrail systems, fences, barricades, or covers.
    (8) Dangerous equipment. (i) Each employee less than 6 feet (1.8 m) 
above dangerous equipment shall be protected from falling into or onto 
the dangerous equipment by guardrail systems or by equipment guards.
    (ii) Each employee 6 feet (1.8 m) or more above dangerous equipment 
shall be protected from fall hazards by guardrail systems, personal fall 
arrest systems, or safety net systems.
    (9) Overhand bricklaying and related work. (i) Except as otherwise 
provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each employee performing 
overhand bricklaying and related work 6 feet (1.8 m) or more above lower 
levels, shall be protected from falling by guardrail systems, safety net 
systems, personal fall

[[Page 323]]

arrest systems, or shall work in a controlled access zone.
    (ii) Each employee reaching more than 10 inches (25 cm) below the 
level of the walking/working surface on which they are working, shall be 
protected from falling by a guardrail system, safety net system, or 
personal fall arrest system.

    Note: Bricklaying operations performed on scaffolds are regulated by 
subpart L--Scaffolds of this part.

    (10) Roofing work on Low-slope roofs. Except as otherwise provided 
in paragraph (b) of this section, each employee engaged in roofing 
activities on low-slope roofs, with unprotected sides and edges 6 feet 
(1.8 m) or more above lower levels shall be protected from falling by 
guardrail systems, safety net systems, personal fall arrest systems, or 
a combination of warning line system and guardrail system, warning line 
system and safety net system, or warning line system and personal fall 
arrest system, or warning line system and safety monitoring system. Or, 
on roofs 50-feet (15.25 m) or less in width (see Appendix A to subpart M 
of this part), the use of a safety monitoring system alone [i.e. without 
the warning line system] is permitted.
    (11) Steep roofs. Each employee on a steep roof with unprotected 
sides and edges 6 feet (1.8 m) or more above lower levels shall be 
protected from falling by guardrail systems with toeboards, safety net 
systems, or personal fall arrest systems.
    (12) Precast concrete erection. Each employee engaged in the 
erection of precast concrete members (including, but not limited to the 
erection of wall panels, columns, beams, and floor and roof ``tees'') 
and related operations such as grouting of precast concrete members, who 
is 6 feet (1.8 m) or more above lower levels shall be protected from 
falling by guardrail systems, safety net systems, or personal fall 
arrest systems, unless another provision in paragraph (b) of this 
section provides for an alternative fall protection measure. Exception: 
When the employer can demonstrate that it is infeasible or creates a 
greater hazard to use these systems, the employer shall develop and 
implement a fall protection plan which meets the requirements of 
paragraph (k) of Sec. 1926.502.

    Note: There is a presumption that it is feasible and will not create 
a greater hazard to implement at least one of the above-listed fall 
protection systems. Accordingly, the employer has the burden of 
establishing that it is appropriate to implement a fall protection plan 
which complies with Sec. 1926.502(k) for a particular workplace 
situation, in lieu of implementing any of those systems.

    (13) Residential construction. Each employee engaged in residential 
construction activities 6 feet (1.8 m) or more above lower levels shall 
be protected by guardrail systems, safety net system, or personal fall 
arrest system unless another provision in paragraph (b) of this section 
provides for an alternative fall protection measure. Exception: When the 
employer can demonstrate that it is infeasible or creates a greater 
hazard to use these systems, the employer shall develop and implement a 
fall protection plan which meets the requirements of paragraph (k) of 
Sec. 1926.502.

    Note: There is a presumption that it is feasible and will not create 
a greater hazard to implement at least one of the above-listed fall 
protection systems. Accordingly, the employer has the burden of 
establishing that it is appropriate to implement a fall protection plan 
which complies with Sec. 1926.502(k) for a particular workplace 
situation, in lieu of implementing any of those systems.

    (14) Wall openings. Each employee working on, at, above, or near 
wall openings (including those with chutes attached) where the outside 
bottom edge of the wall opening is 6 feet (1.8 m) or more above lower 
levels and the inside bottom edge of the wall opening is less than 39 
inches (1.0 m) above the walking/working surface, shall be protected 
from falling by the use of a guardrail system, a safety net system, or a 
personal fall arrest system.
    (15) Walking/working surfaces not otherwise addressed. Except as 
provided in Sec. 1926.500(a)(2) or in Sec. 1926.501 (b)(1) through 
(b)(14), each employee on a walking/working surface 6 feet (1.8 m) or 
more above lower levels shall be protected from falling by a guardrail 
system, safety net system, or personal fall arrest system.
    (c) Protection from falling objects. When an employee is exposed to 
falling

[[Page 324]]

objects, the employer shall have each employee wear a hard hat and shall 
implement one of the following measures:
    (1) Erect toeboards, screens, or guardrail systems to prevent 
objects from falling from higher levels; or,
    (2) Erect a canopy structure and keep potential fall objects far 
enough from the edge of the higher level so that those objects would not 
go over the edge if they were accidentally displaced; or,
    (3) Barricade the area to which objects could fall, prohibit 
employees from entering the barricaded area, and keep objects that may 
fall far enough away from the edge of a higher level so that those 
objects would not go over the edge if they were accidentally displaced.


<R05>
Sec. 1926.502  Fall protection systems criteria and practices.

    (a) General. (1) Fall protection systems required by this part shall 
comply with the applicable provisions of this section.
    (2) Employers shall provide and install all fall protection systems 
required by this subpart for an employee, and shall comply with all 
other pertinent requirements of this subpart before that employee begins 
the work that necessitates the fall protection.
    (b) Guardrail systems. Guardrail systems and their use shall comply 
with the following provisions:
    (1) Top edge height of top rails, or equivalent guardrail system 
members, shall be 42 inches (1.1 m) plus or minus 3 inches (8 cm) above 
the walking/working level. When conditions warrant, the height of the 
top edge may exceed the 45-inch height, provided the guardrail system 
meets all other criteria of this paragraph.

    Note: When employees are using stilts, the top edge height of the 
top rail, or equivalent member, shall be increased an amount equal to 
the height of the stilts.

    (2) Midrails, screens, mesh, intermediate vertical members, or 
equivalent intermediate structural members shall be installed between 
the top edge of the guardrail system and the walking/working surface 
when there is no wall or parapet wall at least 21 inches (53 cm) high.
    (i) Midrails, when used, shall be installed at a height midway 
between the top edge of the guardrail system and the walking/working 
level.
    (ii) Screens and mesh, when used, shall extend from the top rail to 
the walking/working level and along the entire opening between top rail 
supports.
    (iii) Intermediate members (such as balusters), when used between 
posts, shall be not more than 19 inches (48 cm) apart.
    (iv) Other structural members (such as additional midrails and 
architectural panels) shall be installed such that there are no openings 
in the guardrail system that are more than 19 inches (.5 m) wide.
    (3) Guardrail systems shall be capable of withstanding, without 
failure, a force of at least 200 pounds (890 N) applied within 2 inches 
(5.1 cm) of the top edge, in any outward or downward direction, at any 
point along the top edge.
    (4) When the 200 pound (890 N) test load specified in paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section is applied in a downward direction, the top edge 
of the guardrail shall not deflect to a height less than 39 inches (1.0 
m) above the walking/working level. Guardrail system components selected 
and constructed in accordance with the Appendix B to subpart M of this 
part will be deemed to meet this requirement.
    (5) Midrails, screens, mesh, intermediate vertical members, solid 
panels, and equivalent structural members shall be capable of 
withstanding, without failure, a force of at least 150 pounds (666 N) 
applied in any downward or outward direction at any point along the 
midrail or other member.
    (6) Guardrail systems shall be so surfaced as to prevent injury to 
an employee from punctures or lacerations, and to prevent snagging of 
clothing.
    (7) The ends of all top rails and midrails shall not overhang the 
terminal posts, except where such overhang does not constitute a 
projection hazard.
    (8) Steel banding and plastic banding shall not be used as top rails 
or midrails.
    (9) Top rails and midrails shall be at least one-quarter inch (0.6 
cm) nominal

enter controlled access zones.
    (10) In the event an employee falls, or some other related, serious 
incident occurs, (e.g., a near miss) the employer shall investigate the 
circumstances of the fall or other incident to determine if the fall 
protection plan needs to be changed (e.g. new practices, procedures, or 
training) and shall implement those changes to prevent similar types of 
falls or incidents.

    (2) The employer shall assure that each employee has been trained, 
as necessary, by a competent person qualified in the following areas:
    (i) The nature of fall hazards in the work area;
    (ii) The correct procedures for erecting, maintaining, 
disassembling, and inspecting the fall protection systems to be used;
    (iii) The use and operation of guardrail systems, personal fall 
arrest systems, safety net systems, warning line systems, safety 
monitoring systems, controlled access zones, and other protection to be 
used;
    (iv) The role of each employee in the safety monitoring system when 
this system is used;
    (v) The limitations on the use of mechanical equipment during the 
performance of roofing work on low-sloped roofs;

[[Page 332]]

    (vi) The correct procedures for the handling and storage of 
equipment and materials and the erection of overhead protection; and
    (vii) The role of employees in fall protection plans;
    (viii) The standards contained in this subpart.
    (b) Certification of training. (1) The employer shall verify 
compliance with paragraph (a) of this section by preparing a written 
certification record. The written certification record shall contain the 
name or other identity of the employee trained, the date(s) of the 
training, and the signature of the person who conducted the training or 
the signature of the employer. If the employer relies on training 
conducted by another employer or completed prior to the effective date 
of this section, the certification record shall indicate the date the 
employer determined the prior training was adequate rather than the date 
of actual training.
    (2) The latest training certification shall be maintained.
    (c) Retraining. When the employer has reason to believe that any 
affected employee who has already been trained does not have the 
understanding and skill required by paragraph (a) of this section, the 
employer shall retrain each such employee. Circumstances where 
retraining is required include, but are not limited to, situations 
where:
    (1) Changes in the workplace render previous training obsolete; or
    (2) Changes in the types of fall protection systems or equipment to 
be used render previous training obsolete; or
    (3) Inadequacies in an affected employee's knowledge or use of fall 
protection systems or equipment indicate that the employee has not 
retained the requisite understanding or skill.

    Note: The following appendices to subpart M of this part serve as 
non-mandatory guidelines to assist employers in complying with the 
appropriate requirements of subpart M of this part.

            Appendix A to Subpart M--Determining Roof Widths

    Non-mandatory Guidelines for Complying With Sec. 1926.501(b)(10)

    (1) This Appendix serves as a guideline to assist employers 
complying with the requirements of Sec. 1926.501(b)(10). Section 
1910.501(b)(10) allows the use of a safety monitoring system alone as a 
means of providing fall protection during the performance of roofing 
operations on low-sloped roofs 50 feet (15.25 m) or less in width. Each 
example in the appendix shows a roof plan or plans and indicates where 
each roof or roof area is to be measured to determine its width. Section 
views or elevation views are shown where appropriate. Some examples show 
``correct'' and ``incorrect'' subdivisions of irregularly shaped roofs 
divided into smaller, regularly shaped areas. In all examples, the 
dimension selected to be the width of an area is the lesser of the two 
primary dimensions of the area, as viewed from above. Example A shows 
that on a simple rectangular roof, width is the lesser of the two 
primary overall dimensions. This is also the case with roofs which are 
sloped toward or away from the roof center, as shown in Example B.
    (2) Many roofs are not simple rectangles. Such roofs may be broken 
down into subareas as shown in Example C. The process of dividing a roof 
area can produce many different configurations. Example C gives the 
general rule of using dividing lines of minimum length to minimize the 
size and number of the areas which are potentially less than 50 feet 
(15.25 m) wide. The intent is to minimize the number of roof areas where 
safety monitoring systems alone are sufficient protection.
    (3) Roofs which are comprised of several separate, non-contiguous 
roof areas, as in Example D, may be considered as a series of individual 
roofs. Some roofs have penthouses, additional floors, courtyard 
openings, or similar architectural features; Example E shows how the 
rule for dividing roofs into subareas is applied to such configurations. 
Irregular, non-rectangular roofs must be considered on an individual 
basis, as shown in Example F.

                                Example A

                        Rectangular Shaped Roofs

                     Sloped Rectangular Shaped Roofs
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR09AU94.001

                                Example C

        Irregularly Shaped Roofs With Rectangular Shaped Sections

    Such roofs are to be divided into sub-areas by using dividing lines 
of minimum length to minimize the size and number of the areas which are 
potentially less than or equal to 50 feet (15.25 meters) in width, in 
order to limit the size of roof areas where the safety monitoring system 
alone can be used [1926.502(b)(10)]. Dotted lines are used in the 
examples to show the location of dividing lines. W denotes incorrect 
measurements of width.

    Such roofs are to be divided into sub-areas by using dividing lines 
of minimum length to minimize the size and number of the areas which are 
potentially less than or equal to 50 feet (15.25 meters) in width, in 
order to limit the size of roof areas where the safety monitoring system 
alone can be used [1926.502(b)(10)]. Dotted lines are used in the 
examples to show the location of dividing lines. W denotes incorrect 
measurements of width.

               Appendix B to Subpart M--Guardrail Systems

      Non-Mandatory Guidelines for Complying with Sec. 1926.502(b)

    The standard requires guardrail systems and components to be 
designed and built to meet the requirements of Sec. 1926.502 (b) (3), 
(4), and (5). This Appendix serves as a non-mandatory guideline to 
assist employers in complying with these requirements. An employer may 
use these guidelines as a starting point for designing guardrail 
systems. However, the guidelines do not provide all the information 
necessary to build a complete system, and the employer is still 
responsible for designing and assembling these components in such a way 
that the completed system will meet the requirements of Sec. 1926.502(b) 
(3), (4), and (5). Components for which no specific guidelines are given 
in this Appendix (e.g., joints, base connections, components made with 
other materials, and components with

[[Page 338]]

other dimensions) must also be designed and constructed in such a way 
that the completed system meets the requirements of Sec. 1926.502.
    (1) For wood railings: Wood components shall be minimum 1500 lb-ft/
in<SUP>2</SUP> fiber (stress grade) construction grade lumber; the posts 
shall be at least 2-inch by 4-inch (5 cm x 10 cm) lumber spaced not more 
than 8 feet (2.4 m) apart on centers; the top rail shall be at least 2-
inch by 4-inch (5 cm x 10 cm) lumber, the intermediate rail shall be at 
least 1-inch by 6-inch (2.5 cm x 15 cm) lumber. All lumber dimensions 
are nominal sizes as provided by the American Softwood Lumber Standards, 
dated January 1970.
    (2) For pipe railings: posts, top rails, and intermediate railings 
shall be at least one and one-half inches nominal diameter (schedule 40 
pipe) with posts spaced not more than 8 feet (2.4 m) apart on centers.
    (3) For structural steel railings: posts, top rails, and 
intermediate rails shall be at least 2-inch by 2-inch (5 cm x 10 cm) by 
\3/8\-inch (1.1 cm) angles, with posts spaced not more than 8 feet (2.4 
m) apart on centers.

          Appendix C to Subpart M--Personal Fall Arrest Systems

      Non-Mandatory Guidelines for Complying With Sec. 1926.502(d)

    I. Test methods for personal fall arrest systems and positioning 
device systems--(a) General. This appendix serves as a non-mandatory 
guideline to assist employers comply with the requirements in 
Sec. 1926.502(d). Paragraphs (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Appendix 
describe test procedures which may be used to determine compliance with 
the requirements in Sec. 1926.502 (d)(16). As noted in Appendix D of 
this subpart, the test methods listed here in Appendix C can also be 
used to assist employers comply with the requirements in 
Sec. 1926.502(e) (3) and (4) for positioning device systems.
    (b) General conditions for all tests in the Appendix to 
Sec. 1926.502(d). (1) Lifelines, lanyards and deceleration devices 
should be attached to an anchorage and connected to the body-belt or 
body harness in the same manner as they would be when used to protect 
employees.
    (2) The anchorage should be rigid, and should not have a deflection 
greater than 0.04 inches (1 mm) when a force of 2,250 pounds (10 kN) is 
applied.
    (3) The frequency response of the load measuring instrumentation 
should be 500 Hz.
    (4) The test weight used in the strength and force tests should be a 
rigid, metal, cylindrical or torso-shaped object with a girth of 38 
inches plus or minus 4 inches (96 cm plus or minus 10 cm).
    (5) The lanyard or lifeline used to create the free fall distance 
should be supplied with the system, or in its absence, the least elastic 
lanyard or lifeline available to be used with the system.
    (6) The test weight for each test should be hoisted to the required 
level and should be quickly released without having any appreciable 
motion imparted to it.
    (7) The system's performance should be evaluated taking into account 
the range of environmental conditions for which it is designed to be 
used.
    (8) Following the test, the system need not be capable of further 
operation.
    (c) Strength test. (1) During the testing of all systems, a test 
weight of 300 pounds plus or minus 5 pounds (135 kg plus or minus 2.5 
kg) should be used. (See paragraph (b)(4) of this section.)
    (2) The test consists of dropping the test weight once. A new unused 
system should be used for each test.
    (3) For lanyard systems, the lanyard length should be 6 feet plus or 
minus 2 inches (1.83 m plus or minus 5 cm) as measured from the fixed 
anchorage to the attachment on the body belt or body harness.
    (4) For rope-grab-type deceleration systems, the length of the 
lifeline above the centerline of the grabbing mechanism to the 
lifeline's anchorage point should not exceed 2 feet (0.61 m).
    (5) For lanyard systems, for systems with deceleration devices which 
do not automatically limit free fall distance to 2 feet (0.61 m ) or 
less, and for systems with deceleration devices which have a connection 
distance in excess of 1 foot (0.3 m) (measured between the centerline of 
the lifeline and the attachment point to the body belt or harness), the 
test weight should be rigged to free fall a distance of 7.5 feet (2.3 m) 
from a point that is 1.5 feet (.46 m) above the anchorage point, to its 
hanging location (6 feet below the anchorage). The test weight should 
fall without interference, obstruction, or hitting the floor or ground 
during the test. In some cases a non-elastic wire lanyard of sufficient 
length may need to be added to the system (for test purposes) to create 
the necessary free fall distance.
    (6) For deceleration device systems with integral lifelines or 
lanyards which automatically limit free fall distance to 2 feet (0.61 m) 
or less, the test weight should be rigged to free fall a distance of 4 
feet (1.22 m).
    (7) Any weight which detaches from the belt or harness has failed 
the strength test.
    (d) Force test--(1) General. The test consists of dropping the 
respective test weight once as specified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) or 
(d)(3)(i) of this section. A new, unused system should be used for each 
test.
    (2) For lanyard systems. (i) A test weight of 220 pounds plus or 
minus 3 pounds (100 kg plus or minus 1.6 kg) should be used. (See 
paragraph (b)(4) of this appendix).

[[Page 339]]

    (ii) Lanyard length should be 6 feet plus or minus two inches (1.83 
m plus or minus 5 cm) as measured from the fixed anchorage to the 
attachment on the body belt or body harness.
    (iii) The test weight should fall free from the anchorage level to 
its hanging location (a total of 6 feet (1.83 m) free fall distance) 
without interference, obstruction, or hitting the floor or ground during 
the test.
    (3) For all other systems. (i) A test weight of 220 pounds plus or 
minus 3 pounds (100 kg plus or minus 1.6 kg) should be used. (See 
paragraph (b)(4) of this appendix)
    (ii) The free fall distance to be used in the test should be the 
maximum fall distance physically permitted by the system during normal 
use conditions, up to a maximum free fall distance for the test weight 
of 6 feet (1.83 m), except as follows:
    (A) For deceleration systems which have a connection link or 
lanyard, the test weight should free fall a distance equal to the 
connection distance (measured between the centerline of the lifeline and 
the attachment point to the body belt or harness).
    (B) For deceleration device systems with integral lifelines or 
lanyards which automatically limit free fall distance to 2 feet (0.61 m) 
or less, the test weight should free fall a distance equal to that 
permitted by the system in normal use. (For example, to test a system 
with a self-retracting lifeline or lanyard, the test weight should be 
supported and the system allowed to retract the lifeline or lanyard as 
it would in normal use. The test weight would then be released and the 
force and deceleration distance measured).
    (4) A system fails the force test if the recorded maximum arresting 
force exceeds 1,260 pounds (5.6 kN) when using a body belt, and/or 
exceeds 2,520 pounds (11.2 kN) when using a body harness.
    (5) The maximum elongation and deceleration distance should be 
recorded during the force test.
    (e) Deceleration device tests. (1) General. The device should be 
evaluated or tested under the environmental conditions, (such as rain, 
ice, grease, dirt, type of lifeline, etc.), for which the device is 
designed.
    (2) Rope-grab-type deceleration devices. (i) Devices should be moved 
on a lifeline 1,000 times over the same length of line a distance of not 
less than 1 foot (30.5 cm), and the mechanism should lock each time.
    (ii) Unless the device is permanently marked to indicate the type(s) 
of lifeline which must be used, several types (different diameters and 
different materials), of lifelines should be used to test the device.
    (3) Other self-activating-type deceleration devices. The locking 
mechanisms of other self-activating-type deceleration devices designed 
for more than one arrest should lock each of 1,000 times as they would 
in normal service.
    II. Additional non-mandatory guidelines for personal fall arrest 
systems. The following information constitutes additional guidelines for 
use in complying with requirements for a personal fall arrest system.
    (a) Selection and use considerations. (1) The kind of personal fall 
arrest system selected should match the particular work situation, and 
any possible free fall distance should be kept to a minimum. 
Consideration should be given to the particular work environment. For 
example, the presence of acids, dirt, moisture, oil, grease, etc., and 
their effect on the system, should be evaluated. Hot or cold 
environments may also have an adverse effect on the system. Wire rope 
should not be used where an electrical hazard is anticipated. As 
required by the standard, the employer must plan to have means available 
to promptly rescue an employee should a fall occur, since the suspended 
employee may not be able to reach a work level independently.
    (2) Where lanyards, connectors, and lifelines are subject to damage 
by work operations such as welding, chemical cleaning, and sandblasting, 
the component should be protected, or other securing systems should be 
used. The employer should fully evaluate the work conditions and 
environment (including seasonal weather changes) before selecting the 
appropriate personal fall protection system. Once in use, the system's 
effectiveness should be monitored. In some cases, a program for cleaning 
and maintenance of the system may be necessary.
    (b) Testing considerations. Before purchasing or putting into use a 
personal fall arrest system, an employer should obtain from the supplier 
information about the system based on its performance during testing so 
that the employer can know if the system meets this standard. Testing 
should be done using recognized test methods. This Appendix contains 
test methods recognized for evaluating the performance of fall arrest 
systems. Not all systems may need to be individually tested; the 
performance of some systems may be based on data and calculations 
derived from testing of similar systems, provided that enough 
information is available to demonstrate similarity of function and 
design.
    (c) Component compatibility considerations. Ideally, a personal fall 
arrest system is designed, tested, and supplied as a complete system. 
However, it is common practice for lanyards, connectors, lifelines, 
deceleration devices, body belts and body harnesses to be interchanged 
since some components wear out before others. The employer and employee 
should realize that not all components are interchangeable. For 
instance, a lanyard should not be connected between a body belt (or 
harness) and a deceleration device of the self-retracting type since 
this can result in additional free fall for which the

[[Page 340]]

system was not designed. Any substitution or change to a personal fall 
arrest system should be fully evaluated or tested by a competent person 
to determine that it meets the standard, before the modified system is 
put in use.
    (d) Employee training considerations. Thorough employee training in 
the selection and use of personal fall arrest systems is imperative. 
Employees must be trained in the safe use of the system. This should 
include the following: application limits; proper anchoring and tie-off 
techniques; estimation of free fall distance, including determination of 
deceleration distance, and total fall distance to prevent striking a 
lower level; methods of use; and inspection and storage of the system. 
Careless or improper use of the equipment can result in serious injury 
or death. Employers and employees should become familiar with the 
material in this Appendix, as well as manufacturer's recommendations, 
before a system is used. Of uppermost importance is the reduction in 
strength caused by certain tie-offs (such as using knots, tying around 
sharp edges, etc.) and maximum permitted free fall distance. Also, to be 
stressed are the importance of inspections prior to use, the limitations 
of the equipment, and unique conditions at the worksite which may be 
important in determining the type of system to use.
    (e) Instruction considerations. Employers should obtain 
comprehensive instructions from the supplier as to the system's proper 
use and application, including, where applicable:
    (1) The force measured during the sample force test;
    (2) The maximum elongation measured for lanyards during the force 
test;
    (3) The deceleration distance measured for deceleration devices 
during the force test;
    (4) Caution statements on critical use limitations;
    (5) Application limits;
    (6) Proper hook-up, anchoring and tie-off techniques, including the 
proper dee-ring or other attachment point to use on the body belt and 
harness for fall arrest;
    (7) Proper climbing techniques;
    (8) Methods of inspection, use, cleaning, and storage; and
    (9) Specific lifelines which may be used. This information should be 
provided to employees during training.
    (f) Rescue considerations. As required by Sec. 1926.502(d)(20), when 
personal fall arrest systems are used, the employer must assure that 
employees can be promptly rescued or can rescue themselves should a fall 
occur. The availability of rescue personnel, ladders or other rescue 
equipment should be evaluated. In some situations, equipment which 
allows employees to rescue themselves after the fall has been arrested 
may be desirable, such as devices which have descent capability.
    (g) Inspection considerations. As required by Sec. 1926.502(d)(21), 
personal fall arrest systems must be regularly inspected. Any component 
with any significant defect, such as cuts, tears, abrasions, mold, or 
undue stretching; alterations or additions which might affect its 
efficiency; damage due to deterioration; contact with fire, acids, or 
other corrosives; distorted hooks or faulty hook springs; tongues 
unfitted to the shoulder of buckles; loose or damaged mountings; non-
functioning parts; or wearing or internal deterioration in the ropes 
must be withdrawn from service immediately, and should be tagged or 
marked as unusable, or destroyed.
    (h) Tie-off considerations. (1) One of the most important aspects of 
personal fall protection systems is fully planning the system before it 
is put into use. Probably the most overlooked component is planning for 
suitable anchorage points. Such planning should ideally be done before 
the structure or building is constructed so that anchorage points can be 
incorporated during construction for use later for window cleaning or 
other building maintenance. If properly planned, these anchorage points 
may be used during construction, as well as afterwards.
    (i) Properly planned anchorages should be used if they are 
available. In some cases, anchorages must be installed immediately prior 
to use. In such cases, a registered professional engineer with 
experience in designing fall protection systems, or another qualified 
person with appropriate education and experience should design an anchor 
point to be installed.
    (ii) In other cases, the Agency recognizes that there will be a need 
to devise an anchor point from existing structures. Examples of what 
might be appropriate anchor points are steel members or I-beams if an 
acceptable strap is available for the connection (do not use a lanyard 
with a snaphook clipped onto itself); large eye-bolts made of an 
appropriate grade steel; guardrails or railings if they have been 
designed for use as an anchor point; or masonry or wood members only if 
the attachment point is substantial and precautions have been taken to 
assure that bolts or other connectors will not pull through. A qualified 
person should be used to evaluate the suitable of these ``make shift'' 
anchorages with a focus on proper strength.
    (2) Employers and employees should at all times be aware that the 
strength of a personal fall arrest system is based on its being attached 
to an anchoring system which does not reduce the strength of the system 
(such as a properly dimensioned eye-bolt/snap-hook anchorage). 
Therefore, if a means of attachment is used that will reduce the 
strength of the system, that component should be replaced by a stronger 
one, but one

[[Page 341]]

that will also maintain the appropriate maximum arrest force 
characteristics.
    (3) Tie-off using a knot in a rope lanyard or lifeline (at any 
location) can reduce the lifeline or lanyard strength by 50 percent or 
more. Therefore, a stronger lanyard or lifeline should be used to 
compensate for the weakening effect of the knot, or the lanyard length 
should be reduced (or the tie-off location raised) to minimize free fall 
distance, or the lanyard or lifeline should be replaced by one which has 
an appropriately incorporated connector to eliminate the need for a 
knot.
    (4) Tie-off of a rope lanyard or lifeline around an ``H'' or ``I'' 
beam or similar support can reduce its strength as much as 70 percent 
due to the cutting action of the beam edges. Therefore, use should be 
made of a webbing lanyard or wire core lifeline around the beam; or the 
lanyard or lifeline should be protected from the edge; or free fall 
distance should be greatly minimized.
    (5) Tie-off where the line passes over or around rough or sharp 
surfaces reduces strength drastically. Such a tie-off should be avoided 
or an alternative tie-off rigging should be used. Such alternatives may 
include use of a snap-hook/dee ring connection, wire rope tie-off, an 
effective padding of the surfaces, or an abrasion-resistance strap 
around or over the problem surface.
    (6) Horizontal lifelines may, depending on their geometry and angle 
of sag, be subjected to greater loads than the impact load imposed by an 
attached component. When the angle of horizontal lifeline sag is less 
than 30 degrees, the impact force imparted to the lifeline by an 
attached lanyard is greatly amplified. For example, with a sag angle of 
15 degrees, the force amplification is about 2:1 and at 5 degrees sag, 
it is about 6:1. Depending on the angle of sag, and the line's 
elasticity, the strength of the horizontal lifeline and the anchorages 
to which it is attached should be increased a number of times over that 
of the lanyard. Extreme care should be taken in considering a horizontal 
lifeline for multiple tie-offs. The reason for this is that in multiple 
tie-offs to a horizontal lifeline, if one employee falls, the movement 
of the falling employee and the horizontal lifeline during arrest of the 
fall may cause other employees to fall also. Horizontal lifeline and 
anchorage strength should be increased for each additional employee to 
be tied off. For these and other reasons, the design of systems using 
horizontal lifelines must only be done by qualified persons. Testing of 
installed lifelines and anchors prior to use is recommended.
    (7) The strength of an eye-bolt is rated along the axis of the bolt 
and its strength is greatly reduced if the force is applied at an angle 
to this axis (in the direction of shear). Also, care should be exercised 
in selecting the proper diameter of the eye to avoid accidental 
disengagement of snap-hooks not designed to be compatible for the 
connection.
    (8) Due to the significant reduction in the strength of the 
lifeline/lanyard (in some cases, as much as a 70 percent reduction), the 
sliding hitch knot (prusik) should not be used for lifeline/lanyard 
connections except in emergency situations where no other available 
system is practical. The ``one-and-one'' sliding hitch knot should never 
be used because it is unreliable in stopping a fall. The ``two-and-
two,'' or ``three-and-three'' knot (preferable) may be used in emergency 
situations; however, care should be taken to limit free fall distance to 
a minimum because of reduced lifeline/lanyard strength.
    (i) Vertical lifeline considerations. As required by the standard, 
each employee must have a separate lifeline [except employees engaged in 
constructing elevator shafts who are permitted to have two employees on 
one lifeline] when the lifeline is vertical. The reason for this is that 
in multiple tie-offs to a single lifeline, if one employee falls, the 
movement of the lifeline during the arrest of the fall may pull other 
employees' lanyards, causing them to fall as well.
    (j) Snap-hook considerations. (1) Although not required by this 
standard for all connections until January 1, 1998, locking snaphooks 
designed for connection to suitable objects (of sufficient strength) are 
highly recommended in lieu of the nonlocking type. Locking snaphooks 
incorporate a positive locking mechanism in addition to the spring 
loaded keeper, which will not allow the keeper to open under moderate 
pressure without someone first releasing the mechanism. Such a feature, 
properly designed, effectively prevents roll-out from occurring.
    (2) As required by Sec. 1926.502(d)(6), the following connections 
must be avoided (unless properly designed locking snaphooks are used) 
because they are conditions which can result in roll-out when a 
nonlocking snaphook is used:
    (i) Direct connection of a snaphook to a horizontal lifeline.
    (ii) Two (or more) snaphooks connected to one dee-ring.
    (iii) Two snaphooks connected to each other.
    (iv) A snaphook connected back on its integral lanyard.
    (v) A snaphook connected to a webbing loop or webbing lanyard.
    (vi) Improper dimensions of the dee-ring, rebar, or other connection 
point in relation to the snaphook dimensions which would allow the 
snaphook keeper to be depressed by a turning motion of the snaphook.
    (k) Free fall considerations. The employer and employee should at 
all times be aware that a system's maximum arresting force is evaluated 
under normal use conditions established by the manufacturer, and in no 
case using a free fall distance in excess of 6

[[Page 342]]

feet (1.8 m). A few extra feet of free fall can significantly increase 
the arresting force on the employee, possibly to the point of causing 
injury. Because of this, the free fall distance should be kept at a 
minimum, and, as required by the standard, in no case greater than 6 
feet (1.8 m). To help assure this, the tie-off attachment point to the 
lifeline or anchor should be located at or above the connection point of 
the fall arrest equipment to belt or harness. (Since otherwise 
additional free fall distance is added to the length of the connecting 
means (i.e. lanyard)). Attaching to the working surface will often 
result in a free fall greater than 6 feet (1.8 m). For instance, if a 6 
foot (1.8 m) lanyard is used, the total free fall distance will be the 
distance from the working level to the body belt (or harness) attachment 
point plus the 6 feet (1.8 m) of lanyard length. Another important 
consideration is that the arresting force which the fall system must 
withstand also goes up with greater distances of free fall, possibly 
exceeding the strength of the system.
    (l) Elongation and deceleration distance considerations. Other 
factors involved in a proper tie-off are elongation and deceleration 
distance. During the arresting of a fall, a lanyard will experience a 
length of stretching or elongation, whereas activation of a deceleration 
device will result in a certain stopping distance. These distances 
should be available with the lanyard or device's instructions and must 
be added to the free fall distance to arrive at the total fall distance 
before an employee is fully stopped. The additional stopping distance 
may be very significant if the lanyard or deceleration device is 
attached near or at the end of a long lifeline, which may itself add 
considerable distance due to its own elongation. As required by the 
standard, sufficient distance to allow for all of these factors must 
also be maintained between the employee and obstructions below, to 
prevent an injury due to impact before the system fully arrests the 
fall. In addition, a minimum of 12 feet (3.7 m) of lifeline should be 
allowed below the securing point of a rope grab type deceleration 
device, and the end terminated to prevent the device from sliding off 
the lifeline. Alternatively, the lifeline should extend to the ground or 
the next working level below. These measures are suggested to prevent 
the worker from inadvertently moving past the end of the lifeline and 
having the rope grab become disengaged from the lifeline.
    (m) Obstruction considerations. The location of the tie-off should 
also consider the hazard of obstructions in the potential fall path of 
the employee. Tie-offs which minimize the possibilities of exaggerated 
swinging should be considered. In addition, when a body belt is used, 
the employee's body will go through a horizontal position to a jack-
knifed position during the arrest of all falls. Thus, obstructions which 
might interfere with this motion should be avoided or a severe injury 
could occur.
    (n) Other considerations. Because of the design of some personal 
fall arrest systems, additional considerations may be required for 
proper tie-off. For example, heavy deceleration devices of the self-
retracting type should be secured overhead in order to avoid the weight 
of the device having to be supported by the employee. Also, if self- 
retracting equipment is connected to a horizontal lifeline, the sag in 
the lifeline should be minimized to prevent the device from sliding down 
the lifeline to a position which creates a swing hazard during fall 
arrest. In all cases, manufacturer's instructions should be followed.

           Appendix D to Subpart M--Positioning Device Systems

      Non-Mandatory Guidelines for Complying With Sec. 1926.502(e)

    I. Testing Methods For Positioning Device Systems. This appendix 
serves as a non-mandatory guideline to assist employers comply with the 
requirements for positioning device systems in Sec. 1926.502(e). 
Paragraphs (b), (c), (d) and (e) of Appendix C of subpart M relating to 
Sec. 1926.502(d)--Personal Fall Arrest Systems--set forth test 
procedures which may be used, along with the procedures listed below, to 
determine compliance with the requirements for positioning device 
systems in Sec. 1926.502(e) (3) and (4) of subpart M.
    (a) General. (1) Single strap positioning devices shall have one end 
attached to a fixed anchorage and the other end connected to a body belt 
or harness in the same manner as they would be used to protect 
employees. Double strap positioning devices, similar to window cleaner's 
belts, shall have one end of the strap attached to a fixed anchorage and 
the other end shall hang free. The body belt or harness shall be 
attached to the strap in the same manner as it would be used to protect 
employees. The two strap ends shall be adjusted to their maximum span.
    (2) The fixed anchorage shall be rigid, and shall not have a 
deflection greater than .04 inches (1 mm) when a force of 2,250 pounds 
(10 kN) is applied.
    (3) During the testing of all systems, a test weight of 250 pounds 
plus or minus 3 pounds (113 kg plus or minus 1.6 kg) shall be used. The 
weight shall be a rigid object with a girth of 38 inches plus or minus 4 
inches (96 cm plus or minus 10 cm).
    (4) Each test shall consist of dropping the specified weight one 
time without failure of the system being tested. A new system shall be 
used for each test.
    (5) The test weight for each test shall be hoisted exactly 4 feet 
(1.2 m above its ``at

[[Page 343]]

rest'' position), and shall be dropped so as to permit a vertical free 
fall of 4 feet (1.2 m).
    (6) The test is failed whenever any breakage or slippage occurs 
which permits the weight to fall free of the system.
    (7) Following the test, the system need not be capable of further 
operation; however, all such incapacities shall be readily apparent.
    II. Inspection Considerations. As required in Sec. 1926.502 (e)(5), 
positioning device systems must be regularly inspected. Any component 
with any significant defect, such as cuts, tears, abrasions, mold, or 
undue stretching; alterations or additions which might affect its 
efficiency; damage due to deterioration; contact with fire, acids, or 
other corrosives; distorted hooks or faulty hook springs; tongues 
unfitted to the shoulder of buckles; loose or damaged mountings; non-
functioning parts; or wearing or internal deterioration in the ropes 
must be withdrawn from service immediately, and should be tagged or 
marked as unusable, or destroyed.

          Appendix E to Subpart M--Sample Fall Protection Plan

      Non-Mandatory Guidelines for Complying With Sec. 1926.502(k)

    Employers engaged in leading edge work, precast concrete 
construction work and residential construction work who can demonstrate 
that it is infeasible or creates a greater hazard to use conventional 
fall protection systems must develop and follow a fall protection plan. 
Below are sample fall protection plans developed for precast concrete 
construction and residential work that could be tailored to be site 
specific for other precast concrete or residential jobsite. This sample 
plan can be modified to be used for other work involving leading edge 
work. The sample plan outlines the elements that must be addressed in 
any fall protection plan. The reasons outlined in this sample fall 
protection plan are for illustrative purposes only and are not 
necessarily a valid, acceptable rationale (unless the conditions at the 
job site are the same as those covered by these sample plans) for not 
using conventional fall protection systems for a particular precast 
concrete or residential construction worksite. However, the sample plans 
provide guidance to employers on the type of information that is 
required to be discussed in fall protection plans.

                      Sample Fall Protection Plans

     Fall Protection Plan For Precast/Prestress Concrete Structures

    This Fall Protection Plan is specific for the following project:

 Location of Job________________________________________________________
 Erecting Company_______________________________________________________
 Date Plan Prepared or Modified_________________________________________
 Plan Prepared By_______________________________________________________
 Plan Approved By_______________________________________________________
 Plan Supervised By_____________________________________________________
    The following Fall Protection Plan is a sample program prepared for 
the prevention of injuries associated with falls. A Fall Protection Plan 
must be developed and evaluated on a site by site basis. It is 
recommended that erectors discuss the written Fall Protection Plan with 
their OSHA Area Office prior to going on a jobsite.

                     I. Statement of Company Policy

    (Company Name) is dedicated to the protection of its employees from 
on-the-job injuries. All employees of (Company Name) have the 
responsibility to work safely on the job. The purpose of this plan is: 
(a) To supplement our standard safety policy by providing safety 
standards specifically designed to cover fall protection on this job 
and; (b) to ensure that each employee is trained and made aware of the 
safety provisions which are to be implemented by this plan prior to the 
start of erection.
    This Fall Protection Plan addresses the use of other than 
conventional fall protection at a number of areas on the project, as 
well as identifying specific activities that require non-conventional 
means of fall protection. These areas include:
    a. Connecting activity (point of erection).
    b. Leading edge work.
    c. Unprotected sides or edge.
    d. Grouting.
    This plan is designed to enable employers and employees to recognize 
the fall hazards on this job and to establish the procedures that are to 
be followed in order to prevent falls to lower levels or through holes 
and openings in walking/working surfaces. Each employee will be trained 
in these procedures and strictly adhere to them except when doing so 
would expose the employee to a greater hazard. If, in the employees 
opinion, this is the case, the employee is to notify the foreman of the 
concern and the concern addressed before proceeding.
    Safety policy and procedure on any one project cannot be 
administered, implemented, monitored and enforced by any one individual. 
The total objective of a safe, accident free work environment can only 
be accomplished by a dedicated, concerted effort by every individual 
involved with the project from management down to the last employee. 
Each employee must understand their value to the company; the costs of 
accidents, both monetary, physical, and emotional; the objective of the 
safety policy and procedures; the safety rules that apply to the safety 
policy and procedures; and what their individual role is in 
administering, implementing, monitoring, and compliance of

[[Page 344]]

their safety policy and procedures. This allows for a more personal 
approach to compliance through planning, training, understanding and 
cooperative effort, rather than by strict enforcement. If for any reason 
an unsafe act persists, strict enforcement will be implemented.
    It is the responsibility of (name of competent person) to implement 
this Fall Protection Plan. (Name of Competent Person) is responsible for 
continual observational safety checks of their work operations and to 
enforce the safety policy and procedures. The foreman also is 
responsible to correct any unsafe acts or conditions immediately. It is 
the responsibility of the employee to understand and adhere to the 
procedures of this plan and to follow the instructions of the foreman. 
It is also the responsibility of the employee to bring to managements 
attention any unsafe or hazardous conditions or acts that may cause 
injury to either themselves or any other employees. Any changes to this 
Fall Protection Plan must be approved by (name of Qualified Person).

         II. Fall Protection Systems to Be Used on This Project

    Where conventional fall protection is infeasible or creates a 
greater hazard at the leading edge and during initial connecting 
activity, we plan to do this work using a safety monitoring system and 
expose only a minimum number of employees for the time necessary to 
actually accomplish the job. The maximum number of workers to be 
monitored by one safety monitor is six (6). We are designating the 
following trained employees as designated erectors and they are 
permitted to enter the controlled access zones and work without the use 
of conventional fall protection.

Safety monitor:
Designated erector:
Designated erector:
Designated erector:
Designated erector:
Designated erector:
Designated erector:

    The safety monitor shall be identified by wearing an orange hard 
hat. The designated erectors will be identified by one of the following 
methods:
    1. They will wear a blue colored arm band, or
    2. They will wear a blue colored hard hat, or
    3. They will wear a blue colored vest.

Only individuals with the appropriate experience, skills, and training 
will be authorized as designated erectors. All employees that will be 
working as designated erectors under the safety monitoring system shall 
have been trained and instructed in the following areas:
    1. Recognition of the fall hazards in the work area (at the leading 
edge and when making initial connections--point of erection).
    2. Avoidance of fall hazards using established work practices which 
have been made known to the employees.
    3. Recognition of unsafe practices or working conditions that could 
lead to a fall, such as windy conditions.
    4. The function, use, and operation of safety monitoring systems, 
guardrail systems, body belt/harness systems, control zones and other 
protection to be used.
    5. The correct procedure for erecting, maintaining, disassembling 
and inspecting the system(s) to be used.
    6. Knowledge of construction sequence or the erection plan.
    A conference will take place prior to starting work involving all 
members of the erection crew, crane crew and supervisors of any other 
concerned contractors. This conference will be conducted by the precast 
concrete erection supervisor in charge of the project. During the pre-
work conference, erection procedures and sequences pertinent to this job 
will be thoroughly discussed and safety practices to be used throughout 
the project will be specified. Further, all personnel will be informed 
that the controlled access zones are off limits to all personnel other 
than those designated erectors specifically trained to work in that 
area.

                        Safety Monitoring System

    A safety monitoring system means a fall protection system in which a 
competent person is responsible for recognizing and warning employees of 
fall hazards. The duties of the safety monitor are to:
    1. Warn by voice when approaching the open edge in an unsafe manner.
    2. Warn by voice if there is a dangerous situation developing which 
cannot be seen by another person involved with product placement, such 
as a member getting out of control.
    3. Make the designated erectors aware they are in a dangerous area.
    4. Be competent in recognizing fall hazards.
    5. Warn employees when they appear to be unaware of a fall hazard or 
are acting in an unsafe manner.
    6. Be on the same walking/working surface as the monitored employees 
and within visual sighting distance of the monitored employees.
    7. Be close enough to communicate orally with the employees.
    8. Not allow other responsibilities to encumber monitoring. If the 
safety monitor becomes too encumbered with other responsibilities, the 
monitor shall (1) stop the erection process; and (2) turn over other 
responsibilities to a designated erector; or (3) turn

[[Page 345]]

over the safety monitoring function to another designated, competent 
person. The safety monitoring system shall not be used when the wind is 
strong enough to cause loads with large surface areas to swing out of 
radius, or result in loss of control of the load, or when weather 
conditions cause the walking-working surfaces to become icy or slippery.

                           Control Zone System

    A controlled access zone means an area designated and clearly 
marked, in which leading edge work may take place without the use of 
guardrail, safety net or personal fall arrest systems to protect the 
employees in the area. Control zone systems shall comply with the 
following provisions:
    1. When used to control access to areas where leading edge and other 
operations are taking place the controlled access zone shall be defined 
by a control line or by any other means that restricts access.
    When control lines are used, they shall be erected not less than 6 
feet (l.8 m) nor more than 60 feet (18 m) or half the length of the 
member being erected, whichever is less, from the leading edge.
    2. The control line shall extend along the entire length of the 
unprotected or leading edge and shall be approximately parallel to the 
unprotected or leading edge.
    3. The control line shall be connected on each side to a guardrail 
system or wall.
    4. Control lines shall consist of ropes, wires, tapes, or equivalent 
materials, and supporting stanchions as follows:
    5. Each line shall be flagged or otherwise clearly marked at not 
more than 6-foot (1.8 m) intervals with high- visibility material.
    6. Each line shall be rigged and supported in such a way that its 
lowest point (including sag) is not less than 39 inches (1 m) from the 
walking/working surface and its highest point is not more than 45 inches 
(1.3 m) from the walking/working surface.
    7. Each line shall have a minimum breaking strength of 200 pounds 
(.88 kN).

                                  Holes

    All openings greater than 12 in. x 12 in. will have perimeter 
guarding or covering. All predetermined holes will have the plywood 
covers made in the precasters' yard and shipped with the member to the 
jobsite. Prior to cutting holes on the job, proper protection for the 
hole must be provided to protect the workers. Perimeter guarding or 
covers will not be removed without the approval of the erection foreman.
    Precast concrete column erection through the existing deck requires 
that many holes be provided through this deck. These are to be covered 
and protected. Except for the opening being currently used to erect a 
column, all opening protection is to be left undisturbed. The opening 
being uncovered to erect a column will become part of the point of 
erection and will be addressed as part of this Fall Protection Plan. 
This uncovering is to be done at the erection foreman's direction and 
will only occur immediately prior to ``feeding'' the column through the 
opening. Once the end of the column is through the slab opening, there 
will no longer exist a fall hazard at this location.

               III. Implementation of Fall Protection Plan

    The structure being erected is a multistory total precast concrete 
building consisting of columns, beams, wall panels and hollow core slabs 
and double tee floor and roof members.
    The following is a list of the products and erection situations on 
this job:

                                 Columns

    For columns 10 ft to 36 ft long, employees disconnecting crane hooks 
from columns will work from a ladder and wear a body belt/harness with 
lanyard and be tied off when both hands are needed to disconnect. For 
tying off, a vertical lifeline will be connected to the lifting eye at 
the top of the column, prior to lifting, to be used with a manually 
operated or mobile rope grab. For columns too high for the use of a 
ladder, 36 ft and higher, an added cable will be used to reduce the 
height of the disconnecting point so that a ladder can be used. This 
cable will be left in place until a point in erection that it can be 
removed safely. In some cases, columns will be unhooked from the crane 
by using an erection tube or shackle with a pull pin which is released 
from the ground after the column is stabilized.
    The column will be adequately connected and/or braced to safely 
support the weight of a ladder with an employee on it.

                           Inverted Tee Beams

    Employees erecting inverted tee beams, at a height of 6 to 40 ft, 
will erect the beam, make initial connections, and final alignment from 
a ladder. If the employee needs to reach over the side of the beam to 
bar or make an adjustment to the alignment of the beam, they will mount 
the beam and be tied off to the lifting device in the beam after 
ensuring the load has been stabilized on its bearing. To disconnect the 
crane from the beam an employee will stand a ladder against the beam. 
Because the use of ladders is not practical at heights above 40 ft, 
beams will be initially placed with the use of tag lines and their final 
alignment made by a person on a manlift or similar employee positioning 
systems.

                             Spandrel Beams

    Spandrel beams at the exterior of the building will be aligned as 
closely as possible

[[Page 346]]

with the use of tag lines with the final placement of the spandrel beam 
made from a ladder at the open end of the structure. A ladder will be 
used to make the initial connections and a ladder will be used to 
disconnect the crane. The other end of the beam will be placed by the 
designated erector from the double tee deck under the observation of the 
safety monitor.
    The beams will be adequately connected and/or braced to safely 
support the weight of a ladder with an employee on it.

                         Floor and Roof Members

    During installation of the precast concrete floor and/or roof 
members, the work deck continuously increases in area as more and more 
units are being erected and positioned. Thus, the unprotected floor/roof 
perimeter is constantly modified with the leading edge changing location 
as each member is installed. The fall protection for workers at the 
leading edge shall be assured by properly constructed and maintained 
control zone lines not more than 60 ft away from the leading edge 
supplemented by a safety monitoring system to ensure the safety of all 
designated erectors working within the area defined by the control zone 
lines.
    The hollow core slabs erected on the masonry portion of the building 
will be erected and grouted using the safety monitoring system. Grout 
will be placed in the space between the end of the slab and face shell 
of the concrete masonry by dumping from a wheelbarrow. The grout in the 
keyways between the slabs will be dumped from a wheelbarrow and then 
spread with long handled tools, allowing the worker to stand erect 
facing toward the unprotected edge and back from any work deck edge.
    Whenever possible, the designated erectors will approach the 
incoming member at the leading edge only after it is below waist height 
so that the member itself provides protection against falls.
    Except for the situations described below, when the arriving floor 
or roof member is within 2 to 3 inches of its final position, the 
designated erectors can then proceed to their position of erection at 
each end of the member under the control of the safety monitor. Crane 
hooks will be unhooked from double tee members by designated erectors 
under the direction and supervision of the safety monitor.
    Designated erectors, while waiting for the next floor or roof 
member, will be constantly under the control of the safety monitor for 
fall protection and are directed to stay a minimum of six (6) ft from 
the edge. In the event a designated erector must move from one end of a 
member, which has just been placed at the leading edge, they must first 
move away from the leading edge a minimum of six (6) ft and then 
progress to the other end while maintaining the minimum distance of six 
(6) ft at all times.
    Erection of double tees, where conditions require bearing of one end 
into a closed pocket and the other end on a beam ledge, restricting the 
tee legs from going directly into the pockets, require special 
considerations. The tee legs that are to bear in the closed pocket must 
hang lower than those at the beam bearing. The double tee will be ``two-
lined'' in order to elevate one end higher than the other to allow for 
the low end to be ducked into the closed pocket using the following 
procedure.
    The double tee will be rigged with a standard four-way spreader off 
of the main load line. An additional choker will be attached to the 
married point of the two-legged spreader at the end of the tee that is 
to be elevated. The double tee will be hoisted with the main load line 
and swung into a position as close as possible to the tee's final 
bearing elevation. When the tee is in this position and stabilized, the 
whip line load block will be lowered to just above the tee deck. At this 
time, two erectors will walk out on the suspended tee deck at midspan of 
the tee member and pull the load block to the end of the tee to be 
elevated and attach the additional choker to the load block. The 
possibility of entanglement with the crane lines and other obstacles 
during this two lining process while raising and lowering the crane 
block on that second line could be hazardous to an encumbered employee. 
Therefore, the designated erectors will not tie off during any part of 
this process. While the designated erectors are on the double tee, the 
safety monitoring system will be used. After attaching the choker, the 
two erectors then step back on the previously erected tee deck and 
signal the crane operator to hoist the load with the whip line to the 
elevation that will allow for enough clearance to let the low end tee 
legs slide into the pockets when the main load line is lowered. The 
erector, who is handling the lowered end of the tee at the closed pocket 
bearing, will step out on the suspended tee. An erection bar will then 
be placed between the end of the tee leg and the inside face of the 
pocketed spandrel member. The tee is barred away from the pocketed 
member to reduce the friction and lateral force against the pocketed 
member. As the tee is being lowered, the other erector remains on the 
tee which was previously erected to handle the other end. At this point 
the tee is slowly lowered by the crane to a point where the tee legs can 
freely slide into the pockets. The erector working the lowered end of 
the tee must keep pressure on the bar between the tee and the face of 
the pocketed spandrel member to very gradually let the tee legs slide 
into the pocket to its proper bearing dimension. The tee is then slowly 
lowered into its final erected position.

[[Page 347]]

    The designated erector should be allowed onto the suspended double 
tee, otherwise there is no control over the horizontal movement of the 
double tee and this movement could knock the spandrel off of its bearing 
or the column out of plumb. The control necessary to prevent hitting the 
spandrel can only be done safely from the top of the double tee being 
erected.
    Loadbearing Wall Panels: The erection of the loadbearing wall panels 
on the elevated decks requires the use of a safety monitor and a 
controlled access zone that is a minimum of 25 ft and a maximum of \1/2\ 
the length of the wall panels away from the unprotected edge, so that 
designated erectors can move freely and unencumbered when receiving the 
panels. Bracing, if required for stability, will be installed by ladder. 
After the braces are secured, the crane will be disconnected from the 
wall by using a ladder. The wall to wall connections will also be 
performed from a ladder.
    Non-Loadbearing Panels (Cladding): The locating of survey lines, 
panel layout and other installation prerequisites (prewelding, etc.) for 
non-loadbearing panels (cladding) will not commence until floor 
perimeter and floor openings have been protected. In some areas, it is 
necessary because of panel configuration to remove the perimeter 
protection as the cladding is being installed. Removal of perimeter 
protection will be performed on a bay to bay basis, just ahead of 
cladding erection to minimize temporarily unprotected floor edges. Those 
workers within 6 ft of the edge, receiving and positioning the cladding 
when the perimeter protection is removed shall be tied off.

                                Detailing

    Employees exposed to falls of six (6) feet or more to lower levels, 
who are not actively engaged in leading edge work or connecting 
activity, such as welding, bolting, cutting, bracing, guying, patching, 
painting or other operations, and who are working less than six (6) ft 
from an unprotected edge will be tied off at all times or guardrails 
will be installed. Employees engaged in these activities but who are 
more than six (6) ft from an unprotected edge as defined by the control 
zone lines, do not require fall protection but a warning line or control 
lines must be erected to remind employees they are approaching an area 
where fall protection is required.

IV. Conventional Fall Protection Considered for the Point of Erection or 
                    Leading Edge Erection Operations

                     A. Personal Fall Arrest Systems

    In this particular erection sequence and procedure, personal fall 
arrest systems requiring body belt/harness systems, lifelines and 
lanyards will not reduce possible hazards to workers and will create 
offsetting hazards during their usage at the leading edge of precast/
prestressed concrete construction.
    Leading edge erection and initial connections are conducted by 
employees who are specifically trained to do this type of work and are 
trained to recognize the fall hazards. The nature of such work normally 
exposes the employee to the fall hazard for a short period of time and 
installation of fall protection systems for a short duration is not 
feasible because it exposes the installers of the system to the same 
fall hazard, but for a longer period of time.
    1. It is necessary that the employee be able to move freely without 
encumbrance in order to guide the sections of precast concrete into 
their final position without having lifelines attached which will 
restrict the employees ability to move about at the point of erection.
    2. A typical procedure requires 2 or more workers to maneuver around 
each other as a concrete member is positioned to fit into the structure. 
If they are each attached to a lifeline, part of their attention must be 
diverted from their main task of positioning a member weighing several 
tons to the task of avoiding entanglements of their lifelines or 
avoiding tripping over lanyards. Therefore, if these workers are 
attached to lanyards, more fall potential would result than from not 
using such a device.
    In this specific erection sequence and procedure, retractable 
lifelines do not solve the problem of two workers becoming tangled. In 
fact, such a tangle could prevent the lifeline from retracting as the 
worker moved, thus potentially exposing the worker to a fall greater 
than 6 ft. Also, a worker crossing over the lifeline of another worker 
can create a hazard because the movement of one person can unbalance the 
other. In the event of a fall by one person there is a likelihood that 
the other person will be caused to fall as well. In addition, if 
contamination such as grout (during hollow core grouting) enters the 
retractable housing it can cause excessive wear and damage to the device 
and could clog the retracting mechanism as the lanyard is dragged across 
the deck. Obstructing the cable orifice can defeat the devices shock 
absorbing function, produce cable slack and damage, and adversely affect 
cable extraction and retraction.
    3. Employees tied to a lifeline can be trapped and crushed by moving 
structural members if the employee becomes restrained by the lanyard or 
retractable lifeline and cannot get out of the path of the moving load.
    The sudden movement of a precast concrete member being raised by a 
crane can be caused by a number of factors. When this happens, a 
connector may immediately have to move a considerable distance to avoid 
injury. If a tied off body belt/harness is being

[[Page 348]]

used, the connector could be trapped. Therefore, there is a greater risk 
of injury if the connector is tied to the structure for this specific 
erection sequence and procedure.
    When necessary to move away from a retractable device, the worker 
cannot move at a rate greater than the device locking speed typically 
3.5 to 4.5 ft/sec. When moving toward the device it is necessary to move 
at a rate which does not permit cable slack to build up. This slack may 
cause cable retraction acceleration and cause a worker to lose their 
balance by applying a higher than normal jerking force on the body when 
the cable suddenly becomes taut after building up momentum. This slack 
can also cause damage to the internal spring-loaded drum, uneven coiling 
of cable on the drum, and possible cable damage.
    The factors causing sudden movements for this location include:

                               (a) Cranes

    (1) Operator error.
    (2) Site conditions (soft or unstable ground).
    (3) Mechanical failure.
    (4) Structural failure.
    (5) Rigging failure.
    (6) Crane signal/radio communication failure.

                         (b) Weather Conditions

    (1) Wind (strong wind/sudden gusting)--particularly a problem with 
the large surface areas of precast concrete members.
    (2) Snow/rain (visibility).
    (3) Fog (visibility).
    (4) Cold--causing slowed reactions or mechanical problems.
    (c) Structure/Product Conditions.
    (1) Lifting Eye failure.
    (2) Bearing failure or slippage.
    (3) Structure shifting.
    (4) Bracing failure.
    (5) Product failure.
    (d) Human Error.
    (1) Incorrect tag line procedure.
    (2) Tag line hang-up.
    (3) Incorrect or misunderstood crane signals.
    (4) Misjudged elevation of member.
    (5) Misjudged speed of member.
    (6) Misjudged angle of member.
    4. Anchorages or special attachment points could be cast into the 
precast concrete members if sufficient preplanning and consideration of 
erectors position is done before the members are cast. Any hole or other 
attachment must be approved by the engineer who designed the member. It 
is possible that some design restrictions will not allow a member to be 
weakened by an additional hole; however, it is anticipated that such 
situations would be the exception, not the rule. Attachment points, 
other than on the deck surface, will require removal and/or patching. In 
order to remove and/or patch these points, requires the employee to be 
exposed to an additional fall hazard at an unprotected perimeter. The 
fact that attachment points could be available anywhere on the structure 
does not eliminate the hazards of using these points for tying off as 
discussed above. A logical point for tying off on double tees would be 
using the lifting loops, except that they must be cut off to eliminate a 
tripping hazard at an appropriate time.
    5. Providing attachment at a point above the walking/working surface 
would also create fall exposures for employees installing their devices. 
Final positioning of a precast concrete member requires it to be moved 
in such a way that it must pass through the area that would be occupied 
by the lifeline and the lanyards attached to the point above. Resulting 
entanglements of lifelines and lanyards on a moving member could pull 
employees from the work surface. Also, the structure is being created 
and, in most cases, there is no structure above the members being 
placed.
    (a) Temporary structural supports, installed to provide attaching 
points for lifelines limit the space which is essential for orderly 
positioning, alignment and placement of the precast concrete members. To 
keep the lanyards a reasonable and manageable length, lifeline supports 
would necessarily need to be in proximity to the positioning process. A 
sudden shift of the precast concrete member being positioned because of 
wind pressure or crane movement could make it strike the temporary 
supporting structure, moving it suddenly and causing tied off employees 
to fall.
    (b) The time in manhours which would be expended in placing and 
maintaining temporary structural supports for lifeline attaching points 
could exceed the expended manhours involved in placing the precast 
concrete members. No protection could be provided for the employees 
erecting the temporary structural supports and these supports would have 
to be moved for each successive step in the construction process, thus 
greatly increasing the employees exposure to the fall hazard.
    (c) The use of a cable strung horizontally between two columns to 
provide tie off lines for erecting or walking a beam for connecting work 
is not feasible and creates a greater hazard on this multi-story 
building for the following reasons:
    (1) If a connector is to use such a line, it must be installed 
between the two columns. To perform this installation requires an 
erector to have more fall exposure time attaching the cable to the 
columns than would be spent to make the beam to column connection 
itself.
    (2) If such a line is to be installed so that an erector can walk 
along a beam, it must be

[[Page 349]]

overhead or below him. For example, if a connector must walk along a 24 
in. wide beam, the presence of a line next to the connector at waist 
level, attached directly to the columns, would prevent the connector 
from centering their weight over the beam and balancing themselves. 
Installing the line above the connector might be possible on the first 
level of a two-story column; however, the column may extend only a few 
feet above the floor level at the second level or be flush with the 
floor level. Attaching the line to the side of the beam could be a 
solution; however, it would require the connector to attach the lanyard 
below foot level which would most likely extend a fall farther than 6 
ft.
    (3) When lines are strung over every beam, it becomes more and more 
difficult for the crane operator to lower a precast concrete member into 
position without the member becoming fouled. Should the member become 
entangled, it could easily dislodge the line from a column. If a worker 
is tied to it at the time, a fall could be caused.
    6. The ANSI A10.14-1991 American National Standard for Construction 
and Demolition Operations--Requirements for Safety Belts, Harnesses, 
Lanyards and Lifelines for Construction and Demolition Use, states that 
the anchor point of a lanyard or deceleration device should, if 
possible, be located above the wearer's belt or harness attachment. ANSI 
A10.14 also states that a suitable anchorage point is one which is 
located as high as possible to prevent contact with an obstruction below 
should the worker fall. Most manufacturers also warn in the user's 
handbook that the safety block/retractable lifeline must be positioned 
above the D-ring (above the work space of the intended user) and OSHA 
recommends that fall arrest and restraint equipment be used in 
accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
    Attachment of a retractable device to a horizontal cable near floor 
level or using the inserts in the floor or roof members may result in 
increased free fall due to the dorsal D-ring of the full-body harness 
riding higher than the attachment point of the snaphook to the cable or 
insert (e.g., 6 foot tall worker with a dorsal D-ring at 5 feet above 
the floor or surface, reduces the working length to only one foot, by 
placing the anchorage five feet away from the fall hazard). In addition, 
impact loads may exceed maximum fall arrest forces (MAF) because the 
fall arrest D-ring would be 4 to 5 feet higher than the safety block/
retractable lifeline anchored to the walking-working surface; and the 
potential for swing hazards is increased.
    Manufacturers also require that workers not work at a level where 
the point of snaphook attachment to the body harness is above the device 
because this will increase the free fall distance and the deceleration 
distance and will cause higher forces on the body in the event of an 
accidental fall.
    Manufacturers recommend an anchorage for the retractable lifeline 
which is immovably fixed in space and is independent of the user's 
support systems. A moveable anchorage is one which can be moved around 
(such as equipment or wheeled vehicles) or which can deflect 
substantially under shock loading (such as a horizontal cable or very 
flexible beam). In the case of a very flexible anchorage, a shock load 
applied to the anchorage during fall arrest can cause oscillation of the 
flexible anchorage such that the retractable brake mechanism may undergo 
one or more cycles of locking/unlocking/locking (ratchet effect) until 
the anchorage deflection is dampened. Therefore, use of a moveable 
anchorage involves critical engineering and safety factors and should 
only be considered after fixed anchorage has been determined to be not 
feasible.
    Horizontal cables used as an anchorage present an additional hazard 
due to amplification of the horizontal component of maximum arrest force 
(of a fall) transmitted to the points where the horizontal cable is 
attached to the structure. This amplification is due to the angle of sag 
of a horizontal cable and is most severe for small angles of sag. For a 
cable sag angle of 2 degrees the horizontal force on the points of cable 
attachment can be amplified by a factor of 15.
    It is also necessary to install the retractable device vertically 
overhead to minimize swing falls. If an object is in the worker's swing 
path (or that of the cable) hazardous situations exist: (1) due to the 
swing, horizontal speed of the user may be high enough to cause injury 
when an obstacle in the swing fall path is struck by either the user or 
the cable; (2) the total vertical fall distance of the user may be much 
greater than if the user had fallen only vertically without a swing fall 
path.
    With retractable lines, overconfidence may cause the worker to 
engage in inappropriate behavior, such as approaching the perimeter of a 
floor or roof at a distance appreciably greater than the shortest 
distance between the anchorage point and the leading edge. Though the 
retractable lifeline may arrest a worker's fall before he or she has 
fallen a few feet, the lifeline may drag along the edge of the floor or 
beam and swing the worker like a pendulum until the line has moved to a 
position where the distance between the anchorage point and floor edge 
is the shortest distance between those two points. Accompanying this 
pendulum swing is a lowering of the worker, with the attendant danger 
that he or she may violently impact the floor or some obstruction below.
    The risk of a cable breaking is increased if a lifeline is dragged 
sideways across the rough surface or edge of a concrete member at the 
same moment that the lifeline is

[[Page 350]]

being subjected to a maximum impact loading during a fall. The typical 
\3/16\ in. cable in a retractable lifeline has a breaking strength of 
from 3000 to 3700 lbs.
    7. The competent person, who can take into account the specialized 
operations being performed on this project, should determine when and 
where a designated erector cannot use a personal fall arrest system.

                          B. Safety Net Systems

    The nature of this particular precast concrete erection worksite 
precludes the safe use of safety nets where point of erection or leading 
edge work must take place.
    1. To install safety nets in the interior high bay of the single 
story portion of the building poses rigging attachment problems. 
Structural members do not exist to which supporting devices for nets can 
be attached in the area where protection is required. As the erection 
operation advances, the location of point of erection or leading edge 
work changes constantly as each member is attached to the structure. Due 
to this constant change it is not feasible to set net sections and build 
separate structures to support the nets.
    2. The nature of the erection process for the precast concrete 
members is such that an installed net would protect workers as they 
position and secure only one structural member. After each member is 
stabilized the net would have to be moved to a new location (this could 
mean a move of 8 to 10 ft or the possibility of a move to a different 
level or area of the structure) to protect workers placing the next 
piece in the construction sequence. The result would be the installation 
and dismantling of safety nets repeatedly throughout the normal work 
day. As the time necessary to install a net, test, and remove it is 
significantly greater than the time necessary to position and secure a 
precast concrete member, the exposure time for the worker installing the 
safety net would be far longer than for the workers whom the net is 
intended to protect. The time exposure repeats itself each time the nets 
and supporting hardware must be moved laterally or upward to provide 
protection at the point of erection or leading edge.
    3. Strict interpretation of Sec. 1926.502(c) requires that 
operations shall not be undertaken until the net is in place and has 
been tested. With the point of erection constantly changing, the time 
necessary to install and test a safety net significantly exceeds the 
time necessary to position and secure the concrete member.
    4. Use of safety nets on exposed perimeter wall openings and 
opensided floors, causes attachment points to be left in architectural 
concrete which must be patched and filled with matching material after 
the net supporting hardware is removed. In order to patch these 
openings, additional numbers of employees must be suspended by swing 
stages, boatswain chairs or other devices, thereby increasing the amount 
of fall exposure time to employees.
    5. Installed safety nets pose an additional hazard at the perimeter 
of the erected structure where limited space is available in which 
members can be turned after being lifted from the ground by the crane. 
There would be a high probability that the member being lifted could 
become entangled in net hardware, cables, etc.
    6. The use of safety nets where structural wall panels are being 
erected would prevent movement of panels to point of installation. To be 
effective, nets would necessarily have to provide protection across the 
area where structural supporting wall panels would be set and plumbed 
before roof units could be placed.
    7. Use of a tower crane for the erection of the high rise portion of 
the structure poses a particular hazard in that the crane operator 
cannot see or judge the proximity of the load in relation to the 
structure or nets. If the signaler is looking through nets and 
supporting structural devices while giving instructions to the crane 
operator, it is not possible to judge precise relationships between the 
load and the structure itself or to nets and supporting structural 
devices. This could cause the load to become entangled in the net or hit 
the structure causing potential damage.

                          C. Guardrail Systems

    On this particular worksite, guardrails, barricades, ropes, cables 
or other perimeter guarding devices or methods on the erection floor 
will pose problems to safe erection procedures. Typically, a floor or 
roof is erected by placing 4 to 10 ft wide structural members next to 
one another and welding or grouting them together. The perimeter of a 
floor and roof changes each time a new member is placed into position. 
It is unreasonable and virtually impossible to erect guardrails and toe 
boards at the ever changing leading edge of a floor or roof.
    1. To position a member safely it is necessary to remove all 
obstructions extending above the floor level near the point of erection. 
Such a procedure allows workers to swing a new member across the erected 
surface as necessary to position it properly without worrying about 
knocking material off of this surface.
    Hollow core slab erection on the masonry wall requires installation 
of the perimeter protection where the masonry wall has to be 
constructed. This means the guardrail is installed then subsequently 
removed to continue the masonry construction. The erector will be 
exposed to a fall hazard for a longer period of time while installing 
and removing perimeter protection than while erecting the slabs.

[[Page 351]]

    In hollow core work, as in other precast concrete erection, others 
are not typically on the work deck until the precast concrete erection 
is complete. The deck is not complete until the leveling, aligning, and 
grouting of the joints is done. It is normal practice to keep others off 
the deck until at least the next day after the installation is complete 
to allow the grout to harden.
    2. There is no permanent boundary until all structural members have 
been placed in the floor or roof. At the leading edge, workers are 
operating at the temporary edge of the structure as they work to 
position the next member in the sequence. Compliance with the standard 
would require a guardrail and toe board be installed along this edge. 
However, the presence of such a device would prevent a new member from 
being swung over the erected surface low enough to allow workers to 
control it safely during the positioning process. Further, these 
employees would have to work through the guardrail to align the new 
member and connect it to the structure. The guardrail would not protect 
an employee who must lean through it to do the necessary work, rather it 
would hinder the employee to such a degree that a greater hazard is 
created than if the guardrail were absent.
    3. Guardrail requirements pose a hazard at the leading edge of 
installed floor or roof sections by creating the possibility of 
employees being caught between guardrails and suspended loads. The lack 
of a clear work area in which to guide the suspended load into position 
for placement and welding of members into the existing structure creates 
still further hazards.
    4. Where erection processes require precast concrete stairways or 
openings to be installed as an integral part of the overall erection 
process, it must also be recognized that guardrails or handrails must 
not project above the surface of the erection floor. Such guardrails 
should be terminated at the level of the erection floor to avoid placing 
hazardous obstacles in the path of a member being positioned.

        V. Other Fall Protection Measures Considered for This Job

    The following is a list and explanation of other fall protection 
measures available and an explanation of limitations for use on this 
particular jobsite. If during the course of erecting the building the 
employee sees an area that could be erected more safely by the use of 
these fall protection measures, the foreman should be notified.
    A. Scaffolds are not used because:
    1. The leading edge of the building is constantly changing and the 
scaffolding would have to be moved at very frequent intervals. Employees 
erecting and dismantling the scaffolding would be exposed to fall 
hazards for a greater length of time than they would by merely erecting 
the precast concrete member.
    2. A scaffold tower could interfere with the safe swinging of a load 
by the crane.
    3. Power lines, terrain and site do not allow for the safe use of 
scaffolding.
    B. Vehicle mounted platforms are not used because:
    1. A vehicle mounted platform will not reach areas on the deck that 
are erected over other levels.
    2. The leading edge of the building is usually over a lower level of 
the building and this lower level will not support the weight of a 
vehicle mounted platform.
    3. A vehicle mounted platform could interfere with the safe swinging 
of a load by the crane, either by the crane swinging the load over or 
into the equipment.
    4. Power lines and surrounding site work do not allow for the safe 
use of a vehicle mounted platform.
    C. Crane suspended personnel platforms are not used because:
    1. A second crane close enough to suspend any employee in the 
working and erecting area could interfere with the safe swinging of a 
load by the crane hoisting the product to be erected.
    2. Power lines and surrounding site work do not allow for the safe 
use of a second crane on the job.

                             VI. Enforcement

    Constant awareness of and respect for fall hazards, and compliance 
with all safety rules are considered conditions of employment. The 
jobsite Superintendent, as well as individuals in the Safety and 
Personnel Department, reserve the right to issue disciplinary warnings 
to employees, up to and including termination, for failure to follow the 
guidelines of this program.

                      VII. Accident Investigations

    All accidents that result in injury to workers, regardless of their 
nature, shall be investigated and reported. It is an integral part of 
any safety program that documentation take place as soon as possible so 
that the cause and means of prevention can be identified to prevent a 
reoccurrence.
    In the event that an employee falls or there is some other related, 
serious incident occurring, this plan shall be reviewed to determine if 
additional practices, procedures, or training need to be implemented to 
prevent similar types of falls or incidents from occurring.

                          VIII. Changes to Plan

    Any changes to the plan will be approved by (name of the qualified 
person). This plan shall be reviewed by a qualified person as the job 
progresses to determine if additional practices, procedures or training 
needs to be

[[Page 352]]

implemented by the competent person to improve or provide additional 
fall protection. Workers shall be notified and trained, if necessary, in 
the new procedures. A copy of this plan and all approved changes shall 
be maintained at the jobsite.

        Sample Fall Protection Plan for Residential Construction

                          (Insert Company Name)

    This Fall Protection Plan Is Specific For The Following Project:

 Location of Job________________________________________________________
 Date Plan Prepared or Modified_________________________________________
 Plan Prepared By_______________________________________________________
 Plan Approved By_______________________________________________________
 Plan Supervised By_____________________________________________________
    The following Fall Protection Plan is a sample program prepared for 
the prevention of injuries associated with falls. A Fall Protection Plan 
must be developed and evaluated on a site by site basis. It is 
recommended that builders discuss the written Fall Protection Plan with 
their OSHA Area Office prior to going on a jobsite.

                     I. Statement of Company Policy

    (Your company name here) is dedicated to the protection of its 
employees from on-the-job injuries. All employees of (Your company name 
here) have the responsibility to work safely on the job. The purpose of 
the plan is to supplement our existing safety and health program and to 
ensure that every employee who works for (Your company name here) 
recognizes workplace fall hazards and takes the appropriate measures to 
address those hazards.
    This Fall Protection Plan addresses the use of conventional fall 
protection at a number of areas on the project, as well as identifies 
specific activities that require non-conventional means of fall 
protection. During the construction of residential buildings under 48 
feet in height, it is sometimes infeasible or it creates a greater 
hazard to use conventional fall protection systems at specific areas or 
for specific tasks. The areas or tasks may include, but are not limited 
to:
    a. Setting and bracing of roof trusses and rafters;
    b. Installation of floor sheathing and joists;
    c. Roof sheathing operations; and
    d. Erecting exterior walls.
    In these cases, conventional fall protection systems may not be the 
safest choice for builders. This plan is designed to enable employers 
and employees to recognize the fall hazards associated with this job and 
to establish the safest procedures that are to be followed in order to 
prevent falls to lower levels or through holes and openings in walking/
working surfaces.
    Each employee will be trained in these procedures and will strictly 
adhere to them except when doing so would expose the employee to a 
greater hazard. If, in the employee's opinion, this is the case, the 
employee is to notify the competent person of their concern and have the 
concern addressed before proceeding.
    It is the responsibility of (name of competent person) to implement 
this Fall Protection Plan. Continual observational safety checks of work 
operations and the enforcement of the safety policy and procedures shall 
be regularly enforced. The crew supervisor or foreman (insert name) is 
responsible for correcting any unsafe practices or conditions 
immediately.
    It is the responsibility of the employer to ensure that all 
employees understand and adhere to the procedures of this plan and to 
follow the instructions of the crew supervisor. It is also the 
responsibility of the employee to bring to management's attention any 
unsafe or hazardous conditions or practices that may cause injury to 
either themselves or any other employees. Any changes to the Fall 
Protection Plan must be approved by (name of qualified person).

           II. Fall Protection Systems To Be Used on This Job

    Installation of roof trusses/rafters, exterior wall erection, roof 
sheathing, floor sheathing and joist/truss activities will be conducted 
by employees who are specifically trained to do this type of work and 
are trained to recognize the fall hazards. The nature of such work 
normally exposes the employee to the fall hazard for a short period of 
time. This Plan details how (Your company name here) will minimize these 
hazards.

                         Controlled Access Zones

    When using the Plan to implement the fall protection options 
available, workers must be protected through limited access to high 
hazard locations. Before any non-conventional fall protection systems 
are used as part of the work plan, a controlled access zone (CAZ) shall 
be clearly defined by the competent person as an area where a recognized 
hazard exists. The demarcation of the CAZ shall be communicated by the 
competent person in a recognized manner, either through signs, wires, 
tapes, ropes or chains.
    (Your company name here) shall take the following steps to ensure 
that the CAZ is clearly marked or controlled by the competent person:
    <bullet> All access to the CAZ must be restricted to authorized 
entrants;
    <bullet> All workers who are permitted in the CAZ shall be listed in 
the appropriate sections of the Plan (or be visibly identifiable by the 
competent person) prior to implementation;

[[Page 353]]

    <bullet> The competent person shall ensure that all protective 
elements of the CAZ be implemented prior to the beginning of work.

       Installation Procedures for Roof Truss and Rafter Erection

    During the erection and bracing of roof trusses/rafters, 
conventional fall protection may present a greater hazard to workers. On 
this job, safety nets, guardrails and personal fall arrest systems will 
not provide adequate fall protection because the nets will cause the 
walls to collapse, while there are no suitable attachment or anchorage 
points for guardrails or personal fall arrest systems.
    On this job, requiring workers to use a ladder for the entire 
installation process will cause a greater hazard because the worker must 
stand on the ladder with his back or side to the front of the ladder. 
While erecting the truss or rafter the worker will need both hands to 
maneuver the truss and therefore cannot hold onto the ladder. In 
addition, ladders cannot be adequately protected from movement while 
trusses are being maneuvered into place. Many workers may experience 
additional fatigue because of the increase in overhead work with heavy 
materials, which can also lead to a greater hazard.
    Exterior scaffolds cannot be utilized on this job because the 
ground, after recent backfilling, cannot support the scaffolding. In 
most cases, the erection and dismantling of the scaffold would expose 
workers to a greater fall hazard than erection of the trusses/rafters.
    On all walls eight feet or less, workers will install interior 
scaffolds along the interior wall below the location where the trusses/
rafters will be erected. ``Sawhorse'' scaffolds constructed of 46 inch 
sawhorses and 2x10 planks will often allow workers to be elevated high 
enough to allow for the erection of trusses and rafters without working 
on the top plate of the wall.
    In structures that have walls higher than eight feet and where the 
use of scaffolds and ladders would create a greater hazard, safe working 
procedures will be utilized when working on the top plate and will be 
monitored by the crew supervisor. During all stages of truss/rafter 
erection the stability of the trusses/rafters will be ensured at all 
times.
    (Your company name here) shall take the following steps to protect 
workers who are exposed to fall hazards while working from the top plate 
installing trusses/rafters:
    <bullet> Only the following trained workers will be allowed to work 
on the top plate during roof truss or rafter installation:

 _______________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________
    <bullet> Workers shall have no other duties to perform during truss/
rafter erection procedures;
    <bullet> All trusses/rafters will be adequately braced before any 
worker can use the truss/rafter as a support;
    <bullet> Workers will remain on the top plate using the previously 
stabilized truss/rafter as a support while other trusses/rafters are 
being erected;
    <bullet> Workers will leave the area of the secured trusses only 
when it is necessary to secure another truss/rafter;
    <bullet> The first two trusses/rafters will be set from ladders 
leaning on side walls at points where the walls can support the weight 
of the ladder; and
    <bullet> A worker will climb onto the interior top plate via a 
ladder to secure the peaks of the first two trusses/rafters being set.
    The workers responsible for detaching trusses from cranes and/or 
securing trusses at the peaks traditionally are positioned at the peak 
of the trusses/rafters. There are also situations where workers securing 
rafters to ridge beams will be positioned on top of the ridge beam.
    (Your company name here) shall take the following steps to protect 
workers who are exposed to fall hazards while securing trusses/rafters 
at the peak of the trusses/ridge beam:
    <bullet> Only the following trained workers will be allowed to work 
at the peak during roof truss or rafter installation:

 _______________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________
    <bullet> Once truss or rafter installation begins, workers not 
involved in that activity shall not stand or walk below or adjacent to 
the roof opening or exterior walls in any area where they could be 
struck by falling objects;
    <bullet> Workers shall have no other duties than securing/bracing 
the trusses/ridge beam;
    <bullet> Workers positioned at the peaks or in the webs of trusses 
or on top of the ridge beam shall work from a stable position, either by 
sitting on a ``ridge seat'' or other equivalent surface that provides 
additional stability or by positioning themselves in previously 
stabilized trusses/rafters and leaning into and reaching through the 
trusses/rafters;
    <bullet> Workers shall not remain on or in the peak/ridge any longer 
than necessary to safely complete the task.

                        Roof Sheathing Operations

    Workers typically install roof sheathing after all trusses/rafters 
and any permanent truss bracing is in place. Roof structures are 
unstable until some sheathing is installed, so workers installing roof 
sheathing cannot be protected from fall hazards by conventional fall 
protection systems until it is determined

[[Page 354]]

that the roofing system can be used as an anchorage point. At that 
point, employees shall be protected by a personal fall arrest system.
    Trusses/rafters are subject to collapse if a worker falls while 
attached to a single truss with a belt/harness. Nets could also cause 
collapse, and there is no place to attach guardrails.
    All workers will ensure that they have secure footing before they 
attempt to walk on the sheathing, including cleaning shoes/boots of mud 
or other slip hazards.
    To minimize the time workers must be exposed to a fall hazard, 
materials will be staged to allow for the quickest installation of 
sheathing.
    (Your company name here) shall take the following steps to protect 
workers who are exposed to fall hazards while installing roof sheathing:
    <bullet> Once roof sheathing installation begins, workers not 
involved in that activity shall not stand or walk below or adjacent to 
the roof opening or exterior walls in any area where they could be 
struck by falling objects;
    <bullet> The competent person shall determine the limits of this 
area, which shall be clearly communicated to workers prior to placement 
of the first piece of roof sheathing;
    <bullet> The competent person may order work on the roof to be 
suspended for brief periods as necessary to allow other workers to pass 
through such areas when this would not create a greater hazard;
    <bullet> Only qualified workers shall install roof sheathing;
    <bullet> The bottom row of roof sheathing may be installed by 
workers standing in truss webs;
    <bullet> After the bottom row of roof sheathing is installed, a 
slide guard extending the width of the roof shall be securely attached 
to the roof. Slide guards are to be constructed of no less than nominal 
4'' height capable of limiting the uncontrolled slide of workers. 
Workers should install the slide guard while standing in truss webs and 
leaning over the sheathing;
    <bullet> Additional rows of roof sheathing may be installed by 
workers positioned on previously installed rows of sheathing. A slide 
guard can be used to assist workers in retaining their footing during 
successive sheathing operations; and
    <bullet> Additional slide guards shall be securely attached to the 
roof at intervals not to exceed 13 feet as successive rows of sheathing 
are installed. For roofs with pitches in excess of 9-in-12, slide guards 
will be installed at four-foot intervals.
    <bullet> When wet weather (rain, snow, or sleet) are present, roof 
sheathing operations shall be suspended unless safe footing can be 
assured for those workers installing sheathing.
    <bullet> When strong winds (above 40 miles per hour) are present, 
roof sheathing operations are to be suspended unless wind breakers are 
erected.

               Installation of Floor Joists and Sheathing

    During the installation of floor sheathing/joists (leading edge 
construction), the following steps shall be taken to protect workers:
    <bullet> Only the following trained workers will be allowed to 
install floor joists or sheathing:

 _______________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________
    <bullet> Materials for the operations shall be conveniently staged 
to allow for easy access to workers;
    <bullet> The first floor joists or trusses will be rolled into 
position and secured either from the ground, ladders or sawhorse 
scaffolds;
    <bullet> Each successive floor joist or truss will be rolled into 
place and secured from a platform created from a sheet of plywood laid 
over the previously secured floor joists or trusses;
    <bullet> Except for the first row of sheathing which will be 
installed from ladders or the ground, workers shall work from the 
established deck; and
    <bullet> Any workers not assisting in the leading edge construction 
while leading edges still exist (e.g. cutting the decking for the 
installers) shall not be permitted within six feet of the leading edge 
under construction.

                       Erection of Exterior Walls

    During the construction and erection of exterior walls, employers 
shall take the following steps to protect workers:
    <bullet> Only the following trained workers will be allowed to erect 
exterior walls:

 _______________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________
    <bullet> A painted line six feet from the perimeter will be clearly 
marked prior to any wall erection activities to warn of the approaching 
unprotected edge;
    <bullet> Materials for operations shall be conveniently staged to 
minimize fall hazards; and
    <bullet> Workers constructing exterior walls shall complete as much 
cutting of materials and other preparation as possible away from the 
edge of the deck.

                            III. Enforcement

    Constant awareness of and respect for fall hazards, and compliance 
with all safety rules are considered conditions of employment. The crew 
supervisor or foreman, as well as individuals in the Safety and 
Personnel Department, reserve the right to issue disciplinary warnings 
to employees, up to and including termination, for failure to follow the 
guidelines of this program.

[[Page 355]]

                       IV. Accident Investigations

    All accidents that result in injury to workers, regardless of their 
nature, shall be investigated and reported. It is an integral part of 
any safety program that documentation take place as soon as possible so 
that the cause and means of prevention can be identified to prevent a 
reoccurrence.
    In the event that an employee falls or there is some other related, 
serious incident occurring, this plan shall be reviewed to determine if 
additional practices, procedures, or training need to be implemented to 
prevent similar types of falls or incidents from occurring.

                           V. Changes to Plan

    Any changes to the plan will be approved by (name of the qualified 
person). This plan shall be reviewed by a qualified person as the job 
progresses to determine if additional practices, procedures or training 
needs to be implemented by the competent person to improve or provide 
additional fall protection. Workers shall be notified and trained, if 
necessary, in the new procedures. A copy of this plan and all approved 
changes shall be maintained at the jobsite.

    (g) Crane or derrick suspended personnel platforms--(1) Scope, 
application and definitions--(i) Scope and application. This standard 
applies to the design, construction, testing, use and maintenance of 
personnel platforms, and the hoisting of personnel platforms on the load 
lines of cranes or derricks.
    (ii) Definitions. For the purposes of this paragraph (g), the 
following definitions apply:
    (A) Failure means load refusal, breakage, or separation of 
components.
    (B) Hoist (or hoisting) means all crane or derrick functions such as 
lowering, lifting, swinging, booming in and out or up and down, or 
suspending a personnel platform.
    (C) Load refusal means the point where the ultimate strength is 
exceeded.
    (D) Maximum intended load means the total load of all employees, 
tools, materials, and other loads reasonably anticipated to be applied 
to a personnel platform or personnel platform component at any one time.
    (E) Runway means a firm, level surface designed, prepared and 
designated as a path of travel for the weight and configuration of the 
crane being used to lift and travel with the crane suspended platform. 
An existing surface may be used as long as it meets these criteria.
    (2) General requirements. The use of a crane or derrick to hoist 
employees on a personnel platform is prohibited, except when the 
erection, use, and dismantling of conventional means of reaching the 
worksite, such as a personnel hoist, ladder, stairway, aerial lift, 
elevating work platform or scaffold, would be more hazardous, or is not 
possible because of structural design or worksite conditions.
    (3) Cranes and derricks--(i) Operational criteria. (A) Hoisting of 
the personnel platform shall be performed in a slow, controlled, 
cautious manner with no sudden movements of the crane or derrick, or the 
platform.
    (B) Load lines shall be capable of supporting, without failure, at 
least seven times the maximum intended load, except that where rotation 
resistant rope is used, the lines shall be capable of supporting without 
failure, at least ten times the maximum intended load. The required 
design factor is achieved by taking the current safety factor of 3.5 
(required under paragraph (b)(2)) of this section and applying the 50 
per cent derating of the crane capacity which is

[[Page 359]]

required by paragraph (g)(3)(i)(F) of this section.
    (C) Load and boom hoist drum brakes, swing brakes, and locking 
devices such as pawls or dogs shall be engaged when the occupied 
personnel platform is in a stationary working position.
    (D) The crane shall be uniformly level within one percent of level 
grade and located on firm footing. Cranes equipped with outriggers shall 
have them all fully deployed following manufacturer's specifications, 
insofar as applicable, when hoisting employees.
    (E) The total weight of the loaded personnel platform and related 
rigging shall not exceed 50 percent of the rated capaciy for the radius 
and configuration of the crane or derrick.
    (F) The use of machines having live booms (booms in which lowering 
is controlled by a brake without aid from other devices which slow the 
lowering speeds) is prohibited.
    (ii) Instruments and components. (A) Cranes and derricks with 
variable angle booms shall be equipped with a boom angle indicator, 
readily visible to the operator.
    (B) Cranes with telescoping booms shall be equipped with a device to 
indicate clearly to the operator, at all times, the boom's extended 
length, or an accurate determination of the load radius to be used 
during the lift shall be made prior to hoisting personnel.
    (C) A positive acting device shall be used which prevents contact 
between the load block or overhaul ball and the boom tip (anti-two-
blocking device), or a system shall be used which deactivates the 
hoisting action before damage occurs in the event of a two-blocking 
situation (two block damage prevention feature).
    (D) The load line hoist drum shall have a system or device on the 
power train, other than the load hoist brake, which regulates the 
lowering rate of speed of the hoist mechanism (controlled load 
lowering.) Free fall is prohibited.
    (4) Personnel platforms--(i) Design criteria. (A) The personnel 
platform and suspension system shall be designed by a qualified engineer 
or a qualified person competent in structural design.
    (B) The suspension system shall be designed to minimize tipping of 
the platform due to movement of employees occupying the platform.
    (C) The personnel platform itself, except the guardrail system and 
personal fall arrest system anchorages, shall be capable of supporting, 
without failure, its own weight and at least five times the maximum 
intended load. Criteria for guardrail systems and personal fall arrest 
system anchorages are contained in subpart M of this Part.
    (ii) Platform specifications. (A) Each personnel platform shall be 
equipped with a guardrail system which meets the requirements of subpart 
M, and, shall be enclosed at least from the toeboard to mid-rail with 
either solid construction or expanded metal having openings no greater 
than \1/2\ inch (1.27 cm).
    (B) A grab rail shall be installed inside the entire perimeter of 
the personnel platform.
    (C) Access gates, if installed, shall not swing outward during 
hoisting.
    (D) Access gates, including sliding or folding gates, shall be 
equipped with a restraining device to prevent accidental opening.
    (E) Headroom shall be provided which allows employees to stand 
upright in the platform.
    (F) In addition to the use of hard hats, employees shall be 
protected by overhead protection on the personnel platform when 
employees are exposed to falling objects.
    (G) All rough edges exposed to contact by employees shall be 
surfaced or smoothed in order to prevent injury to employees from 
punctures or lacerations.
    (H) All welding of the personnel platform and its components shall 
be performed by a qualified welder familiar with the weld grades, types 
and material specified in the platform design.
    (I) The personnel platform shall be conspicuously posted with a 
plate or other permanent marking which indicates the weight of the 
platform and its rated load capacity or maximum intended load.
    (iii) Personnel platform loading. (A) The personnel platform shall 
not be loaded in excess of its rated load capacity. When a personnel 
platform does

[[Page 360]]

not have a rated load capacity then the personnel platform shall not be 
loaded in excess of its maximum intended load.
    (B) The number of employees occupying the personnel platform shall 
not exceed the number required for the work being performed.
    (C) Personnel platforms shall be used only for employees, their 
tools, and the materials necessary to do their work, and shall not be 
used to hoist only materials or tools when not hoisting personnel.
    (D) Materials and tools for use during a personnel lift shall be 
secured to prevent displacement.
    (E) Materials and tools for use during a personnel lift shall be 
evenly distributed within the confines of the platform while the 
platform is suspended.
    (iv) Rigging. (A) When a wire rope bridle is used to connect the 
personnel platform to the load line, each bridle leg shall be connected 
to a master link or shackle in such a manner to ensure that the load is 
evenly divided among the bridle legs.
    (B) Hooks on overhaul ball assemblies, lower load blocks, or other 
attachment assemblies shall be of a type that can be closed and locked, 
eliminating the hook throat opening. Alternatively, an alloy anchor type 
shackle with a bolt, nut and retaining pin may be used.
    (C) Wire rope, shackles, rings, master links, and other rigging 
hardware must be capable of supporting, without failure, at least five 
times the maximum intended load applied or transmitted to that 
component. Where rotation resistant rope is used, the slings shall be 
capable of supporting without failure at least ten times the maximum 
intended load.
    (D) All eyes in wire rope slings shall be fabricated with thimbles.
    (E) Bridles and associated rigging for attaching the personnel 
platform to the hoist line shall be used only for the platform and the 
necessary employees, their tools and the materials necessary to do their 
work, and shall not be used for any other purpose when not hoisting 
personnel.
    (5) Trial lift, inspection, and proof testing. (i) A trial lift with 
the unoccupied personnel platform loaded at least to the anticipated 
liftweight shall be made from ground level, or any other location where 
employees will enter the platform, to each location at which the 
personnel platform is to be hoisted and positioned. This trial lift 
shall be performed immediately prior to placing personnel on the 
platform. The operator shall determine that all systems, controls and 
safety devices are activated and functioning properly; that no 
interferences exist; and that all configurations necessary to reach 
those work locations will allow the operator to remain under the 50 
percent limit of the hoist's rated capacity. Materials and tools to be 
used during the actual lift can be loaded in the platform, as provided 
in paragraphs (g)(4)(iii) (D), and (E) of this section for the trial 
lift. A single trial lift may be performed at one time for all locations 
that are to be reached from a single set up position.
    (ii) The trial lift shall be repeated prior to hoisting employees 
whenever the crane or derrick is moved and set up in a new location or 
returned to a previously used location. Additionally, the trial lift 
shall be repeated when the lift route is changed unless the operator 
determines that the route change is not significant (i.e. the route 
change would not affect the safety of hoisted employees.)
    (iii) After the trial lift, and just prior to hoisting personnel, 
the platform shall be hoisted a few inches and inspected to ensure that 
it is secure and properly balanced. Employees shall not be hoisted 
unless the following conditions are determined to exist:
    (A) Hoist ropes shall be free of kinks;
    (B) Multiple part lines shall not be twisted around each other;
    (C) The primary attachment shall be centered over the platform; and
    (D) The hoisting system shall be inspected if the load rope is slack 
to ensure all ropes are properly stated on drums and in sheaves.
    (iv) A visual inspection of the crane or derrick, rigging, personnel 
platform, and the crane or derrick base support or ground shall be 
conducted by a competent person immediately after the trial lift to 
determine whether the

[[Page 361]]

testing has exposed any defect or produced any adverse effect upon any 
component or structure.
    (v) Any defects found during inspections which create a safety 
hazard shall be corrected before hoisting personnel.
    (vi) At each job site, prior to hoisting employees on the personnel 
platform, and after any repair or modification, the platform and rigging 
shall be proof tested to 125 percent of the platform's rated capacity by 
holding it in a suspended position for five minutes with the test load 
evenly distributed on the platform (this may be done concurrently with 
the trial lift). After prooftesting, a competent person shall inspect 
the platform and rigging. Any deficiencies found shall be corrected and 
another proof test shall be conducted. Personnel hoisting shall not be 
conducted until the proof testing requirements are satisfied.
    (6) Work practices. (i) Employees shall keep all parts of the body 
inside the platform during raising, lowering, and positioning. This 
provision does not apply to an occupant of the platform performing the 
duties of a signal person.
    (ii) Before employees exit or enter a hoisted personnel platform 
that is not landed, the platform shall be secured to the structure where 
the work is to be performed, unless securing to the structure creates an 
unsafe situation.
    (iii) Tag lines shall be used unless their use creates an unsafe 
condition.
    (iv) The crane or derrick operator shall remain at the controls at 
all times when the crane engine is running and the platform is occupied.
    (v) Hoisting of employees shall be promptly discontinued upon 
indication of any dangerous weather conditions or other impending 
danger.
    (vi) Employees being hoisted shall remain in continuous sight of and 
in direct communication with the operator or signal person. In those 
situations where direct visual contact with the operator is not 
possible, and the use of a signal person would create a greater hazard 
for that person, direct communication alone such as by radio may be 
used.
    (vii) Except over water, employees occupying the personnel platform 
shall use a body belt/harness system with lanyard appropriately attached 
to the lower load block or overhaul ball, or to a structural member 
within the personnel platform capable of supporting a fall impact for 
employees using the anchorage. When working over water, the requirements 
of Sec. 1926.106 shall apply.
    (viii) No lifts shall be made on another of the crane's or derrick's 
loadlines while personnel are suspended on a platform.
    (7) Traveling. (i) Hoisting of employees while the crane is 
traveling is prohibited, except for portal, tower and locomotive cranes, 
or where the employer demonstrates that there is no less hazardous way 
to perform the work.
    (ii) Under any circumstances where a crane would travel while 
hoisting personnel, the employer shall implement the following 
procedures to safeguard employees:
    (A) Crane travel shall be restricted to a fixed track or runway;
    (B) Travel shall be limited to the load radius of the boom used 
during the lift; and
    (C) The boom must be parallel to the direction of travel.
    (D) A complete trial run shall be performed to test the route of 
travel before employees are allowed to occupy the platform. This trial 
run can be performed at the same time as the trial lift required by 
paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section which tests the route of the lift.
    (E) If travel is done with a rubber tired-carrier, the condition and 
air pressure of the tires shall be checked. The chart capacity for lifts 
on rubber shall be used for application of the 50 percent reduction of 
rated capacity. Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(3)(i)(E) of this section, 
outriggers may be partially retracted as necessary for travel.
    (8) Pre-lift meeting. (i) A meeting attended by the crane or derrick 
operator, signal person(s) (if necessary for the lift), employee(s) to 
be lifted, and the person responsible for the task to be performed shall 
be held to review the appropriate requirements of paragraph (g) of this 
section and the procedures to be followed.

[[Page 362]]

    (ii) This meeting shall be held prior to the trial lift at each new 
work location, and shall be repeated for any employees newly assigned to 
the operation.

Sec. 1926.650  Scope, application, and definitions applicable to this subpart.

    (a) Scope and application. This subpart applies to all open 
excavations made in the earth's surface. Excavations are defined to 
include trenches.
    (b) Definitions applicable to this subpart.
    Accepted engineering practices means those requirements which are 
compatible with standards of practice required by a registered 
professional engineer.
    Aluminum Hydraulic Shoring means a pre-engineered shoring system 
comprised of aluminum hydraulic cylinders (crossbraces) used in 
conjunction with vertical rails (uprights) or horizontal rails (walers). 
Such system is designed, specifically to support the sidewalls of an 
excavation and prevent cave-ins.
    Bell-bottom pier hole means a type of shaft or footing excavation, 
the bottom of which is made larger than the cross section above to form 
a belled shape.
    Benching (Benching system) means a method of protecting employees 
from cave-ins by excavating the sides of an excavation to form one or a 
series of horizontal levels or steps, usually with vertical or near-
vertical surfaces between levels.
    Cave-in means the separation of a mass of soil or rock material from 
the side of an excavation, or the loss of soil from under a trench 
shield or support system, and its sudden movement into the excavation, 
either by falling or sliding, in sufficient quantity so that it could 
entrap, bury, or otherwise injure and immobilize a person.
    Competent person means one who is capable of identifying existing 
and predictable hazards in the surroundings, or working conditions which 
are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to employees, and who has 
authorization to take prompt corrective measures to eliminate them.
    Cross braces mean the horizontal members of a shoring system 
installed perpendicular to the sides of the excavation, the ends of 
which bear against either uprights or wales.
    Excavation means any man-made cut, cavity, trench, or depression in 
an earth surface, formed by earth removal.
    Faces or sides means the vertical or inclined earth surfaces formed 
as a result of excavation work.
    Failure means the breakage, displacement, or permanent deformation 
of a structural member or connection so as to reduce its structural 
integrity and its supportive capabilities.

[[Page 374]]

    Hazardous atmosphere means an atmosphere which by reason of being 
explosive, flammable, poisonous, corrosive, oxidizing, irritating, 
oxygen deficient, toxic, or otherwise harmful, may cause death, illness, 
or injury.
    Kickout means the accidental release or failure of a cross brace.
    Protective system means a method of protecting employees from cave-
ins, from material that could fall or roll from an excavation face or 
into an excavation, or from the collapse of adjacent structures. 
Protective systems include support systems, sloping and benching 
systems, shield systems, and other systems that provide the necessary 
protection.
    Ramp means an inclined walking or working surface that is used to 
gain access to one point from another, and is constructed from earth or 
from structural materials such as steel or wood.
    Registered Professional Engineer means a person who is registered as 
a professional engineer in the state where the work is to be performed. 
However, a professional engineer, registered in any state is deemed to 
be a ``registered professional engineer'' within the meaning of this 
standard when approving designs for ``manufactured protective systems'' 
or ``tabulated data'' to be used in interstate commerce.
    Sheeting means the members of a shoring system that retain the earth 
in position and in turn are supported by other members of the shoring 
system.
    Shield (Shield system) means a structure that is able to withstand 
the forces imposed on it by a cave-in and thereby protect employees 
within the structure. Shields can be permanent structures or can be 
designed to be portable and moved along as work progresses. 
Additionally, shields can be either premanufactured or job-built in 
accordance with Sec. 1926.652 (c)(3) or (c)(4). Shields used in trenches 
are usually referred to as ``trench boxes'' or ``trench shields.''
    Shoring (Shoring system) means a structure such as a metal 
hydraulic, mechanical or timber shoring system that supports the sides 
of an excavation and which is designed to prevent cave-ins.
    Sides. See ``Faces.''
    Sloping (Sloping system) means a method of protecting employees from 
cave-ins by excavating to form sides of an excavation that are inclined 
away from the excavation so as to prevent cave-ins. The angle of incline 
required to prevent a cave-in varies with differences in such factors as 
the soil type, environmental conditions of exposure, and application of 
surcharge loads.
    Stable rock means natural solid mineral material that can be 
excavated with vertical sides and will remain intact while exposed. 
Unstable rock is considered to be stable when the rock material on the 
side or sides of the excavation is secured against caving-in or movement 
by rock bolts or by another protective system that has been designed by 
a registered professional engineer.
    Structural ramp means a ramp built of steel or wood, usually used 
for vehicle access. Ramps made of soil or rock are not considered 
structural ramps.
    Support system means a structure such as underpinning, bracing, or 
shoring, which provides support to an adjacent structure, underground 
installation, or the sides of an excavation.
    Tabulated data means tables and charts approved by a registered 
professional engineer and used to design and construct a protective 
system.
    Trench (Trench excavation) means a narrow excavation (in relation to 
its length) made below the surface of the ground. In general, the depth 
is greater than the width, but the width of a trench (measured at the 
bottom) is not greater than 15 feet (4.6 m). If forms or other 
structures are installed or constructed in an excavation so as to reduce 
the dimension measured from the forms or structure to the side of the 
excavation to 15 feet (4.6 m) or less (measured at the bottom of the 
excavation), the excavation is also considered to be a trench.
    Trench box. See ``Shield.''
    Trench shield. See ``Shield.''
    Uprights means the vertical members of a trench shoring system 
placed in contact with the earth and usually positioned so that 
individual members do not contact each other. Uprights placed so that 
individual members are closely spaced, in contact with or

[[Page 375]]

interconnected to each other, are often called ``sheeting.''
    Wales means horizontal members of a shoring system placed parallel 
to the excavation face whose sides bear against the vertical members of 
the shoring system or earth.

to provide adequate protection for the operator during loading and 
unloading operations.
    (f) Warning system for mobile equipment. When mobile equipment is 
operated adjacent to an excavation, or when such equipment is required 
to approach the edge of an excavation, and the operator does not have a 
clear and direct view of the edge of the excavation, a warning system 
shall be utilized such as barricades, hand or mechanical signals, or 
stop logs. If possible, the grade should be away from the excavation.

    (g) Hazardous atmospheres--(1) Testing and controls. In addition to 
the requirements set forth in subparts D and E of this part (29 CFR 
1926.50-1926.107) to prevent exposure to harmful levels of atmospheric 
contaminants and to assure acceptable atmospheric conditions, the 
following requirements shall apply:
    (i) Where oxygen deficiency (atmospheres containing less than 19.5 
percent oxygen) or a hazardous atmosphere exists or could reasonably be 
expected to exist, such as in excavations in landfill areas or 
excavations in areas where hazardous substances are stored nearby, the 
atmospheres in the excavation shall be tested before employees enter 
excavations greater than 4 feet (1.22 m) in depth.
    (ii) Adequate precautions shall be taken to prevent employee 
exposure to atmospheres containing less than 19.5 percent oxygen and 
other hazardous atmospheres. These precautions include providing proper 
respiratory protection or ventilation in accordance with subparts D and 
E of this part respectively.
    (iii) Adequate precaution shall be taken such as providing 
ventilation, to prevent employee exposure to an atmosphere containing a 
concentration of a flammable gas in excess of 20 percent of the lower 
flammable limit of the gas.
    (iv) When controls are used that are intended to reduce the level of 
atmospheric contaminants to acceptable levels, testing shall be 
conducted as often as necessary to ensure that the atmosphere remains 
safe.
    (2) Emergency rescue equipment. (i) Emergency rescue equipment, such 
as breathing apparatus, a safety harness and line, or a basket 
stretcher, shall be readily available where hazardous atmospheric 
conditions exist or may reasonably be expected to develop during work in 
an excavation. This equipment shall be attended when in use.
    (ii) Employees entering bell-bottom pier holes, or other similar 
deep and confined footing excavations, shall wear a harness with a life-
line securely attached to it. The lifeline shall be separate from any 
line used to handle materials, and shall be individually attended at all 
times while the employee wearing the lifeline is in the excavation.
    (h) Protection from hazards associated with water accumulation. (1) 
Employees shall not work in excavations in which there is accumulated 
water, or in excavations in which water is accumulating, unless adequate 
precautions have been taken to protect employees against the hazards 
posed by water accumulation. The precautions necessary to protect 
employees adequately vary with each situation, but could include special 
support or shield systems to protect from cave-ins, water removal to 
control the level of accumulating water, or use of a safety harness and 
lifeline.
    (2) If water is controlled or prevented from accumulating by the use 
of water removal equipment, the water removal equipment and operations 
shall be monitored by a competent person to ensure proper operation.
    (3) If excavation work interrupts the natural drainage of surface 
water (such as streams), diversion ditches, dikes, or other suitable 
means shall be used to prevent surface water from entering the 
excavation and to provide adequate drainage of the area adjacent to the 
excavation. Excavations subject to runoff from heavy rains will require 
an inspection by a competent person and compliance with paragraphs 
(h)(1) and (h)(2) of this section.
    (i) Stability of adjacent structures. (1) Where the stability of 
adjoining buildings, walls, or other structures is endangered by 
excavation operations, support systems such as shoring, bracing, or 
underpinning shall be provided to ensure the stability of such 
structures for the protection of employees.
    (2) Excavation below the level of the base or footing of any 
foundation or retaining wall that could be reasonably expected to pose a 
hazard to employees shall not be permitted except when:
    (i) A support system, such as underpinning, is provided to ensure 
the safety of employees and the stability of the structure; or
    (ii) The excavation is in stable rock; or
    (iii) A registered professional engineer has approved the 
determination that the structure is sufficently removed from the 
excavation so as to be

[[Page 377]]

unaffected by the excavation activity; or
    (iv) A registered professional engineer has approved the 
determination that such excavation work will not pose a hazard to 
employees.
    (3) Sidewalks, pavements, and appurtenant structure shall not be 
undermined unless a support system or another method of protection is 
provided to protect employees from the possible collapse of such 
structures.
    (j) Protection of employees from loose rock or soil. (1) Adequate 
protection shall be provided to protect employees from loose rock or 
soil that could pose a hazard by falling or rolling from an excavation 
face. Such protection shall consist of scaling to remove loose material; 
installation of protective barricades at intervals as necessary on the 
face to stop and contain falling material; or other means that provide 
equivalent protection.
    (2) Employees shall be protected from excavated or other materials 
or equipment that could pose a hazard by falling or rolling into 
excavations. Protection shall be provided by placing and keeping such 
materials or equipment at least 2 feet (.61 m) from the edge of 
excavations, or by the use of retaining devices that are sufficient to 
prevent materials or equipment from falling or rolling into excavations, 
or by a combination of both if necessary.
    (k) Inspections. (1) Daily inspections of excavations, the adjacent 
areas, and protective systems shall be made by a competent person for 
evidence of a situation that could result in possible cave-ins, 
indications of failure of protective systems, hazardous atmospheres, or 
other hazardous conditions. An inspection shall be conducted by the 
competent person prior to the start of work and as needed throughout the 
shift. Inspections shall also be made after every rainstorm or other 
hazard increasing occurrence. These inspections are only required when 
employee exposure can be reasonably anticipated.
    (2) Where the competent person finds evidence of a situation that 
could result in a possible cave-in, indications of failure of protective 
systems, hazardous atmospheres, or other hazardous conditions, exposed 
employees shall be removed from the hazardous area until the necessary 
precautions have been taken to ensure their safety.
    (l) Walkways shall be provided where employees or equipment are 
required or permitted to cross over excavations. Guardrails which comply 
with Sec. 1926.502(b) shall be provided where walkways are 6 feet (1.8 
m) or more above lower levels.

              Appendix A to Subpart P--Soil Classification

    (a) Scope and application--(1) Scope. This appendix describes a 
method of classifying soil and rock deposits based on site and 
environmental conditions, and on the structure and composition of the 
earth deposits. The appendix contains definitions, sets forth 
requirements, and describes acceptable visual and manual tests for use 
in classifying soils.
    (2) Application. This appendix applies when a sloping or benching 
system is designed in accordance with the requirements set forth in 
Sec. 1926.652(b)(2) as a method of protection for employees from cave-
ins. This appendix also applies when timber shoring for excavations is 
designed as a method of protection from cave-ins in accordance with 
appendix C to subpart P of part 1926, and when aluminum hydraulic 
shoring is designed in accordance with appendix D. This Appendix also 
applies if other protective systems are designed and selected for use 
from data prepared in accordance with the requirements set forth in 
Sec. 1926.652(c), and the use of the data is predicated on the use of 
the soil classification system set forth in this appendix.
    (b) Definitions. The definitions and examples given below are based 
on, in whole or in part, the following: American Society for Testing 
Materials (ASTM) Standards D653-85 and D2488; The Unified Soils 
Classification System, The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 
Textural Classification Scheme; and The National Bureau of Standards 
Report BSS-121.
    Cemented soil means a soil in which the particles are held together 
by a chemical agent, such as calcium carbonate, such that a hand-size 
sample cannot be crushed into powder or individual soil particles by 
finger pressure.
    Cohesive soil means clay (fine grained soil), or soil with a high 
clay content, which has cohesive strength. Cohesive soil does not 
crumble, can be excavated with vertical sideslopes, and is plastic when 
moist. Cohesive soil is hard to break up when dry, and exhibits 
significant cohesion when submerged. Cohesive soils include clayey silt, 
sandy clay, silty clay, clay and organic clay.
    Dry soil means soil that does not exhibit visible signs of moisture 
content.
    Fissured means a soil material that has a tendency to break along 
definite planes of fracture with little resistance, or a material that 
exhibits open cracks, such as tension cracks, in an exposed surface.
    Granular soil means gravel, sand, or silt, (coarse grained soil) 
with little or no clay content. Granular soil has no cohesive strength. 
Some moist granular soils exhibit apparent cohesion. Granular soil 
cannot be molded when moist and crumbles easily when dry.
    Layered system means two or more distinctly different soil or rock 
types arranged in layers. Micaceous seams or weakened planes in rock or 
shale are considered layered.
    Moist soil means a condition in which a soil looks and feels damp. 
Moist cohesive soil can easily be shaped into a ball and rolled into 
small diameter threads before crumbling. Moist granular soil that 
contains some cohesive material will exhibit signs of cohesion between 
particles.
    Plastic means a property of a soil which allows the soil to be 
deformed or molded without cracking, or appreciable volume change.
    Saturated soil means a soil in which the voids are filled with 
water. Saturation does not require flow. Saturation, or near saturation, 
is necessary for the proper use of instruments such as a pocket 
penetrometer or sheer vane.
    Soil classification system means, for the purpose of this subpart, a 
method of categorizing soil and rock deposits in a hierarchy of Stable 
Rock, Type A, Type B, and Type C, in decreasing order of stability. The 
categories are determined based on an analysis of the properties and 
performance characteristics of the deposits and the environmental 
conditions of exposure.
    Stable rock means natural solid mineral matter that can be excavated 
with vertical sides and remain intact while exposed.
    Submerged soil means soil which is underwater or is free seeping.

[[Page 381]]

    Type A means cohesive soils with an unconfined compressive strength 
of 1.5 ton per square foot (tsf) (144 kPa) or greater. Examples of 
cohesive soils are: clay, silty clay, sandy clay, clay loam and, in some 
cases, silty clay loam and sandy clay loam. Cemented soils such as 
caliche and hardpan are also considered Type A. However, no soil is Type 
A if:
    (i) The soil is fissured; or
    (ii) The soil is subject to vibration from heavy traffic, pile 
driving, or similar effects; or
    (iii) The soil has been previously disturbed; or
    (iv) The soil is part of a sloped, layered system where the layers 
dip into the excavation on a slope of four horizontal to one vertical 
(4H:1V) or greater; or
    (v) The material is subject to other factors that would require it 
to be classified as a less stable material.
    Type B means:
    (i) Cohesive soil with an unconfined compressive strength greater 
than 0.5 tsf (48 kPa) but less than 1.5 tsf (144 kPa); or
    (ii) Granular cohesionless soils including: angular gravel (similar 
to crushed rock), silt, silt loam, sandy loam and, in some cases, silty 
clay loam and sandy clay loam.
    (iii) Previously disturbed soils except those which would otherwise 
be classed as Type C soil.
    (iv) Soil that meets the unconfined compressive strength or 
cementation requirements for Type A, but is fissured or subject to 
vibration; or
    (v) Dry rock that is not stable; or
    (vi) Material that is part of a sloped, layered system where the 
layers dip into the excavation on a slope less steep than four 
horizontal to one vertical (4H:1V), but only if the material would 
otherwise be classified as Type B.
    Type C means:
    (i) Cohesive soil with an unconfined compressive strength of 0.5 tsf 
(48 kPa) or less; or
    (ii) Granular soils including gravel, sand, and loamy sand; or
    (iii) Submerged soil or soil from which water is freely seeping; or
    (iv) Submerged rock that is not stable, or
    (v) Material in a sloped, layered system where the layers dip into 
the excavation or a slope of four horizontal to one vertical (4H:1V) or 
steeper.
    Unconfined compressive strength means the load per unit area at 
which a soil will fail in compression. It can be determined by 
laboratory testing, or estimated in the field using a pocket 
penetrometer, by thumb penetration tests, and other methods.
    Wet soil means soil that contains significantly more moisture than 
moist soil, but in such a range of values that cohesive material will 
slump or begin to flow when vibrated. Granular material that would 
exhibit cohesive properties when moist will lose those cohesive 
properties when wet.
    (c) Requirements--(1) Classification of soil and rock deposits. Each 
soil and rock deposit shall be classified by a competent person as 
Stable Rock, Type A, Type B, or Type C in accordance with the 
definitions set forth in paragraph (b) of this appendix.
    (2) Basis of classification. The classification of the deposits 
shall be made based on the results of at least one visual and at least 
one manual analysis. Such analyses shall be conducted by a competent 
person using tests described in paragraph (d) below, or in other 
recognized methods of soil classification and testing such as those 
adopted by the America Society for Testing Materials, or the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture textural classification system.
    (3) Visual and manual analyses. The visual and manual analyses, such 
as those noted as being acceptable in paragraph (d) of this appendix, 
shall be designed and conducted to provide sufficient quantitative and 
qualitative information as may be necessary to identify properly the 
properties, factors, and conditions affecting the classification of the 
deposits.
    (4) Layered systems. In a layered system, the system shall be 
classified in accordance with its weakest layer. However, each layer may 
be classified individually where a more stable layer lies under a less 
stable layer.
    (5) Reclassification. If, after classifying a deposit, the 
properties, factors, or conditions affecting its classification change 
in any way, the changes shall be evaluated by a competent person. The 
deposit shall be reclassified as necessary to reflect the changed 
circumstances.
    (d) Acceptable visual and manual tests.--(1) Visual tests. Visual 
analysis is conducted to determine qualitative information regarding the 
excavation site in general, the soil adjacent to the excavation, the 
soil forming the sides of the open excavation, and the soil taken as 
samples from excavated material.
    (i) Observe samples of soil that are excavated and soil in the sides 
of the excavation. Estimate the range of particle sizes and the relative 
amounts of the particle sizes. Soil that is primarily composed of fine-
grained material is cohesive material. Soil composed primarily of 
coarse-grained sand or gravel is granular material.
    (ii) Observe soil as it is excavated. Soil that remains in clumps 
when excavated is cohesive. Soil that breaks up easily and does not stay 
in clumps is granular.
    (iii) Observe the side of the opened excavation and the surface area 
adjacent to the excavation. Crack-like openings such as tension cracks 
could indicate fissured material. If chunks of soil spall off a vertical 
side, the soil could be fissured. Small spalls are evidence of moving 
ground and are indications of potentially hazardous situations.

[[Page 382]]

    (iv) Observe the area adjacent to the excavation and the excavation 
itself for evidence of existing utility and other underground 
structures, and to identify previously disturbed soil.
    (v) Observe the opened side of the excavation to identify layered 
systems. Examine layered systems to identify if the layers slope toward 
the excavation. Estimate the degree of slope of the layers.
    (vi) Observe the area adjacent to the excavation and the sides of 
the opened excavation for evidence of surface water, water seeping from 
the sides of the excavation, or the location of the level of the water 
table.
    (vii) Observe the area adjacent to the excavation and the area 
within the excavation for sources of vibration that may affect the 
stability of the excavation face.
    (2) Manual tests. Manual analysis of soil samples is conducted to 
determine quantitative as well as qualitative properties of soil and to 
provide more information in order to classify soil properly.
    (i) Plasticity. Mold a moist or wet sample of soil into a ball and 
attempt to roll it into threads as thin as \1/8\-inch in diameter. 
Cohesive material can be successfully rolled into threads without 
crumbling. For example, if at least a two inch (50 mm) length of \1/8\-
inch thread can be held on one end without tearing, the soil is 
cohesive.
    (ii) Dry strength. If the soil is dry and crumbles on its own or 
with moderate pressure into individual grains or fine powder, it is 
granular (any combination of gravel, sand, or silt). If the soil is dry 
and falls into clumps which break up into smaller clumps, but the 
smaller clumps can only be broken up with difficulty, it may be clay in 
any combination with gravel, sand or silt. If the dry soil breaks into 
clumps which do not break up into small clumps and which can only be 
broken with difficulty, and there is no visual indication the soil is 
fissured, the soil may be considered unfissured.
    (iii) Thumb penetration. The thumb penetration test can be used to 
estimate the unconfined compressive strength of cohesive soils. (This 
test is based on the thumb penetration test described in American 
Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard designation D2488--
``Standard Recommended Practice for Description of Soils (Visual--Manual 
Procedure).'') Type A soils with an unconfined compressive strength of 
1.5 tsf can be readily indented by the thumb; however, they can be 
penetrated by the thumb only with very great effort. Type C soils with 
an unconfined compressive strength of 0.5 tsf can be easily penetrated 
several inches by the thumb, and can be molded by light finger pressure. 
This test should be conducted on an undisturbed soil sample, such as a 
large clump of spoil, as soon as practicable after excavation to keep to 
a miminum the effects of exposure to drying influences. If the 
excavation is later exposed to wetting influences (rain, flooding), the 
classification of the soil must be changed accordingly.
    (iv) Other strength tests. Estimates of unconfined compressive 
strength of soils can also be obtained by use of a pocket penetrometer 
or by using a hand-operated shearvane.
    (v) Drying test. The basic purpose of the drying test is to 
differentiate between cohesive material with fissures, unfissured 
cohesive material, and granular material. The procedure for the drying 
test involves drying a sample of soil that is approximately one inch 
thick (2.54 cm) and six inches (15.24 cm) in diameter until it is 
thoroughly dry:
    (A) If the sample develops cracks as it dries, significant fissures 
are indicated.
    (B) Samples that dry without cracking are to be broken by hand. If 
considerable force is necessary to break a sample, the soil has 
significant cohesive material content. The soil can be classified as a 
unfissured cohesive material and the unconfined compressive strength 
should be determined.
    (C) If a sample breaks easily by hand, it is either a fissured 
cohesive material or a granular material. To distinguish between the 
two, pulverize the dried clumps of the sample by hand or by stepping on 
them. If the clumps do not pulverize easily, the material is cohesive 
with fissures. If they pulverize easily into very small fragments, the 
material is granular.

              Appendix B to Subpart P--Sloping and Benching

    (a) Scope and application. This appendix contains specifications for 
sloping and benching when used as methods of protecting employees 
working in excavations from cave-ins. The requirements of this appendix 
apply when the design of sloping and benching protective systems is to 
be performed in accordance with the requirements set forth in 
Sec. 1926.652(b)(2).
    (b) Definitions.
    Actual slope means the slope to which an excavation face is 
excavated.
    Distress means that the soil is in a condition where a cave-in is 
imminent or is likely to occur. Distress is evidenced by such phenomena 
as the development of fissures in the face of or adjacent to an open 
excavation; the subsidence of the edge of an excavation; the slumping of 
material from the face or the bulging or heaving of material from the 
bottom of an excavation; the spalling of material from the face of an 
excavation; and ravelling, i.e., small amounts of material such as 
pebbles or little clumps of material suddenly separating from the face 
of an excavation and trickling or rolling down into the excavation.

[[Page 383]]

    Maximum allowable slope means the steepest incline of an excavation 
face that is acceptable for the most favorable site conditions as 
protection against cave-ins, and is expressed as the ratio of horizontal 
distance to vertical rise (H:V).
    Short term exposure means a period of time less than or equal to 24 
hours that an excavation is open.
    (c) Requirements--(1) Soil classification. Soil and rock deposits 
shall be classified in accordance with appendix A to subpart P of part 
1926.
    (2) Maximum allowable slope. The maximum allowable slope for a soil 
or rock deposit shall be determined from Table B-1 of this appendix.
    (3) Actual slope. (i) The actual slope shall not be steeper than the 
maximum allowable slope.
    (ii) The actual slope shall be less steep than the maximum allowable 
slope, when there are signs of distress. If that situation occurs, the 
slope shall be cut back to an actual slope which is at least \1/2\ 
horizontal to one vertical (\1/2\H:1V) less steep than the maximum 
allowable slope.
    (iii) When surcharge loads from stored material or equipment, 
operating equipment, or traffic are present, a competent person shall 
determine the degree to which the actual slope must be reduced below the 
maximum allowable slope, and shall assure that such reduction is 
achieved. Surcharge loads from adjacent structures shall be evaluated in 
accordance with Sec. 1926.651(i).
    (4) Configurations. Configurations of sloping and benching systems 
shall be in accordance with Figure B-1.

          Appendix C to Subpart P--Timber Shoring for Trenches

    (a) Scope. This appendix contains information that can be used 
timber shoring is provided as a method of protection from cave-ins in 
trenches that do not exceed 20 feet (6.1 m) in depth. This appendix must 
be used when design of timber shoring protective systems is to be 
performed in accordance with Sec. 1926.652(c)(1). Other timber shoring 
configurations; other systems of support such as hydraulic and pneumatic 
systems; and other protective systems such as sloping, benching, 
shielding, and freezing systems must be designed in accordance with the 
requirements set forth in Sec. 1926.652(b) and Sec. 1926.652(c).
    (b) Soil Classification. In order to use the data presented in this 
appendix, the soil type or types in which the excavation is made must 
first be determined using the soil classification method set forth in 
appendix A of subpart P of this part.
    (c) Presentation of Information. Information is presented in several 
forms as follows:
    (1) Information is presented in tabular form in Tables C-1.1, C-1.2, 
and C-1.3, and Tables C-2.1, C-2.2 and C-2.3 following paragraph (g) of 
the appendix. Each table presents the minimum sizes of timber members to 
use in a shoring system, and each table contains data only for the 
particular soil type in which the excavation or portion of

[[Page 391]]

the excavation is made. The data are arranged to allow the user the 
flexibility to select from among several acceptable configurations of 
members based on varying the horizontal spacing of the crossbraces. 
Stable rock is exempt from shoring requirements and therefore, no data 
are presented for this condition.
    (2) Information concerning the basis of the tabular data and the 
limitations of the data is presented in paragraph (d) of this appendix, 
and on the tables themselves.
    (3) Information explaining the use of the tabular data is presented 
in paragraph (e) of this appendix.
    (4) Information illustrating the use of the tabular data is 
presented in paragraph (f) of this appendix.
    (5) Miscellaneous notations regarding Tables C-1.1 through C-1.3 and 
Tables C-2.1 through C-2.3 are presented in paragraph (g) of this 
Appendix.
    (d) Basis and limitations of the data.--(1) Dimensions of timber 
members. (i) The sizes of the timber members listed in Tables C-1.1 
through C-1.3 are taken from the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) 
report, ``Recommended Technical Provisions for Construction Practice in 
Shoring and Sloping of Trenches and Excavations.'' In addition, where 
NBS did not recommend specific sizes of members, member sizes are based 
on an analysis of the sizes required for use by existing codes and on 
empirical practice.
    (ii) The required dimensions of the members listed in Tables C-1.1 
through C-1.3 refer to actual dimensions and not nominal dimensions of 
the timber. Employers wanting to use nominal size shoring are directed 
to Tables C-2.1 through C-2.3, or have this choice under 
Sec. 1926.652(c)(3), and are referred to The Corps of Engineers, The 
Bureau of Reclamation or data from other acceptable sources.
    (2) Limitation of application. (i) It is not intended that the 
timber shoring specification apply to every situation that may be 
experienced in the field. These data were developed to apply to the 
situations that are most commonly experienced in current trenching 
practice. Shoring systems for use in situations that are not covered by 
the data in this appendix must be designed as specified in 
Sec. 1926.652(c).
    (ii) When any of the following conditions are present, the members 
specified in the tables are not considered adequate. Either an alternate 
timber shoring system must be designed or another type of protective 
system designed in accordance with Sec. 1926.652.
    (A) When loads imposed by structures or by stored material adjacent 
to the trench weigh in excess of the load imposed by a two-foot soil 
surcharge. The term ``adjacent'' as used here means the area within a 
horizontal distance from the edge of the trench equal to the depth of 
the trench.
    (B) When vertical loads imposed on cross braces exceed a 240-pound 
gravity load distributed on a one-foot section of the center of the 
crossbrace.
    (C) When surcharge loads are present from equipment weighing in 
excess of 20,000 pounds.
    (D) When only the lower portion of a trench is shored and the 
remaining portion of the trench is sloped or benched unless: The sloped 
portion is sloped at an angle less steep than three horizontal to one 
vertical; or the members are selected from the tables for use at a depth 
which is determined from the top of the overall trench, and not from the 
toe of the sloped portion.
    (e) Use of Tables. The members of the shoring system that are to be 
selected using this information are the cross braces, the uprights, and 
the wales, where wales are required. Minimum sizes of members are 
specified for use in different types of soil. There are six tables of 
information, two for each soil type. The soil type must first be 
determined in accordance with the soil classification system described 
in appendix A to subpart P of part 1926. Using the appropriate table, 
the selection of the size and spacing of the members is then made. The 
selection is based on the depth and width of the trench where the 
members are to be installed and, in most instances, the selection is 
also based on the horizontal spacing of the crossbraces. Instances where 
a choice of horizontal spacing of crossbracing is available, the 
horizontal spacing of the crossbraces must be chosen by the user before 
the size of any member can be determined. When the soil type, the width 
and depth of the trench, and the horizontal spacing of the crossbraces 
are known, the size and vertical spacing of the crossbraces, the size 
and vertical spacing of the wales, and the size and horizontal spacing 
of the uprights can be read from the appropriate table.
    (f) Examples to Illustrate the Use of Tables C-1.1 through C-1.3.
    (1) Example 1.
    A trench dug in Type A soil is 13 feet deep and five feet wide.
    From Table C-1.1, for acceptable arrangements of timber can be used.

                             Arrangement B1

    Space 4 x 4 crossbraces at six feet horizontally and four feet 
vertically.
    Wales are not required.
    Space 3 x 8 uprights at six feet horizontally. This arrangement is 
commonly called ``skip shoring.''

                             Arrangement B2

    Space 4 x 6 crossbraces at eight feet horizontally and four feet 
vertically.

    Spaces 3 x 8 uprights at six feet horizontally.
    (2) Example 2.
    A trench dug in Type B soil in 13 feet deep and five feet wide. From 
Table C-1.2 three acceptable arrangements of members are listed.

                             Arrangement B1

    Space 6 x 6 crossbraces at six feet horizontally and five feet 
vertically.
    Space 8 x 8 wales at five feet vertically.
    Space 2 x 6 uprights at two feet horizontally.

                             Arrangement B2

    Space 6 x 8 crossbraces at eight feet horizontally and five feet 
vertically.
    Space 10 x 10 wales at five feet vertically.
    Space 2 x 6 uprights at two feet horizontally.

                             Arrangement B3

    Space 8 x 8 crossbraces at 10 feet horizontally and five feet 
vertically.
    Space 10 x 12 wales at five feet vertically.
    Space 2 x 6 uprights at two feet vertically.
    (3) Example 3.
    A trench dug in Type C soil is 13 feet deep and five feet wide.
    From Table C-1.3 two acceptable arrangements of members can be used.

                             Arrangement B1

    Space 8 x 8 crossbraces at six feet horizontally and five feet 
vertically.
    Space 10 x 12 wales at five feet vertically.
    Position 2 x 6 uprights as closely together as possible.
    If water must be retained use special tongue and groove uprights to 
form tight sheeting.

                             Arrangement B2

    Space 8 x 10 crossbraces at eight feet horizontally and five feet 
vertically.
    Space 12 x 12 wales at five feet vertically.
    Position 2 x 6 uprights in a close sheeting configuration unless 
water pressure must be resisted. Tight sheeting must be used where water 
must be retained.
    (4) Example 4.
    A trench dug in Type C soil is 20 feet deep and 11 feet wide. The 
size and spacing of members for the section of trench that is over 15 
feet in depth is determined using Table C-1.3. Only one arrangement of 
members is provided.
    Space 8 x 10 crossbraces at six feet horizontally and five feet 
vertically.
    Space 12 x 12 wales at five feet vertically.
    Use 3 x 6 tight sheeting.
    Use of Tables C-2.1 through C-2.3 would follow the same procedures.
    (g) Notes for all Tables.
    1. Member sizes at spacings other than indicated are to be 
determined as specified in Sec. 1926.652(c), ``Design of Protective 
Systems.''
    2. When conditions are saturated or submerged use Tight Sheeting. 
Tight Sheeting refers to the use of specially-edged timber planks (e.g., 
tongue and groove) at least three inches thick, steel sheet piling, or 
similar construction that when driven or placed in position provide a 
tight wall to resist the lateral pressure of water and to prevent the 
loss of backfill material. Close Sheeting refers to the placement of 
planks side-by-side allowing as little space as possible between them.
    3. All spacing indicated is measured center to center.
    4. Wales to be installed with greater dimension horizontal.
    5. If the vertical distance from the center of the lowest crossbrace 
to the bottom of the trench exceeds two and one-half feet, uprights 
shall be firmly embedded or a mudsill shall be used. Where uprights are 
embedded, the vertical distance from the center of the lowest crossbrace 
to the bottom of the trench shall not exceed 36 inches. When mudsills 
are used, the vertical distance shall not exceed 42 inches. Mudsills are 
wales that are installed at the toe of the trench side.
    6. Trench jacks may be used in lieu of or in combination with timber 
crossbraces.
    7. Placement cf crossbraces. When the vertical spacing of 
crossbraces is four feet, place the top crossbrace no more than two feet 
below the top of the trench. When the vertical spacing of crossbraces is 
five feet, place the top crossbrace no more than 2.5 feet below the top 
of the trench.

    Appendix D to Subpart P--Aluminum Hydraulic Shoring for Trenches

    (a) Scope. This appendix contains information that can be used when 
aluminum hydraulic shoring is provided as a method of protection against 
cave-ins in trenches that do not exceed 20 feet (6.1m) in depth. This 
appendix must be used when design of the aluminum hydraulic protective 
system cannot be performed in accordance with Sec. 1926.652(c)(2).
    (b) Soil Classification. In order to use data presented in this 
appendix, the soi1 type or types in which the excavation is made must

[[Page 399]]

first be determined using the soil classification method set forth in 
appendix A of subpart P of part 1926.
    (c) Presentation of Information. Information is presented in several 
forms as follows:
    (1) Information is presented in tabular form in Tables D-1.1, D-1.2, 
D-1.3 and E-1.4. Each table presents the maximum vertical and horizontal 
spacings that may be used with various aluminum member sizes and various 
hydraulic cylinder sizes. Each table contains data only for the 
particular soil type in which the excavation or portion of the 
excavation is made. Tables D-1.1 and D-1.2 are for vertical shores in 
Types A and B soil. Tables D-1.3 and D1.4 are for horizontal waler 
systems in Types B and C soil.
    (2) Information concerning the basis of the tabular data and the 
limitations of the data is presented in paragraph (d) of this appendix.
    (3) Information explaining the use of the tabular data is presented 
in paragraph (e) of this appendix.
    (4) Information illustrating the use of the tabular data is 
presented in paragraph (f) of this appendix.
    (5) Miscellaneous notations (footnotes) regarding Table D-1.1 
through D-1.4 are presented in paragraph (g) of this appendix.
    (6) Figures, illustrating typical installations of hydraulic 
shoring, are included just prior to the Tables. The illustrations page 
is entitled ``Aluminum Hydraulic Shoring; Typical Installations.''
    (d) Basis and limitations of the data.
    (1) Vertical shore rails and horizontal wales are those that meet 
the Section Modulus requirements in the D-1 Tables. Aluminum material is 
6061-T6 or material of equivalent strength and properties.
    (2) Hydraulic cylinders specifications. (i) 2-inch cylinders shall 
be a minimum 2-inch inside diameter with a minimum safe working capacity 
of no less than 18,000 pounds axial compressive load at maximum 
extension. Maximum extension is to include full range of cylinder 
extensions as recommended by product manufaturer.
    (ii) 3-inch cylinders shall be a minimum 3-inch inside diameter with 
a safe working capacity of not less than 30,000 pounds axial compressive 
load at extensions as recommended by product manufacturer.
    (3) Limitation of application.
    (i) It is not intended that the aluminum hydraulic specification 
apply to every situation that may be experienced in the field. These 
data were developed to apply to the situations that are most commonly 
experienced in current trenching practice. Shoring systems for use in 
situations that are not covered by the data in this appendix must be 
otherwise designed as specified in Sec. 1926.652(c).
    (ii) When any of the following conditions are present, the members 
specified in the Tables are not considered adequate. In this case, an 
alternative aluminum hydraulic shoring system or other type of 
protective system must be designed in accordance with Sec. 1926.652.
    (A) When vertical loads imposed on cross braces exceed a 100 Pound 
gravity load distributed on a one foot section of the center of the 
hydraulic cylinder.
    (B) When surcharge loads are present from equipment weighing in 
excess of 20,000 pounds.
    (C) When only the lower portion or a trench is shored and the 
remaining portion of the trench is sloped or benched unless: The sloped 
portion is sloped at an angle less steep than three horizontal to one 
vertical; or the members are selected from the tables for use at a depth 
which is determined from the top of the overall trench, and not from the 
toe of the sloped portion.
    (e) Use of Tables D-1.1, D-1.2, D-1.3 and D-1.4. The members of the 
shoring system that are to be selected using this information are the 
hydraulic cylinders, and either the vertical shores or the horizontal 
wales. When a waler system is used the vertical timber sheeting to be 
used is also selected from these tables. The Tables D-1.1 and D-1.2 for 
vertical shores are used in Type A and B soils that do not require 
sheeting. Type B soils that may require sheeting, and Type C soils that 
always require sheeting are found in the horizontal wale Tables D-1.3 
and D-1.4. The soil type must first be determined in accordance with the 
soil classification system described in appendix A to subpart P of part 
1926. Using the appropriate table, the selection of the size and spacing 
of the members is made. The selection is based on the depth and width of 
the trench where the members are to be installed. In these tables the 
vertical spacing is held constant at four feet on center. The tables 
show the maximum horizontal spacing of cylinders allowed for each size 
of wale in the waler system tables, and in the vertical shore tables, 
the hydraulic cylinder horizontal spacing is the same as the vertical 
shore spacing.
    (f) Example to Illustrate the Use of the Tables:
    (1) Example 1:
    A trench dug in Type A soil is 6 feet deep and 3 feet wide. From 
Table D-1.1: Find vertical shores and 2 inch diameter cylinders spaced 8 
feet on center (o.c.) horizontally and 4 feet on center (o.c.) 
vertically. (See Figures 1 & 3 for typical installations.)
    (2) Example 2:
    A trench is dug in Type B soil that does not require sheeting, 13 
feet deep and 5 feet wide. From Table D-1.2: Find vertical shores and 2 
inch diameter cylinders spaced 6.5 feet o.c. horizontally and 4 feet

<R05>
Sec. 1926.705  Requirements for lift-slab construction operations.

    (a) Lift-slab operations shall be designed and planned by a 
registered professional engineer who has experience in lift-slab 
construction. Such plans and designs shall be implemented by the 
employer and shall include detailed instructions and sketches indicating 
the prescribed method of erection. These plans and designs shall also 
include provisions for ensuring lateral stability of the building/
structure during construction.
    (b) Jacks/lifting units shall be marked to indicate their rated 
capacity as established by the manufacturer.
    (c) Jacks/lifting units shall not be loaded beyond their rated 
capacity as established by the manufacturer.
    (d) Jacking equipment shall be capable of supporting at least two 
and one-half times the load being lifted during jacking operations and 
the equipment shall not be overloaded. For the purpose of this 
provision, jacking equipment includes any load bearing component which 
is used to carry out the lifting operation(s). Such equipment includes, 
but is not limited, to the following: threaded rods, lifting 
attachments, lifting nuts, hook-up collars, T-caps, shearheads, columns, 
and footings.
    (e) Jacks/lifting units shall be designed and installed so that they 
will neither lift nor continue to lift when they are loaded in excess of 
their rated capacity.
    (f) Jacks/lifting units shall have a safety device installed which 
will cause the jacks/lifting units to support the load in any position 
in the event any jack/lifting unit malfunctions or loses its lifting 
ability.
    (g) Jacking operations shall be synchronized in such a manner to 
ensure even and uniform lifting of the slab. During lifting, all points 
at which the slab is supported shall be kept within 1/2 inch of that 
needed to maintain the slab in a level position.
    (h) If leveling is automatically controlled, a device shall be 
installed that will stop the operation when the \1/2\inch tolerance set 
forth in paragraph (g) of this section is exceeded or where there is a 
malfunction in the jacking (lifting) system.

[[Page 415]]

    (i) If leveling is maintained by manual controls, such controls 
shall be located in a central location and attended by a competent 
person while lifting is in progress. In addition to meeting the 
definition in Sec. 1926.32(f), the competent person must be experienced 
in the lifting operation and with the lifting equipment being used.
    (j) The maximum number of manually controlled jacks/lifting units on 
one slab shall be limited to a number that will permit the operator to 
maintain the slab level within specified tolerances of paragraph (g) of 
this section, but in no case shall that number exceed 14.
    (k)(1) No employee, except those essential to the jacking operation, 
shall be permitted in the building/structure while any jacking operation 
is taking place unless the building/structure has been reinforced 
sufficiently to ensure its integrity during erection. The phrase 
``reinforced sufficiently to ensure its integrity'' used in this 
paragraph means that a registered professional engineer, independent of 
the engineer who designed and planned the lifting operation, has 
determined from the plans that if there is a loss of support at any jack 
location, that loss will be confined to that location and the structure 
as a whole will remain stable.
    (2) Under no circumstances, shall any employee who is not essential 
to the jacking operation be permitted immediately beneath a slab while 
it is being lifted.
    (3) For the purpose of paragraph (k) of this section, a jacking 
operation begins when a slab or group of slabs is lifted and ends when 
such slabs are secured (with either temporary connections or permanent 
connections).
    (4) Employers who comply with appendix A to Sec. 1926.705 shall be 
considered to be in compliance with the provisions of paragraphs (k)(1) 
through (k)(3) of this section.
    (l) When making temporary connections to support slabs, wedges shall 
be secured by tack welding, or an equivalent method of securing the 
wedges to prevent them from falling out of position. Lifting rods may 
not be released until the wedges at that column have been secured.
    (m) All welding on temporary and permanent connections shall be 
performed by a certified welder, familiar with the welding requirements 
specified in the plans and specifications for the lift-slab operation.
    (n) Load transfer from jacks/lifting units to building columns shall 
not be executed until the welds on the column shear plates (weld blocks) 
are cooled to air temperature.
    (o) Jacks/lifting units shall be positively secured to building 
columns so that they do not become dislodged or dislocated.
    (p) Equipment shall be designed and installed so that the lifting 
rods cannot slip out of position or the employer shall institute other 
measures, such as the use of locking or blocking devices, which will 
provide positive connection between the lifting rods and attachments and 
will prevent components from disengaging during lifting operations.

             Appendix to Sec. 1926.705--Lift-Slab Operations

                    (This Appendix is non-mandatory.)

    In paragraph 1926.705(k), OSHA requires employees to be removed from 
the building/structure during jacking operations unless an independent 
registered professional engineer, other than the engineer who designed 
and planned the lifting operation, has determined that the building/
structure has been sufficiently reinforced to insure the integrity of 
the building/structure. One method to comply with this provision is for 
the employer to ensure that continuous bottom steel is provided in every 
slab and in both directions through every wall or column head area. 
(Column head area means the distance between lines that are one and one 
half times the thickness of the slab or drop panel. These lines are 
located outside opposite faces of the outer edges of the shearhead 
sections--See Figure 1). The amount of bottom steel shall be established 
by assuming loss of support at a given lifting jack and then determining 
the steel necessary to carry, by catenary action over the span between 
surrounding supports, the slab service dead load plus any service dead 
and live loads likely to be acting on the slab during jacking. In 
addition, the surrounding supports must be capable of resisting any 
additional load transferred to them as a result of the loss of support 
at the lifting jack considered.

access zone shall remain in place until the requirements of paragraph 
(b) of this section have been met.
    (b) All masonry walls over eight feet in height shall be adequately 
braced to prevent overturning and to prevent collapse unless the wall is 
adequately supported so that it will not overturn or collapse. The 
bracing shall remain in place until permanent supporting elements of the 
structure are in place.

    (a) Scope and application. (1) This section applies to the 
construction of underground tunnels, shafts, chambers, and passageways. 
This section also applies to cut-and-cover excavations which are both 
physically connected to ongoing underground construction operations 
within the scope of this section, and covered in such a manner as to 
create conditions characteristic of underground construction.
    (2) This section does not apply to the following:
    (i) Excavation and trenching operations covered by subpart P of this 
part, such as foundation operations for above-ground structures that are 
not physically connected to underground construction operations, and 
surface excavation; nor
    (ii) Underground electrical transmission and distribution lines, as 
addressed in subpart V of this part.
    (b) Access and egress. (1) The employer shall provide and maintain 
safe means of access and egress to all work stations.

that employees are protected from being struck by excavators, haulage 
machines, trains and other mobile equipment.
    (3) The employer shall control access to all openings to prevent 
unauthorized entry underground. Unused chutes, manways, or other 
openings shall be tightly covered, bulkheaded, or fenced off, and shall 
be posted with warning signs indicating ``Keep Out'' or similar 
language. Completed or unused sections of the underground facility shall 
be barricaded.
    (c) Check-in/check-out. The employer shall maintain a check-in/
check-out procedure that will ensure that above-ground personnel can 
determine an accurate count of the number of persons underground in the 
event of an emergency. However, this procedure is not required when the 
construction of underground facilities designed for human occupancy has 
been sufficiently completed so that the permanent environmental controls 
are effective, and when the remaining construction activity will not 
cause any environmental hazard or structural failure within the 
facilities.
    (d) Safety instruction. All employees shall be instructed in the 
recognition and avoidance of hazards associated

[[Page 420]]

with underground construction activities including, where appropriate, 
the following subjects:

    check-out systems.

    (e) Notification. (1) Oncoming shifts shall be informed of any 
hazardous occurrences or conditions that have affected or might affect 
employee safety, including liberation of gas, equipment failures, earth 
or rock slides, cave-ins, floodings, fires or explosions.
    (2) The employer shall establish and maintain direct communications 
for coordination of activities with other employers whose operations at 
the jobsite affect or may affect the safety of employees underground.
    (f) Communications. (1) When natural unassisted voice communication 
is ineffective, a power-assisted means of voice communication shall be 
used to provide communication between the work face, the bottom of the 
shaft, and the surface.
    (2) Two effective means of communication, at least one of which 
shall be voice communication, shall be provided in all shafts which are 
being developed or used either for personnel access or for hoisting. 
Additional requirements for hoist operator communication are contained 
in paragraph (t)(3)(xiv) of this section.
    (3) Powered communication systems shall operate on an independent 
power supply, and shall be installed so that the use of or disruption of 
any one phone or signal location will not disrupt the operation of the 
system from any other location.
    (4) Communication systems shall be tested upon initial entry of each 
shift to the underground, and as often as necessary at later times, to 
ensure that they are in working order.
    (5) Any employee working alone underground in a hazardous location, 
who is both out of the range of natural unassisted voice communication 
and not under observation by other persons, shall be provided with an 
effective means of obtaining assistance in an emergency.
    (g) Emergency provisions--(1) Hoisting capability. When a shaft is 
used as a means of egress, the employer shall make advance arrangements 
for power-assisted hoisting capability to be readily available in an 
emergency, unless the regular hoisting means can continue to function in 
the event of an electrical power failure at the jobsite. Such hoisting 
means shall be designed so that the load hoist drum is powered in both 
directions of rotation and so that the brake is automatically applied 
upon power release or failure.
    (2) Self-rescuers. The employer must provide self-rescuers approved 
by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health under 42 
CFR part 84. The respirators must be immediately available to all 
employees at work stations in underground areas where employees might be 
trapped by smoke or gas. The selection, issuance, use, and care of 
respirators must be in accordance with 29 CFR 1926.103.
    (3) Designated person. At least one designated person shall be on 
duty above ground whenever any employee is working underground. This 
designated person shall be responsible for securing immediate aid and 
keeping an accurate count of employees underground in case of emergency. 
The designated person must not be so busy with other responsibilities 
that the counting function is encumbered.
    (4) Emergency lighting. Each employee underground shall have an 
acceptable portable hand lamp or cap lamp in his or her work area for 
emergency use, unless natural light or an emergency lighting system 
provides adequate illumination for escape.
    (5) Rescue teams. (i) On jobsites where 25 or more employees work 
underground at one time, the employer shall provide (or make 
arrangements in advance with locally available rescue services to 
provide) at least two 5-person rescue teams, one on the jobsite or 
within one-half hour travel time from the entry point, and the other

explosive limit for methane or other flammable gases measured at 12 
inches (304.8 mm) <plus-minus>0.25 inch (6.35 mm) from the roof, face, 
floor or walls in any underground work area for more than a 24-hour 
period; or
    (ii) The history of the geographical area or geological formation 
indicates that 10 percent or more of the lower explosive limit for 
methane or other flammable gases is likely to be encountered in such 
underground operations.
    (2) Gassy operations. Underground construction operations shall be 
classified as gassy if:
    (i) Air monitoring discloses 10 percent or more of the lower 
explosive limit for methane or other flammable gases measured at 12

floor or walls in any underground work area for three consecutive days; 
or
    (ii) There has been an ignition of methane or of other flammable 
gases emanating from the strata that indicates the presence of such 
gases; or
    (iii) The underground construction operation is both connected to an 
underground work area which is currently classified as gassy and is also 
subject to a continuous course of air containing the flammable gas 
concentration.
    (3) Declassification to potentially gassy operations. Underground 
construction gassy operations may be declassified to Potentially Gassy 
when air monitoring results remain under 10 percent of the lower 
explosive limit for methane or other flammable gases for three 
consecutive days.
    (i) Gassy operations-additional requirements. (1) Only acceptable 
equipment, maintained in suitable condition, shall be used in gassy 
operations.
    (2) Mobile diesel-powered equipment used in gassy operations shall 
be either approved in accordance with the requirements of 30 CFR part 36 
(formerly Schedule 31) by MSHA, or shall be demonstrated by the employer 
to be fully equivalent to such MSHA-approved equipment, and shall be 
operated in accordance with that part.
    (3) Each entrance to a gassy operation shall be prominently posted 
with signs notifying all entrants of the gassy classification.
    (4) Smoking shall be prohibited in all gassy operations and the 
employer shall be responsible for collecting all personal sources of 
ignition, such as matches and lighters, from all persons entering a 
gassy operation.
    (5) A fire watch as described in Sec. 1926.352(e) shall be 
maintained when hot work is performed.
    (6) Once an operation has met the criteria in paragraph (h)(2) 
warranting classification as gassy, all operations in the affected area, 
except the following, shall be discontinued until the operation either 
is in compliance with all of the gassy operation requirements or has 
been declassified in accordance with paragraph (h)(3) of this section:
    (i) Operations related to the control of the gas concentration;
    (ii) Installation of new equipment, or conversion of existing 
equipment, to comply with this paragraph (i); and
    (iii) Installation of above-ground controls for reversing the air 
flow.

control requirements for construction are found in Sec. 1926.55, except 
as modified by this section.
    (i)(A) The employer shall assign a competent person who shall 
perform all

[[Page 422]]

air monitoring required by this section.
    (B) Where this paragraph requires monitoring of airborne 
contaminants ``as often as necessary,'' the competent person shall make 
a reasonable determination as to which substances to monitor and how 
frequently to monitor, considering at least the following factors:
    (1) Location of jobsite: Proximity to fuel tanks, sewers, gas lines, 
old landfills, coal deposits, and swamps;
    (2) Geology: Geological studies of the jobsite, particularly 
involving the soil type and its permeability;
    (3) History: Presence of air contaminants in nearby jobsites, 
changes in levels of substances monitored on the prior shift; and
    (4) Work practices and jobsite conditions: The use of diesel 
engines, use of explosives, use of fuel gas, volume and flow of 
ventilation, visible atmospheric conditions, decompression of the 
atmosphere, welding, cutting and hot work, and employees' physical 
reactions to working underground.
    (ii)(A) The atmosphere in all underground work areas shall be tested 
as often as necessary to assure that the atmosphere at normal 
atmospheric pressure contains at least 19.5 percent oxygen and no more 
than 22 percent oxygen.
    (B) Tests for oxygen content shall be made before tests for air 
contaminants.
    (iii)(A) The atmosphere in all underground work areas shall be 
tested quantitatively for carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, hydrogen 
sulfide, and other toxic gases, dusts, vapors, mists, and fumes as often 
as necessary to ensure that the permissible exposure limits prescribed 
in Sec. 1926.55 are not exceeded.
    (B) The atmosphere in all underground work areas shall be tested 
quantitatively for methane and other flammable gases as often as 
necessary to determine:
    (1) Whether action is to be taken under paragraphs (j)(1)(vii), 
(viii), and (ix), of this section; and
    (2) Whether an operation is to be classified potentially gassy or 
gassy under paragraph (h) of this section.
    (C) If diesel-engine or gasoline-engine driven ventilating fans or 
compressors are used, an initial test shall be made of the inlet air of 
the fan or compressor, with the engines operating, to ensure that the 
air supply is not contaminated by engine exhaust.
    (D) Testing shall be performed as often as necessary to ensure that 
the ventilation requirements of paragraph (k) of this section are met.
    (iv) When rapid excavation machines are used, a continuous flammable 
gas monitor shall be operated at the face with the sensor(s) placed as 
high and close to the front of the machine's cutter head as practicable.
    (v)(A) Whenever air monitoring indicates the presence of 5 ppm or 
more of hydrogen sulfide, a test shall be conducted in the affected 
underground work area(s), at least at the beginning and midpoint of each 
shift, until the concentration of hydrogen sulfide has been less than 5 
ppm for 3 consecutive days.
    (B) Whenever hydrogen sulfide is detected in an amount exceeding 10 
ppm, a continuous sampling and indicating hydrogen sulfide monitor shall 
be used to monitor the affected work area.
    (C) Employees shall be informed when a concentration of 10 ppm 
hydrogen sulfide is exceeded.
    (D) The continuous sampling and indicating hydrogen sulfide monitor 
shall be designed, installed, and maintained to provide a visual and 
aural alarm when the hydrogen sulfide concentration reaches 20 ppm to 
signal that additional measures, such as respirator use, increased 
ventilation, or evacuation, might be necessary to maintain hydrogen 
sulfide exposure below the permissible exposure limit.
    (vi) When the competent person determines, on the basis of air 
monitoring results or other information, that air contaminants may be 
present in sufficient quantity to be dangerous to life, the employer 
shall:
    (A) Prominently post a notice at all entrances to the underground 
jobsite to inform all entrants of the hazardous condition; and
    (B) Ensure that the necessary precautions are taken.
    (vii) Whenever five percent or more of the lower explosive limit for 
methane or other flammable gases is detected in any underground work 
area(s)

[[Page 423]]

or in the air return, steps shall be taken to increase ventilation air 
volume or otherwise control the gas concentration, unless the employer 
is operating in accordance with the potentially gassy or gassy operation 
requirements. Such additional ventilation controls may be discontinued 
when gas concentrations are reduced below five percent of the lower 
explosive limit, but shall be reinstituted whenever the five percent 
level is exceeded.
    (viii) Whenever 10 percent or more of the lower explosive limit for 
methane or other flammable gases is detected in the vicinity of welding, 
cutting, or other hot work, such work shall be suspended until the 
concentration of such flammable gas is reduced to less than 10 percent 
of the lower explosive limit.
    (ix) Whenever 20 percent or more of the lower explosive limit for 
methane or other flammable gases is detected in any underground work 
area(s) or in the air return:
    (A) All employees, except those necessary to eliminate the hazard, 
shall be immediately withdrawn to a safe location above ground; and
    (B) Electrical power, except for acceptable pumping and ventilation 
equipment, shall be cut off to the area endangered by the flammable gas 
until the concentration of such gas is reduced to less than 20 percent 
of the lower explosive limit.
    (2) Additional monitoring for potentially gassy and gassy 
operations. Operations which meet the criteria for potentially gassy and 
gassy operations set forth in paragraph (h) of this section shall be 
subject to the additional monitoring requirements of this paragraph.
    (i) A test for oxygen content shall be conducted in the affected 
underground work areas and work areas immediately adjacent to such areas 
at least at the beginning and midpoint of each shift.
    (ii) When using rapid excavation machines, continuous automatic 
flammable gas monitoring equipment shall be used to monitor the air at 
the heading, on the rib, and in the return air duct. The continuous 
monitor shall signal the heading, and shut down electric power in the 
affected underground work area, except for acceptable pumping and 
ventilation equipment, when 20 percent or more of the lower explosive 
limit for methane or other flammable gases is encountered.
    (iii) A manual flammable gas monitor shall be used as needed, but at 
least at the beginning and midpoint of each shift, to ensure that the 
limits prescribed in paragraphs (h) and (j) are not exceeded. In 
addition, a manual electrical shut down control shall be provided near 
the heading.
    (iv) Local gas tests shall be made prior to and continuously during 
any welding, cutting, or other hot work.
    (v) In underground operations driven by drill-and-blast methods, the 
air in the affected area shall be tested for flammable gas prior to re-
entry after blasting, and continuously when employees are working 
underground.
    (3) Recordkeeping. A record of all air quality tests shall be 
maintained above ground at the worksite and be made available to the 
Secretary of Labor upon request. The record shall include the location, 
date, time, substance and amount monitored. Records of exposures to 
toxic substances shall be retained in accordance with Sec. 1910.20 of 
this chapter. All other air quality test records shall be retained until 
completion of the project.

underground work areas in sufficient quantities to prevent dangerous or 
harmful accumulation of dusts, fumes, mists, vapors or gases.
    (ii) Mechanical ventilation shall be provided in all underground 
work areas except when the employer can demonstrate that natural 
ventilation provides the necessary air quality through sufficient air 
volume and air flow.
    (2) A minimum of 200 cubic feet (5.7 m<SUP>3</SUP>) of fresh air per 
minute shall be supplied for each employee underground.
    (3) The linear velocity of air flow in the tunnel bore, in shafts, 
and in all other underground work areas shall be at least 30 feet (9.15 
m) per minute where blasting or rock drilling is conducted, or where 
other conditions likely to produce dust, fumes, mists, vapors, or gases 
in harmful or explosive quantities are present.
    (4) The direction of mechanical air flow shall be reversible.

[[Page 424]]

    (5) Following blasting, ventilation systems shall exhaust smoke and 
fumes to the outside atmosphere before work is resumed in affected 
areas.
    (6) Ventilation doors shall be designed and installed so that they 
remain closed when in use, regardless of the direction of the air flow.
    (7) When ventilation has been reduced to the extent that hazardous 
levels of methane or flammable gas may have accumulated, a competent 
person shall test all affected areas after ventilation has been restored 
and shall determine whether the atmosphere is within flammable limits 
before any power, other than for acceptable equipment, is restored or 
work is resumed.
    (8) Whenever the ventilation system has been shut down with all 
employees out of the underground area, only competent persons authorized 
to test for air contaminants shall be allowed underground until the 
ventilation has been restored and all affected areas have been tested 
for air contaminants and declared safe.
    (9) When drilling rock or concrete, appropriate dust control 
measures shall be taken to maintain dust levels within limits set in 
Sec. 1926.55. Such measures may include, but are not limited to, wet 
drilling, the use of vacuum collectors, and water mix spray systems.
    (10)(i) Internal combustion engines, except diesel-powered engines 
on mobile equipment, are prohibited underground.

other than gassy operations shall be either approved by MSHA in 
accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR part 32 (formerly Schedule 24), 
or shall be demonstrated by the employer to be fully equivalent to such 
MSHA-approved equipment, and shall be operated in accordance with that 
part. (Each brake horsepower of a diesel engine requires at least 100 
cubic feet (28.32 m<SUP>3</SUP>) of air per minute for suitable 
operation in addition to the air requirements for personnel. Some 
engines may require a greater amount of air to ensure that the allowable 
levels of carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, and nitrogen dioxide are not 
exceeded.)
    (11) Potentially gassy or gassy operations shall have ventilation 
systems installed which shall:
    (i) Be constructed of fire-resistant materials; and

[[Page 429]]

a cage or otherwise, shall be secured or stacked in a manner to prevent 
the load from shifting, snagging or falling into the shaft.
    (ii) A warning light suitably located to warn employees at the shaft 
bottom and subsurface shaft entrances shall flash whenever a load is 
above the shaft bottom or subsurface entrances, or the load is being 
moved in the shaft. This paragraph does not apply to fully enclosed 
hoistways.
    (iii) Whenever a hoistway is not fully enclosed and employees are at 
the shaft bottom, conveyances or equipment shall be stopped at least 15 
feet (4.57 m) above the bottom of the shaft and held there until the 
signalman at the bottom of the shaft directs the operator to continue 
lowering the load, except that the load may be lowered without stopping 
if the load or conveyance is within full view of a bottom signalman who 
is in constant voice communication with the operator.
    (iv) (A) Before maintenance, repairs, or other work is commenced in 
the shaft served by a cage, skip, or bucket, the operator and other 
employees in the area shall be informed and given suitable instructions.
    (B) A sign warning that work is being done in the shaft shall be

their operation.
    (vii) Cage, skip, and load connections to the hoist rope shall be 
made so that the force of the hoist pull, vibration, misalignment, 
release of lift force, or impact will not disengage the connection. 
Moused or latched open-throat hooks do not meet this requirement.
    (viii) When using wire rope wedge sockets, means shall be provided 
to prevent wedge escapement and to ensure that the wedge is properly 
seated.
    (2) Additional requirements for cranes. Cranes shall be equipped 
with a limit switch to prevent overtravel at the boom tip. Limit 
switches are to be used only to limit travel of loads when operational 
controls malfunction and shall not be used as a substitute for other 
operational controls.
    (3) Additional requirements for hoists. (i) Hoists shall be designed 
so that the load hoist drum is powered in both directions of rotation, 
and so that brakes are automatically applied upon power release or 
failure.
    (ii) Control levers shall be of the ``deadman type'' which return 
automatically to their center (neutral) position upon release.
    (iii) When a hoist is used for both personnel hoisting and material 
hoisting, load and speed ratings for personnel and for materials shall 
be assigned to the equipment.
    (iv) Material hoisting may be performed at speeds higher than the 
rated speed for personnel hoisting if the hoist and components have been 
designed for such higher speeds and if shaft conditions permit.
    (v) Employees shall not ride on top of any cage, skip or bucket 
except when necessary to perform inspection or maintenance of the 
hoisting system, in which case they shall be protected by a body belt/
harness system to prevent falling.
    (vi) Personnel and materials (other than small tools and supplies 
secured in a manner that will not create a hazards to employees) shall 
not be hoisted together in the same conveyance. However, if the operator 
is protected from the shifting of materials, then the operator may ride 
with materials in cages or skips which are designed to be controlled by 
an operator within the cage or skip.
    (vii) Line speed shall not exceed the design limitations of the 
systems.
    (viii) Hoists shall be equipped with landing level indicators at the 
operator's station. Marking of the hoist rope does not satisfy this 
requirement.
    (ix) Whenever glazing is used in the hoist house, it shall be safety 
glass, or its equivalent, and be free of distortions and obstructions.
    (x) A fire extinguisher that is rated at least 2A:10B:C (multi-
purpose, dry chemical) shall be mounted in each hoist house.
    (xi) Hoist controls shall be arranged so that the operator can 
perform all

[[Page 430]]

operating cycle functions and reach the emergency power cutoff without 
having to reach beyond the operator's normal operating position.
    (xii) Hoists shall be equipped with limit switches to prevent 
overtravel at the top and bottom of the hoistway.
    (xiii) Limit switches are to be used only to limit travel of loads 
when operational controls malfunction and shall not be used as a 
substitute for other operational controls.

skips, and buckets that may swing, bump, or snag against shaft sides or 
other structural protrusions shall be guided by fenders, rails, ropes, 
or a combination of those means.
    (xvi) When sinking shafts more than 75 feet (22.86 m) in depth, all 
cages, skips, and buckets shall be rope or rail-guided to within a rail 
length from the sinking operation.
    (xvii) Cages, skips, and buckets in all completed shafts, or in all 
shafts being used as completed shafts, shall be rope or rail-guided for 
the full length of their travel.
    (xviii) Wire rope used in load lines of material hoists shall be 
capable of supporting, without failure, at least five times the maximum 
intended load or the factor recommended by the rope manufacturer, 
whichever is greater. Refer to Sec. 1926.552(c)(14)(iii) of this part 
for design factors for wire rope used in personnel hoists. The design 
factor shall be calculated by dividing the breaking strength of wire 
rope, as reported in the manufacturer's rating tables, by the total 
static load, including the weight of the wire rope in the shaft when 
fully extended.
    (xix) A competent person shall visually check all hoisting 
machinery, equipment, anchorages, and hoisting rope at the beginning of 
each shift and during hoist use, as necessary.
    (xx) Each safety device shall be checked by a competent person at 
least weekly during hoist use to ensure suitable operation and safe 
condition.
    (xxi) In order to ensure suitable operation and safe condition of 
all functions and safety devices, each hoist assembly shall be inspected 
and load-tested to 100 percent of its rated capacity: at the time of 
installation; after any repairs or alterations affecting its structural 
integrity; after the operation of any safety device; and annually when 
in use. The employer shall prepare a certification record which includes 
the date each inspection and load-test was performed; the signature of 
the person who performed the inspection and test; and a serial number or 
other identifier for the hoist that was inspected and tested. The most 
recent certification record shall be maintained on file until completion 
of the project.
    (xxii) Before hoisting personnel or material, the operator shall 
perform a test run of any cage or skip whenever it has been out of 
service for one complete shift, and whenever the assembly or components 
have been repaired or adjusted.
    (xxiii) Unsafe conditions shall be corrected before using the 
equipment.
    (4) Additional requirements for personnel hoists. (i) Hoist drum 
systems shall be equipped with at least two means of stopping the load, 
each of which shall be capable of stopping and holding 150 percent of 
the hoist's rated line pull. A broken-rope safety, safety catch, or 
arrestment device is not a permissible means of stopping under this 
paragraph.
    (ii) The operator shall remain within sight and sound of the signals 
at the operator's station.
    (iii) All sides of personnel cages shall be enclosed by one-half 
inch (12.70 mm) wire mesh (not less than No. 14 gauge or equivalent) to 
a height of not less than 6 feet (1.83 m). However, when the cage or 
skip is being used as a work platform, its sides may be reduced in 
height to 42 inches 1.07 m) when the conveyance is not in motion.
    (iv) All personnel cages shall be provided with positive locking 
door that does not open outward.
    (v) All personnel cages shall be provided with a protective canopy.

square inch gauge or over.
    Stage 1 consists of a reduction in ambient pressure ranging from 10 
to a maximum of 16 pounds per square inch, but in no instance will the 
pressure be reduced below 4 pounds at the end of stage 1. This reduction 
in pressure in stage 1 will always take place at a rate not greater than 
5 pounds per minute.
    Further reduction in pressure will take place during stage 2 and 
subsequent stages as required at a slower rate, but in no event at a 
rate greater than 1 pound per minute.
    Decompression Table No. 1 indicates in the body of the table the 
total decompression time in minutes for various combinations of working 
chamber pressure and exposure time.
    Decompression Table No. 2 indicates for the same various 
combinations of working chamber pressure and exposure time the 
following:
    a. The number of stages required;
    b. The reduction in pressure and the terminal pressure for each 
required stage;
    c. The time in minutes through which the reduction in pressure is 
accomplished for each required stage;
    d. The pressure reduction rate in minutes per pound for each 
required stage;

Important Note: The Pressure Reduction in Each Stage is Accomplished at 
a Uniform Rate. Do Not Interpolate Between Values Shown on the Tables. 
Use the Next Higher Value of Working Chamber Pressure or Exposure Time 
Should the Actual Working Chamber Pressure or the Actual Exposure Time, 
Respectively, Fall Between Those for Which Calculated Values Are Shown 
in the Body of the Tables.

    Authority: Sec. 107, Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act 
(Construction Safety Act) (40 U.S.C. 333); secs. 4, 6, 8, Occupational 
Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 653, 655, 657); Secretary of 
Labor's Order No. 12-71 (36 FR 8754), 8-76 (41 FR 25059), or 9-83 (48 FR 
35736), as applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 1926.850  Preparatory operations.

    (a) Prior to permitting employees to start demolition operations, an 
engineering survey shall be made, by a competent person, of the 
structure to determine the condition of the framing, floors, and walls, 
and possibility of unplanned collapse of any portion of the structure. 
Any adjacent structure where employees may be exposed shall also be 
similarly checked. The employer shall have in writing evidence that such 
a survey has been performed.
    (b) When employees are required to work within a structure to be 
demolished which has been damaged by fire, flood, explosion, or other 
cause, the walls or floor shall be shored or braced.
    (c) All electric, gas, water, steam, sewer, and other service lines 
shall be shut off, capped, or otherwise controlled, outside the building 
line before demolition work is started. In each case, any utility 
company which is involved shall be notified in advance.
    (d) If it is necessary to maintain any power, water or other 
utilities during demolition, such lines shall be temporarily relocated, 
as necessary, and protected.
    (e) It shall also be determined if any type of hazardous chemicals, 
gases, explosives, flammable materials, or similarly dangerous 
substances have been used in any pipes, tanks, or other equipment on the 
property. When the presence of any such substances is apparent or 
suspected, testing and purging shall be performed and the hazard 
eliminated before demolition is started.
    (f) Where a hazard exists from fragmentation of glass, such hazards 
shall be removed.
    (g) Where a hazard exists to employees falling through wall 
openings, the opening shall be protected to a height of approximately 42 
inches.
    (h) When debris is dropped through holes in the floor without the 
use of chutes, the area onto which the material is dropped shall be 
completely enclosed with barricades not less than 42 inches high and not 
less than 6 feet back from the projected edge of the opening above. 
Signs, warning of the hazard of falling materials, shall be posted at 
each level. Removal shall not be permitted in this lower area until 
debris handling ceases above.
    (i) All floor openings, not used as material drops, shall be covered 
over with material substantial enough to support the weight of any load 
which may be imposed. Such material shall be properly secured to prevent 
its accidental movement.
    (j) Except for the cutting of holes in floors for chutes, holes 
through which to drop materials, preparation of storage space, and 
similar necessary preparatory work, the demolition of exterior walls and 
floor construction shall begin at the top of the structure and proceed 
downward. Each story of exterior wall and floor construction shall be 
removed and dropped into the storage space before commencing the removal 
of exterior walls and floors in the story next below.
    (k) Employee entrances to multi-story structures being demolished 
shall be completely protected by sidewalk sheds or canopies, or both, 
providing

[[Page 451]]

protection from the face of the building for a minimum of 8 feet. All 
such canopies shall be at least 2 feet wider than the building entrances 
or openings (1 foot wider on each side thereof), and shall be capable of 
sustaining a load of 150 pounds per square foot.

thereto, which are covered by this section, shall be periodically 
inspected and maintained in a clean safe condition.
    (c) In a multistory building, when a stairwell is being used, it 
shall be properly illuminated by either natural or artificial means, and 
completely and substantially covered over at a point not less than two 
floors below the floor on which work is being performed, and access to 
the floor where the work is in progress shall be through a properly 
lighted, protected, and separate passageway.


<R05>
Sec. 1926.852  Chutes.

    (a) No material shall be dropped to any point lying outside the 
exterior walls of the structure unless the area is effectively 
protected.
    (b) All materials chutes, or sections thereof, at an angle of more 
than 45 deg. from the horizontal, shall be entirely enclosed, except for 
openings equipped with closures at or about floor level for the 
insertion of materials. The openings shall not exceed 48 inches in 
height measured along the wall of the chute. At all stories below the 
top floor, such openings shall be kept closed when not in use.
    (c) A substantial gate shall be installed in each chute at or near 
the discharge end. A competent employee shall be assigned to control the 
operation of the gate, and the backing and loading of trucks.
    (d) When operations are not in progress, the area surrounding the 
discharge end of a chute shall be securely closed off.
    (e) Any chute opening, into which workmen dump debris, shall be 
protected by a substantial guardrail approximately 42 inches above the 
floor or other surface on which the men stand to dump the material. Any 
space between the chute and the edge of openings in the floors through 
which it passes shall be solidly covered over.
    (f) Where the material is dumped from mechanical equipment or 
wheelbarrows, a securely attached toeboard or bumper, not less than 4 
inches thick and 6 inches high, shall be provided at each chute opening.
    (g) Chutes shall be designed and constructed of such strength as to 
eliminate failure due to impact of materials or debris loaded therein.


<R05>
Sec. 1926.853  Removal of materials through floor openings.

    Any openings cut in a floor for the disposal of materials shall be 
no larger in size than 25 percent of the aggregate of the total floor 
area, unless the lateral supports of the removed flooring remain in 
place. Floors weakened or otherwise made unsafe by demolition operations 
shall be shored to carry safely the intended imposed load from 
demolition operations.

shall conduct a thorough survey for extraneous currents, and all 
dangerous currents shall be eliminated before any holes are loaded.
    (c) In any single blast using electric blasting caps, all caps shall 
be of the same style or function, and of the same manufacture.
    (d) Electric blasting shall be carried out by using blasting 
circuits or power circuits in accordance with the electric blasting cap 
manufacturer's recommendations, or an approved contractor or his 
designated representative.
    (e) When firing a circuit of electric blasting caps, care must be 
exercised to ensure that an adequate quantity of delivered current is 
available, in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
    (f) Connecting wires and lead wires shall be insulated single solid 
wires of sufficient current-carrying capacity.
    (g) Bus wires shall be solid single wires of sufficient current-
carrying capacity.
    (h) When firing electrically, the insulation on all firing lines 
shall be adequate and in good condition.
    (i) A power circuit used for firing electric blasting caps shall not 
be grounded.
    (j) In underground operations when firing from a power circuit, a 
safety switch shall be placed in the permanent firing line at intervals. 
This switch shall be made so it can be locked only in the ``Off'' 
position and shall be provided with a short-circuiting arrangement of 
the firing lines to the cap circuit.
    (k) In underground operations there shall be a ``lightning'' gap of 
at least 5 feet in the firing system ahead of the main firing switch; 
that is, between this switch and the source of power. This gap shall be 
bridged by a flexible jumper cord just before firing the blast.

[[Page 459]]

    (l) When firing from a power circuit, the firing switch shall be 
locked in the open or ``Off'' position at all times, except when firing. 
It shall be so designed that the firing lines to the cap circuit are 
automatically short-circuited when the switch is in the ``Off'' 
position. Keys to this switch shall be entrusted only to the blaster.
    (m) Blasting machines shall be in good condition and the efficiency 
of the machine shall be tested periodically to make certain that it can 
deliver power at its rated capacity.
    (n) When firing with blasting machines, the connections shall be 
made as recommended by the manufacturer of the electric blasting caps 
used.
    (o) The number of electric blasting caps connected to a blasting 
machine shall not be in excess of its rated capacity. Furthermore, in 
primary blasting, a series circuit shall contain no more caps than the 
limits recommended by the manufacturer of the electric blasting caps in 
use.
    (p) The blaster shall be in charge of the blasting machines, and no 
other person shall connect the leading wires to the machine.
    (q) Blasters, when testing circuits to charged holes, shall use only 
blasting galvanometers or other instruments that are specifically 
designed for this purpose.
    (r) Whenever the possibility exists that a leading line or blasting 
wire might be thrown over a live powerline by the force of an explosion, 
care shall be taken to see that the total length of wires are kept too 
short to hit the lines, or that the wires are securely anchored to the 
ground. If neither of these requirements can be satisfied, a nonelectric 
system shall be used.
    (s) In electrical firing, only the man making leading wire 
connections shall fire the shot. All connections shall be made from the 
bore hole back to the source of firing current, and the leading wires 
shall remain shorted and not be connected to the blasting machine or 
other source of current until the charge is to be fired.
    (t) After firing an electric blast from a blasting machine, the 
leading wires shall be immediately disconnected from the machine and 
short-circuited.

or common purpose of which is to function by explosion; that is, with 
substantially instantaneous release of gas and heat, unless such 
compound, mixture or device is otherwise specifically classified by the 
U.S. Department of Transportation.
    (2) All material which is classified as Class A, Class B, and Class 
C Explosives by the U.S. Department of Transportation.
    (3) Classification of explosives by the U.S. Department of 
Transportation is as follows:

    Class A Explosives. Possessing detonating hazard, such as dynamite, 
nitroglycerin, picric acid, lead azide, fulminate of mercury, black 
powder, blasting caps, and detonating primers.
    Class B Explosives. Possessing flammable hazard, such as propellant 
explosives, including some smokeless propellants.
    Class C Explosives. Include certain types of manufactured articles 
which contain Class A or Class B explosives, or both, as components, but 
in restricted quantities.

    (o) Fuse lighters--Special devices for the purpose of igniting 
safety fuse.
    (p) Magazine--Any building or structure, other than an explosives 
manufacturing building, used for the storage of explosives.
    (q) Misfire--An explosive charge which failed to detonate.
    (r) Mud-capping (sometimes known as bulldozing, adobe blasting, or 
dobying). The blasting of boulders by placing a quantity of explosives 
against a rock, boulder, or other object without confining the 
explosives in a drill hole.
    (s) Nonelectric delay blasting cap--A blasting cap with an integral 
delay element in conjunction with and capable of being detonated by a 
detonation impulse or signal from miniaturized detonating cord.
    (t) Primary blasting--The blasting operation by which the original 
rock formation is dislodged from its natural location.
    (u) Primer--A cartridge or container of explosives into which a 
detonator or detonating cord is inserted or attached.
    (v) Safety fuse--A flexible cord containing an internal burning 
medium by which fire is conveyed at a continuous and uniform rate for 
the purpose of firing blasting caps.
    (w) Secondary blasting--The reduction of oversize material by the 
use of explosives to the dimension required for handling, including 
mudcapping and blockholing.
    (x) Stemming--A suitable inert incombustible material or device used 
to confine or separate explosives in a drill hole, or to cover 
explosives in mud-capping.
    (y) Springing--The creation of a pocket in the bottom of a drill 
hole by the use of a moderate quantity of explosives in order that 
larger quantities or explosives may be inserted therein.
    (z) Water gels, or slurry explosives--A wide variety of materials 
used for blasting. They all contain substantial proportions of water and 
high proportions of ammonium nitrate, some of which is in solution in 
the water. Two broad classes of water gels are: (1) Those which are 
sensitized by a material classed as an explosive, such as TNT or 
smokeless powder, and (2) those which contain no ingredient classified 
as an explosive; these are sensitized with metals such as aluminum or 
with other fuels. Water gels may be premixed at an explosives plant or 
mixed at the site immediately before delivery into the bore hole.
    (aa) Semiconductive hose. Semiconductive hose--a hose with an 
electrical resistance high enough to limit flow of stray electric 
currents to safe levels, yet not so high as to prevent drainage of 
static electric charges to ground; hose of not more than 2 megohms 
resistance over its entire length and of not less than 5,000 ohms per 
foot meets the requirement.

Dimensions of critical zone, inches.......  <SUP>plus-minus0.5 in.           
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) Vehicle condition. The ROPS to be tested must be attached to the 
vehicle structure in the same manner as it will be attached during 
vehicle use. A totally assembled vehicle is not required. However, the 
vehicle structure and frame which support the ROPS must

[[Page 480]]

represent the actual vehicle installation. All normally detachable 
windows, panels, or nonstructural fittings shall be removed so that they 
do not contribute to the strength of the ROPS.
    (e) Test procedure. The test procedure shall include the following, 
in the sequence indicated:
    (1) Energy absorbing capabilities of ROPS shall be verified when 
loaded laterally by incrementally applying a distributed load to the 
longitudinal outside top member of the ROPS, as shown in Figure W-1, W-
2, or W-3, as applicable. The distributed load must be applied so as to 
result in approximately uniform deflection of the ROPS. The load 
increments should correspond with approximately 0.5 in. ROPS deflection 
increment in the direction of the load application, measured at the ROPS 
top edge. Should the operator's seat be offcenter, the load shall be 
applied on the offcenter side. For each applied load increment, the 
total load (lb.) versus corresponding deflection (in.) shall be plotted, 
and the area under the load -deflection curve shall be calculated. This 
area is equal to the energy (in.-lb.) absorbed by the ROPS. For a 
typical load-deflection curve and calculation method, see Figure W-5.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC30OC91.053



Incremental loading shall be continued until the ROPS has absorbed the 
amount of energy and the minimum applied load specified under paragraph 
(f) of this section has been reached or surpassed.
    (2) To cover the possibility of the vehicle coming to rest on its 
top, the support capability shall be verified by applying a distributed 
vertical load to the top of the ROPS so as to result in approximately 
uniform deflection (see Figure W-1). The load magnitude is specified in 
paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (3) The low temperature impact strength of the material used in the 
ROPS shall be verified by suitable material tests or material 
certification (see paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section).
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC30OC91.054

    (f) Performance requirements--(1) General performance requirements. 
(i) No repairs or straightening of any member shall be carried out 
between each prescribed test.
    (ii) During each test, no part of the ROPS shall enter the critical 
zone as detailed in SAE J397 (1969). Deformation of the ROPS shall not 
allow the plane of the ground to enter this zone.
    (2) Specific performance requirements. (i) The energy requirement 
for purposes of meeting the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section is to be determined by referring to the plot of the energy 
versus weight of vehicle (see Figure W-6 for rubber-tired self-propelled 
scrapers; Figure W-7 for rubber-tired front-end loaders and rubber-tired 
dozers; Figure W-8 for crawler tractors and crawler-type loaders; and 
Figure W-9 for motor graders). For purposes of this section, force and 
weight are measured as pounds (lb.); energy (U) is measured as inch-
pounds.

[[Page 483]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC30OC91.055


    (ii) The applied load must attain at least a value which is 
determined by multiplying the vehicle weight by the corresponding factor 
shown in Figure W-10 for rubber-tired self-propelled scrapers; in Figure 
W-11 for rubber-tired front-end loaders and rubber-tired dozers; in 
Figure W-12 for crawler tractors and crawler-type loaders; and in Figure 
W-13 for motor graders.
    (iii) The load magnitude for purposes of compliance with paragraph 
(e)(2) of this section is equal to the vehicle weight. The test of load 
magnitude shall only be made after the requirements of paragraph 
(f)(2)(i) of this section are met.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC30OC91.056

    (iv) Material used in the ROPS must have the capability of 
performing at zero degrees Fahrenheit, or exhibit Charpy V notch impact 
strength of 8 foot-pounds at minus 20 deg. Fahrenheit.

This is a standard Charpy specimen as described in American Society of 
Testing and Materials A 370, Methods and Definitions for Mechanical 
Testing of Steel Products (available at each Regional Office of the 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration). The purpose of this 
requirement is to reduce the tendency of brittle fracture associated 
with dynamic loading, low temperature operation, and stress raisers 
which cannot be entirely avoided on welded structures.

    (g) Definitions. For purposes of this section, ``vehicle weight'' 
means the manufacturer's maximum weight of the prime mover for rubber-
tired self-propelled scrapers. For other types of equipment to which 
this section applies, ``vehicle weight'' means the manufacturer's 
maximum recommended weight of the vehicle plus the heaviest attachment.

1970) defines agricultural tractor as a ``wheel-type vehicle of more 
than 20 engine horsepower designed to furnish the power to pull, carry, 
propel, or drive implements that are designed for agricultural usage.'' 
Since this Part 1926 applies only to construction work, the following 
definition of ``agricultural tractor'' is adopted for purposes of this 
subpart: ``Agricultural tractor'' means a wheel-type vehicle of more 
than 20 engine horsepower, used in construction work, which is designed 
to furnish the power to pull, propel, or drive implements.
    (2) Industrial tractor means that class of wheeled type tractor of 
more than 20 engine horsepower (other than rubber-tired loaders and 
dozers described in Sec. 1926.1001), used in operations such as 
landscaping, construction services, loading, digging, grounds keeping, 
and highway maintenance.

Sec. 1926.1003  Overhead protection for operators of agricultural and industrial tractors.

    (a) General--(1) Purpose. When overhead protection is provided on 
wheel-type agricultural and industrial tractors, the overhead protection 
shall be designed and installed according to the requirements contained 
in the test and performance requirements of Society of Automotive 
Engineers Standard J167-1970, Protective Frame with Overhead Protection-
Test Procedures and Performance Requirements, which pertains to overhead 
protection requirements and is incorporated by reference. The 
incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal 
Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies 
may be obtained from the Society of Automotive Engineers, 485 Lexington 
Avenue, New York, NY 10017. Copies may be inspected at the OSHA Docket 
Office, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Ave., NW., Room 
N2634, or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol St., 
NW., Suite 700, Washington, D.C. The standard also appears in the 1971 
SAE Handbook, which may be examined in each of OSHA's Regional Offices. 
The provisions of Sec. 1926.1001 for rubber-tired dozers and rubber-
tired loaders may be used in lieu of the standards contained in this 
section. The purpose of the standard is to minimize the possibility of 
operator injury resulting from overhead hazards such as flying and 
falling objects, and at the same time to minimize the possibility of 
operator injury from the cover itself in the event of accidental upset.
    (2) Applicability. This standard applies to wheel-type agricultural 
tractors used in construction work and to wheel-type industrial tractors 
used in construction work. See Sec. 1926.1002 (b) and (j). In the case 
of machines to which Sec. 1926.604 (relating to site clearing) also 
applies, the overhead protection may be either the type of protection 
provided in Sec. 1926.604 or the type of protection provided by this 
section.

[[Page 487]]

    (b) Overhead protection. When overhead protection is installed on 
wheel-type agricultural or industrial tractors used in construction 
work, it shall meet the requirements of this paragraph. The overhead 
protection may be constructed of a solid material. If grid or mesh is 
used, the largest permissible opening shall be such that the maximum 
circle which can be inscribed between the elements of the grid or mesh 
is 1.5 in. (38 mm.) in diameter. The overhead protection shall not be 
installed in such a way as to become a hazard in the case of upset.

(1.1 m) above the top of the access level or landing platform served by 
the ladder. For a parapet ladder, the access level shall be the roof if 
the parapet is cut to permit passage through the parapet; if the parapet 
is continuous, the access level shall be the top of the parapet.
    (25) For through-fixed-ladder extensions, the steps or rungs shall 
be omitted from the extension and the extension of the side rails shall 
be flared to provide not less than 24 inches (61 cm) nor more than 30 
inches (76 cm) clearance between side rails. Where ladder safety devices 
are provided, the maximum clearance between side rails of the extensions 
shall not exceed 36 inches (91 cm).
    (26) For side-step fixed ladders, the side rails and the steps or 
rungs shall be continuous in the extension.
    (27) Individual-rung/step ladders, except those used where their 
access openings are covered with manhole covers or hatches, shall extend 
at least 42 inches (1.1 m) above an access level or landing platform 
either by the continuation of the rung spacings as horizontal grab bars 
or by providing vertical grab bars that shall have the same lateral 
spacing as the vertical legs of the rungs.
    (b) Use. The following requirements apply to the use of all ladders, 
including job-made ladders, except as otherwise indicated:
    (1) When portable ladders are used for access to an upper landing 
surface, the ladder side rails shall extend at least 3 feet (.9 m) above 
the upper landing surface to which the ladder is used to gain access; 
or, when such an extension is not possible because of the ladder's 
length, then the ladder shall be secured at its top to a rigid support 
that will not deflect, and a grasping device, such as a grabrail, shall 
be provided to assist employees in mounting and dismounting the ladder. 
In no case shall the extension be such that ladder deflection under a 
load would, by itself, cause the ladder to slip off its support.
    (2) Ladders shall be maintained free of oil, grease, and other 
slipping hazards.
    (3) Ladders shall not be loaded beyond the maximum intended load for 
which they were built, nor beyond their manufacturer's rated capacity.
    (4) Ladders shall be used only for the purpose for which they were 
designed.
    (5)(i) Non-self-supporting ladders shall be used at an angle such 
that the horizontal distance from the top support to the foot of the 
ladder is approximately one-quarter of the working length of the ladder 
(the distance along the ladder between the foot and the top support).
    (ii) Wood job-made ladders with spliced side rails shall be used at 
an angle such that the horizontal distance is one-eighth the working 
length of the ladder.
    (iii) Fixed ladders shall be used at a pitch no greater than 90 
degrees from the horizontal, as measured to the back side of the ladder.
    (6) Ladders shall be used only on stable and level surfaces unless 
secured to prevent accidental displacement.
    (7) Ladders shall not be used on slippery surfaces unless secured or 
provided with slip-resistant feet to prevent accidental displacement. 
Slip-resistant feet shall not be used as a substitute for care in 
placing, lashing, or holding a ladder that is used upon slippery 
surfaces including, but not limited to, flat metal or concrete surfaces 
that are constructed so they cannot be prevented from becoming slippery.
    (8) Ladders placed in any location where they can be displaced by 
workplace activities or traffic, such as in passageways, doorways, or 
driveways, shall be secured to prevent accidental displacement, or a 
barricade shall be used to keep the activities or traffic away from the 
ladder.
    (9) The area around the top and bottom of ladders shall be kept 
clear.
    (10) The top of a non-self-supporting ladder shall be placed with 
the two rails supported equally unless it is equipped with a single 
support attachment.
    (11) Ladders shall not be moved, shifted, or extended while 
occupied.
    (12) Ladders shall have nonconductive siderails if they are used 
where the employee or the ladder could contact exposed energized 
electrical equipment, except as provided in Sec. 1926.951(c)(1) of this 
part.

[[Page 494]]

    (13) The top or top step of a stepladder shall not be used as a 
step.
    (14) Cross-bracing on the rear section of stepladders shall not be 
used for climbing unless the ladders are designed and provided with 
steps for climbing on both front and rear sections.
    (15) Ladders shall be inspected by a competent person for visible 
defects on a periodic basis and after any occurrence that could affect 
their safe use.
    (16) Portable ladders with structural defects, such as, but not 
limited to, broken or missing rungs, cleats, or steps, broken or split 
rails, corroded components, or other faulty or defective components, 
shall either be immediately marked in a manner that readily identifies 
them as defective, or be tagged with ``Do Not Use'' or similar language, 
and shall be withdrawn from service until repaired.
    (17) Fixed ladders with structural defects, such as, but not limited 
to, broken or missing rungs, cleats, or steps, broken or split rails, or 
corroded components, shall be withdrawn from service until repaired. The 
requirement to withdraw a defective ladder from service is satisfied if 
the ladder is either:
    (i) Immediately tagged with ``Do Not Use'' or similar language,
    (ii) Marked in a manner that readily identifies it as defective;
    (iii) Or blocked (such as with a plywood attachment that spans 
several rungs).
    (18) Ladder repairs shall restore the ladder to a condition meeting 
its original design criteria, before the ladder is returned to use.
    (19) Single-rail ladders shall not be used.
    (20) When ascending or descending a ladder, the user shall face the 
ladder.
    (21) Each employee shall use at least one hand to grasp the ladder 
when progressing up and/or down the ladder.
    (22) An employee shall not carry any object or load that could cause 
the employee to lose balance and fall.

whether the asbestos contractor is in compliance with this standard, and 
shall require such contractor to come into compliance with this standard 
when necessary.
    (e) Regulated areas. (1) All Class I, II and III asbestos work shall 
be conducted within regulated areas. All other operations covered by 
this standard shall be conducted within a regulated area where airborne 
concentrations of asbestos exceed, or there is a reasonable possibility 
they may exceed a PEL. Regulated areas shall comply with the 
requirements of paragraphs (2), (3),(4) and (5) of this section.
    (2) Demarcation. The regulated area shall be demarcated in any 
manner that minimizes the number of persons within the area and protects 
persons outside the area from exposure to airborne asbestos. Where 
critical barriers or negative pressure enclosures are used, they may 
demarcate the regulated area. Signs shall be provided and displayed 
pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (k)(7) of this section.
    (3) Access. Access to regulated areas shall be limited to authorized 
persons and to persons authorized by the Act or regulations issued 
pursuant thereto.
    (4) Respirators. All persons entering a regulated area where 
employees are required pursuant to paragraph (h)(1) of this section to 
wear respirators shall be supplied with a respirator selected in 
accordance with paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
    (5) Prohibited activities. The employer shall ensure that employees 
do not eat, drink, smoke, chew tobacco or gum, or apply cosmetics in the 
regulated area.
    (6) Competent Persons. The employer shall ensure that all asbestos 
work performed within regulated areas is supervised by a competent 
person, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section. The duties of the 
competent person are set out in paragraph (o) of this section.
    (f) Exposure assessments and monitoring--(1) General monitoring 
criteria. (i) Each employer who has a workplace or work operation where 
exposure monitoring is required under this section shall perform 
monitoring to determine accurately the airborne concentrations of 
asbestos to which employees may be exposed.

[[Page 500]]

    (ii) Determinations of employee exposure shall be made from 
breathing zone air samples that are representative of the 8-hour TWA and 
30-minute short-term exposures of each employee.
    (iii) Representative 8-hour TWA employee exposure shall be 
determined on the basis of one or more samples representing full-shift 
exposure for employees in each work area. Representative 30-minute 
short-term employee exposures shall be determined on the basis of one or 
more samples representing 30 minute exposures associated with operations 
that are most likely to produce exposures above the excursion limit for 
employees in each work area.
    (2) Initial Exposure Assessment. (i) Each employer who has a 
workplace or work operation covered by this standard shall ensure that a 
``competent person'' conducts an exposure assessment immediately before 
or at the initiation of the operation to ascertain expected exposures 
during that operation or workplace. The assessment must be completed in 
time to comply with requirements which are triggered by exposure data or 
the lack of a ``negative exposure assessment,'' and to provide 
information necessary to assure that all control systems planned are 
appropriate for that operation and will work properly.
    (ii) Basis of Initial Exposure Assessment: Unless a negative 
exposure assessment has been made pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of 
this section, the initial exposure assessment shall, if feasible, be 
based on monitoring conducted pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this 
section. The assessment shall take into consideration both the 
monitoring results and all observations, information or calculations 
which indicate employee exposure to asbestos, including any previous 
monitoring conducted in the workplace, or of the operations of the 
employer which indicate the levels of airborne asbestos likely to be 
encountered on the job. For Class I asbestos work, until the employer 
conducts exposure monitoring and documents that employees on that job 
will not be exposed in excess of the PELs, or otherwise makes a negative 
exposure assessment pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, 
the employer shall presume that employees are exposed in excess of the 
TWA and excursion limit.
    (iii) Negative Exposure Assessment: For any one specific asbestos 
job which will be performed by employees who have been trained in 
compliance with the standard, the employer may demonstrate that employee 
exposures will be below the PELs by data which conform to the following 
criteria;
    (A) Objective data demonstrating that the product or material 
containing asbestos minerals or the activity involving such product or 
material cannot release airborne fibers in concentrations exceeding the 
TWA and excursion limit under those work conditions having the greatest 
potential for releasing asbestos; or
    (B) Where the employer has monitored prior asbestos jobs for the PEL 
and the excursion limit within 12 months of the current or projected 
job, the monitoring and analysis were performed in compliance with the 
asbestos standard in effect; and the data were obtained during work 
operations conducted under workplace conditions ``closely resembling'' 
the processes, type of material, control methods, work practices, and 
environmental conditions used and prevailing in the employer's current 
operations, the operations were conducted by employees whose training 
and experience are no more extensive than that of employees performing 
the current job, and these data show that under the conditions 
prevailing and which will prevail in the current workplace there is a 
high degree of certainty that employee exposures will not exceed the TWA 
and excursion limit; or
    (C) The results of initial exposure monitoring of the current job 
made from breathing zone air samples that are representative of the 8-
hour TWA and 30-minute short-term exposures of each employee covering 
operations which are most likely during the performance of the entire 
asbestos job to result in exposures over the PELs.
    (3) Periodic monitoring--(i) Class I and II operations. The employer 
shall conduct daily monitoring that is representative of the exposure of 
each employee who is assigned to work within a regulated area who is 
performing Class I or II work, unless the employer

[[Page 501]]

pursuant to (f)(2)(iii) of this section, has made a negative exposure 
assessment for the entire operation.
    (ii) All operations under the standard other than Class I and II 
operations. The employer shall conduct periodic monitoring of all work 
where exposures are expected to exceed a PEL, at intervals sufficient to 
document the validity of the exposure prediction.
    (iii) Exception: When all employees required to be monitored daily 
are equipped with supplied-air respirators operated in the pressure 
demand mode, or other positive pressure mode respirator, the employer 
may dispense with the daily monitoring required by this paragraph. 
However, employees performing Class I work using a control method which 
is not listed in paragraph (g)(4) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this section or 
using a modification of a listed control method, shall continue to be 
monitored daily even if they are equipped with supplied-air respirators.
    (4) Termination of monitoring. (i) If the periodic monitoring 
required by paragraph (f)(3) of this section reveals that employee 
exposures, as indicated by statistically reliable measurements, are 
below the permissible exposure limit and excursion limit the employer 
may discontinue monitoring for those employees whose exposures are 
represented by such monitoring.
    (ii) Additional monitoring. Notwithstanding the provisions of 
paragraph (f) (2) and (3), and (f)(4) of this section, the employer 
shall institute the exposure monitoring required under paragraph (f)(3) 
of this section whenever there has been a change in process, control 
equipment, personnel or work practices that may result in new or 
additional exposures above the permissible exposure limit and/or 
excursion limit or when the employer has any reason to suspect that a 
change may result in new or additional exposures above the permissible 
exposure limit and/or excursion limit. Such additional monitoring is 
required regardless of whether a ``negative exposure assessment'' was 
previously produced for a specific job.
    (5) Employee notification of monitoring results. (i) The employer 
shall notify affected employees of the monitoring results that represent 
that employee's exposure as soon as possible following receipt of 
monitoring results.
    (ii) The employer shall notify affected employees of the results of 
monitoring representing the employee's exposure in writing either 
individually or by posting at a centrally located place that is 
accessible to affected employees.
    (6) Observation of monitoring. (i) The employer shall provide 
affected employees and their designated representatives an opportunity 
to observe any monitoring of employee exposure to asbestos conducted in 
accordance with this section.
    (ii) When observation of the monitoring of employee exposure to 
asbestos requires entry into an area where the use of protective 
clothing or equipment is required, the observer shall be provided with 
and be required to use such clothing and equipment and shall comply with 
all other applicable safety and health procedures.
    (g) Methods of compliance. (1) Engineering controls and work 
practices for all operations covered by this section. The employer shall 
use the following engineering controls and work practices in all 
operations covered by this section, regardless of the levels of 
exposure:
    (i) Vacuum cleaners equipped with HEPA filters to collect all debris 
and dust containing ACM and PACM, except as provided in paragraph 
(g)(8)(ii) of this section in the case of roofing material.
    (ii) Wet methods, or wetting agents, to control employee exposures 
during asbestos handling, mixing, removal, cutting, application, and 
cleanup, except where employers demonstrate that the use of wet methods 
is infeasible due to for example, the creation of electrical hazards, 
equipment malfunction, and, in roofing, except as provided in paragraph 
(g)(8)(ii) of this section; and
    (iii) Prompt clean-up and disposal of wastes and debris contaminated 
with asbestos in leak-tight containers except in roofing operations, 
where the procedures specified in paragraph (g)(8)(ii) of this section 
apply.
    (2) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section, the employer shall use the following control

[[Page 502]]

methods to achieve compliance with the TWA permissible exposure limit 
and excursion limit prescribed by paragraph (c) of this section;
    (i) Local exhaust ventilation equipped with HEPA filter dust 
collection systems;
    (ii) Enclosure or isolation of processes producing asbestos dust;
    (iii) Ventilation of the regulated area to move contaminated air 
away from the breathing zone of employees and toward a filtration or 
collection device equipped with a HEPA filter;
    (iv) Use of other work practices and engineering controls that the 
Assistant Secretary can show to be feasible.
    (v) Wherever the feasible engineering and work practice controls 
described above are not sufficient to reduce employee exposure to or 
below the permissible exposure limit and/or excursion limit prescribed 
in paragraph (c) of this section, the employer shall use them to reduce 
employee exposure to the lowest levels attainable by these controls and 
shall supplement them by the use of respiratory protection that complies 
with the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section.
    (3) Prohibitions. The following work practices and engineering 
controls shall not be used for work related to asbestos or for work 
which disturbs ACM or PACM, regardless of measured levels of asbestos 
exposure or the results of initial exposure assessments:
    (i) High-speed abrasive disc saws that are not equipped with point 
of cut ventilator or enclosures with HEPA filtered exhaust air.
    (ii) Compressed air used to remove asbestos, or materials containing 
asbestos, unless the compressed air is used in conjunction with an 
enclosed ventilation system designed to capture the dust cloud created 
by the compressed air.
    (iii) Dry sweeping, shoveling or other dry clean-up of dust and 
debris containing ACM and PACM.
    (iv) Employee rotation as a means of reducing employee exposure to 
asbestos.
    (4) Class I Requirements. In addition to the provisions of 
paragraphs (g) (1) and (2) of this section, the following engineering 
controls and work practices and procedures shall be used.
    (i) All Class I work, including the installation and operation of 
the control system shall be supervised by a competent person as defined 
in paragraph (b) of this section;
    (ii) For all Class I jobs involving the removal of more than 25 
linear or 10 square feet of thermal system insulation or surfacing

a negative exposure assessment pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this 
section, or where employees are working in areas adjacent to the 
regulated area, while the Class I work is being performed, the employer 
shall use one of the following methods to ensure that airborne asbestos 
does not migrate from the regulated area:
    (A) Critical barriers shall be placed over all the openings to the 
regulated area, except where activities are performed outdoors; or
    (B) The employer shall use another barrier or isolation method which 
prevents the migration of airborne asbestos from the regulated area, as 
verified by perimeter area surveillance during each work shift at each 
boundary of the regulated area, showing no visible asbestos dust; and 
perimeter area monitoring showing that clearance levels contained in 40 
CFR part 763, subpt. E, of the EPA Asbestos in Schools Rule are met, or 
that perimeter area levels, measured by Phase Contrast Microscopy (PCM) 
are no more than background levels representing the same area before the 
asbestos work began. The results of such monitoring shall be made known 
to the employer no later than 24 hours from the end of the work shift 
represented by such monitoring. Exception: For work completed outdoors 
where employees are not working in areas adjacent to the regulated 
areas, this paragraph (g)(4)(ii) is satisfied when the specific control 
methods in paragraph (g)(5) of this section are used.

[[Page 505]]

method referenced in paragraph (g)(5)of this section, if the following 
provisions are complied with:
    (i) The control method shall enclose, contain or isolate the 
processes or source of airborne asbestos dust, or otherwise capture or 
redirect such dust before it enters the breathing zone of employees.
    (ii) A certified industrial hygienist or licensed professional 
engineer who is also qualified as a project designer as defined in 
paragraph (b) of this section, shall evaluate the work area, the 
projected work practices and the engineering controls and shall certify 
in writing that the planned control method is adequate to reduce direct

conditions of use, and that the planned control method will prevent 
asbestos contamination outside the regulated area, as measured by 
clearance sampling which meets the requirements of EPA's Asbestos in 
Schools rule issued under AHERA, or perimeter monitoring which meets the 
criteria in paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(B) of this section.
    (A) Where the TSI or surfacing material to be removed is 25 linear 
or 10 square feet or less , the evaluation required in paragraph (g)(6) 
of this section may be performed by a ``competent person'', and may omit 
consideration of perimeter or clearance monitoring otherwise required.
    (B) The evaluation of employee exposure required in paragraph (g)(6) 
of this section, shall include and be based on sampling and analytical

paragraph (g)(6) of this section required evaluation and certification, 
the employer shall send a copy of such evaluation and certification to 
the national office of OSHA, Office of Technical Support, Room N3653, 
200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20210. The submission shall 
not constitute approval by OSHA.
    (7) Work Practices and Engineering Controls for Class II work.
    (i) All Class II work shall be supervised by a competent person as 
defined in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (ii) For all indoor Class II jobs, where the employer has not 
produced a negative exposure assessment pursuant to paragraph 
(f)(2)(iii) of this section, or where during the job, changed conditions 
indicate there may be exposure above the PEL or where the employer does 
not remove the ACM in a substantially intact state, the employer shall 
use one of the following methods to ensure that airborne asbestos does 
not migrate from the regulated area;
    (A) Critical barriers shall be placed over all openings to the 
regulated area; or,
    (B) The employer shall use another barrier or isolation method which 
prevents the migration of airborne asbestos from the regulated area, as 
verified by perimeter area monitoring or clearance monitoring which 
meets the criteria set out in paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(B) of this section.
    (C) Impermeable dropcloths shall be placed on surfaces beneath all 
removal activity;
    (iii) [Reserved]
    (iv) All Class II asbestos work shall be performed using the work 
practices and requirements set out above in paragraph (g)(1) (i) through 
(g)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (8) Additional Controls for Class II work. Class II asbestos work 
shall also be performed by complying with the work practices and 
controls designated for each type of asbestos work to be performed, set 
out in this paragraph. Where more than one control method may be used 
for a type of asbestos work, the employer may choose one or a 
combination of designated control methods. Class II work also may be 
performed using a method allowed for Class I work, except that glove 
bags and glove boxes are allowed if they fully enclose the Class II 
material to be removed.
    (i) For removing vinyl and asphalt flooring materials which contain 
ACM or for which in buildings constructed no later than 1980, the 
employer has

[[Page 506]]

not verified the absence of ACM pursuant to paragraph (g)(8)(i)(I) of 
this section. The employer shall ensure that employees comply with the 
following work practices and that employees are trained in these 
practices pursuant to paragraph (k)(9):
    (A) Flooring or its backing shall not be sanded.
    (B) Vacuums equipped with HEPA filter, disposable dust bag, and 
metal floor tool (no brush) shall be used to clean floors.

omitted.
    (I) Resilient flooring material including associated mastic and 
backing shall be assumed to be asbestos-containing unless an industrial 
hygienist determines that it is asbestos-free using recognized 
analytical techniques.
    (ii) For removing roofing material which contains ACM the employer 
shall ensure that the following work practices are followed:
    (A) Roofing material shall be removed in an intact state to the 
extent feasible.
    (B) Wet methods shall be used to remove roofing materials that are 
not intact, or that will be rendered not intact during removal, unless 
such wet methods are not feasible or will create safety hazards.
    (C) Cutting machines shall be continuously misted during use, unless 
a competent person determines that misting substantially decreases 
worker safety.
    (D) When removing built-up roofs with asbestos-containing roofing 
felts and an aggregate surface using a power roof cutter, all dust 
resulting from the cutting operation shall be collected by a HEPA dust 
collector, or shall be HEPA vacuumed by vacuuming along the cut line. 
When removing built-up roofs with asbestos-containing roofing felts and 
a smooth surface using a power roof cutter, the dust resulting from the 
cutting operation shall be collected either by a HEPA dust collector or 
HEPA vacuuming along the cut line, or by gently sweeping and then 
carefully and completely wiping up the still-wet dust and debris left 
along the cut line. The dust and debris shall be immediately bagged or 
placed in covered containers.
    (E) Asbestos-containing material that has been removed from a roof 
shall not be dropped or thrown to the ground. Unless the material is 
carried or passed to the ground by hand, it shall be lowered to the 
ground via covered, dust-tight chute, crane or hoist:
    (1) Any ACM that is not intact shall be lowered to the ground as 
soon as is practicable, but in any event no later than the end of the 
work shift. While the material remains on the roof it shall either be 
kept wet, placed in an impermeable waste bag, or wrapped in plastic 
sheeting.
    (2) Intact ACM shall be lowered to the ground as soon as is 
practicable, but in any event no later than the end of the work shift.
    (F) Upon being lowered, unwrapped material shall be transferred to a 
closed receptacle in such manner so as to preclude the dispersion of 
dust.
    (G) Roof level heating and ventilation air intake sources shall be 
isolated or the ventilation system shall be shut down.
    (H) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, removal or 
repair of sections of intact roofing less than 25 square feet in area 
does not require use of wet methods or HEPA vacuuming as long as manual 
methods which do not render the material non-intact are used to remove 
the material and no visible dust is created by the removal method used. 
In determining whether a job involves less than 25 square feet, the 
employer shall include all removal and repair work performed on the same 
roof on the same day.

[[Page 507]]

    (iii) When removing cementitious asbestos-containing siding and 
shingles or transite panels containing ACM on building exteriors (other 
than roofs, where paragraph (g)(8)(ii) of this section applies) the 
employer shall ensure that the following work practices are followed:
    (A) Cutting, abrading or breaking siding, shingles, or transite 
panels, shall be prohibited unless the employer can demonstrate that 
methods less likely to result in asbestos fiber release cannot be used.
    (B) Each panel or shingle shall be sprayed with amended water prior 
to removal.
    (C) Unwrapped or unbagged panels or shingles shall be immediately 
lowered to the ground via covered dust-tight chute, crane or hoist, or

paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section.
    (B) [Reserved]
    (C) The gasket shall be immediately placed in a disposal container.
    (D) Any scraping to remove residue must be performed wet.
    (v) When performing any other Class II removal of asbestos 
containing material for which specific controls have not been listed in 
paragraph (g)(8)(iv) (A) through (D) of this section, the employer shall 
ensure that the following work practices are complied with.
    (A) The material shall be thoroughly wetted with amended water prior 
to and during its removal.
    (B) The material shall be removed in an intact state unless the 
employer demonstrates that intact removal is not possible.
    (C) Cutting, abrading or breaking the material shall be prohibited 
unless the employer can demonstrate that methods less likely to result 
in asbestos fiber release are not feasible.
    (D) Asbestos-containing material removed, shall be immediately 
bagged or wrapped, or kept wetted until transferred to a closed 
receptacle, no later than the end of the work shift.
    (vi) Alternative Work Practices and Controls. Instead of the work 
practices and controls listed in paragraph (g)(8) (i) through (v) of 
this section, the employer may use different or modified engineering and 
work practice controls if the following provisions are complied with.
    (A) The employer shall demonstrate by data representing employee 
exposure during the use of such method under conditions which closely 
resemble the conditions under which the method is to be used, that 
employee exposure will not exceed the PELs under any anticipated 
circumstances.
    (B) A competent person shall evaluate the work area, the projected 
work practices and the engineering controls, and shall certify in 
writing, that the different or modified controls are adequate to reduce 
direct and indirect employee exposure to below the PELs under all 
expected conditions of use and that the method meets the requirements of 
this standard. The evaluation shall include and be based on data 
representing employee exposure during the use of such method under 
conditions which closely resemble the conditions under which the method 
is to be used for the current job, and by employees whose training and 
experience are equivalent to employees who are to perform the current 
job.
    (9) Work Practices and Engineering Controls for Class III asbestos 
work. Class III asbestos work shall be conducted using engineering and 
work practice controls which minimize the exposure to employees 
performing the asbestos work and to bystander employees.
    (i) The work shall be performed using wet methods.
    (ii) To the extent feasible, the work shall be performed using local 
exhaust ventilation.
    (iii) Where the disturbance involves drilling, cutting, abrading, 
sanding,

[[Page 508]]

chipping, breaking, or sawing of thermal system insulation or surfacing 
material, the employer shall use impermeable dropcloths, and shall 
isolate the operation using mini-enclosures or glove bag systems 
pursuant to paragraph (g)(5) of this section or another isolation 
method.
    (iv) Where the employer does not produce a ``negative exposure 
assessment'' for a job, or where monitoring results show the PEL has 
been exceeded, the employer shall contain the area using impermeable 
dropcloths and plastic barriers or their equivalent, or shall isolate 
the operation using a control system listed in and in compliance with 
paragraph (g)(5) of this section.
    (v) Employees performing Class III jobs, which involve the 
disturbance of thermal system insulation or surfacing material, or where 
the employer does not produce a ``negative exposure assessment'' or 
where monitoring results show a PEL has been exceeded, shall wear 
respirators which are selected, used and fitted pursuant to provisions 
of paragraph (h) of this section.
    (10) Class IV asbestos work. Class IV asbestos jobs shall be 
conducted by employees trained pursuant to the asbestos awareness 
training program set out in paragraph (k)(9) of this section. In 
addition, all Class IV jobs shall be conducted in conformity with the 
requirements set out in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, mandating wet 
methods, HEPA vacuums, and prompt clean up of debris containing ACM or 
PACM.
    (i) Employees cleaning up debris and waste in a regulated area where 
respirators are required shall wear respirators which are selected, used 
and fitted pursuant to provisions of paragraph (h) of this section.
    (ii) Employers of employees who clean up waste and debris in, and 
employers in control of, areas where friable thermal system insulation 
or surfacing material is accessible, shall assume that such waste and 
debris contain asbestos.
    (11) Alternative methods of compliance for installation, removal, 
repair, and maintenance of certain roofing and pipeline coating 
materials. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an 
employer who complies with all provisions of this paragraph (g)(11) when 
installing, removing, repairing, or maintaining intact pipeline 
asphaltic wrap, or roof flashings which contain asbestos fibers 
encapsulated or coated by bituminous or resinous compounds shall be 
deemed to be in compliance with this section. If an employer does not 
comply with all provisions of this paragraph (g)(11) or if during the 
course of the job the material does not remain intact, the provisions of 
paragraph (g)(8) of this section apply instead of this paragraph 
(g)(11).
    (i) Before work begins and as needed during the job, a competent 
person who is capable of identifying asbestos hazards in the workplace 
and selecting the appropriate control strategy for asbestos exposure, 
and who has the authority to take prompt corrective measures to 
eliminate such hazards, shall conduct an inspection of the worksite and 
determine that the roofing material is intact and will likely remain 
intact.
    (ii) All employees performing work covered by this paragraph (g)(11) 
shall be trained in a training program that meets the requirements of 
paragraph (k)(9)(viii) of this section.
    (iii) The material shall not be sanded, abraded, or ground. Manual 
methods which do not render the material non-intact shall be used.
    (iv) Material that has been removed from a roof shall not be dropped 
or thrown to the ground. Unless the material is carried or passed to the 
ground by hand, it shall be lowered to the ground via covered, dust-
tight chute, crane or hoist. All such material shall be removed from the 
roof as soon as is practicable, but in any event no later than the end 
of the work shift.
    (v) Where roofing products which have been labeled as containing 
asbestos pursuant to paragraph (k)(8) of this section are installed on 
non-residential roofs during operations covered by this paragraph 
(g)(11), the employer shall notify the building owner of the presence 
and location of such materials no later than the end of the job.
    (vi) All removal or disturbance of pipeline asphaltic wrap shall be 
performed using wet methods.
    (h) Respiratory protection. (1) General. For employees who use 
respirators required by this section, the employer must provide 
respirators that comply

[[Page 509]]

with the requirements of this paragraph. Respirators must be used 
during:
    (i) Class I asbestos work.
    (ii) Class II asbestos work when ACM is not removed in a 
substantially intact state.
    (iii) Class II and III asbestos work that is not performed using wet 
methods, except for removal of ACM from sloped roofs when a negative-
exposure assessment has been conducted and ACM is removed in an intact 
state.
    (iv) Class II and III asbestos work for which a negative-exposure 
assessment has not been conducted.
    (v) Class III asbestos work when TSI or surfacing ACM or PACM is 
being disturbed.
    (vi) Class IV asbestos work performed within regulated areas where 
employees who are performing other work are required to use respirators.
    (vii) Work operations covered by this section for which employees 
are exposed above the TWA or excursion limit.
    (viii) Emergencies.
    (2) Respirator program. (i) The employer must implement a 
respiratory protection program in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.134 (b) 
through (d) (except (d)(1)(iii)), and (f) through (m).
    (ii) No employee shall be assigned to asbestos work that requires 
respirator use if, based on their most recent medical examination, the 
examining physician determines that the employee will be unable to 
function normally while using a respirator, or that the safety or health 
of the employee or other employees will be impaired by the employee's 
respirator use. Such employees must be assigned to another job or given 
the opportunity to transfer to a different position that they can 
perform. If such a transfer position is available, it must be with the 
same employer, in the same geographical area, and with the same 
seniority, status, rate of pay, and other job benefits the employee had 
just prior to such transfer.
    (3) Respirator selection. (i) The employer must select the 
appropriate respirator from Table 1 of this section.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: a. Respirators assigned for high environmental concentrations may 
  be used at lower concentrations, or when required respirator use is   
  independent of concentration.                                         
b. A high efficiency filter means a filter that is at least 99.97       
  percent efficient against mono-dispersed particles of 0.3 micrometers 
  in diameters in diameter or larger.                                   

    (ii) The employer must provide an employee with a tight-fitting, 
powered air-purifying respirator instead of a negative-pressure 
respirator from Table 1 when the employee chooses to use this type of 
respirator and such a respirator will provide adequate protection to the 
employee.
    (iii) The employer must provide a half-mask air-purifying 
respirator, other than a disposable respirator, that is equipped with 
high-efficiency filters when the employee performs:
    (A) Class II and III asbestos work and a negative-exposure 
assessment has not been conducted by the employer.
    (B) Class III asbestos work when TSI or surfacing ACM or PACM is 
being disturbed.
    (iv) In addition to the above selection criteria, when employees are 
in a regulated area where Class I work is being

[[Page 510]]

performed, a negative exposure assessment of the area has not been 
produced, and the exposure assessment of the area indicates the exposure 
level will not exceed 1 f/cc as an 8-hour time weighted average, 
employers must provide the employees with one of the following 
respirators:
    (A) A tight-fitting powered air-purifying respirator equipped with 
high efficiency filters;
    (B) A full facepiece supplied-air respirator operated in the 
pressure-demand mode equipped with HEPA egress cartridges; or
    (C) A full facepiece supplied-air respirator operated in the 
pressure-demand mode equipped with an auxiliary positive pressure self-
contained breathing apparatus. A full facepiece supplied-air respirator 
operated in the pressure-demand mode equipped with an auxiliary positive 
pressure self-contained breathing apparatus must be provided under such 
conditions when the exposure assessment indicates exposure levels above 
1 f/cc as an 8-hour time weighted average.
    (i) Protective clothing--(1) General. The employer shall provide or 
require the use of protective clothing, such as coveralls or similar 
whole-body clothing, head coverings, gloves, and foot coverings for any 
employee exposed to airborne concentrations of asbestos that exceed the 
TWA and/or excursion limit prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, 
or for which a required negative exposure assessment is not produced, or 
for any employee performing Class I operations which involve the removal 
of over 25 linear or 10 square feet of TSI or surfacing ACM and PACM.
    (2) Laundering. (i) The employer shall ensure that laundering of 
contaminated clothing is done so as to prevent the release of airborne 
asbestos in excess of the TWA or excursion limit prescribed in paragraph 
(c) of this section.
    (ii) Any employer who gives contaminated clothing to another person 
for laundering shall inform such person of the requirement in paragraph 
(i)(2)(i) of this section to effectively prevent the release of airborne 
asbestos in excess of the TWA and excursion limit prescribed in 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (3) Contaminated clothing. Contaminated clothing shall be 
transported in sealed impermeable bags, or other closed, impermeable 
containers, and be labeled in accordance with paragraph (k) of this 
section.
    (4) Inspection of protective clothing. (i) The competent person 
shall examine worksuits worn by employees at least once per workshift 
for rips or tears that may occur during performance of work.
    (ii) When rips or tears are detected while an employee is working, 
rips and tears shall be immediately mended, or the worksuit shall be 
immediately replaced.
    (j) Hygiene facilities and practices for employees. (1) Requirements 
for employees performing Class I asbestos jobs involving over 25 linear 
or 10 square feet of TSI or surfacing ACM and PACM.
    (i) Decontamination areas. The employer shall establish a 
decontamination area that is adjacent and connected to the regulated 
area for the decontamination of such employees. The decontamination area 
shall consist of an equipment room, shower area, and clean room in 
series. The employer shall ensure that employees enter and exit the 
regulated area through the decontamination area.
    (A) Equipment room. The equipment room shall be supplied with 
impermeable, labeled bags and containers for the containment and 
disposal of contaminated protective equipment.
    (B) Shower area. Shower facilities shall be provided which comply 
with 29 CFR 1910.141(d)(3), unless the employer can demonstrate that 
they are not feasible. The showers shall be adjacent both to the 
equipment room and the clean room, unless the employer can demonstrate 
that this location is not feasible. Where the employer can demonstrate 
that it is not feasible to locate the shower between the equipment room 
and the clean room, or where the work is performed outdoors, the 
employers shall ensure that employees:
    (1) Remove asbestos contamination from their worksuits in the 
equipment room using a HEPA vacuum before proceeding to a shower that is 
not adjacent to the work area; or
    (2) Remove their contaminated worksuits in the equipment room, then

[[Page 511]]

don clean worksuits, and proceed to a shower that is not adjacent to the 
work area.
    (C) Clean change room. The clean room shall be equipped with a 
locker or appropriate storage container for each employee's use. When 
the employer can demonstrate that it is not feasible to provide a clean 
change area adjacent to the work area or where the work is performed 
outdoors, the employer may permit employees engaged in Class I asbestos 
jobs to clean their protective clothing with a portable HEPA-equipped 
vacuum before such employees leave the regulated area. Following 
showering, such employees however must then change into street clothing 
in clean change areas provided by the employer which otherwise meet the 
requirements of this section.
    (ii) Decontamination area entry procedures. The employer shall 
ensure that employees:
    (A) Enter the decontamination area through the clean room;
    (B) Remove and deposit street clothing within a locker provided for 
their use; and
    (C) Put on protective clothing and respiratory protection before 
leaving the clean room.
    (D) Before entering the regulated area, the employer shall ensure 
that employees pass through the equipment room.
    (iii) Decontamination area exit procedures. The employer shall 
ensure that:
    (A) Before leaving the regulated area, employees shall remove all 
gross contamination and debris from their protective clothing.
    (B) Employees shall remove their protective clothing in the 
equipment room and deposit the clothing in labeled impermeable bags or 
containers.
    (C) Employees shall not remove their respirators in the equipment 
room.
    (D) Employees shall shower prior to entering the clean room.
    (E) After showering, employees shall enter the clean room before 
changing into street clothes.
    (iv) Lunch Areas. Whenever food or beverages are consumed at the 
worksite where employees are performing Class I asbestos work, the 
employer shall provide lunch areas in which the airborne concentrations 
of asbestos are below the permissible exposure limit and/or excursion 
limit.
    (2) Requirements for Class I work involving less than 25 linear or 
10 square feet of TSI or surfacing ACM and PACM, and for Class II and 
Class III asbestos work operations where exposures exceed a PEL or where 
there is no negative exposure assessment produced before the operation.
    (i) The employer shall establish an equipment room or area that is 
adjacent to the regulated area for the decontamination of employees and 
their equipment which is contaminated with asbestos which shall consist 
of an area covered by a impermeable drop cloth on the floor or 
horizontal working surface.
    (ii) The area must be of sufficient size as to accommodate cleaning 
of equipment and removing personal protective equipment without 
spreading contamination beyond the area (as determined by visible 
accumulations).
    (iii) Work clothing must be cleaned with a HEPA vacuum before it is 
removed.
    (iv) All equipment and surfaces of containers filled with ACM must 
be cleaned prior to removing them from the equipment room or area.
    (v) The employer shall ensure that employees enter and exit the 
regulated area through the equipment room or area.
    (3) Requirements for Class IV work. Employers shall ensure that 
employees performing Class IV work within a regulated area comply with 
the hygiene practice required of employees performing work which has a 
higher classification within that regulated area. Otherwise employers of 
employees cleaning up debris and material which is TSI or surfacing ACM 
or identified as PACM shall provide decontamination facilities for such 
employees which are required by paragraph (j)(2) of this section.
    (4) Smoking in work areas. The employer shall ensure that employees 
do not smoke in work areas where they are occupationally exposed to 
asbestos because of activities in that work area.
    (k) Communication of hazards. (1) This section applies to the 
communication of information concerning asbestos hazards in construction 
activities to

[[Page 512]]

facilitate compliance with this standard. Most asbestos-related 
construction activities involve previously installed building materials. 
Building owners often are the only and/or best sources of information 
concerning them. Therefore, they, along with employers of potentially 
exposed employees, are assigned specific information conveying and 
retention duties under this section. Installed Asbestos Containing 
Building Material. Employers and building owners shall identify TSI and 
sprayed or troweled on surfacing materials in buildings as asbestos-
containing, unless they determine in compliance with paragraph (k)(5) of 
this section that the material is not asbestos-containing. Asphalt and 
vinyl flooring material installed no later than 1980 must also be 
considered as asbestos containing unless the employer, pursuant to 
paragraph (g)(8)(i)(I) of this section determines that it is not 
asbestos-containing. If the employer/building owner has actual 
knowledge, or should have known through the exercise of due diligence, 
that other materials are asbestos-containing, they too must be treated 
as such. When communicating information to employees pursuant to this 
standard, owners and employers shall identify ``PACM'' as ACM. 
Additional requirements relating to communication of asbestos work on 
multi-employer worksites are set out in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) Duties of building and facility owners. (i) Before work subject 
to this standard is begun, building and facility owners shall determine 
the presence, location, and quantity of ACM and/or PACM at the work site 
pursuant to paragraph (k)(1) of this section.
    (ii) Building and/or facility owners shall notify the following 
persons of the presence, location and quantity of ACM or PACM, at the 
work sites in their buildings and facilities. Notification either shall 
be in writing, or shall consist of a personal communication between the 
owner and the person to whom notification must be given or their 
authorized representatives:
    (A) Prospective employers applying or bidding for work whose 
employees reasonably can be expected to work in or adjacent to areas 
containing such material;
    (B) Employees of the owner who will work in or adjacent to areas 
containing such material:
    (C) On multi-employer worksites, all employers of employees who will 
be performing work within or adjacent to areas containing such 
materials;
    (D) Tenants who will occupy areas containing such material.
    (3) Duties of employers whose employees perform work subject to this 
standard in or adjacent to areas containing ACM and PACM. Building/
facility owners whose employees perform such work shall comply with 
these provisions to the extent applicable.
    (i) Before work in areas containing ACM and PACM is begun; employers 
shall identify the presence, location, and quantity of ACM, and/or PACM 
therein pursuant to paragraph (k)(1) of this section.
    (ii) Before work under this standard is performed employers of 
employees who will perform such work shall inform the following persons 
of the location and quantity of ACM and/or PACM present in the area and 
the precautions to be taken to insure that airborne asbestos is confined 
to the area.
    (A) Owners of the building/facility;
    (B) Employees who will perform such work and employers of employees 
who work and/or will be working in adjacent areas.
    (iii) Within 10 days of the completion of such work, the employer 
whose employees have performed work subject to this standard, shall 
inform the building/facility owner and employers of employees who will 
be working in the area of the current location and quantity of PACM and/
or ACM remaining in the area and final monitoring results, if any.
    (4) In addition to the above requirements, all employers who 
discover ACM and/or PACM on a worksite shall convey information 
concerning the presence, location and quantity of such newly discovered 
ACM and/or PACM to the owner and to other employers of employees working 
at the work site, within 24 hours of the discovery.
    (5) Criteria to rebut the designation of installed material as PACM. 
(i) At any time, an employer and/or building owner may demonstrate, for 
purposes of this standard, that PACM does not

[[Page 513]]

contain asbestos. Building owners and/or employers are not required to 
communicate information about the presence of building material for 
which such a demonstration pursuant to the requirements of paragraph 
(k)(5)(ii) of this section has been made. However, in all such cases, 
the information, data and analysis supporting the determination that 
PACM does not contain asbestos, shall be retained pursuant to paragraph 
(n) of this section.
    (ii) An employer or owner may demonstrate that PACM does not contain 
more than 1% asbestos by the following: (A) Having a completed 
inspection conducted pursuant to the requirements of AHERA (40 CFR Part 
763, subpart E) which demonstrates that the material is not ACM; or
    (B) Performing tests of the material containing PACM which 
demonstrate that no ACM is present in the material. Such tests shall 
include analysis of bulk samples collected in the manner described in 40 
CFR 763.86. The tests, evaluation and sample collection shall be 
conducted by an accredited inspector or by a CIH. Analysis of samples 
shall be performed by persons or laboratories with proficiency 
demonstrated by current successful participation in a nationally 
recognized testing program such as the National Voluntary Laboratory 
Accreditation Program (NVLAP) or the National Institute for Standards 
and Technology (NIST) or the Round Robin for bulk samples administered 
by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) or an equivalent 
nationally-recognized round robin testing program.
    (iii) The employer and/or building owner may demonstrate that 
flooring material including associated mastic and backing does not 
contain asbestos, by a determination of an industrial hygienist based 
upon recognized analytical techniques showing that the material is not 
ACM.
    (6) At the entrance to mechanical rooms/areas in which employees 
reasonably can be expected to enter and which contain ACM and/or PACM, 
the building owner shall post signs which identify the material which is 
present, its location, and appropriate work practices which, if 
followed, will ensure that ACM and/or PACM will not be disturbed. The 
employer shall ensure, to the extent feasible, that employees who come 
in contact with these signs can comprehend them. Means to ensure 
employee comprehension may include the use of foreign languages, 
pictographs, graphics, and awareness training.
    (7) Signs. (i) Warning signs that demarcate the regulated area shall 
be provided and displayed at each location where a regulated area is 
required to be established by paragraph (e) of this section. Signs shall 
be posted at such a distance from such a location that an employee may 
read the signs and take necessary protective steps before entering the 
area marked by the signs.
    (ii) (A) The warning signs required by paragraph (k)(7) of this 
section shall bear the following information:

                                 DANGER

                                ASBESTOS

clothing is required in the regulated area under this section, the 
warning signs shall include the following:

      RESPIRATORS AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING ARE REQUIRED IN THIS AREA

    (iii) The employer shall ensure that employees working in and 
contiguous to regulated areas comprehend the warning signs required to 
be posted by paragraph (k)(7)(i) of this section. Means to ensure 
employee comprehension may include the use of foreign languages, 
pictographs and graphics.
    (8) Labels. (i) Labels shall be affixed to all products containing 
asbestos and to all containers containing such products, including waste 
containers. Where feasible, installed asbestos products shall contain a 
visible label.
    (ii) Labels shall be printed in large, bold letters on a contrasting 
background.
    (iii) Labels shall be used in accordance with the requirements of 29 
CFR

     Appendix A to Sec. 1926.1101-- OSHA Reference Method--Mandatory

    This mandatory appendix specifies the procedure for analyzing air 
samples for asbestos and specifies quality control procedures that must 
be implemented by laboratories performing the analysis. The sampling and 
analytical methods described below represent the elements of the 
available monitoring methods (such as Appendix B of this regulation, the 
most current version of the OSHA method ID-160, or the most current 
version of the NIOSH Method 7400). All employers who are required to 
conduct air monitoring under paragraph (f) of the standard are required 
to utilize analytical laboratories that use this procedure, or an 
equivalent method, for collecting and analyzing samples.

                    Sampling and Analytical Procedure

    1. The sampling medium for air samples shall be mixed cellulose 
ester filter membranes. These shall be designated by the manufacturer as 
suitable for asbestos counting. See below for rejection of blanks.
    2. The preferred collection device shall be the 25-mm diameter 
cassette with an open-faced 50-mm electrically conductive extension 
cowl. The 37-mm cassette may be used if necessary but only if written 
justification for the need to use the 37-mm filter cassette accompanies 
the sample results in the employee's exposure monitoring record. Do not 
reuse or reload cassettes for asbestos sample collection.
    3. An air flow rate between 0.5 liter/min and 2.5 liters/min shall 
be selected for the 25/mm cassette. If the 37-mm cassette is used, an 
air flow rate between 1 liter/min and 2.5 liters/min shall be selected.
    4. Where possible, a sufficient air volume for each air sample shall 
be collected to yield between 100 and 1,300 fibers per square millimeter 
on the membrane filter. If a filter darkens in appearance or if loose 
dust is seen on the filter, a second sample shall be started.
    5. Ship the samples in a rigid container with sufficient packing 
material to prevent dislodging the collected fibers. Packing material 
that has a high electrostatic charge on its surface (e.g., expanded 
polystyrene) cannot be used because such material can cause loss of 
fibers to the sides of the cassette.
    6. Calibrate each personal sampling pump before and after use with a 
representative filter cassette installed between the pump and the 
calibration devices.
    7. Personal samples shall be taken in the ``breathing zone'' of the 
employee (i.e., attached to or near the collar or lapel near the 
worker's face).
    8. Fiber counts shall be made by positive phase contrast using a 
microscope with an 8 to 10 X eyepiece and a 40 to 45 X objective for a 
total magnification of approximately 400 X and a numerical aperture of 
0.65 to 0.75. The microscope shall also be fitted with a green or blue 
filter.
    9. The microscope shall be fitted with a Walton-Beckett eyepiece 
graticule calibrated for a field diameter of 100 micrometers (+/-2 
micrometers).
    10. The phase-shift detection limit of the microscope shall be about 
3 degrees measured using the HSE phase shift test slide as outlined 
below.
    a. Place the test slide on the microscope stage and center it under 
the phase objective.
    b. Bring the blocks of grooved lines into focus.


[[Page 521]]


    Note: The slide consists of seven sets of grooved lines (ca. 20 
grooves to each block) in descending order of visibility from sets 1 to 
7, seven being the least visible. The requirements for asbestos counting 
are that the microscope optics must resolve the groooved lines in set 3 
completely, although they may appear somewhat faint, and that the 
grooved lines in sets 6 and 7 must be invisible. Sets 4 and 5 must be at 
least partially visible but may vary slightly in visibility between 
microscopes. A microscope that fails to meet these requirements has 
either too low or too high a resolution to be used for asbestos 
counting.

    c. If the image deteriorates, clean and adjust the microscope 
optics. If the problem persists, cosult the microscope manufacturer.
    11. Each set of samples taken will include 10% field blanks or a 
minimum of 2 field blanks. These blanks must come from the same lot as 
the filters used for sample collection. The field blank results shall be 
averaged and subtracted from the analytical results before reporting. A 
set consists of any sample or group of samples for which an evaluation 
for this standard must be made. Any samples represented by a field blank 
having a fiber count in excess of the detection limit of the method 
being used shall be rejected.
    12. The samples shall be mounted by the acetone/triacetin method or 
a method with an equivalent index of refraction and similar clarity.
    13. Observe the following counting rules.
    a. Count only fibers equal to or longer than 5 micrometers. Measure 
the length of curved fibers along the curve.
    b. In the absence of other information, count all particles as 
asbestos, that have a length-to-width ratio (aspect ratio) of 3:1 or 
greater.
    c. Fibers lying entirely within the boundary of the Walton-Beckett 
graticule field shall receive a count of 1. Fibers crossing the boundary 
once, having one end within the circle, shall receive the count of one 
half (\1/2\). Do not count any fiber that crosses the graticule boundary 
more than once. Reject and do not count any other fibers even though 
they may be visible outside the graticule area.
    d. Count bundles of fibers as one fiber unless individual fibers can 
be identified by observing both ends of an individual fiber.
    e. Count enough graticule fields to yield 100 fibers. Count a 
minimum of 20 fields; stop counting at 100 fields regardless of fiber 
count.
    14. Blind recounts shall be conducted at the rate of 10 percent.

                       Quality Control Procedures

    1. Intralaboratory program. Each laboratory and/or each company with 
more than one microscopist counting slides shall establish a 
statistically designed quality assurance program involving blind 
recounts and comparisons between microscopists to monitor the 
variability of counting by each microscopist and between microscopists. 
In a company with more than one laboratory, the program shall include 
all laboratories, and shall also evaluate the laboratory-to-laboratory 
variability.
    2a. Interlaboratory program. Each laboratory analyzing asbestos 
samples for compliance determination shall implement an interlaboratory 
quality assurance program that, as a minimum, includes participation of 
at least two other independent laboratories. Each laboratory shall 
participate in round robin testing at least once every 6 months with at 
least all the other laboratories in its interlaboratory quality 
assurance group. Each laboratory shall submit slides typical of its own 
workload for use in this program. The round robin shall be designed and 
results analyzed using appropriate statistical methodology.
    b. All laboratories should also participate in a national sample 
testing scheme such as the Proficiency Analytical Testing Program (PAT), 
or the Asbestos Registry sponsored by the American Industrial Hygiene 
Association (AIHA).
    3. All individuals performing asbestos analysis must have taken the 
NIOSH course for sampling and evaluating airborne asbestos dust or an 
equivalent course.
    4. When the use of different microscopes contributes to differences 
between counters and laboratories, the effect of the different 
microscope shall be evaluated and the microscope shall be replaced, as 
necessary.
    5. Current results of these quality assurance programs shall be 
posted in each laboratory to keep the microscopists informed.

                             1. Introduction

    This method describes the collection of airborne asbestos fibers 
using calibrated sampling pumps with mixed-cellulose ester (MCE) filters 
and analysis by phase contrast microscopy (PCM). Some terms used are 
unique to this method and are defined below: Asbestos: A term for 
naturally occurring fibrous minerals. Asbestos includes chrysotile, 
crocidolite, amosite (cummingtonite-grunerite asbestos), tremolite 
asbestos, actinolite asbestos, anthophyllite asbestos, and any of these 
minerals that have been chemically treated and/or altered. The precise 
chemical formulation of each species will vary with the location from 
which it was mined. Nominal compositions are listed:

                                                                        
                                                                        
                                                                        
Chrysotile..............................                 Mg<INF>3 Si<INF>2 O<INF>5(OH)<INF>4
Crocidolite.............................    Na<INF>2 Fe<INF>3<SUP>2+ Fe<INF>2<SUP>3+ Si<INF>8 O<INF>22(OH)<INF>2
Amosite.................................           (Mg,Fe)<INF>7 Si<INF>8 O<INF>22(OH)<INF>2
Tremolite-actinolite....................        Ca<INF>2(Mg,Fe)<INF>5 Si<INF>8 O<INF>22(OH)<INF>2
Anthophyllite...........................           (Mg,Fe)<INF>7 Si<INF>8 O<INF>22(OH)<INF>2
                                                                        

    Asbestos Fiber: A fiber of asbestos which meets the criteria 
specified below for a fiber.
    Aspect Ratio: The ratio of the length of a fiber to it's diameter 
(e.g. 3:1, 5:1 aspect ratios).
    Cleavage Fragments: Mineral particles formed by comminution of 
minerals, especially those characterized by parallel sides and a 
moderate aspect ratio (usually less than 20:1).
    Detection Limit: The number of fibers necessary to be 95% certain 
that the result is greater than zero.
    Differential Counting: The term applied to the practice of excluding 
certain kinds of fibers from the fiber count because they do not appear 
to be asbestos.
    Fiber: A particle that is 5 <greek-m> m or longer, with a length-to-
width ratio of 3 to 1 or longer.
    Field: The area within the graticule circle that is superimposed on 
the microscope image.
    Set: The samples which are taken, submitted to the laboratory, 
analyzed, and for which, interim or final result reports are generated.
    Tremolite, Anthophyllite, and Actinolite: The non-asbestos form of 
these minerals which meet the definition of a fiber. It includes any of 
these minerals that have been chemically treated and/or altered.
    Walton-Beckett Graticule: An eyepiece graticule specifically 
designed for asbestos fiber counting. It consists of a circle with a 
projected diameter of 100<plus-minus>2 <greek-m> m (area of about 
0.00785 mm<SUP>2</SUP>) with a crosshair having tic-marks at 3-<greek-m> 
m intervals in one direction and 5-<greek-m> m in the orthogonal 
direction. There are marks around the periphery of the circle to 
demonstrate the proper sizes and shapes of fibers. This design is 
reproduced in Figure 1. The disk is placed in one of the microscope 
eyepieces so that the design is superimposed on the field of view.

                              1.1. History

    Early surveys to determine asbestos exposures were conducted using 
impinger counts of total dust with the counts expressed as million 
particles per cubic foot. The British Asbestos Research Council 
recommended filter membrane counting in 1969. In July 1969, the Bureau 
of Occupational Safety and Health published a filter membrane method for 
counting asbestos fibers in the United States. This method was refined 
by NIOSH and published as P & CAM 239. On May 29, 1971, OSHA specified 
filter membrane sampling with phase contrast counting for evaluation of 
asbestos exposures at work sites in the United States. The use of this 
technique was again required by OSHA in 1986. Phase contrast microscopy 
has continued to be the method of choice for the measurement of 
occupational exposure to asbestos.

[[Page 523]]

                             1.2. Principle

    Air is drawn through a MCE filter to capture airborne asbestos 
fibers. A wedge shaped portion of the filter is removed, placed on a 
glass microscope slide and made transparent. A measured area (field) is 
viewed by PCM. All the fibers meeting defined criteria for asbestos are 
counted and considered a measure of the airborne asbestos concentration.

                    1.3. Advantages and Disadvantages

    There are four main advantages of PCM over other methods:
    (1) The technique is specific for fibers. Phase contrast is a fiber 
counting technique which excludes non-fibrous particles from the 
analysis.
    (2) The technique is inexpensive and does not require specialized 
knowledge to carry out the analysis for total fiber counts.
    (3) The analysis is quick and can be performed on-site for rapid 
determination of air concentrations of asbestos fibers.
    (4) The technique has continuity with historical epidemiological 
studies so that estimates of expected disease can be inferred from long-
term determinations of asbestos exposures.
    The main disadvantage of PCM is that it does not positively identify 
asbestos fibers. Other fibers which are not asbestos may be included in 
the count unless differential counting is performed. This requires a 
great deal of experience to adequately differentiate asbestos from non-
asbestos fibers. Positive identification of asbestos must be performed 
by polarized light or electron microscopy techniques. A further 
disadvantage of PCM is that the smallest visible fibers are about 0.2 
<greek-m> m in diameter while the finest asbestos fibers may be as small 
as 0.02 <greek-m> m in diameter. For some exposures, substantially more 
fibers may be present than are actually counted.

                         1.4. Workplace Exposure

    Asbestos is used by the construction industry in such products as 
shingles, floor tiles, asbestos cement, roofing felts, insulation and 
acoustical products. Non-construction uses include brakes, clutch 
facings, paper, paints, plastics, and fabrics. One of the most 
significant exposures in the workplace is the removal and encapsulation 
of asbestos in schools, public buildings, and homes. Many workers have 
the potential to be exposed to asbestos during these operations.
    About 95% of the asbestos in commercial use in the United States is 
chrysotile. Crocidolite and amosite make up most of the remainder. 
Anthophyllite and tremolite or actinolite are likely to be encountered 
as contaminants in various industrial products.

                        1.5. Physical Properties

    Asbestos fiber possesses a high tensile strength along its axis, is 
chemically inert, non-combustible, and heat resistant. It has a high 
electrical resistance and good sound absorbing properties. It can be 
weaved into cables, fabrics or other textiles, and also matted into 
asbestos papers, felts, or mats.

                      2. Range and Detection Limit

    2.1. The ideal counting range on the filter is 100 to 1,300 fibers/
mm\2\. With a Walton-Beckett graticule this range is equivalent to 0.8 
to 10 fibers/field. Using NIOSH counting statistics, a count of 0.8 
fibers/field would give an approximate coefficient of variation (CV) of 
0.13.
    2.2. The detection limit for this method is 4.0 fibers per 100 
fields or 5.5 fibers/mm\2\. This was determined using an equation to 
estimate the maximum CV possible at a specific concentration (95% 
confidence) and a Lower Control Limit of zero. The CV value was then 
used to determine a corresponding concentration from historical CV vs 
fiber relationships. As an example:

Lower Control Limit (95% Confidence) = AC--1.645(CV)(AC)
Where:
AC=Estimate of the airborne fiber concentration (fibers/cc) Setting the 
          Lower Control Limit=0 and solving for CV:
0=AC--1.645(CV)(AC)
CV=0.61
    This value was compared with CV vs. count curves. The count at which 
CV = 0.61 for Leidel-Busch counting statistics or for an OSHA Salt Lake 
Technical Center (OSHA-SLTC) CV curve (see Appendix A for further 
information) was 4.4 fibers or 3.9 fibers per 100 fields, respectively. 
Although a lower detection limit of 4 fibers per 100 fields is supported 
by the OSHA-SLTC data, both data sets support the 4.5 fibers per 100 
fields value.

              3. Method Performance--Precision and Accuracy

    Precision is dependent upon the total number of fibers counted and 
the uniformity of the fiber distribution on the filter. A general rule 
is to count at least 20 and not more than 100 fields. The count is 
discontinued when 100 fibers are counted, provided that 20 fields have 
already been counted. Counting more than 100 fibers results in only a 
small gain in precision. As the total count drops below 10 fibers, an 
accelerated loss of precision is noted.
    At this time, there is no known method to determine the absolute 
accuracy of the asbestos analysis. Results of samples prepared through 
the Proficiency Analytical Testing (PAT) Program and analyzed by the 
OSHA-SLTC showed no significant bias when compared to PAT reference 
values. The PAT samples were analyzed from 1987 to 1989

[[Page 524]]

(N=36) and the concentration range was from 120 to 1,300 fibers/mm\2\.

                            4. Interferences

    Fibrous substances, if present, may interfere with asbestos 
analysis.
    Some common fibers are:

fiberglass
anhydrite
plant fibers
perlite veins
gypsum
some synthetic fibers
membrane structures
sponge spicules
diatoms
microorganisms
wollastonite

    The use of electron microscopy or optical tests such as polarized 
light, and dispersion staining may be used to differentiate these 
materials from asbestos when necessary.

                               5. Sampling

                             5.1. Equipment

    5.1.1. Sample assembly (The assembly is shown in Figure 3). 
Conductive filter holder consisting of a 25-mm diameter, 3-piece 
cassette having a 50-mm long electrically conductive extension cowl. 
Backup pad, 25-mm, cellulose. Membrane filter, mixed-cellulose ester 
(MCE), 25-mm, plain, white, 0.4 to 1.2-<greek-m> m pore size.

    Notes:
(a) DO NOT RE-USE CASSETTES.
(b) Fully conductive cassettes are required to reduce fiber loss to the 
          sides of the cassette due to electrostatic attraction.
(c) Purchase filters which have been selected by the manufacturer for 
          asbestos counting or analyze representative filters for fiber 
          background before use. Discard the filter lot if more than 4 
          fibers/100 fields are found.
(d) To decrease the possibility of contamination, the sampling system 
          (filter-backup pad-cassette) for asbestos is usually 
          preassembled by the manufacturer.
(e) Other cassettes, such as the Bell-mouth, may be used within the 
          limits of their validation.

    5.1.2. Gel bands for sealing cassettes.
    5.1.3. Sampling pump.
    Each pump must be a battery operated, self-contained unit small 
enough to be placed on the monitored employee and not interfere with the 
work being performed. The pump must be capable of sampling at the 
collection rate for the required sampling time.
    5.1.4. Flexible tubing, 6-mm bore.
    5.1.5. Pump calibration.
    Stopwatch and bubble tube/burette or electronic meter.
    5.2. Sampling Procedure
    5.2.1. Seal the point where the base and cowl of each cassette meet 
with a gel band or tape.
    5.2.2. Charge the pumps completely before beginning.
    5.2.3. Connect each pump to a calibration cassette with an 
appropriate length of 6-mm bore plastic tubing. Do not use luer 
connectors--the type of cassette specified above has built-in adapters.
    5.2.4. Select an appropriate flow rate for the situation being 
monitored. The sampling flow rate must be between 0.5 and 5.0 L/min for 
personal sampling and is commonly set between 1 and 2 L/min. Always 
choose a flow rate that will not produce overloaded filters.
    5.2.5. Calibrate each sampling pump before and after sampling with a 
calibration cassette in-line (Note: This calibration cassette should be 
from the same lot of cassettes used for sampling). Use a primary 
standard (e.g. bubble burette) to calibrate each pump. If possible, 
calibrate at the sampling site.

    Note: If sampling site calibration is not possible, environmental 
influences may affect the flow rate. The extent is dependent on the type 
of pump used. Consult with the pump manufacturer to determine dependence 
on environmental influences. If the pump is affected by temperature and 
pressure changes, correct the flow rate using the formula shown in the 
section ``Sampling Pump Flow Rate Corrections'' at the end of this 
appendix.

    5.2.6. Connect each pump to the base of each sampling cassette with 
flexible tubing. Remove the end cap of each cassette and take each air 
sample open face. Assure that each sample cassette is held open side 
down in the employee's breathing zone during sampling. The distance from 
the nose/mouth of the employee to the cassette should be about 10 cm. 
Secure the cassette on the collar or lapel of the employee using spring 
clips or other similar devices.
    5.2.7. A suggested minimum air volume when sampling to determine TWA 
compliance is 25 L. For Excursion Limit (30 min sampling time) 
evaluations, a minimum air volume of 48 L is recommended.
    5.2.8. The most significant problem when sampling for asbestos is 
overloading the filter with non-asbestos dust. Suggested maximum air 
sample volumes for specific environments are:

Office environments.....................  400 to 2,400.                 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    CAUTION: Do not overload the filter with dust. High levels of non-
fibrous dust particles may obscure fibers on the filter and

[[Page 525]]

lower the count or make counting impossible. If more than about 25 to 
30% of the field area is obscured with dust, the result may be biased 
low. Smaller air volumes may be necessary when there is excessive non-
asbestos dust in the air.
    While sampling, observe the filter with a small flashlight. If there 
is a visible layer of dust on the filter, stop sampling, remove and seal 
the cassette, and replace with a new sampling assembly. The total dust 
loading should not exceed 1 mg.
    5.2.9. Blank samples are used to determine if any contamination has 
occurred during sample handling. Prepare two blanks for the first 1 to 
20 samples. For sets containing greater than 20 samples, prepare blanks 
as 10% of the samples. Handle blank samples in the same manner as air 
samples with one exception: Do not draw any air through the blank 
samples. Open the blank cassette in the place where the sample cassettes 
are mounted on the employee. Hold it open for about 30 seconds. Close 
and seal the cassette appropriately. Store blanks for shipment with the 
sample cassettes.
    5.2.10. Immediately after sampling, close and seal each cassette 
with the base and plastic plugs. Do not touch or puncture the filter 
membrane as this will invalidate the analysis.
    5.2.11  Attach and secure a sample seal around each sample cassette 
in such a way as to assure that the end cap and base plugs cannot be 
removed without destroying the seal. Tape the ends of the seal together 
since the seal is not long enough to be wrapped end-to-end. Also wrap 
tape around the cassette at each joint to keep the seal secure.
    5.3.1. Send the samples to the laboratory with paperwork requesting 
asbestos analysis. List any known fibrous interferences present during 
sampling on the paperwork. Also, note the workplace operation(s) 
sampled.
    5.3.2. Secure and handle the samples in such that they will not 
rattle during shipment nor be exposed to static electricity. Do not ship 
samples in expanded polystyrene peanuts, vermiculite, paper shreds, or 
excelsior. Tape sample cassettes to sheet bubbles and place in a 
container that will cushion the samples in such a manner that they will 
not rattle.
    5.3.3. To avoid the possibility of sample contamination, always ship 
bulk samples in separate mailing containers.

                               6. Analysis

                         6.1. Safety Precautions

    6.1.1. Acetone is extremely flammable and precautions must be taken 
not to ignite it. Avoid using large containers or quantities of acetone. 
Transfer the solvent in a ventilated laboratory hood. Do not use acetone 
near any open flame. For generation of acetone vapor, use a spark free 
heat source.
    6.1.2. Any asbestos spills should be cleaned up immediately to 
prevent dispersal of fibers. Prudence should be exercised to avoid 
contamination of laboratory facilities or exposure of personnel to 
asbestos. Asbestos spills should be cleaned up with wet methods and/or a 
High Efficiency Particulate-Air (HEPA) filtered vacuum.
    CAUTION: Do not use a vacuum without a HEPA filter--It will disperse 
fine asbestos fibers in the air.

                             6.2. Equipment

    6.2.1. Phase contrast microscope with binocular or trinocular head.
    6.2.2. Widefield or Huygenian 10X eyepieces (NOTE: The eyepiece 
containing the graticule must be a focusing eyepiece. Use a 40X phase 
objective with a numerical aperture of 0.65 to 0.75).
    6.2.3. Kohler illumination (if possible) with green or blue filter.
    6.2.4. Walton-Beckett Graticule, type G-22 with 100 <plus-minus>2 
<greek-m> m projected diameter.
    6.2.5. Mechanical stage. A rotating mechanical stage is convenient 
for use with polarized light.

                        6.4. Standard Preparation

    A way to prepare standard asbestos samples of known concentration 
has not been developed. It is possible to prepare replicate samples of 
nearly equal concentration. This has been performed through the PAT 
program. These asbestos samples are distributed by the AIHA to 
participating laboratories.
    Since only about one-fourth of a 25-mm sample membrane is required 
for an asbestos count, any PAT sample can serve as a ``standard'' for 
replicate counting.
    6.5. Sample Mounting
    Note: See Safety Precautions in Section 6.1. before proceeding. The 
objective is to

[[Page 526]]

produce samples with a smooth (non-grainy) background in a medium with a 
refractive index of approximately 1.46. The technique below collapses 
the filter for easier focusing and produces permanent mounts which are 
useful for quality control and interlaboratory comparison.

    An aluminum block or similar device is required for sample 
preparation.
    6.5.1. Heat the aluminum block to about 70 deg.C. The hot block 
should not be used on any surface that can be damaged by either the heat 
or from exposure to acetone.
    6.5.2. Ensure that the glass slides and cover glasses are free of 
dust and fibers.
    6.5.3. Remove the top plug to prevent a vacuum when the cassette is 
opened. Clean the outside of the cassette if necessary. Cut the seal 
and/or tape on the cassette with a razor blade. Very carefully separate 
the base from the extension cowl, leaving the filter and backup pad in 
the base.
    6.5.4. With a rocking motion cut a triangular wedge from the filter 
using the scalpel. This wedge should be one-sixth to one-fourth of the 
filter. Grasp the filter wedge with the forceps on the perimeter of the 
filter which was clamped between the cassette pieces. DO NOT TOUCH the 
filter with your finger. Place the filter on the glass slide sample side 
up. Static electricity will usually keep the filter on the slide until 
it is cleared.
    6.5.5. Place the tip of the micropipette containing about 200 
<greek-m> L acetone into the aluminum block. Insert the glass slide into 
the receiving slot in the aluminum block. Inject the acetone into the 
block with slow, steady pressure on the plunger while holding the 
pipette firmly in place. Wait 3 to 5 seconds for the filter to clear, 
then remove the pipette and slide from the aluminum block.
    6.5.6. Immediately (less than 30 seconds) place 2.5 to 3.5 <greek-m> 
L of triacetin on the filter (NOTE: Waiting longer than 30 seconds will 
result in increased index of refraction and decreased contrast between 
the fibers and the preparation. This may also lead to separation of the 
cover slip from the slide).
    6.5.7. Lower a cover slip gently onto the filter at a slight angle 
to reduce the possibility of forming air bubbles. If more than 30 
seconds have elapsed between acetone exposure and triacetin application, 
glue the edges of the cover slip to the slide with lacquer or nail 
polish.
    6.5.8. If clearing is slow, warm the slide for 15 min on a hot plate 
having a surface temperature of about 50 deg.C to hasten clearing. The 
top of the hot block can be used if the slide is not heated too long.
    6.5.9. Counting may proceed immediately after clearing and mounting 
are completed.

                          6.6. Sample Analysis

    Completely align the microscope according to the manufacturer's 
instructions. Then, align the microscope using the following general 
alignment routine at the beginning of every counting session and more 
often if necessary.

                            6.6.1. Alignment

    (1) Clean all optical surfaces. Even a small amount of dirt can 
significantly degrade the image.
    (2) Rough focus the objective on a sample.
    (3) Close down the field iris so that it is visible in the field of 
view. Focus the image of the iris with the condenser focus. Center the 
image of the iris in the field of view.
    (4) Install the phase telescope and focus on the phase rings. 
Critically center the rings. Misalignment of the rings results in 
astigmatism which will degrade the image.
    (5) Place the phase-shift test slide on the microscope stage and 
focus on the lines. The analyst must see line set 3 and should see at 
least parts of 4 and 5 but, not see line set 6 or 6. A microscope/
microscopist combination which does not pass this test may not be used.

                         6.6.2. Counting Fibers

    (1) Place the prepared sample slide on the mechanical stage of the 
microscope. Position the center of the wedge under the objective lens 
and focus upon the sample.
    (2) Start counting from one end of the wedge and progress along a 
radial line to the other end (count in either direction from perimeter 
to wedge tip). Select fields randomly, without looking into the 
eyepieces, by slightly advancing the slide in one direction with the 
mechanical stage control.
    (3) Continually scan over a range of focal planes (generally the 
upper 10 to 15 <greek-m> m of the filter surface) with the fine focus 
control during each field count. Spend at least 5 to 15 seconds per 
field.
    (4) Most samples will contain asbestos fibers with fiber diameters 
less than 1 <greek-m> m. Look carefully for faint fiber images. The 
small diameter fibers will be very hard to see. However, they are an 
important contribution to the total count.
    (5) Count only fibers equal to or longer than 5 <greek-m> m. Measure 
the length of curved fibers along the curve.
    (6) Count fibers which have a length to width ratio of 3:1 or 
greater.
    (7) Count all the fibers in at least 20 fields. Continue counting 
until either 100 fibers are counted or 100 fields have been viewed; 
whichever occurs first. Count all the fibers in the final field.
    (8) Fibers lying entirely within the boundary of the Walton-Beckett 
graticule field shall receive a count of 1. Fibers crossing the boundary 
once, having one end within the

[[Page 527]]

circle shall receive a count of \1/2\. Do not count any fiber that 
crosses the graticule boundary more than once. Reject and do not count 
any other fibers even though they may be visible outside the graticule 
area. If a fiber touches the circle, it is considered to cross the line.
    (9) Count bundles of fibers as one fiber unless individual fibers 
can be clearly identified and each individual fiber is clearly not 
connected to another counted fiber. See Figure 1 for counting 
conventions.
    (10) Record the number of fibers in each field in a consistent way 
such that filter non-uniformity can be assessed.
    (11) Regularly check phase ring alignment.
    (12) When an agglomerate (mass of material) covers more than 25% of 
the field of view, reject the field and select another. Do not include 
it in the number of fields counted.
    (13) Perform a ``blind recount'' of 1 in every 10 filter wedges 
(slides). Re-label the slides using a person other than the original 
counter.

                        6.7. Fiber Identification

    As previously mentioned in Section 1.3., PCM does not provide 
positive confirmation of asbestos fibers. Alternate differential 
counting techniques should be used if discrimination is desirable. 
Differential counting may include primary discrimination based on 
morphology, polarized light analysis of fibers, or modification of PCM 
data by Scanning Electron or Transmission Electron Microscopy.
    A great deal of experience is required to routinely and correctly 
perform differential counting. It is discouraged unless it is legally 
necessary. Then, only if a fiber is obviously not asbestos should it be 
excluded from the count. Further discussion of this technique can be 
found in reference 8.10.
    If there is a question whether a fiber is asbestos or not, follow 
the rule:
    ``WHEN IN DOUBT, COUNT.''

         6.8. Analytical Recommendations--Quality Control System

    6.8.1. All individuals performing asbestos analysis must have taken 
the NIOSH course for sampling and evaluating airborne asbestos or an 
equivalent course.
    6.8.2. Each laboratory engaged in asbestos counting shall set up a 
slide trading arrangement with at least two other laboratories in order 
to compare performance and eliminate inbreeding of error. The slide 
exchange occurs at least semiannually. The round robin results shall be 
posted where all analysts can view individual analyst's results.
    6.8.3. Each laboratory engaged in asbestos counting shall 
participate in the Proficiency Analytical Testing Program, the Asbestos 
Analyst Registry or equivalent.
    6.8.4. Each analyst shall select and count prepared slides from a 
``slide bank''. These are quality assurance counts. The slide bank shall 
be prepared using uniformly distributed samples taken from the workload. 
Fiber densities should cover the entire range routinely analyzed by the 
laboratory. These slides are counted blind by all counters to establish 
an original standard deviation. This historical distribution is compared 
with the quality assurance counts. A counter must have 95% of all 
quality control samples counted within three standard deviations of the 
historical mean. This count is then integrated into a new historical 
mean and standard deviation for the slide.
    The analyses done by the counters to establish the slide bank may be 
used for an interim quality control program if the data are treated in a 
proper statistical fashion.

                             7. Calculations

    7.1. Calculate the estimated airborne asbestos fiber concentration 
on the filter sample using the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR10AU94.033

where:
AC=Airborne fiber concentration
FB=Total number of fibers greater than 5 <greek-m> m counted
FL=Total number of fields counted on the filter
BFB=Total number of fibers greater than 5 <greek-m>m counted in the 
          blank
BFL=Total number of fields counted on the blank
ECA=Effective collecting area of filter (385 mm\2\ nominal for a 25-mm 
          filter.)
FR=Pump flow rate (L/min)
MFA=Microscope count field area (mm\2\). This is 0.00785 mm\2\ for a 
          Walton-Beckett Graticule.
T=Sample collection time (min)
1,000=Conversion of L to cc

    Note: The collection area of a filter is seldom equal to 385 mm\2\. 
It is appropriate for laboratories to routinely monitor the exact 
diameter using an inside micrometer. The collection area is calculated 
according to the formula:


Area=<SUP>dagger;</SUP>(d/2)\2\

                       7.2. Short-Cut Calculation

    Since a given analyst always has the same interpupillary distance, 
the number of fields per filter for a particular analyst will remain 
constant for a given size filter. The field size for that analyst is 
constant (i.e. the analyst is using an assigned microscope and is not 
changing the reticle).

[[Page 528]]

    For example, if the exposed area of the filter is always 385 mm\2\ 
and the size of the field is always 0.00785 mm<SUP>2</SUP> the number of 
fields per filter will always be 49,000. In addition it is necessary to 
convert liters of air to cc. These three constants can then be combined 
such that ECA/(1,000 x MFA)=49. The previous equation simplifies to:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR10AU94.034

                        7.3. Recount Calculations

    As mentioned in step 13 of Section 6.6.2., a ``blind recount'' of 
10% of the slides is performed. In all cases, differences will be 
observed between the first and second counts of the same filter wedge. 
Most of these differences will be due to chance alone, that is, due to 
the random variability (precision) of the count method. Statistical 
recount criteria enables one to decide whether observed differences can 
be explained due to chance alone or are probably due to systematic 
differences between analysts, microscopes, or other biasing factors.
    The following recount criterion is for a pair of counts that 
estimate AC in fibers/cc. The criterion is given at the type-I error 
level. That is, there is 5% maximum risk that we will reject a pair of 
counts for the reason that one might be biased, when the large observed 
difference is really due to chance.
    Reject a pair of counts if:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR29JN95.002
    
Where:
AC<INF>1</INF>=lower estimated airborne fiber concentration
AC<INF>2</INF>=higher estimated airborne fiber concentration
AC<INF>avg</INF>=average of the two concentration estimates
CV<INF>FB</INF>=CV for the average of the two concentration estimates
    If a pair of counts are rejected by this criterion then, recount the 
rest of the filters in the submitted set. Apply the test and reject any 
other pairs failing the test. Rejection shall include a memo to the 
industrial hygienist stating that the sample failed a statistical test 
for homogeneity and the true air concentration may be significantly 
different than the reported value.

                         7.4. Reporting Results

    Report results to the industrial hygienist as fibers/cc. Use two 
significant figures. If multiple analyses are performed on a sample, an 
average of the results is to be reported unless any of the results can 
be rejected for cause.

                             Quality Control

    The OSHA asbestos regulations require each laboratory to establish a 
quality control program. The following is presented as an example of how 
the OSHA-SLTC constructed its internal CV curve as part of meeting this 
requirement. Data is from 395 samples collected during OSHA compliance

[[Page 529]]

inspections and analyzed from October 1980 through April 1986.
    Each sample was counted by 2 to 5 different counters independently 
of one another. The standard deviation and the CV statistic was 
calculated for each sample. This data was then plotted on a graph of CV 
vs. fibers/mm\2\. A least squares regression was performed using the 
following equation:

CV=antilog<INF>10</INF>[A(log<INF>10</INF>(x))<SUP>2</SUP>+B(log<INF>10</INF>
          (x))+C]

where:
x=the number of fibers/mm\2\
    Application of least squares gave:
A=0.182205
B=0.973343
C=0.327499

    Using these values, the equation becomes:

CV=antilog<INF>10</INF>[0.182205(log<INF>10</INF>(x))\2\
  -0.973343(log<INF>10</INF>(x))+0.327499]

                   Sampling Pump Flow Rate Corrections

    This correction is used if a difference greater than 5% in ambient 
temperature and/or pressure is noted between calibration and sampling 
sites and the pump does not compensate for the differences.

                        Walton-Beckett Graticule

    When ordering the Graticule for asbestos counting, specify the exact 
disc diameter needed to fit the ocular of the microscope and the 
diameter (mm) of the circular counting area. Instructions for measuring 
the dimensions necessary are listed:
    (1) Insert any available graticule into the focusing eyepiece and 
focus so that the graticule lines are sharp and clear.
    (2) Align the microscope.
    (3) Place a stage micrometer on the microscope object stage and 
focus the microscope on the graduated lines.
    (4) Measure the magnified grid length, PL (<greek-m> m), using the 
stage micrometer.
    (5) Remove the graticule from the microscope and measure its actual 
grid length, AL (mm). This can be accomplished by using a mechanical 
stage fitted with verniers, or a jeweler's loupe with a direct reading 
scale.
    (6) Let D=100 <greek-m> m. Calculate the circle diameter, 
d<INF>c</INF> (mm), for the Walton-Beckett graticule and specify the 
diameter when making a purchase:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR10AU94.037

Example: If PL=108 <greek-m> m, AL=2.93 mm and D=100 <greek-m> m, then,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR10AU94.038

    (7) Each eyepiece-objective-reticle combination on the microscope 
must be calibrated. Should any of the three be changed (by zoom 
adjustment, disassembly, replacement, etc.), the combination must be 
recalibrated. Calibration may change if interpupillary distance is 
changed.
    Measure the field diameter, D (acceptable range: 100<plus-minus>2 
<greek-m> m) with a stage micrometer upon receipt of the graticule from 
the manufacturer. Determine the field area (mm<SUP>2</SUP>).
Field Area=<SUP>dagger;</SUP>(D/2) \2\
If D=100 <greek-m> m=0.1 mm, then
Field Area=<SUP>dagger;</SUP>(0.1 mm/2) \2\=0.00785 mm \2\

Appendix E to Sec. 1926.1101--Interpretation and Classification of Chest 
                        Roentgenograms--Mandatory

    (a) Chest roentgenograms shall be interpreted and classified in 
accordance with a professionally accepted classification system and 
recorded on an interpretation form following the format of the CDC/NIOSH 
(M) 2.8 form. As a minimum, the content within the bold lines of this 
form (items 1 through 4) shall be included. This form is not to be 
submitted to NIOSH..
    (b) Roentgenograms shall be interpreted and classified only by a B-
reader, a board eligible/certified radiologist, or an experienced 
physician with known s.
    (c) All interpreters, whenever interpreting chest roentgenograms 
made under this section, shall have immediately available for reference 
a complete set of the ILO-U/C International Classification of 
Radiographs for Pneumoconioses, 1980.

 Appendix F to Sec. 1926.1101--Work Practices and Engineering Controls 
             for Class I Asbestos Operations (Non-Mandatory)

    This is a non-mandatory appendix to the asbestos standards for 
construction and for shipyards. It describes criteria and procedures for 
erecting and using negative pressure enclosures for Class I Asbestos 
Work, when NPEs are used as an allowable control method to comply with 
paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section. Many small and variable details are 
involved in the erection of a negative pressure enclosure. OSHA and most 
participants in the rulemaking agreed that only the major, more 
performance oriented criteria should be made mandatory. These criteria 
are set out in paragraph (g) of this section. In addition, this appendix 
includes these mandatory specifications and procedures in its guidelines 
in order to make this appendix coherent and helpful. The mandatory 
nature of the criteria which appear in the regulatory text is not 
changed because they are

[[Page 543]]

included in this ``non-mandatory'' appendix. Similarly, the additional 
criteria and procedures included as guidelines in the appendix, do not 
become mandatory because mandatory criteria are also included in these 
comprehensive guidelines.
    In addition, none of the criteria, both mandatory and recommended, 
are meant to specify or imply the need for use of patented or licensed 
methods or equipment. Recommended specifications included in this 
attachment should not discourage the use of creative alternatives which 
can be shown to reliably achieve the objectives of negative-pressure 
enclosures.
    Requirements included in this appendix, cover general provisions to 
be followed in all asbestos jobs, provisions which must be followed for 
all Class I asbestos jobs, and provisions governing the construction and 
testing of negative pressure enclosures. The first category includes the 
requirement for use of wet methods, HEPA vacuums, and immediate bagging 
of waste; Class I work must conform to the following provisions:
    <bullet> oversight by competent person
    <bullet> use of critical barriers over all openings to work area
    <bullet> isolation of HVAC systems
    <bullet> use of impermeable dropcloths and coverage of all objects 
within regulated areas
    In addition, more specific requirements for NPEs include:
    <bullet> maintenance of -0.02 inches water gauge within enclosure
    <bullet> manometric measurements
    <bullet> air movement away from employees performing removal work
    <bullet> smoke testing or equivalent for detection of leaks and air 
direction
    <bullet> deactivation of electrical circuits, if not provided with 
ground-fault circuit interrupters.

                          Planning the Project

    The standard requires that an exposure assessment be conducted 
before the asbestos job is begun [Sec. 1926.1101 (f)(1)]. Information 
needed for that assessment, includes data relating to prior similar 
jobs, as applied to the specific variables of the current job. The 
information needed to conduct the assessment will be useful in planning 
the project, and in complying with any reporting requirements under this 
standard, when significant changes are being made to a control system 
listed in the standard, [see also those of USEPA (40 CFR 61, subpart M). 
Thus, although the standard does not explicitly require the preparation 
of a written asbestos removal plan, the usual constituents of such a 
plan, i.e., a description of the enclosure, the equipment, and the 
procedures to be used throughout the project, must be determined before 
the enclosure can be erected. The following information should be 
included in the planning of the system:

A physical description of the work area;
A description of the approximate amount of material to be removed;
A schedule for turning off and sealing existing ventilation systems;
Personnel hygiene procedures;
A description of personal protective equipment and clothing to be worn 
          by employees;
A description of the local exhaust ventilation systems to be used and 
          how they are to be tested;
A description of work practices to be observed by employees;
An air monitoring plan;
A description of the method to be used to transport waste material; and
The location of the dump site.

         Materials and Equipment Necessary for Asbestos Removal

    Although individual asbestos removal projects vary in terms of the 
equipment required to accomplish the removal of the materials, some 
equipment and materials are common to most asbestos removal operations.
    Plastic sheeting used to protect horizontal surfaces, seal HVAC 
openings or to seal vertical openings and ceilings should have a minimum 
thickness of 6 mils. Tape or other adhesive used to attach plastic 
sheeting should be of sufficient adhesive strength to support the weight 
of the material plus all stresses encountered during the entire duration 
of the project without becoming detached from the surface.
    Other equipment and materials which should be available at the 
beginning of each project are:

--HEPA Filtered Vacuum is essential for cleaning the work area after the 
asbestos has been removed. It should have a long hose capable of 
reaching out-of-the-way places, such as areas above ceiling tiles, 
behind pipes, etc.
--Portable air ventilation systems installed to provide the negative air 
pressure and air removal from the enclosure must be equipped with a HEPA 
filter. The number and capacity of units required to ventilate an 
enclosure depend on the size of the area to be ventilated. The filters 
for these systems should be designed in such a manner that they can be 
replaced when the air flow volume is reduced by the build-up of dust in 
the filtration material. Pressure monitoring devices with alarms and 
strip chart recorders attached to each system to indicate the pressure 
differential and the loss due to dust buildup on the filter are 
recommended.
--Water sprayers should be used to keep the asbestos material as 
saturated as possible during removal; the sprayers will provide a

[[Page 544]]

fine mist that minimizes the impact of the spray on the material.
--Water used to saturate the asbestos containing material can be amended 
by adding at least 15 milliliters (\1/4\ ounce) of wetting agent in 1 
liter (1 pint) of water. An example of a wetting agent is a 50/50 
mixture of polyoxyethylene ether and polyoxyethylene polyglycol ester.
--Backup power supplies are recommended, especially for ventilation 
systems.
--Shower and bath water should be with mixed hot and cold water faucets. 
Water that has been used to clean personnel or equipment should either 
be filtered or be collected and discarded as asbestos waste. Soap and 
shampoo should be provided to aid in removing dust from the workers' 
skin and hair.
--See paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section for appropriate respiratory 
protection and protective clothing.
--See paragraph (k) of this section for required signs and labels.

                         Preparing the Work Area

    Disabling HVAC Systems: The power to the heating, ventilation, and 
air conditioning systems that service the restricted area must be 
deactivated and locked off. All ducts, grills, access ports, windows and 
vents must be sealed off with two layers of plastic to prevent 
entrainment of contaminated air.
    Operating HVAC Systems in the Restricted Area: If components of a 
HVAC system located in the restricted area are connected to a system 
that will service another zone during the project, the portion of the 
duct in the restricted area must be sealed and pressurized. Necessary 
precautions include caulking the duct joints, covering all cracks and 
openings with two layers of sheeting, and pressurizing the duct 
throughout the duration of the project by restricting the return air 
flow. The power to the fan supplying the positive pressure should be 
locked ``on'' to prevent pressure loss.
    Sealing Elevators: If an elevator shaft is located in the restricted 
area, it should be either shut down or isolated by sealing with two 
layers of plastic sheeting. The sheeting should provide enough slack to 
accommodate the pressure changes in the shaft without breaking the air-
tight seal.
    Removing Mobile Objects: All movable objects should be cleaned and 
removed from the work area before an enclosure is constructed unless 
moving the objects creates a hazard. Mobile objects will be assumed to 
be contaminated and should be either cleaned with amended water and a 
HEPA vacuum and then removed from the area or wrapped and then disposed 
of as hazardous waste.
    Cleaning and Sealing Surfaces: After cleaning with water and a HEPA 
vacuum, surfaces of stationary objects should be covered with two layers 
of plastic sheeting. The sheeting should be secured with duct tape or an 
equivalent method to provide a tight seal around the object.
    Bagging Waste: In addition to the requirement for immediate bagging 
of waste for disposal, it is further recommended that the waste material 
be double-bagged and sealed in plastic bags designed for asbestos 
disposal. The bags should be stored in a waste storage area that can be 
controlled by the workers conducting the removal. Filters removed from 
air handling units and rubbish removed from the area are to be bagged 
and handled as hazardous waste.

                       Constructing the Enclosure

    The enclosure should be constructed to provide an air-tight seal 
around ducts and openings into existing ventilation systems and around 
penetrations for electrical conduits, telephone wires, water lines, 
drain pipes, etc. Enclosures should be both airtight and watertight 
except for those openings designed to provide entry and/or air flow 
control.
    Size: An enclosure should be the minimum volume to encompass all of 
the working surfaces yet allow unencumbered movement by the worker(s), 
provide unrestricted air flow past the worker(s), and ensure walking 
surfaces can be kept free of tripping hazards.
    Shape: The enclosure may be any shape that optimizes the flow of 
ventilation air past the worker(s).
    Structural Integrity: The walls, ceilings and floors must be 
supported in such a manner that portions of the enclosure will not fall 
down during normal use.
    Openings: It is not necessary that the structure be airtight; 
openings may be designed to direct air flow. Such openings should be 
located at a distance from active removal operations. They should be 
designed to draw air into the enclosure under all anticipated 
circumstances. In the event that negative pressure is lost, they should 
be fitted with either HEPA filters to trap dust or automatic trap doors 
that prevent dust from escaping the enclosure. Openings for exits should 
be controlled by an airlock or a vestibule.
    Barrier Supports: Frames should be constructed to support all 
unsupported spans of sheeting.
    Sheeting: Walls, barriers, ceilings, and floors should be lined with 
two layers of plastic sheeting having a thickness of at least 6 mil.
    Seams: Seams in the sheeting material should be minimized to reduce 
the possibilities of accidental rips and tears in the adhesive or 
connections. All seams in the sheeting should overlap, be staggered and 
not be located at corners or wall-to-floor joints. Areas Within an 
Enclosure: Each enclosure consists of a work area, a decontamination 
area, and waste storage area. The work area

[[Page 545]]

where the asbestos removal operations occur should be separated from 
both the waste storage area and the contamination control area by 
physical curtains, doors, and/or airflow patterns that force any 
airborne contamination back into the work area.
    See paragraph (j) of this section for requirements for hygiene 
facilities.
    During egress from the work area, each worker should step into the 
equipment room, clean tools and equipment, and remove gross 
contamination from clothing by wet cleaning and HEPA vacuuming. Before 
entering the shower area, foot coverings, head coverings, hand 
coverings, and coveralls are removed and placed in impervious bags for 
disposal or cleaning. Airline connections from airline respirators with 
HEPA disconnects and power cables from powered air-purifying respirators 
(PAPRs) will be disconnected just prior to entering the shower room.

           Establishing Negative Pressure Within the Enclosure

    Negative Pressure: Air is to be drawn into the enclosure under all 
anticipated conditions and exhausted through a HEPA filter for 24 hours 
a day during the entire duration of the project.
    Air Flow Tests: Air flow patterns will be checked before removal 
operations begin, at least once per operating shift and any time there 
is a question regarding the integrity of the enclosure. The primary test 
for air flow is to trace air currents with smoke tubes or other visual 
methods. Flow checks are made at each opening and at each doorway to 
demonstrate that air is being drawn into the enclosure and at each 
worker's position to show that air is being drawn away from the 
breathing zone.
    Monitoring Pressure Within the Enclosure: After the initial air flow 
patterns have been checked, the static pressure must be monitored within 
the enclosure. Monitoring may be made using manometers, pressure gauges, 
or combinations of these devices. It is recommended that they be 
attached to alarms and strip chart recorders at points identified by the 
design engineer.
    Corrective Actions: If the manometers or pressure gauges demonstrate 
a reduction in pressure differential below the required level, work 
should cease and the reason for the change investigated and appropriate 
changes made. The air flow patterns should be retested before work 
begins again.
    Pressure Differential: The design parameters for static pressure 
differentials between the inside and outside of enclosures typically 
range from 0.02 to 0.10 inches of water gauge, depending on conditions. 
All zones inside the enclosure must have less pressure than the ambient 
pressure outside of the enclosure (-0.02 inches water gauge 
differential). Design specifications for the differential vary according 
to the size, configuration, and shape of the enclosure as well as 
ambient and mechanical air pressure conditions around the enclosure.
    Air Flow Patterns: The flow of air past each worker shall be 
enhanced by positioning the intakes and exhaust ports to remove 
contaminated air from the worker's breathing zone, by positioning HEPA 
vacuum cleaners to draw air from the worker's breathing zone, by forcing 
relatively uncontaminated air past the worker toward an exhaust port, or 
by using a combination of methods to reduce the worker's exposure.
    Air Handling Unit Exhaust: The exhaust plume from air handling units 
should be located away from adjacent personnel and intakes for HVAC 
systems.
    Air Flow Volume: The air flow volume (cubic meters per minute) 
exhausted (removed) from the workplace must exceed the amount of makeup 
air supplied to the enclosure. The rate of air exhausted from the 
enclosure should be designed to maintain a negative pressure in the 
enclosure and air movement past each worker. The volume of air flow 
removed from the enclosure should replace the volume of the container at 
every 5 to 15 minutes. Air flow volume will need to be relatively high 
for large enclosures, enclosures with awkward shapes, enclosures with 
multiple openings, and operations employing several workers in the 
enclosure.
    Air Flow Velocity: At each opening, the air flow velocity must 
visibly ``drag'' air into the enclosure. The velocity of air flow within 
the enclosure must be adequate to remove airborne contamination from 
each worker's breathing zone without disturbing the asbestos-containing 
material on surfaces.
    Airlocks: Airlocks are mechanisms on doors and curtains that control 
the air flow patterns in the doorways. If air flow occurs, the patterns 
through doorways must be such that the air flows toward the inside of 
the enclosure. Sometimes vestibules, double doors, or double curtains 
are used to prevent air movement through the doorways. To use a 
vestibule, a worker enters a chamber by opening the door or curtain and 
then closing the entry before opening the exit door or curtain.
    Airlocks should be located between the equipment room and shower 
room, between the shower room and the clean room, and between the waste 
storage area and the outside of the enclosure. The air flow between 
adjacent rooms must be checked using smoke tubes or other visual tests 
to ensure the flow patterns draw air toward the work area without 
producing eddies.

                 Monitoring for Airborne Concentrations

    In addition to the breathing zone samples taken as outlined in 
paragraph (f) of this section, samples of air should be taken to 
demonstrate the integrity of the enclosure, the cleanliness of the clean 
room and shower

[[Page 546]]

area, and the effectiveness of the HEPA filter. If the clean room is 
shown to be contaminated, the room must be relocated to an 
uncontaminated area.
    Samples taken near the exhaust of portable ventilation systems must 
be done with care.

                         General Work Practices

    Preventing dust dispersion is the primary means of controlling the 
spread of asbestos within the enclosure. Whenever practical, the point 
of removal should be isolated, enclosed, covered, or shielded from the 
workers in the area. Waste asbestos containing materials must be bagged 
during or immediately after removal; the material must remain saturated 
until the waste container is sealed.
    Waste material with sharp points or corners must be placed in hard 
air-tight containers rather than bags.
    Whenever possible, large components should be sealed in plastic 
sheeting and removed intact.
    Bags or containers of waste will be moved to the waste holding area, 
washed, and wrapped in a bag with the appropriate labels.

                         Cleaning the Work Area

    Surfaces within the work area should be kept free of visible dust 
and debris to the extent feasible. Whenever visible dust appears on 
surfaces, the surfaces within the enclosure must be cleaned by wiping 
with a wet sponge, brush, or cloth and then vacuumed with a HEPA vacuum.
    All surfaces within the enclosure should be cleaned before the 
exhaust ventilation system is deactivated and the enclosure is 
disassembled. An approved encapsulant may be sprayed onto areas after 
the visible dust has been removed.

                Appendix G to Sec. 1926.1101--[Reserved]

   Appendix H to Sec. 1926.1101--Substance Technical Information for 
                         Asbestos. Non-Mandatory

                       I. Substance Identification

    A. Substance: ``Asbestos'' is the name of a class of magnesium-
silicate minerals that occur in fibrous form. Minerals that are included 
in this group are chrysotile, crocidolite, amosite, anthophyllite 
asbestos, tremolite asbestos, and actinolite asbestos.
    B. Asbestos is and was used in the manufacture of heat-resistant 
clothing, automotive brake and clutch linings, and a variety of building 
materials including floor tiles, roofing felts, ceiling tiles, asbestos-
cement pipe and sheet, and fire-resistant drywall. Asbestos is also 
present in pipe and boiler insulation materials and in sprayed-on 
materials located on beams, in crawlspaces, and between walls.
    C. The potential for an asbestos-containing product to release 
breathable fibers depends largely on its degree of friability. Friable 
means that the material can be crumbled with hand pressure and is 
therefore likely to emit fibers. The fibrous fluffy sprayed-on materials 
used for fireproofing, insulation, or sound proofing are considered to 
be friable, and they readily release airborne fibers if disturbed. 
Materials such as vinyl-asbestos floor tile or roofing felt are 
considered non-friable if intact and generally do not emit airborne 
fibers unless subjected to sanding, sawing and other aggressive 
operations. Asbestos-cement pipe or sheet can emit airborne fibers if 
the materials are cut or sawed, or if they are broken.
    D. Permissible exposure: Exposure to airborne asbestos fibers may 
not exceed 0.1 fibers per cubic centimeter of air (0.1 f/cc) averaged 
over the 8-hour workday, and 1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air (1.0 f/
cc) averaged over a 30 minute work period.

                         II. Health Hazard Data

    A. Asbestos can cause disabling respiratory disease and various 
types of cancers if the fibers are inhaled. Inhaling or ingesting fibers 
from contaminated clothing or skin can also result in these diseases. 
The symptoms of these diseases generally do not appear for 20 or more 
years after initial exposure.
    B. Exposure to asbestos has been shown to cause lung cancer, 
mesothelioma, and cancer of the stomach and colon. Mesothelioma is a 
rare cancer of the thin membrane lining of the chest and abdomen. 
Symptoms of mesothelioma include shortness of breath, pain in the walls 
of the chest, and/or abdominal pain.

                III. Respirators and Protective Clothing

    A. Respirators: You are required to wear a respirator when 
performing tasks that result in asbestos exposure that exceeds the 
permissible exposure limit (PEL) of 0.1 f/cc and when performing certain 
designated operations. Air-purifying respirators equipped with a high-
efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter can be used where airborne 
asbestos fiber concentrations do not exceed 1.0 f/cc; otherwise, more 
protective respirators such as air-supplied, positive-pressure, full 
facepiece respirators must be used. Disposable respirators or dust masks 
are not permitted to be used for asbestos work. For effective 
protection, respirators must fit your face and head snugly. Your 
employer is required to conduct a fit test when you are first assigned a 
respirator and every 6 months thereafter. Respirators should not be 
loosened or removed in work situations where their use is required.
    B. Protective Clothing: You are required to wear protective clothing 
in work areas where

[[Page 547]]

asbestos fiber concentrations exceed the permissible exposure limit 
(PEL) of 0.1 f/cc.

                  IV. Disposal Procedures and Clean-up

    A. Wastes that are generated by processes where asbestos is present 
include:
    1. Empty asbestos shipping containers.
    2. Process wastes such as cuttings, trimmings, or reject materials.
    3. Housekeeping waste from wet-sweeping or HEPA-vacuuming.
    4. Asbestos fireproofing or insulating material that is removed from 
buildings.
    5. Asbestos-containing building products removed during building 
renovation or demolition.
    6. Contaminated disposable protective clothing.
    B. Empty shipping bags can be flattened under exhaust hoods and 
packed into airtight containers for disposal. Empty shipping drums are 
difficult to clean and should be sealed.
    C. Vacuum bags or disposable paper filters should not be cleaned, 
but should be sprayed with a fine water mist and placed into a labeled 
waste container.
    D. Process waste and housekeeping waste should be wetted with water 
or a mixture of water and surfactant prior to packaging in disposable 
containers.
    E. Asbestos-containing material that is removed from buildings must 
be disposed of in leak-tight 6-mil plastic bags, plastic-lined cardboard 
containers, or plastic-lined metal containers. These wastes, which are 
removed while wet, should be sealed in containers before they dry out to 
minimize the release of asbestos fibers during handling.

                        V. Access to Information

    A. Each year, your employer is required to inform you of the 
information contained in this standard and appendices for asbestos. In 
addition, your employer must instruct you in the proper work practices 
for handling asbestos-containing materials, and the correct use of 
protective equipment.
    B. Your employer is required to determine whether you are being 
exposed to asbestos. Your employer must treat exposure to thermal system 
insulation and sprayed-on and troweled-on surfacing material as asbestos 
exposure, unless results of laboratory analysis show that the material 
does not contain asbestos. You or your representative has the right to 
observe employee measurements and to record the results obtained. Your 
employer is required to inform you of your exposure, and, if you are 
exposed above the permissible exposure limit, he or she is required to 
inform you of the actions that are being taken to reduce your exposure 
to within the permissible limit.
    C. Your employer is required to keep records of your exposures and 
medical examinations. These exposure records must be kept for at least 
thirty (30) years. Medical records must be kept for the period of your 
employment plus thirty (30) years.
    D. Your employer is required to release your exposure and medical 
records to your physician or designated representative upon your written 
request.

   Appendix I to Sec. 1926.1101--Medical Surveillance Guidelines for 
                         Asbestos, Non-Mandatory

                            I. Route of Entry

    Inhalation, ingestion.

                             II. Toxicology

    Clinical evidence of the adverse effects associated with exposure to 
asbestos is present in the form of several well-conducted 
epidemiological studies of occupationally exposed workers, family 
contacts of workers, and persons living near asbestos mines. These 
studies have shown a definite association between exposure to asbestos 
and an increased incidence of lung cancer, pleural and peritoneal 
mesothelioma, gastrointestinal cancer, and asbestosis. The latter is a 
disabling fibrotic lung disease that is caused only by exposure to 
asbestos. Exposure to asbestos has also been associated with an 
increased incidence of esophageal, kidney, laryngeal, pharyngeal, and 
buccal cavity cancers. As with other known chronic occupational 
diseases, disease associated with asbestos generally appears about 20 
years following the first occurrence of exposure: There are no known 
acute effects associated with exposure to asbestos.
    Epidemiological studies indicate that the risk of lung cancer among 
exposed workers who smoke cigarettes is greatly increased over the risk 
of lung cancer among non-exposed smokers or exposed nonsmokers. These 
studies suggest that cessation of smoking will reduce the risk of lung 
cancer for a person exposed to asbestos but will not reduce it to the 
same level of risk as that existing for an exposed worker who has never 
smoked.

           III. Signs and Symptoms of Exposure-Related Disease

    The signs and symptoms of lung cancer or gastrointestinal cancer 
induced by exposure to asbestos are not unique, except that a chest X-
ray of an exposed patient with lung cancer may show pleural plaques, 
pleural calcification, or pleural fibrosis. Symptoms characteristic of 
mesothelioma include shortness of breath, pain in the walls of the 
chest, or abdominal pain. Mesothelioma has a much longer latency period 
compared with lung cancer (40 years versus 15-20 years), and 
mesothelioma is therefore more likely to be found among workers who were 
first exposed

[[Page 548]]

to asbestos at an early age. Mesothelioma is always fatal.
    Asbestosis is pulmonary tibrosis caused by the accumulation of 
asbestos fibers in the lungs. Symptoms include shortness of breath, 
coughing, fatigue, and vague feelings of sickness. When the fibrosis 
worsens, shortness of breath occurs even at rest. The diagnosis of 
asbestosis is based on a history of exposure to asbestos, the presence 
of characteristics radiologic changes, end-inspiratory crackles (rales), 
and other clinical features of fibrosing lung disease. Pleural plaques 
and thickening are observed on X-rays taken during the early stages of 
the disease. Asbestosis is often a progressive disease even in the 
absence of continued exposure, although this appears to be a highly 
individualized characteristic. In severe cases, death may be caused by 
respiratory or cardiac failure.

             IV. Surveillance and Preventive Considerations

    As noted above, exposure to asbestos has been linked to an increased 
risk of lung cancer, mesothelioma, gastrointestinal cancer, and 
asbestosis among occupationally exposed workers. Adequate screening 
tests to determine an employee's potential for developing serious 
chronic diseases, such as a cancer, from exposure to asbestos do not 
presently exist. However, some tests, particularly chest X-rays and 
pulmonary function tests, may indicate that an employee has been 
overexposed to asbestos increasing his or her risk of developing 
exposure related chronic diseases. It is important for the physician to 
become familiar with the operating conditions in which occupational 
exposure to asbestos is likely to occur. This is particularly important 
in evaluating medical and work histories and in conducting physical 
examinations. When an active employee has been identified as having been 
overexposed to asbestos measures taken by the employer to eliminate or 
mitigate further exposure should also lower the risk of serious long-
term consequences.
    The employer is required to institute a medical surveillance program 
for all employees who are or will be exposed to asbestos at or above the 
permissible exposure limit (0.1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air). All 
examinations and procedures must be performed by or under the 
supervision of a licensed physician, at a reasonable time and place, and 
at no cost to the employee.
    Although broad latitude is given to the physician in prescribing 
specific tests to be included in the medical surveillance program, OSHA 
requires inclusion of the following elements in the routine examination:
    (i) Medical and work histories with special emphasis directed to 
symptoms of the respiratory system, cardiovascular system, and digestive 
tract.
    (ii) Completion of the respiratory disease questionnaire contained 
in Appendix D.
    (iii) A physical examination including a chest roentgenogram and 
pulmonary function test that includes measurement of the employee's 
forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume at one second 
(FEV<INF>1</INF>).
    (iv) Any laboratory or other test that the examining physician deems 
by sound medical practice to be necessary.
    The employer is required to make the prescribed tests available at 
least annually to those employees covered; more often than specified if 
recommended by the examining physician; and upon termination of 
employment.
    The employer is required to provide the physician with the following 
information: A copy of this standard and appendices; a description of 
the employee's duties as they relate to asbestos exposure; the 
employee's representative level of exposure to asbestos; a description 
of any personal protective and respiratory equipment used; and 
information from previous medical examinations of the affected employee 
that is not otherwise available to the physician. Making this 
information available to the physician will aid in the evaluation of the 
employee's health in relation to assigned duties and fitness to wear 
personal protective equipment, if required.
    The employer is required to obtain a written opinion from the 
examining physician containing the results of the medical examination; 
the physician's opinion as to whether the employee has any detected 
medical conditions that would place the employee at an increased risk of 
exposure-related disease; any recommended limitations on the employee or 
on the use of personal protective equipment; and a statement that the 
employee has been informed by the physician of the results of the 
medical examination and of any medical conditions related to asbestos 
exposure that require further explanation or treatment. This written 
opinion must not reveal specific findings or diagnoses unrelated to 
exposure to asbestos, and a copy of the opinion must be provided to the 
affected employee.

                             1. Introduction

    This method describes the collection and analysis of asbestos bulk 
materials by light microscopy techniques including phase- polar 
illumination and central-stop dispersion microscopy. Some terms unique 
to asbestos analysis are defined below:
    Amphibole: A family of minerals whose crystals are formed by long, 
thin units which have two thin ribbons of double chain silicate with a 
brucite ribbon in between. The shape of each unit is similar to an ``I 
beam''. Minerals important in asbestos analysis include cummingtonite-
grunerite, crocidolite, tremolite-actinolite and anthophyllite.
    Asbestos: A term for naturally occurring fibrous minerals. Asbestos 
includes chrysotile, cummingtonite-grunerite asbestos (amosite), 
anthophyllite asbestos, tremolite asbestos, crocidolite, actinolite 
asbestos and any of these minerals which have been chemically treated or 
altered. The precise chemical formulation of each species varies with 
the location from which it was mined. Nominal compositions are listed:

            Chrysotile...................................Mg<INF>3</INF> 
                            Si<INF>2</INF> O<INF>5</INF>(OH)<INF>4</INF>
              Crocidolite (Riebeckite asbestos)..........Na<INF>2</INF> 
                         Fe<INF>3</INF>2+Fe<INF>2</INF>3+Si<INF>8</INF> 
                                          O<INF>22</INF>(OH)<INF>2</INF>
         Cummingtonite-Grunerite asbestos (Amosite)............(Mg,Fe)<I
                NF>7</INF> Si<INF>8</INF> O<INF>22</INF>(OH)<INF>2</INF>
     Tremolite-Actinolite asbestos....Ca<INF>2</INF>(Mg,Fe)<INF>5</INF> 
                           Si<INF>8</INF> O<INF>22</INF>(OH)<INF>2</INF>
             Anthophyllite asbestos.................(Mg,Fe)<INF>7</INF> 
                           Si<INF>8</INF> O<INF>22</INF>(OH)<INF>2</INF>
    Asbestos Fiber: A fiber of asbestos meeting the criteria for a 
fiber. (See section 3.5. of this Appendix)
    Aspect Ratio: The ratio of the length of a fiber to its diameter 
usually defined as ``length : width'', e.g. 3:1.
    Brucite: A sheet mineral with the composition Mg(OH)<INF>2</INF>.
    Central Stop Dispersion Staining (microscope): This is a dark field 
microscope technique that images particles using only light refracted by 
the particle, excluding light that travels through the particle 
unrefracted. This is usually accomplished with a McCrone objective or 
other arrangement which places

[[Page 550]]

a circular stop with apparent aperture equal to the objective aperture 
in the back focal plane of the microscope.
    Cleavage Fragments: Mineral particles formed by the comminution of 
minerals, especially those characterized by relatively parallel sides 
and moderate aspect ratio.
    Differential Counting: The term applied to the practice of excluding 
certain kinds of fibers from a phase contrast asbestos count because 
they are not asbestos.
    Fiber: A particle longer than or equal to 5 <greek-m>m with a length 
to width ratio greater than or equal to 3:1. This may include cleavage 
fragments. (see section 3.5 of this appendix).
    Phase Contrast: Contrast obtained in the microscope by causing light 
scattered by small particles to destructively interfere with unscattered 
light, thereby enhancing the visibility of very small particles and 
particles with very low intrinsic contrast.
    Phase Contrast Microscope: A microscope configured with a phase mask 
pair to create phase contrast. The technique which uses this is called 
Phase Contrast Microscopy (PCM).
    Phase-Polar Analysis: This is the use of polarized light in a phase 
contrast microscope. It is used to see the same size fibers that are 
visible in air filter analysis. Although fibers finer than 1 <greek-m> m 
are visible, analysis of these is inferred from analysis of larger 
bundles that are usually present.
    Phase-Polar Microscope: The phase-polar microscope is a phase 
contrast microscope which has an analyzer, a polarizer, a first order 
red plate and a rotating phase condenser all in place so that the 
polarized light image is enhanced by phase contrast.
    Sealing Encapsulant: This is a product which can be applied, 
preferably by spraying, onto an asbestos surface which will seal the 
surface so that fibers cannot be released.
    Serpentine: A mineral family consisting of minerals with the general 
composition Mg<INF>3</INF>(Si<INF>2</INF> O<INF>5</INF>(OH)<INF>4</INF> 
having the magnesium in brucite layer over a silicate layer. Minerals 
important in asbestos analysis included in this family are chrysotile, 
lizardite, antigorite.

                              1.1. History

    Light microscopy has been used for well over 100 years for the 
determination of mineral species. This analysis is carried out using 
specialized polarizing microscopes as well as bright field microscopes. 
The identification of minerals is an on-going process with many new 
minerals described each year. The first recorded use of asbestos was in 
Finland about 2500 B.C. where the material was used in the mud wattle 
for the wooden huts the people lived in as well as strengthening for 
pottery. Adverse health aspects of the mineral were noted nearly 2000 
years ago when Pliny the Younger wrote about the poor health of slaves 
in the asbestos mines. Although known to be injurious for centuries, the 
first modern references to its toxicity were by the British Labor 
Inspectorate when it banned asbestos dust from the workplace in 1898. 
Asbestosis cases were described in the literature after the turn of the 
century. Cancer was first suspected in the mid 1930's and a causal link 
to mesothelioma was made in 1965. Because of the public concern for 
worker and public safety with the use of this material, several 
different types of analysis were applied to the determination of 
asbestos content. Light microscopy requires a great deal of experience 
and craft. Attempts were made to apply less subjective methods to the 
analysis. X-ray diffraction was partially successful in determining the 
mineral types but was unable to separate out the fibrous portions from 
the non-fibrous portions. Also, the minimum detection limit for asbestos 
analysis by X-ray diffraction (XRD) is about 1%. Differential Thermal 
Analysis (DTA) was no more successful. These provide useful 
corroborating information when the presence of asbestos has been shown 
by microscopy; however, neither can determine the difference between 
fibrous and non-fibrous minerals when both habits are present. The same 
is true of Infrared Absorption (IR).
    When electron microscopy was applied to asbestos analysis, hundreds 
of fibers were discovered present too small to be visible in any light 
microscope. There are two different types of electron microscope used 
for asbestos analysis: Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and 
Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). Scanning Electron Microscopy is 
useful in identifying minerals. The SEM can provide two of the three 
pieces of information required to identify fibers by electron 
microscopy: morphology and chemistry. The third is structure as 
determined by Selected Area Electron Diffraction--SAED which is 
performed in the TEM. Although the resolution of the SEM is sufficient 
for very fine fibers to be seen, accuracy of chemical analysis that can 
be performed on the fibers varies with fiber diameter in fibers of less 
than 0.2 <greek-m> m diameter. The TEM is a powerful tool to identify 
fibers too small to be resolved by light microscopy and should be used 
in conjunction with this method when necessary. The TEM can provide all 
three pieces of information required for fiber identification. Most 
fibers thicker than 1 <greek-m> m can adequately be defined in the light 
microscope. The light microscope remains as the best instrument for the 
determination of mineral type. This is because the minerals under 
investigation were first described analytically with the light 
microscope. It is inexpensive and gives positive identification for most 
samples analyzed.

[[Page 551]]

Further, when optical techniques are inadequate, there is ample 
indication that alternative techniques should be used for complete 
identification of the sample.

                             1.2. Principle

    Minerals consist of atoms that may be arranged in random order or in 
a regular arrangement. Amorphous materials have atoms in random order 
while crystalline materials have long range order. Many materials are 
transparent to light, at least for small particles or for thin sections. 
The properties of these materials can be investigated by the effect that 
the material has on light passing through it. The six asbestos minerals 
are all crystalline with particular properties that have been identified 
and cataloged. These six minerals are anisotropic. They have a regular 
array of atoms, but the arrangement is not the same in all directions. 
Each major direction of the crystal presents a different regularity. 
Light photons travelling in each of these main directions will encounter 
different electrical neighborhoods, affecting the path and time of 
travel. The techniques outlined in this method use the fact that light 
traveling through fibers or crystals in different directions will behave 
differently, but predictably. The behavior of the light as it travels 
through a crystal can be measured and compared with known or determined 
values to identify the mineral species. Usually, Polarized Light 
Microscopy (PLM) is performed with strain-free objectives on a bright-
field microscope platform. This would limit the resolution of the 
microscope to about 0.4 <greek-m>m. Because OSHA requires the counting 
and identification of fibers visible in phase contrast, the phase 
contrast platform is used to visualize the fibers with the polarizing 
elements added into the light path. Polarized light methods cannot 
identify fibers finer than about 1<greek-m> m in diameter even though 
they are visible. The finest fibers are usually identified by inference 
from the presence of larger, identifiable fiber bundles. When fibers are 
present, but not identifiable by light microscopy, use either SEM or TEM 
to determine the fiber identity.

                    1.3. Advantages and Disadvantages

    The advantages of light microcopy are:
    (a) Basic identification of the materials was first performed by 
light microscopy and gross analysis. This provides a large base of 
published information against which to check analysis and analytical 
technique.
    (b) The analysis is specific to fibers. The minerals present can 
exist in asbestiform, fibrous, prismatic, or massive varieties all at 
the same time. Therefore, bulk methods of analysis such as X-ray 
diffraction, IR analysis, DTA, etc. are inappropriate where the material 
is not known to be fibrous.
    (c) The analysis is quick, requires little preparation time, and can 
be performed on-site if a suitably equipped microscope is available.
    The disadvantages are:
    (a) Even using phase-polar illumination, not all the fibers present 
may be seen. This is a problem for very low asbestos concentrations 
where agglomerations or large bundles of fibers may not be present to 
allow identification by inference.
    (b) The method requires a great degree of sophistication on the part 
of the microscopist. An analyst is only as useful as his mental catalog 
of images. Therefore, a microscopist's accuracy is enhanced by 
experience. The mineralogical training of the analyst is very important. 
It is the basis on which subjective decisions are made.
    (c) The method uses only a tiny amount of material for analysis. 
This may lead to sampling bias and false results (high or low). This is 
especially true if the sample is severely inhomogeneous.
    (d) Fibers may be bound in a matrix and not distinguishable as 
fibers so identification cannot be made.

                         1.4. Method Performance

    1.4.1. This method can be used for determination of asbestos content 
from 0 to 100% asbestos. The detection limit has not been adequately 
determined, although for selected samples, the limit is very low, 
depending on the number of particles examined. For mostly homogeneous, 
finely divided samples, with no difficult fibrous interferences, the 
detection limit is below 1%. For inhomogeneous samples (most samples), 
the detection limit remains undefined. NIST has conducted proficiency 
testing of laboratories on a national scale. Although each round is 
reported statistically with an average, control limits, etc., the 
results indicate a difficulty in establishing precision especially in 
the low concentration range. It is suspected that there is significant 
bias in the low range especially near 1%. EPA tried to remedy this by 
requiring a mandatory point counting scheme for samples less than 10%. 
The point counting procedure is tedious, and may introduce significant 
biases of its own. It has not been incorporated into this method.
    1.4.2. The precision and accuracy of the quantitation tests 
performed in this method are unknown. Concentrations are easier to 
determine in commercial products where asbestos was deliberately added 
because the amount is usually more than a few percent. An analyst's 
results can be ``calibrated'' against the known amounts added by the 
manufacturer. For geological samples, the degree of homogeneity affects 
the precision.
    1.4.3. The performance of the method is analyst dependent. The 
analyst must choose carefully and not necessarily randomly the portions 
for analysis to assure that detection

[[Page 552]]

of asbestos occurs when it is present. For this reason, the analyst must 
have adequate training in sample preparation, and experience in the 
location and identification of asbestos in samples. This is usually 
accomplished through substantial on-the-job training as well as formal 
education in mineralogy and microscopy.

                           1.5. Interferences

    Any material which is long, thin, and small enough to be viewed 
under the microscope can be considered an interference for asbestos. 
There are literally hundreds of interferences in workplaces. The 
techniques described in this method are normally sufficient to eliminate 
the interferences. An analyst's success in eliminating the interferences 
depends on proper training.
    Asbestos minerals belong to two mineral families: the serpentines 
and the amphiboles. In the serpentine family, the only common fibrous 
mineral is chrysotile. Occasionally, the mineral antigorite occurs in a 
fibril habit with morphology similar to the amphiboles. The amphibole 
minerals consist of a score of different minerals of which only five are 
regulated by federal standard: amosite, crocidolite, anthophyllite 
asbestos, tremolite asbestos and actinolite asbestos. These are the only 
amphibole minerals that have been commercially exploited for their 
fibrous properties; however, the rest can and do occur occasionally in 
asbestiform habit.
    In addition to the related mineral interferences, other minerals 
common in building material may present a problem for some 
microscopists: gypsum, anhydrite, brucite, quartz fibers, talc fibers or 
ribbons, wollastonite, perlite, attapulgite, etc. Other fibrous 
materials commonly present in workplaces are: fiberglass, mineral wool, 
ceramic wool, refractory ceramic fibers, kevlar, nomex, synthetic 
fibers, graphite or carbon fibers, cellulose (paper or wood) fibers, 
metal fibers, etc.
    Matrix embedding material can sometimes be a negative interference. 
The analyst may not be able to easily extract the fibers from the matrix 
in order to use the method. Where possible, remove the matrix before the 
analysis, taking careful note of the loss of weight. Some common matrix 
materials are: vinyl, rubber, tar, paint, plant fiber, cement, and 
epoxy. A further negative interference is that the asbestos fibers 
themselves may be either too small to be seen in Phase contrast 
Microscopy (PCM) or of a very low fibrous quality, having the appearance 
of plant fibers. The analyst's ability to deal with these materials 
increases with experience.

                   1.6. Uses and Occupational Exposure

    Asbestos is ubiquitous in the environment. More than 40% of the land 
area of the United States is composed of minerals which may contain 
asbestos. Fortunately, the actual formation of great amounts of asbestos 
is relatively rare. Nonetheless, there are locations in which 
environmental exposure can be severe such as in the Serpentine Hills of 
California.
    There are thousands of uses for asbestos in industry and the home. 
Asbestos abatement workers are the most current segment of the 
population to have occupational exposure to great amounts of asbestos. 
If the material is undisturbed, there is no exposure. Exposure occurs 
when the asbestos-containing material is abraded or otherwise disturbed 
during maintenance operations or some other activity. Approximately 95% 
of the asbestos in place in the United States is chrysotile.
    Amosite and crocidolite make up nearly all the difference. Tremolite 
and anthophyllite make up a very small percentage. Tremolite is found in 
extremely small amounts in certain chrysotile deposits. Actinolite 
exposure is probably greatest from environmental sources, but has been 
identified in vermiculite containing, sprayed-on insulating materials 
which may have been certified as asbestos-free.

                  1.7. Physical and Chemical Properties

    The nominal chemical compositions for the asbestos minerals were 
given in Section 1. Compared to cleavage fragments of the same minerals, 
asbestiform fibers possess a high tensile strength along the fiber axis. 
They are chemically inert, non-combustible, and heat resistant. Except 
for chrysotile, they are insoluble in Hydrochloric acid (HCl). 
Chrysotile is slightly soluble in HCl. Asbestos has high electrical 
resistance and good sound absorbing characteristics. It can be woven 
into cables, fabrics or other textiles, or matted into papers, felts, 
and mats.

1.8. Toxicology (This Section is for Information Only and Should Not Be 
                          Taken as OSHA Policy)

    Possible physiologic results of respiratory exposure to asbestos are 
mesothelioma of the pleura or peritoneum, interstitial fibrosis, 
asbestosis, pneumoconiosis, or respiratory cancer. The possible 
consequences of asbestos exposure are detailed in the NIOSH Criteria 
Document or in the OSHA Asbestos Standards 29 CFR 1910.1001 and 29 CFR 
1926.1101 and 29 CFR 1915.1001.

                          2. Sampling Procedure

                       2.1. Equipment for sampling

    (a) Tube or cork borer sampling device
    (b) Knife
    (c) 20 mL scintillation vial or similar vial
    (d) Sealing encapsulant

[[Page 553]]

                         2.2. Safety Precautions

    Asbestos is a known carcinogen. Take care when sampling. While in an 
asbestos-containing atmosphere, a properly selected and fit-tested 
respirator should be worn. Take samples in a manner to cause the least 
amount of dust. Follow these general guidelines:
    (a) Do not make unnecessary dust.
    (b) Take only a small amount (1 to 2 g).
    (c) Tightly close the sample container.
    (d) Use encapsulant to seal the spot where the sample was taken, if 
necessary.

                         2.3. Sampling Procedure

    Samples of any suspect material should be taken from an 
inconspicuous place. Where the material is to remain, seal the sampling 
wound with an encapsulant to eliminate the potential for exposure from 
the sample site. Microscopy requires only a few milligrams of material. 
The amount that will fill a 20 mL scintillation vial is more than 
adequate. Be sure to collect samples from all layers and phases of 
material. If possible, make separate samples of each different phase of 
the material. This will aid in determining the actual hazard. DO NOT USE 
ENVELOPES, PLASTIC OR PAPER BAGS OF ANY KIND TO COLLECT SAMPLES. The use 
of plastic bags presents a contamination hazard to laboratory personnel 
and to other samples. When these containers are opened, a bellows effect 
blows fibers out of the container onto everything, including the person 
opening the container.
    If a cork-borer type sampler is available, push the tube through the 
material all the way, so that all layers of material are sampled. Some 
samplers are intended to be disposable. These should be capped and sent 
to the laboratory. If a non-disposable cork borer is used, empty the 
contents into a scintillation vial and send to the laboratory. 
Vigorously and completely clean the cork borer between samples.

                              2.4  Shipment

    Samples packed in glass vials must not touch or they might break in 
shipment.
    (a) Seal the samples with a sample seal over the end to guard 
against tampering and to identify the sample.
    (b) Package the bulk samples in separate packages from the air 
samples. They may cross-contaminate each other and will invalidate the 
results of the air samples.
    (c) Include identifying paperwork with the samples, but not in 
contact with the suspected asbestos.
    (d) To maintain sample accountability, ship the samples by certified 
mail, overnight express, or hand carry them to the laboratory.

                               3. Analysis

    The analysis of asbestos samples can be divided into two major 
parts: sample preparation and microscopy. Because of the different 
asbestos uses that may be encountered by the analyst, each sample may 
need different preparation steps. The choices are outlined below. There 
are several different tests that are performed to identify the asbestos 
species and determine the percentage. They will be explained below.

                               3.1. Safety

    (a) Do not create unnecessary dust. Handle the samples in HEPA-
filter equipped hoods. If samples are received in bags, envelopes or 
other inappropriate container, open them only in a hood having a face 
velocity at or greater than 100 fpm. Transfer a small amount to a 
scintillation vial and only handle the smaller amount.
    (b) Open samples in a hood, never in the open lab area.
    (c) Index of refraction oils can be toxic. Take care not to get this 
material on the skin. Wash immediately with soap and water if this 
happens.
    (d) Samples that have been heated in the muffle furnace or the 
drying oven may be hot. Handle them with tongs until they are cool 
enough to handle.
    (e) Some of the solvents used, such as THF (tetrahydrofuran), are 
toxic and should only be handled in an appropriate fume hood and 
according to instructions given in the Material Safety Data Sheet 
(MSDS).

                       3.3. Sample Pre-Preparation

    Sample preparation begins with pre-preparation which may include 
chemical reduction of the matrix, heating the sample to dryness or 
heating in the muffle furnace. The end result is a sample which has been 
reduced to a powder that is sufficiently fine to fit under the cover 
slip. Analyze different phases of samples separately, e.g., tile and the 
tile mastic should be analyzed separately as the mastic may contain 
asbestos while the tile may not.
    (a) Wet Samples
    Samples with a high water content will not give the proper 
dispersion colors and must be dried prior to sample mounting. Remove the 
lid of the scintillation vial, place the bottle in the drying oven and 
heat at 100 deg.C to dryness (usually about 2 h). Samples which are not 
submitted to the lab in glass must be removed and placed in glass vials 
or aluminum weighing pans before placing them in the drying oven.

          (b) Samples With Organic Interference--Muffle Furnace

    These may include samples with tar as a matrix, vinyl asbestos tile, 
or any other organic that can be reduced by heating. Remove the sample 
from the vial and weigh in a balance to determine the weight of the 
submitted portion. Place the sample in a muffle furnace at 500 deg.C for 
1 to 2 h or until all obvious organic material has been removed. 
Retrieve, cool and weigh again to determine the weight loss on ignition. 
This is necessary to determine the asbestos content of the submitted 
sample, because the analyst will be looking at a reduced sample.

    Note: Heating above 600 deg.C will cause the sample to undergo a 
structural change which, given sufficient time, will convert the 
chrysotile to forsterite. Heating even at lower temperatures for 1 to 2 
h may have a measurable effect on the optical properties of the 
minerals. If the analyst is unsure of what to expect, a sample of 
standard asbestos should be heated to the same temperature for the same 
length of time so that it can be examined for the proper interpretation.

               (c) Samples With Organic Interference--THF

    Vinyl asbestos tile is the most common material treated with this 
solvent, although, substances containing tar will sometimes yield to 
this treatment. Select a portion of the material and then grind it up if 
possible. Weigh the sample and place it in a test tube. Add sufficient 
THF to dissolve the organic matrix. This is usually about 4 to 5 mL. 
Remember, THF is highly flammable. Filter the remaining material through 
a tared silver membrane, dry and weigh to determine how much is left 
after the solvent extraction. Further process the sample to remove 
carbonate or mount directly.

                 (d) Samples With Carbonate Interference

    Carbonate material is often found on fibers and sometimes must be 
removed in order to perform dispersion microscopy. Weigh out a portion 
of the material and place it in a test tube. Add a sufficient amount of 
0.1 M HCl or decalcifying solution in the tube to react all the 
carbonate as evidenced by gas formation; i.e., when the gas bubbles 
stop, add a little more solution. If no more gas forms, the reaction is 
complete. Filter the material out through a tared silver membrane, dry 
and weigh to determine the weight lost.

                         3.4. Sample Preparation

    Samples must be prepared so that accurate determination can be made 
of the asbestos type and amount present. The following steps are carried 
out in the low-flow hood (a low-flow hood has less than 50 fpm flow):
    (1) If the sample has large lumps, is hard, or cannot be made to lie 
under a cover slip, the grain size must be reduced. Place a small amount 
between two slides and grind the material between them or grind a small 
amount in a clean mortar and pestle. The choice of whether to use an 
alumina, ruby, or diamond mortar depends on the hardness of the 
material. Impact damage can alter the asbestos mineral if too much 
mechanical shock occurs. (Freezer mills can completely destroy the 
observable crystallinity of asbestos and should not be used). For some 
samples, a portion of material can be shaved off with a scalpel, ground 
off with a hand grinder or hack saw blade.
    The preparation tools should either be disposable or cleaned 
thoroughly. Use vigorous scrubbing to loosen the fibers during the 
washing. Rinse the implements with copious

[[Page 555]]

amounts of water and air-dry in a dust-free environment.
    (2) If the sample is powder or has been reduced as in (1) above, it 
is ready to mount. Place a glass slide on a piece of optical tissue and 
write the identification on the painted or frosted end. Place two drops 
of index of refraction medium n=1.550 on the slide. (The medium n=1.550 
is chosen because it is the matching index for chrysotile. Dip the end 
of a clean paper-clip or dissecting needle into the droplet of 
refraction medium on the slide to moisten it. Then dip the probe into 
the powder sample. Transfer what sticks on the probe to the slide. The 
material on the end of the probe should have a diameter of about 3 mm 
for a good mount. If the material is very fine, less sample may be 
appropriate. For non-powder samples such as fiber mats, forceps should 
be used to transfer a small amount of material to the slide. Stir the 
material in the medium on the slide, spreading it out and making the 
preparation as uniform as possible. Place a cover-slip on the 
preparation by gently lowering onto the slide and allowing it to fall 
``trapdoor'' fashion on the preparation to push out any bubbles. Press 
gently on the cover slip to even out the distribution of particulate on 
the slide. If there is insufficient mounting oil on the slide, one or 
two drops may be placed near the edge of the coverslip on the slide. 
Capillary action will draw the necessary amount of liquid into the 
preparation. Remove excess oil with the point of a laboratory wiper.
    Treat at least two different areas of each phase in this fashion. 
Choose representative areas of the sample. It may be useful to select 
particular areas or fibers for analysis. This is useful to identify 
asbestos in severely inhomogeneous samples.
    When it is determined that amphiboles may be present, repeat the 
above process using the appropriate high-dispersion oils until an 
identification is made or all six asbestos minerals have been ruled out. 
Note that percent determination must be done in the index medium 1.550 
because amphiboles tend to disappear in their matching mediums.

                        3.5. Analytical procedure

    Note: This method presumes some knowledge of mineralogy and optical 
petrography.

    The analysis consists of three parts: The determination of whether 
there is asbestos present, what type is present and the determination of 
how much is present. The general flow of the analysis is:
    (1) Gross examination.
    (2) Examination under polarized light on the stereo microscope.
    (3) Examination by phase-polar illumination on the compound phase 
microscope.
    (4) Determination of species by dispersion stain. Examination by 
Becke line analysis may also be used; however, this is usually more 
cumbersome for asbestos determination.
    (5) Difficult samples may need to be analyzed by SEM or TEM, or the 
results from those techniques combined with light microscopy for a 
definitive identification.
    Identification of a particle as asbestos requires that it be 
asbestiform. Description of particles should follow the suggestion of 
Campbell. (Figure 1)

    For the purpose of regulation, the mineral must be one of the six 
minerals covered and must be in the asbestos growth habit. Large 
specimen samples of asbestos generally have the gross appearance of 
wood. Fibers are easily parted from it. Asbestos fibers are very long 
compared with their widths. The fibers have a very high tensile strength 
as demonstrated by bending without breaking. Asbestos fibers exist in 
bundles that are easily

[[Page 557]]

parted, show longitudinal fine structure and may be tufted at the ends 
showing ``bundle of sticks'' morphology. In the microscope some of these 
properties may not be observable. Amphiboles do not always show 
striations along their length even when they are asbestos. Neither will 
they always show tufting. They generally do not show a curved nature 
except for very long fibers. Asbestos and asbestiform minerals are 
usually characterized in groups by extremely high aspect ratios (greater 
than 100:1). While aspect ratio analysis is useful for characterizing 
populations of fibers, it cannot be used to identify individual fibers 
of intermediate to short aspect ratio. Observation of many fibers is 
often necessary to determine whether a sample consists of ``cleavage 
fragments'' or of asbestos fibers.
    Most cleavage fragments of the asbestos minerals are easily 
distinguishable from true asbestos fibers. This is because true cleavage 
fragments usually have larger diameters than 1 <greek-m>m. Internal 
structure of particles larger than this usually shows them to have no 
internal fibrillar structure. In addition, cleavage fragments of the 
monoclinic amphiboles show inclined extinction under crossed polars with 
no compensator. Asbestos fibers usually show extinction at zero degrees 
or ambiguous extinction if any at all. Morphologically, the larger 
cleavage fragments are obvious by their blunt or stepped ends showing 
prismatic habit. Also, they tend to be acicular rather than filiform.
    Where the particles are less than 1 <greek-m>m in diameter and have 
an aspect ratio greater than or equal to 3:1, it is recommended that the 
sample be analyzed by SEM or TEM if there is any question whether the 
fibers are cleavage fragments or asbestiform particles.
    Care must be taken when analyzing by electron microscopy because the 
interferences are different from those in light microscopy and may 
structurally be very similar to asbestos. The classic interference is 
between anthophyllite and biopyribole or intermediate fiber. Use the 
same morphological clues for electron microscopy as are used for light 
microscopy, e.g. fibril splitting, internal longitudinal striation, 
fraying, curvature, etc.
    (1) Gross examination:
    Examine the sample, preferably in the glass vial. Determine the 
presence of any obvious fibrous component. Estimate a percentage based 
on previous experience and current observation. Determine whether any 
pre-preparation is necessary. Determine the number of phases present. 
This step may be carried out or augmented by observation at 6 to 40 x  
under a stereo microscope.
    (2) After performing any necessary pre-preparation, prepare slides 
of each phase as described above. Two preparations of the same phase in 
the same index medium can be made side-by-side on the same glass for 
convenience. Examine with the polarizing stereo microscope. Estimate the 
percentage of asbestos based on the amount of birefringent fiber 
present.
    (3) Examine the slides on the phase-polar microscopes at 
magnifications of 160 and 400 x . Note the morphology of the fibers. 
Long, thin, very straight fibers with little curvature are indicative of 
fibers from the amphibole family. Curved, wavy fibers are usually 
indicative of chrysotile. Estimate the percentage of asbestos on the 
phase-polar microscope under conditions of crossed polars and a gypsum 
plate. Fibers smaller than 1.0 <greek-m>m in thickness must be 
identified by inference to the presence of larger, identifiable fibers 
and morphology. If no larger fibers are visible, electron microscopy 
should be performed. At this point, only a tentative identification can 
be made. Full identification must be made with dispersion microscopy. 
Details of the tests are included in the appendices.
    (4) Once fibers have been determined to be present, they must be 
identified. Adjust the microscope for dispersion mode and observe the 
fibers. The microscope has a rotating stage, one polarizing element, and 
a system for generating dark-field dispersion microscopy (see Section 
4.6. of this appendix). Align a fiber with its length parallel to the 
polarizer and note the color of the Becke lines. Rotate the stage to 
bring the fiber length perpendicular to the polarizer and note the 
color. Repeat this process for every fiber or fiber bundle examined. The 
colors must be consistent with the colors generated by standard asbestos 
reference materials for a positive identification. In n=1.550, 
amphiboles will generally show a yellow to straw-yellow color indicating 
that the fiber indices of refraction are higher than the liquid. If 
long, thin fibers are noted and the colors are yellow, prepare further 
slides as above in the suggested matching liquids listed below:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
             Type of asbestos                    Index of refraction    
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chrysotile................................  n=1.550.                    
Amosite...................................  n=1.670 r 1.680.            
Crocidolite...............................  n=1.690.                    
Anthophyllite.............................  n=1.605 nd 1.620.           
Tremolite.................................  n=1.605 and 1.620.          
Actinolite................................  n=1.620.                    
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Where more than one liquid is suggested, the first is preferred; 
however, in some cases this liquid will not give good dispersion color. 
Take care to avoid interferences in the other liquid; e.g., wollastonite 
in n=1.620 will give the same colors as tremolite. In n=1.605 
wollastonite will appear yellow in all directions. Wollastonite may be 
determined under crossed polars as it will change from blue to yellow as 
it is rotated along its fiber axis by tapping on the cover slip. 
Asbestos minerals will not change in this way.

[[Page 558]]

    Determination of the angle of extinction may, when present, aid in 
the determination of anthophyllite from tremolite. True asbestos fibers 
usually have 0 deg. extinction or ambiguous extinction, while cleavage 
fragments have more definite extinction.
    Continue analysis until both preparations have been examined and all 
present species of asbestos are identified. If there are no fibers 
present, or there is less than 0.1% present, end the analysis with the 
minimum number of slides (2).
    (5) Some fibers have a coating on them which makes dispersion 
microscopy very difficult or impossible. Becke line analysis or electron 
microscopy may be performed in those cases. Determine the percentage by 
light microscopy. TEM analysis tends to overestimate the actual 
percentage present.
    (6) Percentage determination is an estimate of occluded area, 
tempered by gross observation. Gross observation information is used to 
make sure that the high magnification microscopy does not greatly over- 
or under- estimate the amount of fiber present. This part of the 
analysis requires a great deal of experience. Satisfactory models for 
asbestos content analysis have not yet been developed, although some 
models based on metallurgical grain-size determination have found some 
utility. Estimation is more easily handled in situations where the grain 
sizes visible at about 160 x  are about the same and the sample is 
relatively homogeneous.
    View all of the area under the cover slip to make the percentage 
determination. View the fields while moving the stage, paying attention 
to the clumps of material. These are not usually the best areas to 
perform dispersion microscopy because of the interference from other 
materials. But, they are the areas most likely to represent the accurate 
percentage in the sample. Small amounts of asbestos require slower 
scanning and more frequent analysis of individual fields.
    Report the area occluded by asbestos as the concentration. This 
estimate does not generally take into consideration the difference in 
density of the different species present in the sample. For most samples 
this is adequate. Simulation studies with similar materials must be 
carried out to apply microvisual estimation for that purpose and is 
beyond the scope of this procedure.
    (7) Where successive concentrations have been made by chemical or 
physical means, the amount reported is the percentage of the material in 
the ``as submitted'' or original state. The percentage determined by 
microscopy is multiplied by the fractions remaining after pre-
preparation steps to give the percentage in the original sample. For 
example:

Step 1. 60% remains after heating at 550  deg.C for 1 h.
Step 2. 30% of the residue of step 1 remains after dissolution of 
          carbonate in 0.1 m HCl.
Step 3. Microvisual estimation determines that 5% of the sample is 
          chrysotile asbestos.

    The reported result is:

R=(Microvisual result in percent)  x  (Fraction remaining after step 2) 
          x  (Fraction remaining of original sample after step 1)
R=(5) x (.30) x (.60)=0.9%

    (8) Report the percent and type of asbestos present. For samples 
where asbestos was identified, but is less than 1.0%, report ``Asbestos 
present, less than 1.0%.'' There must have been at least two observed 
fibers or fiber bundles in the two preparations to be reported as 
present. For samples where asbestos was not seen, report as ``None 
Detected.''

                          Auxiliary Information

    Because of the subjective nature of asbestos analysis, certain 
concepts and procedures need to be discussed in more depth. This 
information will help the analyst understand why some of the procedures 
are carried out the way they are.

                               4.1. Light

    Light is electromagnetic energy. It travels from its source in 
packets called quanta. It is instructive to consider light as a plane 
wave. The light has a direction of travel. Perpendicular to this and 
mutually perpendicular to each other, are two vector components. One is 
the magnetic vector and the other is the electric vector. We shall only 
be concerned with the electric vector. In this description, the 
interaction of the vector and the mineral will describe all the 
observable phenomena. From a light source such a microscope illuminator, 
light travels in all different direction from the filament.
    In any given direction away from the filament, the electric vector 
is perpendicular to the direction of travel of a light ray. While 
perpendicular, its orientation is random about the travel axis. If the 
electric vectors from all the light rays were lined up by passing the 
light through a filter that would only let light rays with electric 
vectors oriented in one direction pass, the light would then be 
POLARIZED.
    Polarized light interacts with matter in the direction of the 
electric vector. This is the polarization direction. Using this property 
it is possible to use polarized light to probe different materials and 
identify them by how they interact with light.
    The speed of light in a vacuum is a constant at about 
2.99 x 10<SUP>8</SUP> m/s. When light travels in different materials 
such as air, water, minerals or oil, it does not travel at this speed. 
It travels slower. This slowing is a function of both the material 
through which

[[Page 559]]

the light is traveling and the wavelength or frequency of the light. In 
general, the more dense the material, the slower the light travels. 
Also, generally, the higher the frequency, the slower the light will 
travel. The ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to that in a 
material is called the index of refraction (n). It is usually measured 
at 589 nm (the sodium D line). If white light (light containing all the 
visible wavelengths) travels through a material, rays of longer 
wavelengths will travel faster than those of shorter wavelengths, this 
separation is called dispersion. Dispersion is used as an identifier of 
materials as described in Section 4.6.

                        4.2. Material Properties

    Materials are either amorphous or crystalline. The difference 
between these two descriptions depends on the positions of the atoms in 
them. The atoms in amorphous materials are randomly arranged with no 
long range order. An example of an amorphous material is glass. The 
atoms in crystalline materials, on the other hand, are in regular arrays 
and have long range order. Most of the atoms can be found in highly 
predictable locations. Examples of crystalline material are salt, gold, 
and the asbestos minerals.
    It is beyond the scope of this method to describe the different 
types of crystalline materials that can be found, or the full 
description of the classes into which they can fall. However, some 
general crystallography is provided below to give a foundation to the 
procedures described.
    With the exception of anthophyllite, all the asbestos minerals 
belong to the monoclinic crystal type. The unit cell is the basic 
repeating unit of the crystal and for monoclinic crystals can be 
described as having three unequal sides, two 90 deg. angles and one 
angle not equal to 90 deg.. The orthorhombic group, of which 
anthophyllite is a member has three unequal sides and three 90 deg. 
angles. The unequal sides are a consequence of the complexity of fitting 
the different atoms into the unit cell. Although the atoms are in a 
regular array, that array is not symmetrical in all directions. There is 
long range order in the three major directions of the crystal. However, 
the order is different in each of the three directions. This has the 
effect that the index of refraction is different in each of the three 
directions. Using polarized light, we can investigate the index of 
refraction in each of the directions and identify the mineral or 
material under investigation. The indices <greek-a>, <greek-b>, and 
<greek-g> are used to identify the lowest, middle, and highest index of 
refraction respectively. The x direction, associated with <greek-a> is 
called the fast axis. Conversely, the z direction is associated with 
<greek-g> and is the slow direction. Crocidolite has <greek-a> along the 
fiber length making it ``length-fast''. The remainder of the asbestos 
minerals have the <greek-g> axis along the fiber length. They are called 
``length-slow''. This orientation to fiber length is used to aid in the 
identification of asbestos.

                     4.3. Polarized Light Technique

    Polarized light microscopy as described in this section uses the 
phase-polar microscope described in Section 3.2. A phase contrast 
microscope is fitted with two polarizing elements, one below and one 
above the sample. The polarizers have their polarization directions at 
right angles to each other. Depending on the tests performed, there may 
be a compensator between these two polarizing elements. A compensator is 
a piece of mineral with known properties that ``compensates'' for some 
deficiency in the optical train. Light emerging from a polarizing 
element has its electric vector pointing in the polarization direction 
of the element. The light will not be subsequently transmitted through a 
second element set at a right angle to the first element. Unless the 
light is altered as it passes from one element to the other, there is no 
transmission of light.

                        4.4. Angle of Extinction

    Crystals which have different crystal regularity in two or three 
main directions are said to be anisotropic. They have a different index 
of refraction in each of the main directions. When such a crystal is 
inserted between the crossed polars, the field of view is no longer dark 
but shows the crystal in color. The color depends on the properties of 
the crystal. The light acts as if it travels through the crystal along 
the optical axes. If a crystal optical axis were lined up along one of 
the polarizing directions (either the polarizer or the analyzer) the 
light would appear to travel only in that direction, and it would blink 
out or go dark. The difference in degrees between the fiber direction 
and the angle at which it blinks out is called the angle of extinction. 
When this angle can be measured, it is useful in identifying the 
mineral. The procedure for measuring the angle of extinction is to first 
identify the polarization direction in the microscope. A commercial 
alignment slide can be used to establish the polarization directions or 
use anthophyllite or another suitable mineral. This mineral has a zero 
degree angle of extinction and will go dark to extinction as it aligns 
with the polarization directions. When a fiber of anthophyllite has gone 
to extinction, align the eyepiece reticle or graticule with the fiber so 
that there is a visual cue as to the direction of polarization in the 
field of view. Tape or otherwise secure the eyepiece in this position so 
it will not shift.
    After the polarization direction has been identified in the field of 
view, move the particle of interest to the center of the field of

[[Page 560]]

view and align it with the polarization direction. For fibers, align the 
fiber along this direction. Note the angular reading of the rotating 
stage. Looking at the particle, rotate the stage until the fiber goes 
dark or ``blinks out''. Again note the reading of the stage. The 
difference in the first reading and the second is an angle of 
extinction.
    The angle measured may vary as the orientation of the fiber changes 
about its long axis. Tables of mineralogical data usually report the 
maximum angle of extinction. Asbestos forming minerals, when they 
exhibit an angle of extinction, usually do show an angle of extinction 
close to the reported maximum, or as appropriate depending on the 
substitution chemistry.

                  4.5. Crossed Polars with Compensator

    When the optical axes of a crystal are not lined up along one of the 
polarizing directions (either the polarizer or the analyzer) part of the 
light travels along one axis and part travels along the other visible 
axis. This is characteristic of birefringent materials.
    The color depends on the difference of the two visible indices of 
refraction and the thickness of the crystal. The maximum difference 
available is the difference between the <greek-a> and the <greek-g> 
axes. This maximum difference is usually tabulated as the birefringence 
of the crystal.
    For this test, align the fiber at 45 deg. to the polarization 
directions in order to maximize the contribution to each of the optical 
axes. The colors seen are called retardation colors. They arise from the 
recombination of light which has traveled through the two separate 
directions of the crystal. One of the rays is retarded behind the other 
since the light in that direction travels slower. On recombination, some 
of the colors which make up white light are enhanced by constructive 
interference and some are suppressed by destructive interference. The 
result is a color dependent on the difference between the indices and 
the thickness of the crystal. The proper colors, thicknesses, and 
retardations are shown on a Michel-Levy chart. The three items, 
retardation, thickness and birefringence are related by the following 
relationship:
R=t(n<greek-g>-n<greek-a>)
R=retardation, t=crystal thickness in <greek-m> m, and
n<greek-a>,<greek-g>=indices of refraction.
    Examination of the equation for asbestos minerals reveals that the 
visible colors for almost all common asbestos minerals and fiber sizes 
are shades of gray and black. The eye is relatively poor at 
discriminating different shades of gray. It is very good at 
discriminating different colors. In order to compensate for the low 
retardation, a compensator is added to the light train between the 
polarization elements. The compensator used for this test is a gypsum 
plate of known thickness and birefringence. Such a compensator when 
oriented at 45 deg. to the polarizer direction, provides a retardation 
of 530 nm of the 530 nm wavelength color. This enhances the red color 
and gives the background a characteristic red to red-magenta color. If 
this ``full-wave'' compensator is in place when the asbestos preparation 
is inserted into the light train, the colors seen on the fibers are 
quite different. Gypsum, like asbestos has a fast axis and a slow axis. 
When a fiber is aligned with its fast axis in the same direction as the 
fast axis of the gypsum plate, the ray vibrating in the slow direction 
is retarded by both the asbestos and the gypsum. This results in a 
higher retardation than would be present for either of the two minerals. 
The color seen is a second order blue. When the fiber is rotated 90 deg. 
using the rotating stage, the slow direction of the fiber is now aligned 
with the fast direction of the gypsum and the fast direction of the 
fiber is aligned with the slow direction of the gypsum. Thus, one ray 
vibrates faster in the fast direction of the gypsum, and slower in the 
slow direction of the fiber; the other ray will vibrate slower in the 
slow direction of the gypsum and faster in the fast direction of the 
fiber. In this case, the effect is subtractive and the color seen is a 
first order yellow. As long as the fiber thickness does not add 
appreciably to the color, the same basic colors will be seen for all 
asbestos types except crocidolite. In crocidolite the colors will be 
weaker, may be in the opposite directions, and will be altered by the 
blue absorption color natural to crocidolite. Hundreds of other 
materials will give the same colors as asbestos, and therefore, this 
test is not definitive for asbestos. The test is useful in 
discriminating against fiberglass or other amorphous fibers such as some 
synthetic fibers. Certain synthetic fibers will show retardation colors 
different than asbestos; however, there are some forms of polyethylene 
and aramid which will show morphology and retardation colors similar to 
asbestos minerals. This test must be supplemented with a positive 
identification test when birefringent fibers are present which can not 
be excluded by morphology. This test is relatively ineffective for use 
on fibers less than 1 <greek-m> m in diameter. For positive confirmation 
TEM or SEM should be used if no larger bundles or fibers are visible.

                        4.6. Dispersion Staining

    Dispersion microscopy or dispersion staining is the method of choice 
for the identification of asbestos in bulk materials. Becke line 
analysis is used by some laboratories and yields the same results as 
does dispersion staining for asbestos and can be used in lieu of 
dispersion staining. Dispersion staining is performed on the same 
platform as the phase-polar analysis with the analyzer and

[[Page 561]]

compensator removed. One polarizing element remains to define the 
direction of the light so that the different indices of refraction of 
the fibers may be separately determined. Dispersion microscopy is a 
dark-field technique when used for asbestos. Particles are imaged with 
scattered light. Light which is unscattered is blocked from reaching the 
eye either by the back field image mask in a McCrone objective or a back 
field image mask in the phase condenser. The most convenient method is 
to use the rotating phase condenser to move an oversized phase ring into 
place. The ideal size for this ring is for the central disk to be just 
larger than the objective entry aperture as viewed in the back focal 
plane. The larger the disk, the less scattered light reaches the eye. 
This will have the effect of diminishing the intensity of dispersion 
color and will shift the actual color seen. The colors seen vary even on 
microscopes from the same manufacturer. This is due to the different 
bands of wavelength exclusion by different mask sizes. The mask may 
either reside in the condenser or in the objective back focal plane. It 
is imperative that the analyst determine by experimentation with 
asbestos standards what the appropriate colors should be for each 
asbestos type. The colors depend also on the temperature of the 
preparation and the exact chemistry of the asbestos. Therefore, some 
slight differences from the standards should be allowed. This is not a 
serious problem for commercial asbestos uses. This technique is used for 
identification of the indices of refraction for fibers by recognition of 
color. There is no direct numerical readout of the index of refraction. 
Correlation of color to actual index of refraction is possible by 
referral to published conversion tables. This is not necessary for the 
analysis of asbestos. Recognition of appropriate colors along with the 
proper morphology are deemed sufficient to identify the commercial 
asbestos minerals. Other techniques including SEM, TEM, and XRD may be 
required to provide additional information in order to identify other 
types of asbestos.
    Make a preparation in the suspected matching high dispersion oil, 
e.g., n=1.550 for chrysotile. Perform the preliminary tests to determine 
whether the fibers are birefringent or not. Take note of the 
morphological character. Wavy fibers are indicative of chrysotile while 
long, straight, thin, frayed fibers are indicative of amphibole 
asbestos. This can aid in the selection of the appropriate matching oil. 
The microscope is set up and the polarization direction is noted as in 
Section 4.4. Align a fiber with the polarization direction. Note the 
color. This is the color parallel to the polarizer. Then rotate the 
fiber rotating the stage 90 deg. so that the polarization direction is 
across the fiber. This is the perpendicular position. Again note the 
color. Both colors must be consistent with standard asbestos minerals in 
the correct direction for a positive identification of asbestos. If only 
one of the colors is correct while the other is not, the identification 
is not positive. If the colors in both directions are bluish-white, the 
analyst has chosen a matching index oil which is higher than the correct 
matching oil, e.g. the analyst has used n=1.620 where chrysotile is 
present. The next lower oil (Section 3.5.) should be used to prepare 
another specimen. If the color in both directions is yellow-white to 
straw-yellow-white, this indicates that the index of the oil is lower 
than the index of the fiber, e.g. the preparation is in n=1.550 while 
anthophyllite is present. Select the next higher oil (Section 3.5.) and 
prepare another slide. Continue in this fashion until a positive 
identification of all asbestos species present has been made or all 
possible asbestos species have been ruled out by negative results in 
this test. Certain plant fibers can have similar dispersion colors as 
asbestos. Take care to note and evaluate the morphology of the fibers or 
remove the plant fibers in pre-preparation. Coating material on the 
fibers such as carbonate or vinyl may destroy the dispersion color. 
Usually, there will be some outcropping of fiber which will show the 
colors sufficient for identification. When this is not the case, treat 
the sample as described in Section 3.3. and then perform dispersion 
staining. Some samples will yield to Becke line analysis if they are 
coated or electron microscopy can be used for identification.

Sec. 1926.1127  Cadmium.

    (a) Scope. This standard applies to all occupational exposures to 
cadmium and cadmium compounds, in all forms, in all construction work 
where an employee may potentially be exposed to cadmium. Construction 
work is defined as work involving construction, alteration and/or 
repair, including but not limited to the following:
    (1) Wrecking, demolition or salvage of structures where cadmium or 
materials containing cadmium are present;
    (2) Use of cadmium containing-paints and cutting, brazing, burning, 
grinding or welding on surfaces that were painted with cadmium-
containing paints;
    (3) Construction, alteration, repair, maintenance, or renovation of 
structures, substrates, or portions thereof, that contain cadmium, or 
materials containing cadmium;
    (4) Cadmium welding; cutting and welding cadmium-plated steel; 
brazing or welding with cadmium alloys;
    (5) Installation of products containing cadmium;
    (6) Electrical grounding with cadmium welding, or electrical work 
using cadmium-coated conduit;
    (7) Maintaining or retrofitting cadmium-coated equipment;
    (8) Cadmium contamination/emergency cleanup; and
    (9) Transportation, disposal, storage, or containment of cadmium or 
materials containing cadmium on the site or location at which 
construction activities are performed.
    (b) Definitions.
    Action level (AL) is defined as an airborne concentration of cadmium 
of 2.5 micrograms per cubic meter of air (2.5 <greek-m> g/
m<SUP>3</SUP>), calculated as an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA).

[[Page 564]]

    Assistant Secretary means the Assistant Secretary of Labor for 
Occupational Safety and Health, U.S. Department of Labor, or designee.
    Authorized person means any person authorized by the employer and 
required by work duties to be present in regulated areas or any person 
authorized by the OSH Act or regulations issued under it to be in 
regulated areas.
    Competent person, in accordance with 29 CFR 1926.32(f), means a 
person designated by the employer to act on the employer's behalf who is 
capable of identifying existing and potential cadmium hazards in the 
workplace and the proper methods to control them in order to protect 
workers, and has the authority necessary to take prompt corrective 
measures to eliminate or control such hazards. The duties of a competent 
person include at least the following: Determining prior to the 
performance of work whether cadmium is present in the workplace; 
establishing, where necessary, regulated areas and assuring that access 
to and from those areas is limited to authorized employees; assuring the 
adequacy of any employee exposure monitoring required by this standard; 
assuring that all employees exposed to air cadmium levels above the PEL 
wear appropriate personal protective equipment and are trained in the 
use of appropriate methods of exposure control; assuring that proper 
hygiene facilities are provided and that workers are trained to use 
those facilities; and assuring that the engineering controls required by 
this standard are implemented, maintained in proper operating condition, 
and functioning properly.
    Director means the Director of the National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services, or designee.
    Employee exposure and similar language referring to the air cadmium 
level to which an employee is exposed means the exposure to airborne 
cadmium that would occur if the employee were not using respiratory 
protective equipment.
    Final medical determination is the written medical opinion of the 
employee's health status by the examining physician under paragraphs 
(l)(3)-(12) of this section or, if multiple physician review under 
paragraph (l)(13) of this section or the alternative physician 
determination under paragraph (l)(14) of this section is invoked, it is 
the final, written medical finding, recommendation or determination that 
emerges from that process.
    High-efficiency Particulate Air [HEPA] filter means a filter capable 
of trapping and retaining at least 99.97 percent of mono-dispersed 
particles of 0.3 micrometers in diameter.
    Regulated area means an area demarcated by the employer where an 
employee's exposure to airborne concentrations of cadmium exceeds, or 
can reasonably be expected to exceed the permissible exposure limit 
(PEL).
    This section means this cadmium standard.
    (c) Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL). The employer shall assure that 
no employee is exposed to an airborne concentration of cadmium in excess 
of five micrograms per cubic meter of air (5 <greek-m> g/m\3\), 
calculated as an eight-hour time-weighted average exposure (TWA).
    (d) Exposure Monitoring--(1) General. (i) Prior to the performance 
of any construction work where employees may be potentially exposed to 
cadmium, the employer shall establish the applicability of this standard 
by determining whether cadmium is present in the workplace and whether 
there is the possibility that employee exposures will be at or above the 
action level. The employer shall designate a competent person who shall 
make this determination. Investigation and material testing techniques 
shall be used, as appropriate, in the determination. Investigation shall 
include a review of relevant plans, past reports, material safety data 
sheets, and other available records, and consultations with the property 
owner and discussions with appropriate individuals and agencies.
    (ii) Where cadmium has been determined to be present in the 
workplace, and it has been determined that there is a possibility the 
employee's exposure will be at or above the action level, the competent 
person shall identify employees potentially exposed to cadmium at or 
above the action level.

[[Page 565]]

    (iii) Determinations of employee exposure shall be made from 
breathing-zone air samples that reflect the monitored employee's 
regular, daily 8-hour TWA exposure to cadmium.
    (iv) Eight-hour TWA exposures shall be determined for each employee 
on the basis of one or more personal breathing-zone air samples 
reflecting full shift exposure on each shift, for each job 
classification, in each work area. Where several employees perform the 
same job tasks, in the same job classification, on the same shift, in 
the same work area, and the length, duration, and level of cadmium 
exposures are similar, an employer may sample a representative fraction 
of the employees instead of all employees in order to meet this 
requirement. In representative sampling, the employer shall sample the 
employee(s) expected to have the highest cadmium exposures.
    (2) Specific. (i) Initial monitoring. Except as provided for in 
paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, where a determination conducted 
under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section shows the possibility of 
employee exposure to cadmium at or above the action level, the employer 
shall conduct exposure monitoring as soon as practicable that is 
representative of the exposure for each employee in the workplace who is 
or may be exposed to cadmium at or above the action level.
    (ii) In addition, if the employee periodically performs tasks that 
may expose the employee to a higher concentration of airborne cadmium, 
the employee shall be monitored while performing those tasks.
    (iii) Where the employer has objective data, as defined in paragraph 
(n)(2) of this section, demonstrating that employee exposure to cadmium 
will not exceed airborne concentrations at or above the action level 
under the expected conditions of processing, use, or handling, the 
employer may rely upon such data instead of implementing initial 
monitoring.
    (iv) Where a determination conducted under paragraphs (d)(1) or 
(d)(2) of this section is made that a potentially exposed employee is 
not exposed to airborne concentrations of cadmium at or above the action 
level, the employer shall make a written record of such determination. 
The record shall include at least the monitoring data developed under 
paragraphs (d)(2)(i)-(iii) of this section, where applicable, and shall 
also include the date of determination, and the name and social security 
number of each employee.
    (3) Monitoring frequency (periodic monitoring). (i) If the initial 
monitoring or periodic monitoring reveals employee exposures to be at or 
above the action level, the employer shall monitor at a frequency and 
pattern needed to assure that the monitoring results reflect with 
reasonable accuracy the employee's typical exposure levels, given the 
variability in the tasks performed, work practices, and environmental 
conditions on the job site, and to assure the adequacy of respiratory 
selection and the effectiveness of engineering and work practice 
controls.
    (ii) If the initial monitoring or the periodic monitoring indicates 
that employee exposures are below the action level and that result is 
confirmed by the results of another monitoring taken at least seven days 
later, the employer may discontinue the monitoring for those employees 
whose exposures are represented by such monitoring.
    (4) Additional monitoring. The employer also shall institute the 
exposure monitoring required under paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (d)(3) of 
this section whenever there has been a change in the raw materials, 
equipment, personnel, work practices, or finished products that may 
result in additional employees being exposed to cadmium at or above the 
action level or in employees already exposed to cadmium at or above the 
action level being exposed above the PEL, or whenever the employer or 
competent person has any reason to suspect that any other change might 
result in such further exposure.
    (5) Employee notification of monitoring results. (i) No later than 
five working days after the receipt of the results of any monitoring 
performed under this section, the employer shall notify each affected 
employee individually in writing of the results. In addition, within the 
same time period, the employer shall post the results of the exposure 
monitoring in an appropriate location that is accessible to all affected 
employees.

[[Page 566]]

    (ii) Wherever monitoring results indicate that employee exposure 
exceeds the PEL, the employer shall include in the written notice a 
statement that the PEL has been exceeded and a description of the 
corrective action being taken by the employer to reduce employee 
exposure to or below the PEL.
    (6) Accuracy of measurement. The employer shall use a method of 
monitoring and analysis that has an accuracy of not less than plus or 
minus 25 percent (<plus-minus> 25%), with a confidence level of 95 
percent, for airborne concentrations of cadmium at or above the action 
level and the permissible exposure limit.
    (e) Regulated areas--(1) Establishment. The employer shall establish 
a regulated area wherever an employee's exposure to airborne 
concentrations of cadmium is, or can reasonably be expected to be in 
excess of the permissible exposure limit (PEL).
    (2) Demarcation. Regulated areas shall be demarcated from the rest 
of the workplace in any manner that adequately establishes and alerts 
employees of the boundaries of the regulated area, including employees 
who are or may be incidentally in the regulated areas, and that protects 
persons outside the area from exposure to airborne concentrations of 
cadmium in excess of the PEL.
    (3) Access. Access to regulated areas shall be limited to authorized 
persons.
    (4) Provision of respirators. Each person entering a regulated area 
shall be supplied with and required to use a respirator, selected in 
accordance with paragraph (g)(2) of this section.
    (5) Prohibited activities. The employer shall assure that employees 
do not eat, drink, smoke, chew tobacco or gum, or apply cosmetics in 
regulated areas, or carry the products associated with any of these 
activities into regulated areas or store such products in those areas.
    (f) Methods of compliance--(1) Compliance hierarchy. (i) Except as 
specified in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, the employer shall 
implement engineering and work practice controls to reduce and maintain 
employee exposure to cadmium at or below the PEL, except to the extent 
that the employer can demonstrate that such controls are not feasible.
    (ii) The requirement to implement engineering controls to achieve 
the PEL does not apply where the employer demonstrates the following:
    (A) The employee is only intermittently exposed; and
    (B) The employee is not exposed above the PEL on 30 or more days per 
year (12 consecutive months).
    (iii) Wherever engineering and work practice controls are not 
sufficient to reduce employee exposure to or below the PEL, the employer 
nonetheless shall implement such controls to reduce exposures to the 
lowest levels achievable. The employer shall supplement such controls 
with respiratory protection that complies with the requirements of 
paragraph (g) of this section and the PEL.
    (iv) The employer shall not use employee rotation as a method of 
compliance.
    (2) Specific operations--(i) Abrasive blasting. Abrasive blasting on 
cadmium or cadmium-containing materials shall be conducted in a manner 
that will provide adequate protection.
    (ii) Heating cadmium and cadmium-containing materials. Welding, 
cutting, and other forms of heating of cadmium or cadmium-containing 
materials shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements of 29 
CFR 1926.353 and 29 CFR 1926.354, where applicable.
    (3) Prohibitions. (i) High speed abrasive disc saws and similar 
abrasive power equipment shall not be used for work on cadmium or 
cadmium-containing materials unless they are equipped with appropriate 
engineering controls to minimize emissions, if the exposure levels are 
above the PEL.
    (ii) Materials containing cadmium shall not be applied by spray 
methods, if exposures are above the PEL, unless employees are protected 
with supplied-air respirators with full facepiece, hood, helmet, suit, 
operated in positive pressure mode and measures are instituted to limit 
overspray and prevent contamination of adjacent areas.
    (4) Mechanical ventilation. (i) When ventilation is used to control 
exposure, measurements that demonstrate the effectiveness of the system 
in controlling exposure, such as capture velocity, duct velocity, or 
static pressure shall

[[Page 567]]

be made as necessary to maintain its effectiveness.
    (ii) Measurements of the system's effectiveness in controlling 
exposure shall be made as necessary within five working days of any 
change in production, process, or control that might result in a 
significant increase in employee exposure to cadmium.
    (iii) Recirculation of air. If air from exhaust ventilation is 
recirculated into the workplace, the system shall have a high efficiency 
filter and be monitored to assure effectiveness.
    (iv) Procedures shall be developed and implemented to minimize 
employee exposure to cadmium when maintenance of ventilation systems and 
changing of filters is being conducted.
    (5) Compliance program. (i) Where employee exposure to cadmium 
exceeds the PEL and the employer is required under paragraph (f)(1) of 
this section to implement controls to comply with the PEL, prior to the 
commencement of the job the employer shall establish and implement a 
written compliance program to reduce employee exposure to or below the 
PEL. To the extent that engineering and work practice controls cannot 
reduce exposures to or below the PEL, the employer shall include in the 
written compliance program the use of appropriate respiratory protection 
to achieve compliance with the PEL.
    (ii) Written compliance programs shall be reviewed and updated as 
often and as promptly as necessary to reflect significant changes in the 
employer's compliance status or significant changes in the lowest air 
cadmium level that is technologically feasible.
    (iii) A competent person shall review the comprehensive compliance 
program initially and after each change.
    (iv) Written compliance programs shall be provided upon request for 
examination and copying to the Assistant Secretary, the Director, 
affected employees, and designated employee representatives.
    (g) Respirator protection. (1) General. For employees who use 
respirators required by this section, the employer must provide 
respirators that comply with the requirements of this paragraph. 
Respirators must be used during:
    (i) Periods necessary to install or implement feasible engineering 
and work-practice controls when employee exposures exceed the PEL.
    (ii) Maintenance and repair activities, and brief or intermittent 
work operations, for which employee exposures exceed the PEL and 
engineering and work-practice controls are not feasible or are not 
required.
    (iii) Work operations in the regulated areas specified in paragraph 
(e) of this section.
    (iv) Work operations for which the employer has implemented all 
feasible engineering and work-practice controls, and such controls are 
not sufficient to reduce employee exposures to or below the PEL.
    (v) Work operations for which an employee, who is exposed to cadmium 
at or above the action level, requests a respirator.
    (vi) Work operations for which engineering controls are not required 
by paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section to reduce employee exposures 
that exceed the PEL.
    (vii) Emergencies.
    (2) Respirator program. (i) The employer must implement a 
respiratory protection program in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.134 (b) 
through (d) (except (d)(1)(iii)), and (f) through (m).
    (ii) If an employee exhibits breathing difficulty during fit testing 
or respirator use, the employer must provide the employee with a medical 
examination in accordance with paragraph (l)(6)(ii) of this section to 
determine if the employee can use a respirator while performing the 
required duties.
    (iii) No employee must use a respirator when, based on their most 
recent medical examination, the examining physician determines that the 
employee will be unable to continue to function normally while using a 
respirator. If the physician determines the employee must be limited in, 
or removed from, their current job because of the employee's inability 
to use a respirator, the job limitation or removal must be conducted in 
accordance with paragraphs (l) (11) and (12) of this section.

[[Page 568]]

    (3) Respirator selection. (i) The employer must select the

lunchroom facility is exposed at any time to cadmium at or above a 
concentration of 2.5 <greek-m>g/m<SUP>3</SUP>.
    (ii) The employer shall assure that employees do not enter lunchroom 
facilities with protective work clothing or equipment unless surface 
cadmium has been removed from the clothing and equipment by HEPA 
vacuuming or some other method that removes cadmium dust without 
dispersing it.
    (k) Housekeeping. (1) All surfaces shall be maintained as free as 
practicable of accumulations of cadmium.
    (2) All spills and sudden releases of material containing cadmium 
shall be cleaned up as soon as possible.
    (3) Surfaces contaminated with cadmium shall, wherever possible, be 
cleaned by vacuuming or other methods that minimize the likelihood of 
cadmium becoming airborne.

[[Page 570]]

    (4) HEPA-filtered vacuuming equipment or equally effective 
filtration methods shall be used for vacuuming. The equipment shall be 
used and emptied in a manner that minimizes the reentry of cadmium into 
the workplace.
    (5) Shoveling, dry or wet sweeping, and brushing may be used only 
where vacuuming or other methods that minimize the likelihood of cadmium 
becoming airborne have been tried and found not to be effective.
    (6) Compressed air shall not be used to remove cadmium from any 
surface unless the compressed air is used in conjunction with a 
ventilation system designed to capture the dust cloud created by the 
compressed air.
    (7) Waste, scrap, debris, bags, containers, personal protective 
equipment, and clothing contaminated with cadmium and consigned for 
disposal shall be collected and disposed of in sealed impermeable bags 
or other closed, impermeable containers. These bags and containers shall 
be labeled in accordance with paragraph (m)(2) of this section.
    (l) Medical Surveillance--(1) General--(i) Scope--(A) Currently 
exposed--The employer shall institute a medical surveillance program for 
all employees who are or may be exposed at or above the action level and 
all employees who perform the following tasks, operations or jobs: 
Electrical grounding with cadmium welding; cutting, brazing, burning, 
grinding or welding on surfaces that were painted with cadmium-

concentrations of cadmium at or above the action level on 30 or more 
days per year (twelve consecutive months); and,
    (2) Is not currently exposed by the employer in those tasks on 30 or 
more days per year (twelve consecutive months).
    (B) Previously exposed-- The employer shall also institute a medical 
surveillance program for all employees who might previously have been 
exposed to cadmium by the employer prior to the effective date of this 
standard in tasks specified under paragraph (l)(1)(i)(A) of this 
section, unless the employer demonstrates that the employee did not in 
the years prior to the effective date of this section work in those 
tasks for the employer with exposure to cadmium for an aggregated total 
of more than 12 months.
    (ii) To determine an employee's fitness for using a respirator, the 
employer shall provide the limited medical examination specified in 
paragraph (l)(6) of this section.
    (iii) The employer shall assure that all medical examinations and 
procedures required by this section are performed by or under the 
supervision of a licensed physician, who has read and is familiar with 
the health effects section of appendix A to this section, the regulatory 
text of this section, the protocol for sample handling and lab selection 
in appendix F to this section, and the questionnaire of appendix D to 
this section.
    (iv) The employer shall provide the medical surveillance required by 
this section, including multiple physician review under paragraph 
(l)(13) of this section without cost to employees, and at a time and 
place that is reasonable and convenient to employees.
    (v) The employer shall assure that the collecting and handling of 
biological samples of cadmium in urine (CdU), cadmium in blood (CdB), 
and beta-2 microglobulin in urine (<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M) taken from 
employees under this section is done in a manner that assures their 
reliability and that analysis of biological samples of cadmium in urine 
(CdU), cadmium in blood (CdB), and beta-2 microglobulin in urine 
(<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M) taken from employees under this section is 
performed in laboratories with demonstrated proficiency to perform the 
particular analysis. (See appendix F to this section.)

    (2) Initial Examination. (i) For employees covered by medical 
surveillance under paragraph (l)(1)(i) of this section, the employer 
shall provide an initial medical examination. The examination shall be 
provided to those employees within 30 days after initial assignment to a 
job with exposure to cadmium or no later than 90 days after the 
effective date of this section, whichever date is later.
    (ii) The initial medical examination shall include:
    (A) A detailed medical and work history, with emphasis on: Past, 
present, and anticipated future exposure to cadmium; any history of 
renal, cardiovascular, respiratory, hematopoietic, reproductive, and/or 
musculo-skeletal system dysfunction; current usage of medication with 
potential nephrotoxic side-effects; and smoking history and current 
status; and
    (B) Biological monitoring that includes the following tests:
    (1) Cadmium in urine (CdU), standardized to grams of creatinine (g/
Cr);
    (2) Beta-2 microglobulin in urine (<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M), 
standardized to grams of creatinine (g/Cr), with pH specified, as 
described in Appendix F to this section; and
    (3) Cadmium in blood (CdB), standardized to liters of whole blood 
(lwb).
    (iii) Recent Examination: An initial examination is not required to 
be provided if adequate records show that the employee has been examined 
in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (l)(2)(ii) of this 
section within the past 12 months. In that case, such records shall be 
maintained as part of the employee's medical record and the prior exam 
shall be treated as if it were an initial examination for the purposes 
of paragraphs (l)(3) and (4) of this section.
    (3) Actions triggered by initial biological monitoring. (i) If the 
results of the biological monitoring tests in the initial examination 
show the employee's CdU level to be at or below 3<greek-m>g/g Cr, 
<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M level to be at or below 300<greek-m>g/g Cr and 
CdB level to be at or below 5<greek-m>g/lwb, then:
    (A) For employees who are subject to medical surveillance under 
paragraphs (l)(1)(i)(A) of this section because of current or 
anticipated exposure to cadmium, the employer shall provide the minimum 
level of periodic medical surveillance in accordance with the 
requirements in paragraph (l)(4)(i) of this section; and
    (B) For employees who are subject to medical surveillance under 
paragraph (l)(1)(i)(B) of this section because of prior but not current 
exposure, the employer shall provide biological monitoring for CdU, 
B<INF>2</INF>-M, and CdB one year after the initial biological 
monitoring and then the employer shall comply with the requirements of 
paragraph (l)(4)(vi) of this section.
    (ii) For all employees who are subject to medical surveillance under 
paragraph (l)(1)(i) of this section, if the results of the initial 
biological monitoring tests show the level of CdU to exceed 3 <greek-m> 
g/g Cr, the level of <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M to be in excess of 300 
<greek-m> g/g Cr, or the level of CdB to be in excess of 5 <greek-m> g/
lwb, the employer shall:
    (A) Within two weeks after receipt of biological monitoring results, 
reassess the employee's occupational exposure to cadmium as follows:
    (1) Reassess the employee's work practices and personal hygiene;
    (2) Reevaluate the employee's respirator use, if any, and the 
respirator program;
    (3) Review the hygiene facilities;
    (4) Reevaluate the maintenance and effectiveness of the relevant 
engineering controls;
    (5) Assess the employee's smoking history and status;
    (B) Within 30 days after the exposure reassessment, specified in 
paragraph (l)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, take reasonable steps to 
correct any deficiencies found in the reassessment that may be 
responsible for the employee's excess exposure to cadmium; and,
    (C) Within 90 days after receipt of biological monitoring results, 
provide a full medical examination to the employee in accordance with 
the requirements of paragraph (l)(4)(ii) of this section. After 
completing the medical examination, the examining physician shall 
determine in a written medical opinion whether to medically remove the 
employee. If the physician determines that medical removal is not 
necessary, then until the employee's CdU level falls to or below 3 
<greek-m> g/g Cr, <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M level falls to or below 300 
<greek-m> g/g Cr and

[[Page 572]]

CdB level falls to or below 5 <greek-m> g/lwb, the employer shall:
    (1) Provide biological monitoring in accordance with paragraph 
(l)(2)(ii)(B) of this section on a semiannual basis; and
    (2) Provide annual medical examinations in accordance with paragraph 
(l)(4)(ii) of this section.
    (iii) For all employees who are subject to medical surveillance 
under paragraph (l)(1)(i) of this section, if the results of the initial 
biological monitoring tests show the level of CdU to be in excess of 15 
<greek-m> g/g Cr, or the level of CdB to be in excess of 15 <greek-m> g/
lwb, or the level of <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M to be in excess of 1,500 
<greek-m> g/g Cr, the employer shall comply with the requirements of 
paragraphs (l)(3)(ii)(A)-(B) of this section. Within 90 days after 
receipt of biological monitoring results, the employer shall provide a 
full medical examination to the employee in accordance with the 
requirements of paragraph (l)(4)(ii) of this section. After completing 
the medical examination, the examining physician shall determine in a 
written medical opinion whether to medically remove the employee. 
However, if the initial biological monitoring results and the biological 
monitoring results obtained during the medical examination both show 
that: CdU exceeds 15 <greek-m> g/g Cr; or CdB exceeds 15 <greek-m> g/
lwb; or <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M exceeds 1500 <greek-m> g/g Cr, and in 
addition CdU exceeds 3 <greek-m> g/g Cr or CdB exceeds 5 <greek-m> g/
liter of whole blood, then the physician shall medically remove the 
employee from exposure to cadmium at or above the action level. If the 
second set of biological monitoring results obtained during the medical 
examination does not show that a mandatory removal trigger level has 
been exceeded, then the employee is not required to be removed by the 
mandatory provisions of this paragraph. If the employee is not required 
to be removed by the mandatory provisions of this paragraph or by the 
physician's determination, then until the employee's CdU level falls to 
or below 3 <greek-m> g/g Cr, <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M level falls to or 
below 300 <greek-m> g/g Cr and CdB level falls to or below 5 <greek-m> 
g/lwb, the employer shall:
    (A) Periodically reassess the employee's occupational exposure to 
cadmium;
    (B) Provide biological monitoring in accordance with paragraph 
(l)(2)(ii)(B) of this section on a quarterly basis; and
    (C) Provide semiannual medical examinations in accordance with 
paragraph (l)(4)(ii) of this section.
    (iv) For all employees to whom medical surveillance is provided, 
beginning on January 1, 1999, and in lieu of paragraph (l)(3)(iii) of 
this section, whenever the results of initial biological monitoring 
tests show the employee's CdU level to be in excess of 7 <greek-m> g/g 
Cr, or <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M level to be in excess of 750 <greek-m> g/
g Cr, or CdB level to be in excess of 10 <greek-m> g/lwb, the employer 
shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs (l)(3)(ii)(A)-(B) of 
this section. Within 90 days after receipt of biological monitoring 
results, the employer shall provide a full medical examination to the 
employee in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (l)(4)(ii) of 
this section. After completing the medical examination, the examining 
physician shall determine in a written medical opinion whether to 
medically remove the employee. However, if the initial biological 
monitoring results and the biological monitoring results obtained during 
the medical examination both show that: CdU exceeds 7 <greek-m> g/g Cr; 
or CdB exceeds 10 <greek-m> g/lwb; or <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M exceeds 
750 <greek-m> g/g Cr, and in addition CdU exceeds 3 <greek-m> g/g Cr or 
CdB exceeds 5 <greek-m> g/liter of whole blood, then the physician shall 
medically remove the employee from exposure to cadmium at or above the 
action level. If the second set of biological monitoring results 
obtained during the medical examination does not show that a mandatory 
removal trigger level has been exceeded, then the employee is not 
required to be removed by the mandatory provisions of this paragraph. If 
the employee is not required to be removed by the mandatory provisions 
of this paragraph or by the physician's determination, then until the 
employee's CdU level falls to or below 3 <greek-m> g/g Cr, 
<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M level falls to or below 300 <greek-m> g/g Cr and 
CdB level falls to or below 5 <greek-m> g/lwb, the employer shall:
    (A) Periodically reassess the employee's occupational exposure to 
cadmium;

[[Page 573]]

    (B) Provide biological monitoring in accordance with paragraph 
(l)(2)(ii)(B) of this section on a quarterly basis; and
    (C) Provide semiannual medical examinations in accordance with 
paragraph (l)(4)(ii) of this section.
    (4) Periodic medical surveillance. (i) For each employee who is 
covered by medical surveillance under paragraph (l)(1)(i)(A) of this 
section because of current or anticipated exposure to cadmium, the 
employer shall provide at least the minimum level of periodic medical 
surveillance, which consists of periodic medical examinations and 
periodic biological monitoring. A periodic medical examination shall be 
provided within one year after the initial examination required by 
paragraph (l)(2) of this section and thereafter at least biennially. 
Biological sampling shall be provided at least annually either as part 
of a periodic medical examination or separately as periodic biological 
monitoring.
    (ii) The periodic medical examination shall include:
    (A) A detailed medical and work history, or update thereof, with 
emphasis on: Past, present and anticipated future exposure to cadmium; 
smoking history and current status; reproductive history; current use of 
medications with potential nephrotoxic side-effects; any history of 
renal, cardiovascular, respiratory, hematopoietic, and/or musculo-
skeletal system dysfunction; and as part of the medical and work 
history, for employees who wear respirators, questions 3-11 and 25-32 in 
appendix D to this section;
    (B) A complete physical examination with emphasis on: blood 
pressure, the respiratory system, and the urinary system;
    (C) A 14 inch by 17 inch, or a reasonably standard sized posterior-
anterior chest X-ray (after the initial X-ray, the frequency of chest X-
rays is to be determined by the examining physician);
    (D) Pulmonary function tests, including forced vital capacity (FVC) 
and forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1);
    (E) Biological monitoring, as required in paragraph (l)(2)(ii)(B) of 
this section;
    (F) Blood analysis, in addition to the analysis required under 
paragraph (l)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, including blood urea nitrogen, 
complete blood count, and serum creatinine;
    (G) Urinalysis, in addition to the analysis required under paragraph 
(l)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, including the determination of albumin, 
glucose, and total and low molecular weight proteins;
    (H) For males over 40 years old, prostate palpation, or other at 
least as effective diagnostic test(s), and;
    (I) Any additional tests or procedures deemed appropriate by the 
examining physician.
    (iii) Periodic biological monitoring shall be provided in accordance 
with paragraph (l)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.
    (iv) If the results of periodic biological monitoring or the results 
of biological monitoring performed as part of the periodic medical 
examination show the level of the employee's CdU, <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-
M, or CdB to be in excess of the levels specified in paragraphs 
(l)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section; or beginning on January 1, 1999, in 
excess of the levels specified in paragraphs (l)(3)(ii) or (iv), the 
employer shall take the appropriate actions specified in paragraphs 
(l)(3)(ii)-(iv) of this section, respectively.
    (v) For previously exposed employees under paragraph (l)(1)(i)(B) of 
this section:
    (A) If the employee's levels of CdU did not exceed 3 <greek-m>g/g 
Cr, CdB did not exceed 5 <greek-m>g/lwb, and <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M did 
not exceed 300 <greek-m>g/g Cr in the initial biological monitoring 
tests, and if the results of the followup biological monitoring required 
by paragraph (l)(3)(i)(B) of this section one year after the initial 
examination confirm the previous results, the employer may discontinue 
all periodic medical surveillance for that employee.
    (B) If the initial biological monitoring results for CdU, CdB, or 
<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M were in excess of the levels specified in 
paragraph (l)(3)(i) of this section, but subsequent biological 
monitoring results required by paragraph (l)(3)(ii)-(iv) of this section 
show that the employee's CdU levels no longer exceed 3 <greek-m>g/g Cr, 
CdB levels no longer exceed 5 <greek-m>g/lwb, and <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-
M levels no longer exceed 300 <greek-m>g/g Cr, the employer shall 
provide biological monitoring for CdU, CdB, and

[[Page 574]]

<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M one year after these most recent biological 
monitoring results. If the results of the followup biological monitoring 
specified in this paragraph, confirm the previous results, the employer 
may discontinue all periodic medical surveillance for that employee.
    (C) However, if the results of the follow-up tests specified in 
paragraph (l)(4)(v)(A) or (B) of this section indicate that the level of 
the employee's CdU, <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M, or CdB exceeds these same 
levels, the employer is required to provide annual medical examinations 
in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (l)(4)(ii) of this 
section until the results of biological monitoring are consistently 
below these levels or the examining physician determines in a written 
medical opinion that further medical surveillance is not required to 
protect the employee's health.
    (vi) A routine, biennial medical examination is not required to be 
provided in accordance with paragraphs (l)(3)(i) and (l)(4) of this 
section if adequate medical records show that the employee has been 
examined in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (l)(4)(ii) of 
this section within the past 12 months. In that case, such records shall 
be maintained by the employer as part of the employee's medical record, 
and the next routine, periodic medical examination shall be made 
available to the employee within two years of the previous examination.
    (5) Actions triggered by medical examinations. (i) If the results of 
a medical examination carried out in accordance with this section 
indicate any laboratory or clinical finding consistent with cadmium 
toxicity that does not require employer action under paragraphs (l)(2), 
(3) or (4) of this section, the employer shall take the following steps 
and continue to take them until the physician determines that they are 
no longer necessary.
    (A) Periodically reassess: The employee's work practices and 
personal hygiene; the employee's respirator use, if any; the employee's 
smoking history and status; the respiratory protection program; the 
hygiene facilities; the maintenance and effectiveness of the relevant 
engineering controls; and take all reasonable steps to correct the 
deficiencies found in the reassessment that may be responsible for the 
employee's excess exposure to cadmium.
    (B) Provide semi-annual medical reexaminations to evaluate the 
abnormal clinical sign(s) of cadmium toxicity until the results are 
normal or the employee is medically removed; and
    (C) Where the results of tests for total proteins in urine are 
abnormal, provide a more detailed medical evaluation of the toxic 
effects of cadmium on the employee's renal system.
    (6) Examination for respirator use. (i) To determine an employee's 
fitness for respirator use, the employer shall provide a medical 
examination that includes the elements specified in paragraph 
(l)(6)(i)(A)-(D) of this section. This examination shall be provided 
prior to the employee's being assigned to a job that requires the use of 
a respirator or no later than 90 days after this section goes into 
effect, whichever date is later, to any employee without a medical 
examination within the preceding 12 months that satisfies the 
requirements of this paragraph.
    (A) A detailed medical and work history, or update thereof, with 
emphasis on: past exposure to cadmium; smoking history and current 
status; any history of renal, cardiovascular, respiratory, 
hematopoietic, and/or musculo-skeletal system dysfunction; a description 
of the job for which the respirator is required; and questions 3-11 and 
25-32 in appendix D;
    (B) A blood pressure test;
    (C) Biological monitoring of the employee's levels of CdU, CdB and 
<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 
(l)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, unless such results already have been 
obtained within the twelve months; and
    (D) Any other test or precedure that the examining physician deems 
appropriate.
    (ii) After reviewing all the information obtained from the medical 
examination required in paragraph (l)(6)(i) of this section, the 
physician shall determine whether the employee is fit to wear a 
respirator.
    (iii) Whenever an employee has exhibited difficulty in breathing 
during a respirator fit test or during use of a respirator, the 
employer, as soon as possible, shall provide the employee

[[Page 575]]

with a periodic medical examination in accordance with paragraph 
(l)(4)(ii) of this section to determine the employee's fitness to wear a 
respirator.
    (iv) Where the results of the examination required under paragraphs 
(l)(6)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section are abnormal, medical 
limitation or prohibition of respirator use shall be considered. If the 
employee is allowed to wear a respirator, the employee's ability to 
continue to do so shall be periodically evaluated by a physician.
    (7) Emergency Examinations. (i) In addition to the medical 
surveillance required in paragraphs (l)(2)-(6) of this section, the 
employer shall provide a medical examination as soon as possible to any 
employee who may have been acutely exposed to cadmium because of an 
emergency.
    (ii) The examination shall include the requirements of paragraph 
(l)(4)(ii), of this section, with emphasis on the respiratory system, 
other organ systems considered appropriate by the examining physician, 
and symptoms of acute overexposure, as identified in paragraphs 
II(B)(1)-(2) and IV of appendix A of this section.
    (8) Termination of employment examination. (i) At termination of 
employment, the employer shall provide a medical examination in 
accordance with paragraph (l)(4)(ii) of this section, including a chest 
X-ray where necessary, to any employee to whom at any prior time the 
employer was required to provide medical surveillance under paragraph 
(l)(1)(i) or (l)(7) of this section. However, if the last examination 
satisfied the requirements of paragraph (l)(4)(ii) of this section and 
was less than six months prior to the date of termination, no further 
examination is required unless otherwise specified in paragraph (l)(3) 
or (l)(5) of this section;
    (ii) In addition, if the employer has discontinued all periodic 
medical surveillance under paragraph (l)(4)(v) of this section, no 
termination of employment medical examination is required.
    (9) Information provided to the physician. The employer shall 
provide the following information to the examining physician:
    (i) A copy of this standard and appendices;
    (ii) A description of the affected employee's former, current, and 
anticipated duties as they relate to the employee's occupational 
exposure to cadmium;
    (iii) The employee's former, current, and anticipated future levels 
of occupational exposure to cadmium;
    (iv) A description of any personal protective equipment, including 
respirators, used or to be used by the employee, including when and for 
how long the employee has used that equipment; and
    (v) Relevant results of previous biological monitoring and medical 
examinations.
    (10) Physician's written medical opinion. (i) The employer shall 
promptly obtain a written, signed medical opinion from the examining 
physician for each medical examination performed on each employee. This 
written opinion shall contain:
    (A) The physician's diagnosis for the employee;
    (B) The physician's opinion as to whether the employee has any 
detected medical condition(s) that would place the employee at increased 
risk of material impairment to health from further exposure to cadmium, 
including any indications of potential cadmium toxicity;
    (C) The results of any biological or other testing or related 
evaluations that directly assess the employee's absorption of cadmium;
    (D) Any recommended removal from, or limitation on the activities or 
duties of the employee or on the employee's use of personal protective 
equipment, such as respirators;
    (E) A statement that the physician has clearly and carefully 
explained to the employee the results of the medical examination, 
including all biological monitoring results and any medical conditions 
related to cadmium exposure that require further evaluation or 
treatment, and any limitation on the employee's diet or use of 
medications.
    (ii) The employer shall promptly obtain a copy of the results of any 
biological monitoring provided by an employer to an employee 
independently of a medical examination under paragraphs (l)(2) and 
(l)(4) of this section,

[[Page 576]]

and, in lieu of a written medical opinion, an explanation sheet 
explaining those results.
    (iii) The employer shall instruct the physician not to reveal orally 
or in the written medical opinion given to the employer specific 
findings or diagnoses unrelated to occupational exposure to cadmium.
    (11) Medical Removal Protection (MRP)--(i) General. (A) The employer 
shall temporarily remove an employee from work where there is excess 
exposure to cadmium on each occasion that medical removal is required 
under paragraphs (l)(3), (l)(4), or (l)(6) of this section and on each 
occasion that a physician determines in a written medical opinion that 
the employee should be removed from such exposure. The physician's 
determination may be based on biological monitoring results, inability 
to wear a respirator, evidence of illness, other signs or symptoms of 
cadmium-related dysfunction or disease, or any other reason deemed 
medically sufficient by the physician.
    (B) The employer shall medically remove an employee in accordance 
with paragraph (l)(11) of this section regardless of whether at the time 
of removal a job is available into which the removed employee may be 
transferred.
    (C) Whenever an employee is medically removed under paragraph 
(l)(11) of this section, the employer shall transfer the removed 
employee to a job where the exposure to cadmium is within the 
permissible levels specified in that paragraph as soon as one becomes 
available.
    (D) For any employee who is medically removed under the provisions 
of paragraph (l)(11)(i) of this section, the employer shall provide 
follow-up medical examinations semi-annually until, in a written medical 
opinion, the examining physician determines that either the employee may 
be returned to his/her former job status or the employee must be 
permanently removed from excess cadmium exposure.
    (E) The employer may not return an employee who has been medically 
removed for any reason to his/her former job status until a physician 
determines in a written medical opinion that continued medical removal 
is no longer necessary to protect the employee's health.
    (ii) Where an employee is found unfit to wear a respirator under 
paragraph (l)(6)(ii) of this section, the employer shall remove the 
employee from work where exposure to cadmium is above the PEL.
    (iii) Where removal is based upon any reason other than the 
employee's inability to wear a respirator, the employer shall remove the 
employee from work where exposure to cadmium is at or above the action 
level.
    (iv) Except as specified in paragraph (l)(11)(v) of this section, no 
employee who was removed because his/her level of CdU, CdB and/or 
<greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M exceeded the trigger levels in paragraph (l)(3) 
or (l)(4) of this section may be returned to work with exposure to 
cadmium at or above the action level until the employee's levels of CdU 
fall to or below 3 <greek-m> g/g Cr, CdB fall to or below 5 <greek-m> g/
lwb, and <greek-b><INF>2</INF>-M fall to or below 300 <greek-m> g/g Cr.
    (v) However, when in the examining physician's opinion continued 
exposure to cadmium will not pose an increased risk to the employee's 
health and there are special circumstances that make continued medical 
removal an inappropriate remedy, the physician shall fully discuss these 
matters with the employee, and then in a written determination may 
return a worker to his/her former job status despite what would 
otherwise be unacceptably high biological monitoring results. Thereafter 
and until such time as the employee's biological monitoring results have 
decreased to levels where he/she could have been returned to his/her 
former job status, the returned employee shall continue medical 
surveillance as if he/she were still on medical removal. Until such 
time, the employee is no longer subject to mandatory medical removal. 
Subsequent questions regarding the employee's medical removal shall be 
decided solely by a final medical determination.
    (vi) Where an employer, although not required by this section to do 
so, removes an employee from exposure to cadmium or otherwise places 
limitations on an employee due to the effects of cadmium exposure on the 
employee's medical condition, the employer

[[Page 577]]

shall provide the same medical removal protection benefits to that 
employee under paragraph (l)(12) of this section as would have been 
provided had the removal been required under paragraph (l)(11) of this 
section.
    (12) Medical removal protection benefits. (i) The employer shall 
provide medical removal protection benefits to an employee for up to a 
maximum of 18 months each time, and while the employee is temporarily 
medically removed under paragraph (l)(11) of this section.
    (ii) For purposes of this section, the requirement that the employer 
provide medical removal protection benefits means that the employer 
shall maintain the total normal earnings, seniority, and all other 
employee rights and benefits of the removed employee, including the 
employee's right to his/her former job status, as if the employee had 
not been removed from the employee's job or otherwise medically limited.
    (iii) Where, after 18 months on medical removal because of elevated 
biological monitoring results, the employee's monitoring results have 
not declined to a low enough level to permit the employee to be returned 
to his/her former job status:
    (A) The employer shall make available to the employee a medical 
examination pursuant to this section in order to obtain a final medical 
determination as to whether the employee may be returned to his/her 
former job status or must be permanently removed from excess cadmium 
exposure; and
    (B) The employer shall assure that the final medical determination 
indicates whether the employee may be returned to his/her former job 
status and what steps, if any, should be taken to protect the employee's 
health;
    (iv) The employer may condition the provision of medical removal 
protection benefits upon the employee's participation in medical 
surveillance provided in accordance with this section.
    (13) Multiple physician review. (i) If the employer selects the 
initial physician to conduct any medical examination or consultation 
provided to an employee under this section, the employee may designate a 
second physician to:
    (A) Review any findings, determinations, or recommendations of the 
initial physician; and
    (B) Conduct such examinations, consultations, and laboratory tests 
as the second physician deems necessary to facilitate this review.
    (ii) The employer shall promptly notify an employee of the right to 
seek a second medical opinion after each occasion that an initial 
physician provided by the employer conducts a medical examination or 
consultation pursuant to this section. The employer may condition its 
participation in, and payment for, multiple physician review upon the 
employee doing the following within fifteen (15) days after receipt of 
this notice, or receipt of the initial physician's written opinion, 
whichever is later:
    (A) Informing the employer that he or she intends to seek a medical 
opinion; and
    (B) Initiating steps to make an appointment with a second physician.
    (iii) If the findings, determinations, or recommendations of the 
second physician differ from those of the initial physician, then the 
employer and the employee shall assure that efforts are made for the two 
physicians to resolve any disagreement.
    (iv) If the two physicians have been unable to quickly resolve their 
disagreement, then the employer and the employee, through their 
respective physicians, shall designate a third physician to:
    (A) Review any findings, determinations, or recommendations of the 
other two physicians; and
    (B) Conduct such examinations, consultations, laboratory tests, and 
discussions with the other two physicians as the third physician deems 
necessary to resolve the disagreement among them.
    (v) The employer shall act consistently with the findings, 
determinations, and recommendations of the third physician, unless the 
employer and the employee reach an agreement that is consistent with the 
recommendations of at least one of the other two physicians.
    (14) Alternate physician determination. The employer and an employee 
or designated employee representative may

[[Page 578]]

agree upon the use of any alternate form of physician determination in 
lieu of the multiple physician review provided by paragraph (l)(13) of 
this section, so long as the alternative is expeditious and at least as 
protective of the employee.
    (15) Information the employer must provide the employee. (i) The 
employer shall provide a copy of the physician's written medical opinion 
to the examined employee within five working days after receipt thereof.
    (ii) The employer shall provide the employee with a copy of the 
employee's biological monitoring results and an explanation sheet 
explaining the results within five working days after receipt thereof.
    (iii) Within 30 days after a request by an employee, the employer 
shall provide the employee with the information the employer is required 
to provide the examining physician under paragraph (l)(9) of this 
section.
    (16) Reporting. In addition to other medical events that are 
required to be reported on the OSHA Form No. 200, the employer shall 
report any abnormal condition or disorder caused by occupational 
exposure to cadmium associated with employment as specified in Chapter 
(V)(E) of the Reporting Guidelines for Occupational Injuries and 
Illnesses.
    (m) Communication of cadmium hazards to employees--(1) General. In 
communications concerning cadmium hazards, employers shall comply with 
the requirements of OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard for the 
construction industry, 29 CFR 1926.59, including but not limited to the 
requirements concerning warning signs and labels, material safety data

                                       conditions requiring the         
                                       grounding of portable equipment. 
1926.401(b).........................  1926.404(f)(7) (iii) and (v);

                                       conditions requiring the

1926.401(c).........................  1926.404(f)(6); requirements      
                                       relating to impedance and        
                                       ampacity of grounding conductor

                                       consistent with 29 CFR part 1910,
                                       Subpart S. Briefly, these        
                                       requirements have been removed   
                                       because the parameters cannot be 
                                       accurately measured in           
                                       operational workplaces. Further

1926.401(d).........................  Ground resistance of driven rod   
                                       electrodes is covered by         
                                       1926.404(f)(10).                 
1926.401(e).........................  Removed. Requirement is ambiguous 
                                       in that it implies that the      
                                       resistance between the ground and
                                       the grounded power conductor is a
                                       controlling factor in circuit    
                                       overcurrent protection.          
                                       Clarifying the ambiguity would   
                                       result in a requirement for      
                                       measuring the actual equipment   
                                       grounding conductor impedance    
                                       under fault conditions. The      
                                       practicality of such measurements
                                       have been questioned and         
                                       currently no such requirement    
                                       exists in the National Electrical
                                       Code. See discussion of issue No.
