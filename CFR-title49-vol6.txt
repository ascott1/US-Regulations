                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 1997), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 1000.10  Availability of statements of policy, interpretations, and other matters not required to be published in the Federal Register.

    (a) The Surface Transportation Board, in performing its duties under 
the Interstate Commerce Act, frequently formulates and adopts statements 
of general policy, or interpretations of general applicability, and 
other matters not required to be published in the Federal Register in 
rendering decisions in proceedings involving the operating rights, 
financial structures, or rates and practices of brokers, electric 
railways, express companies, freight forwarders, motor carriers, 
pipelines, private car companies, rail carriers, and water carriers. 
Because such statements of policy and interpretations of general 
applicability are scattered throughout more than 320,000 pages in over 
400 volumes of Board reports and because such policies and 
interpretations must be revised or repealed from time to time as 
required by changing technology and economic conditions, it is not 
feasible, and is wholly impractical, to state them separately and 
publish them in the Federal Register. Further, to be fully understood, 
such statements of general policy or interpretations of general 
applicability must be read in context in the Board's reports where they 
are explained, revised, or repealed in relation to the factual 
situations to which they are applicable. Notice is hereby given that 
those portions of the printed reports of decisions of the Surface 
Transportation Board which contain statements of general policy or 
interpretations of general applicability are digested, arranged 
topically, and indexed both in the multivolume set ``Interstate Commerce 
Acts Annotated'' (supplemented monthly by the ``Advance Bulletin of 
Interstate Commerce Acts Annotated'') and in the index-digests in the 
backs of bound volumes of Surface Transportation Board reports. The 
multivolume set, ``Interstate Commerce Acts Annotated'' and the three 
series of Surface Transportation Board reports (i.e., I.C.C., M.C.C. and 
Val. Rep.) are published and sold by the Government Printing Office, and 
are sent free to Depository Libraries (44 U.S.C. 82), which include all 
State libraries, two libraries in each congressional district, the 
libraries of land grant colleges, and other libraries. Copies are also 
available for public examination in the Surface Transportation Board 
Library in Washington, DC. The indexes in these publications are 
maintained in compliance with the provision in 5 United States Code 
552(a)(2). The ``Advance Bulletin of Interstate Commerce Acts 
Annotated'' and recent reports, which have not yet been included in 
published indexes, are available upon request from the Office of the 
Secretary, Surface Transportation Board.
    (b) Because of the large volume of reports, it is the policy of the 
Board to print for publication in bound volumes only reports of those 
cases decided by the entire Board or by a division thereof and more 
significant reports of employee boards. With few exceptions, reports and 
orders of employee boards are duplicated (``no print reports and 
orders'') and distributed to the parties and made available to the 
press. From time to time ``no print reports and orders'' are cited as 
precedents in other cases. Therefore, notice is hereby given that 
duplicated ``no print reports and orders'', are indexed by docket number 
and title, and filed by subject matter and are available for public 
inspection in the Section of Reference Services of the Board in 
Washington, DC. These indexes and files are maintained in compliance 
with the provision in 5 United States Code 552(a)(2). Persons outside 
Washington, DC, can obtain information about, or copies of, such 
duplicated reports by writing to the Secretary of the Board.

<R05>
Sec. 1001.3  Requests to inspect other records not considered public under 5 U.S.C. 552.

    Requests to inspect records other than those now deemed to be of a 
public nature shall be in writing and addressed to the Freedom of 
Information Officer (Officer). The Officer shall determine within 10 
days of receipt of a request (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal 
public holidays) whether a requested record will be made available. If 
the Officer determines that a request cannot be honored, the Officer 
must inform the requesting party in writing of this decision and such 
letter shall contain a detailed explanation of why the requested 
material cannot be made available and explain the requesting party's 
right of appeal. If the Officer rules that such records cannot be made 
available because they are exempt under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 
552(b), an appeal from such ruling may be addressed to the Chairman. The 
Chairman's decision shall be administratively final and state the 
specific exemption(s) contained in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) relied upon for 
denial. Such an appeal must be filed within 30 days of the date of the 
Freedom of Information Officer's letter. The Chairman shall act in 
writing on such appeals within 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, 
and legal public holidays) of receipt of any appeal. In unusual 
circumstances, as set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B), the time limit may 
be extended, by written notice to the person making the particular 
request, setting forth the reasons for such extension, for no more than 
10 working days. If the appeal is denied, the Chairman's order shall 
notify the requesting party of his or her right to judicial review. 
Charges shall be made as provided for in Sec. 1002.1(f) of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 1001.4  Predisclosure notification procedures for confidential commercial information.

    (a) In general. Confidential commercial information provided to the 
Interstate Commerce Commission or the Board shall not be disclosed 
pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request except in 
accordance with this section. For such purposes, the following 
definitions apply:
    (1) Confidential commercial information means records provided to 
the government by a submitter that arguably contain material exempt from 
release under Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 
552(b)(4), because disclosure could reasonably be

[[Page 11]]

expected to cause substantial competitive harm.
    (2) Submitter means any person or entity who provides confidential 
commercial information to the government. The term ``submitter'' 
includes, but is not limited to, corporations, state governments, and 
foreign governments.
    (b) Notice to submitters. Except as provided in paragraph (g) of 
this section, the Board, to the extent permitted by law, shall provide a 
submitter with prompt written notice, in accordance with paragraph (c) 
of this section, of receipt of an FOIA request encompassing its 
submissions. This notice shall either describe the exact nature of the 
information requested or provide copies of the records themselves.
    (c) When notice is required. Notice shall be given to a submitter 
whenever:
    (1) The Board has reason to believe that disclosure of the 
information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial 
competitive harm; or
    (2) The information has been designated, in good faith by the 
submitter, as confidential commercial information at the time of 
submission or within a reasonable time thereafter. Whenever possible, 
the submitter's claim of confidentiality shall be supported by a 
statement or certification by an officer or authorized representative of 
the company that the information in question is in fact confidential 
commercial information and has not been disclosed to the public.
    (d) Opportunity to object to disclosure. (1) Through the notice 
described in paragraph (b) of this section, the Board shall afford a 
submitter a reasonable period of time in which to provide it with a 
detailed statement of any objection to disclosure. Such statement shall 
specify all grounds for withholding the requested information.
    (2) When notice is given to a submitter under this section, the 
Board also shall notify the requester that it has been provided.
    (e) Notice of intent to disclose. (1) The Board shall consider 
carefully a submitter's objections and specific grounds for 
nondisclosure prior to its determination whether or not to disclose the 
requested information. Whenever the Board decides to disclose the 
information over a submitter's objection, it shall provide the submitter 
with written notice containing the following:
    (i) A description or copy of the information to be disclosed;
    (ii) The reasons why the submitter's disclosure objections were not 
sustained; and
    (iii) A specific disclosure date, which shall be a reasonable number 
of days after the notice of intent to disclose has been mailed to the 
submitter.
    (2) At the same time that notice of intent to disclose is given to a 
submitter, the Board shall notify the requester accordingly.
    (f) Notice of lawsuit. (1) Whenever an FOIA requester brings legal 
action seeking to compel disclosure of confidential commercial 
information, the Board shall promptly notify the submitter.
    (2) Whenever a submitter brings legal action seeking to prevent 
disclosure of confidential commercial information, the Board shall 
promptly notify the requester.
    (g) Exception to notice requirement. The notice requirements of this 
section shall not apply if:
    (1) The Board determines that the information requested should not 
be disclosed; or
    (2) The information already has been published or otherwise 
officially made available to the public; or
    (3) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 
U.S.C. 552); or
    (4) Disclosure is required by a Board rule that:
    (i) Was adopted pursuant to notice and public comment;
    (ii) Specifies narrow classes of records submitted to the Board that 
are to be released; and
    (iii) Provides in exceptional circumstances for notice when the 
submitter provides written justification, at the time the information is 
submitted or within a reasonable time thereafter, that disclosure of the 
information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial 
competitive harm; or
    (5) The information requested was not designated by the submitter as 
exempt from disclosure, when the submitter had an opportunity to do so 
at

[[Page 12]]

the time of submission or within a reasonable time thereafter, unless 
the Board has reason to believe that disclosure of the information could 
reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm; or
    (6) The designation made by the submitter in accordance with these 
regulations appears obviously frivolous; in such case, the Board must 
provide the submitter only with written notice of any administrative 
disclosure determination within a reasonable number of days prior to the 
specified disclosure date.

<R05>


Sec.
1002.1  Fees for records search, review, copying, certification, and 
          related services.
1002.2  Filing fees.
1002.3  Updating user fees.

    Authority:  5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A) and 553; 31 U.S.C. 9701; and 49 
U.S.C. 721(a).


<R05>
Sec. 1002.1  Fees for records search, review, copying, certification, and related services.

    Certifications and copies of such tariffs, reports and other public 
records and documents on file with the Surface Transportation Board as 
may be practicable to furnish, as well as searches and copying of 
records not considered public under the Freedom of Information Act (5 
U.S.C. 552), will be furnished on the following basis:
    (a) Certificate of the Secretary, $10.00.
    (b) Service involved in examination of tariffs or schedules for 
preparation of certified copies of tariffs or schedules or extracts 
therefrom at the rate of $25.00 per hour.
    (c) Service involved in checking records to be certified to 
determine authenticity, including clerical work, etc., incidental 
thereto, at the rate of $17.00 per hour.
    (d) Electrostatic copies of tariffs, reports, and other public 
documents, at the rate of $.80 per letter size or legal size exposure. A 
minimum charge of $5.00 will be made for this service.
    (e) The fee for search and copying services requiring ADP processing 
are as follows:
    (1) A fee of $44.00 per hour for professional staff time will be 
charged when it is required to fulfill a request for ADP data.
    (2) The fee for port minute time for the search will be set at the 
current rate set forth in the Board's contract with its time sharing 
computer contractor. Information on those charges can be obtained from 
the Chief, System Services Branch, Surface Transportation Board, 
Washington, DC 20423.
    (3) Printing shall be charged at the rates of $.10 per page of 
computer generated output with a minimum charge of $.25. A charge of $30 
per reel of magnetic tape will be made if the tape is to be permanently 
retained by the requestor.
    (f) The fees for search, review and copying services for records not 
considered public under the Freedom of Information Act are as follows:
    (1) When records are sought for commercial use, requesters will be 
assessed the full and reasonable direct costs of document search, review 
and duplication. A ``commercial use'' request refers to a request from 
or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that 
furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or 
the person on whose behalf the request is made.
    (2) When records are not sought for commercial use and a request is 
made by an educational or noncommercial scientific institution, 
requesters will be assessed only for the cost of duplication (excluding 
charges for the first 100 pages). The term ``Educational Institution'' 
refers to a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary 
school, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of 
undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional 
education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a 
program of scholarly research. The term ``noncommercial scientific 
institution'' refers to an institution that is not operated on a 
``commercial'' basis and that is operated solely for the purpose of 
conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to 
promote any particular product or industry. They must show that their 
request is authorized by and under the auspices of a

[[Page 13]]

qualifying institution and the records are not sought for a commercial 
use but, instead, are in furtherance of scholarly or scientific 
research.
    (3) Requesters who are representatives of the news media (persons 
actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to 
publish or broadcast news to the public) will be assessed only for the 
cost of duplication (excluding charges for the first 100 pages) if they 
can show that their request is not made for a commercial use. A request 
for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester 
shall not be considered a request for a commercial use.
    (4) All other requesters will be assessed fees which recover the 
full, reasonable direct cost of searching for and duplicating records 
that are responsive to the request (excluding charges for the first 100 
pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time).
    (5) All requesters must reasonably describe the records sought.
    (6) The search and review hourly fees will be based upon employee 
grade levels in order to recoup the full, allowable direct costs 
attributable to their performance of these functions. They are as 
follows:

                                                                        
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             Grade                                 Rate 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
GS-1...........................................................    $7.37
GS-2...........................................................     8.02
GS-3...........................................................     9.04
GS-4...........................................................    10.15
GS-5...........................................................    11.35

GS-8...........................................................    15.58
GS-9...........................................................    17.20
GS-10..........................................................    18.95
GS-11..........................................................    20.82
GS-12..........................................................    24.95
GS-13..........................................................    29.67
GS-14..........................................................    35.06
GS-15 and over.................................................    41.24
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (7) The fee for electrostatic copies shall be $.60 per letter or 
legal size exposure with a minimum charge of $3.00.
    (8) The fee charged for ADP data is set forth in paragraph (e) of 
this section.
    (9) If the cost of collecting any fee would be equal to or greater 
than the fee itself, it will not be assessed.
    (10) A fee may be charged for searches which are not productive and 
for searches for records or those parts of records which subsequently 
are determined to be exempt from disclosure.
    (11) Interest charges will be assessed on any unpaid bill starting 
on the date specified in the bill, at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 
3717 and will accrue from the date of the billing. The Debt Collection 
Act, 5 U.S.C. 5514 (1982), including disclosure to the consumer 
reporting agencies and the use of collection agencies, as prescribed in 
the Board's Debt Collection Regulations in 49 CFR part 1018, will be 
utilized to encourage payment where appropriate.
    (12) If search charges are likely to exceed $25, the requester will 
be notified of the estimated fees unless requester willingness to pay 
whatever fee is assessed has been provided in advance. The 
administrative time limits prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) will not 
begin until after the requester agrees in writing to accept the 
prospective charges.
    (13) An advance payment (before work is commenced or continued on a 
request) may be required if the charges are likely to exceed $250. 
Requesters who have previously failed to pay a fee charged in timely 
fashion (i.e. within 30 days of the date of billing) may be required 
first to pay this amount plus any applicable interest (or demonstrate 
that the fee has been paid) and then make an advance payment of the full 
amount of the estimated fee before the new or pending request is 
processed. The administrative time limits prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 
552(a)(6) also will not begin until after a requester has complied with 
this provision.
    (14) Documents shall be furnished without any charge or at a charge 
reduced below the fees set forth above if disclosure of the information 
is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute 
significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of 
the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the 
requester. The following six factors will be employed in determining 
when such fees shall be waived or reduced:
    (i) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requester 
records concerns ``the operations or activities of the government'';
    (ii) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: 
Whether the

[[Page 14]]

disclosure is ``likely to contribute'' to an understanding of government 
operations or activities;
    (iii) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the 
general public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of 
the requested information will contribute to ``public understanding'';
    (iv) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: 
Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute ``significantly'' to 
public understanding of government operations or activities;
    (v) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether 
the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the 
requested disclosure; and, if so
    (vi) The primary interest in disclosure: Whether the magnitude of 
the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently 
large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that 
disclosure is ``primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.''

This fee waiver and reduction provision will be implemented in 
accordance with guidelines issued by the U.S. Department of Justice on 
April 2, 1987 and entitled ``New FOIA Fee Waiver Policy Guidance.'' A 
copy of these guidelines may be inspected or obtained from the Surface 
Transportation Board's Freedom of Information Office, Washington, DC 
20423.
    (g) Payment for services described in paragraphs (a) through (f) of 
this section may be made in cash or by postal money order or check 
payable to the order of the Secretary, Surface Transportation Board, 
Washington, D.C., and forwarded to his office.
    (h) Transcript of testimony and of oral argument, or extracts 
therefrom, may be purchased by the public from the Board's official 
reporter. For information regarding the official reporter, contact the 
Secretary, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC 20423.

<R05>
Sec. 1002.2  Filing fees.

    (a) Manner of payment. (1) Except as specified in this section, all 
filing fees will be payable at the time and place the application, 
petition, notice, tariff, contract summary, or other document is 
tendered for filing. The filing fee for tariffs, including schedules, 
and contracts summaries including supplements (Item 78) may be charged 
to tariff filing fee accounts established by the Board in accordance 
with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (2) Billing account procedure. Form STB-1032 must be submitted to 
the Board's Budget and Fiscal Office to establish a tariff filing fee 
account or an insurance service fee account.
    (i) Each account will have a specific billing date within each month 
and a billing cycle. The billing date is the date that the bill is 
prepared and printed. The billing cycle is the period between the 
billing date in one month and the billing date in the next month. A bill 
for each account which has activity or an unpaid balance during the 
billing cycle will be sent on the billing date each month. Payment will 
be due 20 days from the billing date. Payments received before the next 
billing date are applied to the account. Interest will accrue in 
accordance with 49 CFR 1018.30.
    (ii) The Debt Collection Act of 1982, including disclosure to the 
consumer reporting agencies and the use of collection agencies, as 
prescribed in the Board's Debt Collection Regulations in 49 CFR part 
1018, will be utilized to encourage payment where appropriate.
    (iii) An account holder who files a petition in bankruptcy or who is 
the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding must provide the following 
information to the Chief, Budget and Fiscal Office, Surface 
Transportation Board, Washington, DC:
    (A) The filing date of the bankruptcy petition;
    (B) The court in which the bankruptcy petition was filed;
    (C) The type of bankruptcy proceeding;
    (D) The name, address, and telephone number of its representative in 
the bankruptcy proceeding; and

[[Page 15]]

    (E) The name, address, and telephone number of the bankruptcy 
trustee, if one has been appointed.
    (3) Fees will be payable to the Surface Transportation Board by a 
check payable in United States currency drawn upon funds deposited in a 
United States or foreign bank or other financial institution, money 
order payable in United States' currency, or credit card (VISA or 
MASTERCARD).
    (b) Any filing, other than a tariff filing, that is not accompanied 
by the appropriate filing fee is deficient except for filings that 
satisfy the deferred payment procedures in paragraph (a) of this 
section. However, the Board may find that a tariff which is submitted 
without the appropriate filing fee is deficient and reject the tariff 
filing, if the filer repeatedly fails to submit the appropriate filing 
fee after the Board has advised the filer of the proper filing fee and 
tariff filing procedures.
    (c) Fees not refundable. Fees will be assessed for every filing in 
the type of proceeding listed in the schedule of fees contained in 
paragraph (f) of this section, subject to the exceptions contained in 
paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section. After the application, petition, 
notice, tariff, contract, or other document has been accepted for filing 
by the Board, the filing fee will not be refunded, regardless of whether 
the application, petition, notice, tariff, contract, or other document 
is granted or approved, denied, rejected before docketing, dismissed, or 
withdrawn. If an individual exemption proceeding becomes a matter of 
general applicability and is handled through the rulemaking process, the 
Board will refund the filing fee.
    (d) Related or consolidated proceedings. (1)(i) Except as provided 
for in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, separate fees need not be 
paid for related applications filed by the same applicant that would be 
the subject of one proceeding.
    (ii) In proceedings filed under the rail consolidation procedures at 
49 CFR part 1180, the applicable filing fee must be paid for each 
proceeding submitted concurrently with the primary application. The fee 
for each type of proceeding is set forth in the fee schedule contained 
in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (2) A separate fee will be assessed for the filing of an application 
for temporary authority to operate a motor carrier of passengers as 
provided for in paragraph (f)(5) of this section regardless of whether 
such application is related to a corresponding transfer proceeding as 
provided for in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
    (3) The Board may reject concurrently filed applications, petitions, 
notices, contracts, or other documents asserted to be related and refund 
the filing fee if, in its judgment, they embrace two or more severable 
matters wich should be the subject of separate proceedings.
    (e) Waiver or reduction of filing fees. It is the general policy of 
the Board not to waive or reduce filing fees except as described below:
    (1) Filing fees are waived for an application or other proceeding 
which is filed by a federal government agency, or a state or local 
government entity. For purposes of this section the phrases ``federal 
government agency'' or ``government entity'' do not include a quasi-
governmental corporation or government subsidized transportation 
company.
    (2) In extraordinary situations the Board will accept requests for 
waivers or fee reductions in accordance with the following procedure:
    (i) When to request. At the time that a filing is submitted to the 
Board the applicant may request a waiver or reduction of the fee 
prescribed in this part. Such request should be addressed to the 
Secretary.
    (ii) Basis. The applicant must show the waiver or reduction of the 
fee is in the best interest of the public, or that payment of the fee 
would impose an undue hardship upon the requestor.
    (iii) Board action. The Secretary will notify the applicant of the 
decision to grant or deny the request for waiver or reduction.
    (f) Schedule of filing fees.

Sec. 1002.3  Updating user fees.

    (a) Update. Each fee established in this part shall be updated in 
accordance with this section at least once a year. However, any fee may 
be updated more than once a year, if the Board finds that an additional 
update is necessary.
    (b) Publication and effective dates. Updated fees shall be published 
in the Federal Register and shall become effective 30 days after 
publication.
    (c) Payment of fees. Any person submitting a filing for which a fee 
is established shall pay the fee in effect at the time of the filing.
    (d) Method of updating fees. Each fee shall be updated by updating 
the cost components comprising the fee. Cost components shall be updated 
as follows:
    (1) Direct labor costs shall be updated by multiplying base level 
direct labor costs by percentage changes in average wages and salaries 
of Board employees. Base level direct labor costs are direct labor costs 
determined by the cost study set forth in Revision of Fees For Services, 
1 I.C.C.2d 60 (1984) or subsequent cost studies. The base period for 
measuring changes shall be April 1984.
    (2) Operations overhead shall be developed each year on the basis of 
current relationships existing on a weighted basis, for indirect labor 
applicable to the first supervisory work centers directly associated 
with user fee activity. Actual updating of operations overhead will be 
accomplished by applying the current percentage factor to updated direct 
labor, including current governmental overhead costs.
    (3)(i) Office general and administrative costs shall be developed 
each year on the basis of current level costs, i.e., dividing actual 
office general and administrative costs for the current fiscal year by 
total office costs for the Offices directly associated with user fee 
activity. Actual updating of office general and administrative costs 
will be accomplished by applying the current percentage factor to 
updated direct labor, including current governmental overhead and 
current operations overhead costs.
    (ii) Board general and administrative costs shall be developed each 
year on the basis of current level costs; i.e., dividing actual Board 
general and administrative costs for the current fiscal year by total 
agency expenses for the current fiscal year. Actual updating of Board 
general and administrative costs will be accomplished by applying the 
current percentage factor to updated direct labor, including current 
governmental overhead, operations overhead and office general and 
administrative costs.
    (4) Publication costs shall be adjusted on the basis of known 
changes in the costs applicable to publication of material in the 
Federal Register.
    (e) Rounding of updated fees. Updated fees shall be rounded in the 
following manner: (1) Fees between $1-$30 will be rounded to the nearest 
$1; (2) fees between $30-$100 will be rounded to the nearest $10; (3) 
fees between $100-$999

[[Page 19]]

will be rounded to the nearest $50; and (4) fees above $1,000 will be 
rounded to the nearest $100. (This rounding procedure excludes copying, 
printing and search fees.)

<R05>
Sec. 1004.2  Authority to serve a particular area--construction.

    (a) Service at municipality. A motor carrier of property, motor 
passenger carrier of express, and household goods freight forwarder 
authorized to serve a municipality may serve all points within that 
municipality's commercial zone not beyond the territorial limits, if 
any, fixed in such authority.
    (b) Service at unincorporated community. A motor carrier of 
property, motor passenger carrier of express, and household goods 
freight forwarder, authorized to serve an unincorporated community 
having a post office of the same name, may serve all points in the 
United States not beyond the territorial limits, if any, fixed in such 
authority, as follows:
    (1) All points within 3 miles of the post office in such 
unincorporated community if it has a population of less than 2,500; 
within 4 miles if it has a population of 2,500 but less than 25,000; and 
within 6 miles if it has a population of 25,000 or more;
    (2) At all points in any municipality any part of which is within 
the limits described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and
    (3) At all points in any municipality wholly surrounded, or so 
surrounded except for a water boundary, by any municipality included 
under the terms of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.


<R04>
                Subpart B--Miscellaneous Interpretations


<R05>
Sec. 1004.10  Gifts, donations, and hospitality by carriers.

    It is unlawful for any common carrier engaged in interstate or 
foreign commerce to offer, make, or cause any undue or unreasonable 
preference or advantage to any person. Gifts of services or anything of 
substantial value to particular shippers or their representatives are 
considered violations of the law. Expenditures for such gifts may not 
support requests to increase carrier rates. The Board shall take 
appropriate enforcement action to redress such unlawful expenditures.

[[Page 20]]


<R04>
                     Subpart C--Routing Regulations


<R05>
Sec. 1004.20  Regular-route motor passenger service.

    (a) A motor common carrier authorized to transport passengers over 
regular routes may serve: (1) All points on its authorized route; (2) 
all municipalities wholly within 1 airline mile of its authorized route; 
(3) all unincorporated areas within 1 airline mile of its authorized 
route; and (4) all military posts, airports, schools, and similar 
establishments that may be entered within 1 airline mile of its 
authorized route, but operations within any part of such establishment 
more than 1 airline mile from such authorized route may not be over a 
public road.
    (b) This section does not apply to those motor passenger common 
carriers authorized to operate within:
    (1) New York, NY;
    (2) Rockland, Westchester, Orange, or Nassau Counties, NY;
    (3) Fairfield County, CT; and
    (4) Passaic, Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Union, Morris, Somerset, 
Middlesex, or Monmouth Counties, NJ.
[54 FR 21956, May 22, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 1004.21  Traversal authority.

    (a) Scope. An irregular-route motor carrier may operate between 
authorized service points over any reasonably direct or logical route 
unless expressly prohibited.
    (b) Requirements. Before commencing operations, the carrier must, 
regarding each State traversed:
    (1) Notify the State regulatory body in writing, attaching a copy of 
its operating rights;
    (2) Designate a process agent; and
    (3) Comply with 49 CFR 1043.8.


<R05>
Sec. 1004.22  Tacking.

    Unless expressly prohibited, a motor common carrier of property 
holding separate authorities which have common service points may join, 
or ``tack,'' those authorities at the common point, or ``gateway,'' for 
the purpose of performing through service as follows:
    (a) Regular-route authorities may be tacked with one another;
    (b) Regular-route authority may be tacked with irregular-route 
authority;
    (c) Irregular-route authorities may be tacked with one another if 
the authorities were granted pursuant to applications filed on or before 
November 23, 1973, and the distance between the points at which service 
is provided, when measured through the gateway point, is 300 miles or 
less; and
    (d) Irregular-route authorities may be tacked with one another if 
the authorities involved contain a specific provision granting the right 
to tack.


<R05>
Sec. 1004.23  Elimination of routing restrictions--regular-route carriers.

    (a) Regular-route authorities--construction. All certificates that, 
either singly or in combination, authorize the transportation by a motor 
common carrier of property over:
    (1) A single regular route or;
    (2) Over two or more regular routes that can lawfully be tacked at a 
common service point, shall be construed as authorizing transportation 
between authorized service points over any available route.
    (b) Service at authorized points. A common carrier departing from 
its authorized service routes under paragraph (a) of this section shall 
continue to serve points authorized to be served on or in connection 
with its authorized service routes.
    (c) Intermediate point service. A common carrier conducting 
operations under paragraph (a) of this section may serve points on, and 
within 1 airline mile of, an alternative route it elects to use if all 
the following conditions are met:
    (1) The carrier is authorized to serve all intermediate points 
(without regard to nominal restrictions) on the underlying service 
route;
    (2) The alternative route involves the use of a superhighway (i.e., 
a limited access highway with split-level crossings);
    (3) The alternative superhighway route, including highways 
connecting the superhighway portion of the route with the carrier's 
authorized service route,
    (i) Extends in the same general direction as the carrier's 
authorized service route and

[[Page 21]]

    (ii) Is wholly within 25 airline miles of the carrier's authorized 
service route; and
    (4) Service is provided in the same manner as, and subject to any 
restrictions that apply to, service over the authorized service route.


<R05>
Sec. 1004.24  Elimination of gateways--regular- and irregular-route carriers.

    A motor common carrier of property holding separate grants of 
authority (including regular-route authority), one or more of which 
authorizes transportation over irregular routes, where the authorities 
have a common service point at which they can lawfully be tacked to 
perform through service, may perform such through service over any 
available route.


<R05>
Sec. 1004.25  Redesignated highways.

    Where a highway over which a regular-route motor common carrier of 
property is authorized to operate is assigned a new designation, such as 
a new number, letter, or name, the carrier shall advise the Board by 
letter, and shall provide information concerning the new and the old 
designation, the points between which the highway is redesignated, and 
each place where the highway is referred to in the carrier's authority. 
The new designation of the highway will be shown in the carrier's 
certificate when the Board has occasion to reissue it.


<R05>
Sec. 1004.26  Misrouting, adjustment of claims.

    Carriers should adjust claims for damages resulting from misrouting. 
Where a carrier admits responsibility for billing, forwarding, or 
diverting a shipment over a higher rated route than that directed by the 
shipper or otherwise available, the misrouting carrier should refund the 
difference to the shipper (or reimburse the delivering carrier, as the 
case may be). Where the misrouting carrier alleges justification for 
using the higher rated route, the Board may, at its discretion and upon 
appropriate petition, determine or express an advisory opinion on the 
lawfulness of such routing. This interpretation must not be used to 
evade or defeat tariff rates or to meet the rate of a competing carrier 
or route, nor to relieve a shipper from responsibility for routing 
instructions. Damages caused by misrouting are not overcharges. 
Therefore, adjustments of claims for misrouting against rail and water 
carriers are governed by 49 U.S.C. 11706 (c)(1) and (d).

<R05>
Sec. 1005.1  Applicability of regulations.

    The regulations set forth in this part shall govern the processing 
of claims for loss, damage, injury, or delay to property transported or 
accepted for transportation, in interstate or foreign commerce, by each 
railroad, express company, motor carrier, water carrier, and freight 
forwarder (hereinafter called carrier), subject to the Interstate 
Commerce Act.
[46 FR 16224, Mar. 11, 1981]


<R05>
Sec. 1005.2  Filing of claims.

    (a) Compliance with regulations. A claim for loss or damage to 
baggage or for loss, damage, injury, or delay to cargo, shall not be 
voluntarily paid by a carrier unless filed, as provided in paragraph (b) 
of this section, with the receiving or delivering carrier, or carrier 
issuing the bill of lading, receipt, ticket, or baggage check, or 
carrier on whose line the alleged loss, damage, injury, or delay 
occurred, within the specified time limits applicable thereto and as 
otherwise may be required by law, the terms of the bill of lading or 
other contract of carriage, and all tariff provisions applicable 
thereto.
    (b) Minimum filing requirements. A written or electronic 
communication

[[Page 22]]

(when agreed to by the carrier and shipper or receiver involved) from a 
claimant, filed with a proper carrier within the time limits specified 
in the bill of lading or contract of carriage or transportation and: (1) 
Containing facts sufficient to identify the baggage or shipment (or 
shipments) of property, (2) asserting liability for alleged loss, 
damage, injury, or delay, and (3) making claim for the payment of a 
specified or determinable amount of money, shall be considered as 
sufficient compliance with the provisions for filing claims embraced in 
the bill of lading or other contract of carriage; Provided, however, 
That where claims are electronically handled, procedures are established 
to ensure reasonable carrier access to supporting documents.
    (c) Documents not constituting claims. Bad order reports, appraisal 
reports of damage, notations of shortage or damage, or both, on freight 
bills, delivery receipts, or other documents, or inspection reports 
issued by carriers or their inspection agencies, whether the extent of 
loss or damage is indicated in dollars and cents or otherwise, shall, 
standing alone, not be considered by carriers as sufficient to comply 
with the minimum claim filing requirements specified in paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (d) Claims filed for uncertain amounts. Whenever a claim is 
presented against a proper carrier for an uncertain amount, such as 
``$100 more or less,'' the carrier against whom such claim is filed 
shall determine the condition of the baggage or shipment involved at the 
time of delivery by it, if it was delivered, and shall ascertain as 
nearly as possible the extent, if any, of the loss or damage for which 
it may be responsible. It shall not, however, voluntarily pay a claim 
under such circumstances unless and until a formal claim in writing for 
a specified or determinable amount of money shall have been filed in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.
    (e) Other claims. If investigation of a claim develops that one or 
more other carriers has been presented with a similar claim on the same 
shipment, the carrier investigating such claim shall communicate with 
each such other carrier and, prior to any agreement entered into between 
or among them as to the proper disposition of such claim or claims, 
shall notify all claimants of the receipt of conflicting or overlapping 
claims and shall require further substantiation, on the part of each 
claimant of his title to the property involved or his right with respect 
to such claim.
[37 FR 4258, Mar. 1, 1972, as amended at 47 FR 12803, Mar. 25, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 1005.3  Acknowledgment of claims.

    (a) Each carrier shall, upon receipt in writing or by electronic 
transmission of a proper claim in the manner and form described in the 
regulations, acknowledge the receipt of such claim in writing or 
electronically to the claimant within 30 days after the date of its 
receipt by the carrier unless the carrier shall have paid or declined 
such claim in writing or electronically within 30 days of the receipt 
thereof. The carrier shall indicate in its acknowledgment to the 
claimant what, if any, additional documentary evidence or other 
pertinent information may be required by it further to process the claim 
as its preliminary examination of the claim, as filed, may have 
revealed.
    (b) The carrier shall at the time each claim is received create a 
separate file and assign thereto a successive claim file number and note 
that number on all documents filed in support of the claim and all 
records and correspondence with respect to the claim, including the 
acknowledgment of receipt. At the time such claim is received the 
carrier shall cause the date of receipt to be recorded on the face of 
the claim document, and the date of receipt shall also appear in the 
carrier's acknowledgment of receipt to the claimant. The carrier shall 
also cause the claim file number to be noted on the shipping order, if 
in its possession, and the delivery receipt, if any, covering such 
shipment, unless the carrier has established an orderly and consistent 
internal procedure for assuring: (1) That all information contained in 
shipping orders, delivery receipts, tally sheets, and all other 
pertinent records made with respect to the transportation of the 
shipment on which claim is made, is available for examination upon 
receipt of a claim; (2) that all such

[[Page 23]]

records and documents (or true and complete reproductions thereof) are 
in fact examined in the course of the investigation of the claim (and an 
appropriate record is made that such examination has in fact taken 
place); and (3) that such procedures prevent the duplicate or otherwise 
unlawful payment of claims.
[37 FR 4258, Mar. 1, 1972, as amended at 37 FR 20943, Oct. 10, 1972; 47 
FR 12803, Mar. 25, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 1005.4  Investigation of claims.

    (a) Prompt investigation required. Each claim filed against a 
carrier in the manner prescribed herein shall be promptly and thoroughly 
investigated if investigation has not already been made prior to receipt 
of the claim.
    (b) Supporting documents. When a necessary part of an investigation, 
each claim shall be supported by the original bill of lading, evidence 
of the freight charges, if any, and either the original invoice, a 
photographic copy of the original invoice, or an exact copy thereof or 
any extract made therefrom, certified by the claimant to be true and 
correct with respect to the property and value involved in the claim; or 
certification of prices or values, with trade or other discounts, 
allowance, or deductions, of any nature whatsoever and the terms 
thereof, or depreciation reflected thereon; Provided, however, That 
where property involved in a claim has not been invoiced to the 
consignee shown on the bill of lading or where an invoice does not show 
price or value, or where the property involved has been sold, or where 
the property has been transferred at bookkeeping values only, the 
carrier shall, before voluntarily paying a claim, require the claimant 
to establish the destination value in the quantity, shipped, 
transported, or involved; Provided, further, That when supporting 
documents are determined to be a necessary part of an investigation, the 
supporting documents are retained by the carriers for possible Board 
inspection.
    (c) Verification of Loss. When an asserted claim for loss of an 
entire package or an entire shipment cannot be otherwise authenticated 
upon investigation, the carrier shall obtain from the consignee of the 
shipment involved a certified statement in writing that the property for 
which the claim is filed has not been received from any other source.
[37 FR 4258, Mar. 1, 1972, as amended at 37 FR 23909, Nov. 10, 1972; 47 
FR 12803, Mar. 25, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 1005.5  Disposition of claims.

    (a) Each carrier subject to the Interstate Commerce Act which 
receives a written or electronically transmitted claim for loss or 
damage to baggage or for loss, damage, injury, or delay to property 
transported shall pay, decline, or make a firm compromise settlement 
offer in writing or electronically to the claimant within 120 days after 
receipt of the claim by the carrier; Provided, however, That, if the 
claim cannot be processed and disposed of within 120 days after the 
receipt thereof, the carrier shall at that time and at the expiration of 
each succeeding 60-day period while the claim remains pending, advise 
the claimant in writing or electronically of the status of the claim and 
the reason for the delay in making final disposition thereof and it 
shall retain a copy of such advice to the claimant in its claim file 
thereon.
    (b) When settling a claim for loss or damage, a common carrier by 
motor vehicle of household goods as defined in Sec. 1056.1(b)(1) shall 
use the replacement costs of the lost or damaged item as a base to apply 
a depreciation factor to arrive at the current actual value of the lost 
or damaged item: Provided, That where an item cannot be replaced or no 
suitable replacement is obtainable, the proper measure of damages shall 
be the original costs, augmented by a factor derived from a consumer 
price index, and adjusted downward by a factor depreciation over average 
useful life.

<R05>
Sec. 1005.6  Processing of salvage.

    (a) Whenever baggage or material, goods, or other property 
transported by a carrier subject to the provisions herein contained is 
damaged or alleged to be damaged and is, as a consequence thereof, not 
delivered or is rejected or refused upon tender thereof to the owner, 
consignee, or person entitled to

[[Page 24]]

receive such property, the carrier, after giving due notice, whenever 
practicable to do so, to the owner and other parties that may have an 
interest therein, and unless advised to the contrary after giving such 
notice, shall undertake to sell or dispose of such property directly or 
by the employment of a competent salvage agent. The carrier shall only 
dispose of the property in a manner that will fairly and equally protect 
the best interests of all persons having an interest therein. The 
carrier shall make an itemized record sufficient to identify the 
property involved so as to be able to correlate it to the shipment or 
transportation involved, and claim, if any, filed thereon. The carrier 
also shall assign to each lot of such property a successive lot number 
and note that lot number on its record of shipment and claim, if any 
claim is filed thereon.
    (b) Whenever disposition of salvage material or goods shall be made 
directly to an agent or employee of a carrier or through a salvage agent 
or company in which the carrier or one or more of its directors, 
officers, or managers has any interest, financial or otherwise, that 
carrier's salvage records shall fully reflect the particulars of each 
such transaction or relationship, or both, as the case may be.
    (c) Upon receipt of a claim on a shipment on which salvage has been 
processed in the manner hereinbefore prescribed, the carrier shall 
record in its claim file thereon the lot number assigned, the amount of 
money recovered, if any, from the disposition of such property, and the 
date of transmittal of such money to the person or persons lawfully 
entitled to receive the same.

Sec. 1005.7  Weight as a measure of loss.

    Where weight is used as a measure of loss in rail transit of scrap 
iron and steel and actual tare and gross weights are determined at 
origin and destination, the settlement of claims shall be based upon a 
comparison of net weights at origin and destination.

Sec. 1007.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This part contains the rules of the Surface Transportation Board 
implementing the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a). These rules apply 
to all records maintained by this Board which are not excepted or 
exempted as provided for in Sec. 1007.12, insofar as they contain 
personal information concerning an individual, identify that individual 
by name or other symbol and are contained in a system of records from 
which information is retrieved by the individual's name or identifying 
symbol. Among the primary purposes of these rules are to permit 
individuals to determine whether information about them is contained in 
Board files and, if so, to obtain access to that information; to 
establish procedures whereby individuals may have inaccurate and 
incomplete information corrected; and, to restrict access by 
unauthorized persons to that information.
    (b) In this part the Board is also exempting certain Board systems 
of records from some of the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 that 
would otherwise be applicable to those systems.

[[Page 26]]

Sec. 1007.5 of these rules, the Board shall require reasonable

information is given and records are disclosed only to the proper 
person.
    (a) An individual may establish his identity by:

    (c) The requirements of this subsection shall not apply if the 
records involved would be available to any person under the Freedom of

<R05>
Sec. 1007.5  Disclosure of requested information to individuals; fees for copies of records.

has furnished a written statement authorizing discussion of his or her 
record in the accompanying person's presence.

where the records are maintained during normal business hours, but for 
good cause shown the Board may grant access at another office of the 
Board or at different times for the convenience of the individual making 
the request. When a request for access is from a Board employee, this 
request may be granted by forwarding the information desired through 
registered mail, return receipt requested.
    (c) Where a document containing information about an individual also 
contains information not pertaining to him or her, the portion not 
pertaining to the individual shall not be disclosed except to the extent 
the information is available to any person under the Freedom of 
Information Act. If the records sought cannot be provided for review and 
copying in a meaningful form, the Board shall provide to the individual 
a summary of the information concerning the individual contained in the 
record or records which shall be complete and accurate in all material 
aspects.
    (d) Where the disclosure involves medical records, the Privacy 
Officer may determine that such information will be provided only to a 
physician designated by the individual.

Officer or to the member of the Board's staff through whom arrangements 
for access were made.
    (f) Fees for copies of records shall be charged at the rate set

    (a) Any individual may request amendment of information pertaining

could impair the effectiveness and orderly conduct of the Board's 
enforcement program. Provided, however, That if any individual is denied 
any right, privilege, or benefit to which he or she would otherwise be 
entitled by Federal law, or for which he or she would otherwise be 
eligible, as a result of the maintenance of such material, such

identity of the source would be held in confidence.

determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for employment

whom information is sought to provide information to the Board which, 
absent assurances of confidentiality, they might otherwise be unwilling 
to give. However, if practicable, material identifying a confidential 
source shall be extracted or summarized in a manner which protects the 
source, and the summary or extract shall be provided to the requesting 
individual.

a meeting be called on less than one week's notice, the meeting may be 
called on short notice, and public notice will be posted and published 
at the earliest practicable time.
    (f) Changes in the scheduling of a meeting which has been the 
subject of a public notice will also be made the subject of a public 
notice, which will be posted at the earliest practicable time. Changes 
in, or additions to a conference agenda or in the open or closed status 
of a meeting will be made only if a majority of the Board Members 
eligible to participate in the conduct or disposition of the matter 
which is the subject of the meeting determines, by recorded vote, that 
the Board's business requires such change and that no earlier 
announcement of the change was possible. In such a case, the public 
notice of the change, will show the vote of each Board Member on the 
change.

adjudication; (iii) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy; (iv) disclose the identity of a confidential investigation

the meeting, it may be disposed of as the first order of business at the 
meeting, in which case the decision will be communicated to the 
petitioner orally through the Board's Public Information Officer or 
other spokesperson.

records, but only to the extent that the production of such records or 
information would (i) interfere with enforcement proceedings, (ii)

adjudication, (iii) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy, (iv) disclose the identity of a confidential source and (in the

PART 1013--GUIDELINES FOR THE PROPER USE OF VOTING TRUSTS--Table of Contents

<R05>


Sec.
1013.1  The independence of the trustee of a voting trust.
1013.2  The irrevocability of the trust.
1013.3  Review and reporting requirements for regulated carriers.

    Authority:  49 U.S.C. 721, 13301(f).

    Source:  44 FR 59909, Oct. 17, 1979, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1013.1  The independence of the trustee of a voting trust.

    (a) In order to avoid an unlawful control violation, the independent 
voting trust should be established before a controlling block of voting 
securities is purchased.
    (b) In voting the trusteed stock, the trustee should maintain 
complete independence from the creator of the trust (the settlor).
    (c) Neither the trustee, the settlor, nor their respective 
affiliates should have any officers or board members in common or direct 
business arrangements, other than the voting trust, that could be 
construed as creating an indicium of control by the settlor over the 
trustee.
    (d) The trustee should not use the voting power of the trust in any 
way which would create any dependence or intercorporate relationship 
between the settlor and the carrier whose corporate securities 
constitute the corpus of the trust.
    (e) The trustee should be entitled to receive cash dividends 
declared and paid upon the trusteed voting stock and turn them over to 
the settlor. Dividends other than cash should be received and held by 
the trustee upon the same terms and conditions as the stock which 
constitutes the corpus of the trust.
    (f) If the trustee becomes disqualified because of a violation of 
the trust agreement or if the trustee resigns, the settlor should 
appoint a successor trustee within 15 days.

[[Page 42]]


<R05>
Sec. 1013.2  The irrevocability of the trust.

    (a) The trust and the nomination of the trustee during the term of 
the trust should be irrevocable.
    (b) The trust should remain in effect until certain events, 
specified in the trust, occur. For example, the trust might remain in 
effect until (1) all the deposited stock is sold to a person not 
affiliated with the settlor or (2) the trustee receives a Board decision 
authorizing the settlor to acquire control of the carrier or authorizing 
the release of the securities for any reason.
    (c) The settlor should not be able to control the events terminating 
the trust except by filing with this Board an application to control the 
carrier whose stock is held in trust.
    (d) The trust agreement should contain provisions to ensure that no 
violations of 49 U.S.C. 11343 will result from termination of the trust.


<R05>
Sec. 1013.3  Review and reporting requirements for regulated carriers.

    (a) Any carrier choosing to utilize a voting trust may voluntarily 
submit a copy of the voting trust to the Board for review. The Board's 
staff will give an informal, nonbinding opinion as to whether the voting 
trust effectively insulates the settlor from any violation of Board 
policy against unauthorized acquisition of control of a regulated 
carrier.
    (b) Any person who establishes an independent trust for the receipt 
of the voting stock of carrier must file a copy of the trust, along with 
any auxiliary or modifying documents, with the Board.
    (c) Any carrier required to file a Schedule 13D with the Securities 
and Exchange Board (17 CFR 240.13d-1) which reports the purchase of 5 
percent or more of the registered securities of another I.C.C. regulated 
carrier (or the listed shares of a company controlling 10 percent or 
more of the stock of an I.C.C. regulated carrier), must simultaneously 
file a copy of that schedule with this Board, along with any supplements 
to that schedule.
    (d) Failure to comply with the reporting requirements in paragraphs 
(b) or (c) of this section will result in denial of the application in 
which acquisition of control, through the acquisition of the voting 
stock of another carrier, is sought, unless the applicant shows, by 
clear and convincing evidence, and the Board finds, that the failure to 
comply was unintentional and that denial of the application will 
substantially and adversely affect the public interest and the national 
transportation policy.

agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant historic features of an historic property; or
    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 1014.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that 
handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or 
activity.
    (b) Methods--(1) General. The agency may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and 
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any 
other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not 
required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other 
methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The 
agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet 
accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any 
regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for 
meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority 
to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified 
handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 1014.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall 
give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped 
persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is 
not required because of Sec. 1014.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative 
methods of achieving program accessibility include--
    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through 
portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987, a transition plan setting 
forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall 
provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped 
persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan

[[Page 47]]

shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a 
minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped 
persons;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 1014.151  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the 
Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 
CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this 
section.

Sec. 1014.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
handicapped person.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and adminstrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 1014.160 would 
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or 
his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for 
use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, 
and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for 
reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this 
section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency 
shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration 
or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum 
extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services 
of the program or activity.

Sec. 1014.170  Compliance procedures.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this 
section applies to all allegations of discrimination on the basis of 
handicap in programs or activities conducted by the agency.

[[Page 48]]

    (b) The agency shall process complaints alleging violations of 
section 504 with respect to employment according to the procedures 
established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR 
part 1613 pursuant to section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29

coordinating implementation of this section. Complaints may be sent to 
Director, Office of Human Relations, Surface Transportation Board, Room 
3147, Washington, DC 20423.
    (d) The agency shall accept and investigate all complete complaints 
for which it has jurisdiction. All complete complaints must be filed 
within 180 days of the alleged act of discrimination. The agency may 
extend this time period for good cause.
    (e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have 
jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make 
reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate government 
entity.
    (f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation 
Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a 
building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), or section 502 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 792), is not readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.
    (g) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which 
it has jurisdiction, the agency shall notify the complainant of the 
results of the investigation in a letter containing--
    (1) Findings of fact and conclusions of law;
    (2) A description of a remedy for each violation found; and
    (3) A notice of the right to appeal.
    (h) Appeals of the findings of fact and conclusions of law or 
remedies must be filed by the complainant within 90 days of receipt from 
the agency of the letter required by Sec. 1014.170(g). The agency may 
extend this time for good cause.
    (i) Timely appeals shall be accepted and processed by the head of 
the agency.
    (j) The head of the agency shall notify the complainant of the 
results of the appeal within 60 days of the receipt of the request. If 
the head of the agency determines that additional information is needed 
from the complainant, he or she shall have 60 days from the date of 
receipt of the additional information to make his or her determination 
on the appeal.
    (k) The time limits cited in paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section 
may be extended with the permission of the Assistant Attorney General.
    (l) The agency may delegate its authority for conducting complaint

<R04>
                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 1016.101  Purpose of these rules.

    The Equal Access to Justice Act (5 U.S.C. 504) (called the ``Act'' 
in this part), provides for the award of attorney fees and other 
expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain 
administrative proceedings (called ``adversary adjudications'') before 
the Surface Transportation Board. An eligible party may receive an award 
when it prevails over the Board or another agency of the United States 
participating in the Board proceeding, unless the Board's position in 
the proceeding, or that of the other agency, was substantially justified 
or special circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in this part 
describe the parties eligible for awards and the proceedings that are 
covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, and the procedures 
and standards that the Board will use to make them.


<R05>
Sec. 1016.102  When the Act applies.

    The Act applies to any adversary adjudication pending before the 
Board after October 1, 1981. This includes proceedings begun before 
October 1, 1981, if final Board action has not been taken before that 
date, regardless of when they were initiated or when final Board action 
occurs. These rules incorporate the changes made in Pub. L. No. 99-80, 
99 Stat. 183, which applies generally to cases instituted after October 
1, 1984. If awards are sought for cases pending on October 1, 1981 or 
filed between that date and September 30, 1984, the prior statutory 
provisions (to the extent they differ from the existing ones, and our 
implementing rules) apply.
[54 FR 26379, June 23, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 1016.103  Proceedings covered.

    (a) The Act applies to adversary adjudications conducted by the 
Board under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of this or any other 
agency of the United States, or any component of an agency, is presented 
by an attorney or other representative (hereinafter ``agency counsel'') 
who enters an appearance and participates in the proceeding. Proceedings 
for the purpose of establishing or fixing a rate are not covered by the 
Act. Proceedings to grant or renew licenses are also excluded, but 
proceedings to modify, suspend, or revoke licenses are covered if they 
are otherwise ``adversary adjudications.'' Generally, the types of Board 
proceedings covered by the Act include, but are not limited to, 
investigation proceedings instituted under 49 U.S.C. 11701 and 49 U.S.C. 
10925 and disciplinary proceedings conducted pursuant to 49 CFR 1100.11.
    (b) The Board may also designate a proceeding not listed in 
paragraph (a) of this section as an adversary adjudication for purposes 
of the Act by so stating in an order initiating the proceeding, 
designating the matter for hearing or at any other time during the 
proceeding. The Board's failure to designate a proceeding as an 
adversary adjudication shall not preclude the filing of an application 
by a party who believes the proceeding is covered by the Act; whether 
the proceeding is covered will then be an issue for resolution in 
proceedings on the application.
    (c) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the Act and 
matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include 
only fees and expenses related to covered issues.


<R05>
Sec. 1016.104  Decisionmaking authority.

    Unless otherwise ordered by the Board in a particular proceeding, 
each application for an award under this part shall be assigned for 
decision to the official or decisionmaking body that entered the 
decision in the adversary adjudication. That official or decisionmaking 
body is referred to in this part as the ``adjudicative officer.''
[46 FR 61660, Dec. 18, 1981, as amended at 54 FR 26379, June 23, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 1016.105  Eligibility of applicants.

    (a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses 
under the Act, the applicant must be a party to the adversary 
adjudication for which it seeks an award, it must have stood in an 
adversary relationship to the position taken by agency counsel, and it

[[Page 50]]

must have prevailed on one or more of the issues raised by agency 
counsel. The term ``party''is defined in 5 U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(B). The 
applicant must show that it meets all conditions of eligibility set out 
in this subpart and in Subpart B.
    (b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:
    (1) An individual whose net worth did not exceed $2 million at the 
time the adversary adjudication was initiated;
    (2) Any owner of an unincorporated business, or any partnership, 
corporation, association, unit of local government, or organization 
whose net worth does not exceed $7 million and which had no more than 
500 employees at the time the adversary adjudication was initiated;
    (3) Any organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) exempt from taxation under 
section 501(a) of such Code, or a cooperative association as defined in 
section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)), 
may be a party regardless of the net worth of such organization or 
cooperative association.
    (c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of 
employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the 
proceeding was initiated.
    (d) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly 
perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the 
applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included 
on a proportional basis. Independent contractors under lease to motor 
carriers are not employees of the carriers under these rules. Also, 
agents for motor common carriers of household goods are not employees of 
their respective principal carriers.
    (e) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all 
of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any 
individual, corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly 
controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of 
the applicant or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant 
directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares 
or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this 
part, unless the adjudicative officer determines that such treatment 
would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in light of the 
actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the 
adjudicative officer may determine that financial relationships of the 
applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute 
special circumstances that would make an award unjust.
    (f) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on 
behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible 
is not itself eligible for an award.
[46 FR 61660, Dec. 18, 1981, as amended at 54 FR 26379, June 23, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 1016.106  Standards for awards.

    (a) A prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and 
expenses incurred in connection with a proceeding, or in a significant 
and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, unless the position 
of the agency over which the applicant has prevailed was substantially 
justified. Whether or not the position of the agency was substantially 
justified shall be determined on the basis of the administrative record 
made in the adversary adjudication for which fees and other expenses are 
sought. The burden of proof that an award should not be made to an 
eligible prevailing applicant is on the agency counsel, which may avoid 
an award by showing that its position was reasonable in law and fact.
    (b) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly 
or unreasonably protracted the proceeding or if special circumstances 
make the award sought unjust.
[46 FR 61660, Dec. 18, 1981, as amended at 54 FR 26379, June 23, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 1016.107  Allowable fees and expenses.

    (a) Awards will be based on rates customarily charged by persons 
engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents and expert 
witnesses, even if the services were made available without charge or at 
a reduced rate to the applicant.

[[Page 51]]

    (b) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under these rules 
may exceed $75.00 per hour, unless a higher fee is justified. 5 U.S.C. 
504(b)(1)(A). However, an award may also include the reasonable expenses 
of the attorney, agent, or witness as a separate item, if the attorney, 
agent, or witness ordinarily charges clients separately for such 
expenses.
    (c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an 
attorney, agent or expert witness, the adjudicative officer shall 
consider the following:
    (1) If the attorney, agent or witness is in private practice, his or 
her customary fee for similar services, or, if an employee of the 
applicant, the fully allocated cost of the services;
    (2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in 
which the attorney, agent, or witness ordinarily performs services;
    (3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;
    (4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or 
complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and
    (5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services 
provided.
    (d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, 
test, project or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be 
awarded, to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed 
the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter 
was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.
[46 FR 61660, Dec. 18, 1981, as amended at 54 FR 26379, June 23, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 1016.109  Awards against other agencies.

    If an applicant is entitled to an award because it prevails over 
another agency of the United States that participates in a proceeding 
before this agency and takes a position that is not substantially 
justified, the award or an appropriate portion of the award shall be 
made against that agency.


<R04>
             Subpart B--Information Required From Applicants


<R05>
Sec. 1016.201  Contents of application.

    (a) An application for an award of fees and expenses under the Act 
shall identify the applicant and the proceeding for which an award is 
sought. The application shall show that the applicant has prevailed and 
identify the position of the Board or other agencies in the proceeding 
that the applicant alleges was not substantially justified. Unless the 
applicant is an individual, the application shall also state the number 
of employees of the applicant and describe briefly the type and purpose 
of its organization or business.
    (b) The application shall also include a statement that the 
applicant's net worth does not exceed $2 million (if an individual) or 
$7 million (for all other applicants, including their affiliates). 
However, an applicant may omit this statement if:
    (1) It attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service 
that it qualifies as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of 
the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) exempt from taxation 
under section 501(a) of such Code; or
    (2) It states that it is a cooperative association as defined in 
section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)).
    (c) The application shall state the amount of fees and expenses for 
which an award is sought.
    (d) The application may also include any other matters that the 
applicant wishes the Board to consider in determining whether and in 
what amount an award should be made.
    (e) The application shall be signed by the applicant or an 
authorized officer or attorney of the applicant. It shall also contain 
or be accompanied by a written verification under oath or under penalty 
of perjury that the information provided in the application is true and 
correct.
[46 FR 61660, Dec. 18, 1981, as amended at 54 FR 26380, June 23, 1989]

[[Page 52]]


<R05>
Sec. 1016.202  Net worth exhibit.

    (a) Each applicant must provide with its application a detailed 
exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as 
defined in Sec. 1016.105(f) of this part) when the proceeding was 
initiated. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant 
that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' 
assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the 
applicant qualifies under the standards in this part. The adjudicative 
officer may require an applicant to file additional information to 
determine its eligibility for an award.
    (b) Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public 
record of the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public 
disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes 
that there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may file 
a motion to withhold the information from public disclosure. The burden 
is on the moving party to justify the confidentiality of the 
information.

<R05>
Sec. 1016.203  Documentation of fees and expenses.

    The application shall be accompanied by full documentation of the 
fees and expenses, including the cost of any study, analysis, 
engineering report, test, project or similar matter, for which an award 
is sought. A separate itemized statement shall be submitted for each 
professional firm or individual whose services are covered by the 
application, showing the hours spent in connection with the proceeding 
by each individual, a description of the specific services performed, 
the rate at which each fee has been computed, any expenses for which 
reimbursement is sought, the total amount claimed, and the total amount 
paid or payable by the applicant or by another person or entity for the 
services provided. The adjudicative officer may require the applicant to 
provide vouchers, receipts, or other substantiation for any expenses 
claimed.


<R04>
           Subpart C--Procedures for Considering Applications


<R05>
Sec. 1016.301  When an application may be filed.

    (a) An application may be filed whenever the applicant has prevailed 
in the proceeding or in a significant and discrete substantive portion 
of the proceeding, but in no case later than 30 days after an 
administratively final disposition of the proceeding.
    (b) If review or reconsideration is sought or taken of a decision as 
to which an applicant believes it has prevailed, proceedings for the 
award of fees shall be stayed pending final disposition of the 
underlying controversy.
    (c) For purposes of this rule, see the Board's rules governing 
appellate procedures at Secs. 1115.2 and 1115.3 to determine when a 
decision becomes administratively final.
[46 FR 61660, Dec. 18, 1981, as amended at 54 FR 26380, June 23, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 1016.302  Filing and service of documents.

    Any application for an award or other pleading or document related 
to an application shall be filed and served on all parties to the 
proceeding in the same manner as other pleadings in the proceeding, 
except as provided in Sec. 1016.202(b) for confidential financial 
information.


<R05>
Sec. 1016.303  Answer to application.

    (a) Within 30 days after service of an application, counsel 
representing the agency against which an award is sought may file an 
answer to the application. Unless agency counsel requests an extension 
of time for filing or files a statement of intent to negotiate under 
paragraph (b) of this section, failure to file an answer within the 30-
day period may be treated as a consent to the award requested.
    (b) If agency counsel and the applicant believe that the issues in 
the fee application can be settled, they may jointly file a statement of 
their intent to negotiate a settlement. The filing of this statement 
shall extend the time for filing an answer for an additional 30 days, 
and further extensions may be granted as justified.

[[Page 53]]

    (c) The answer shall explain in detail any objections to the award 
requested and identify the facts relied on in support of agency 
counsel's position. If the answer is based on any alleged facts not 
already in the record of the proceeding, agency counsel shall include

<R05>
Sec. 1017.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) These regulations set forth guidelines for implementing the Debt 
Collection Act of 1982 at the Surface Transportation Board (STB). The 
purpose of the Act is to give agencies the ability to more aggressively 
pursue debts owed the Federal Government and to increase the efficiency 
of governmentwide efforts to collect debts owed the United States. The 
authority for these regulations is found in the Debt Collection Act of 
1982 (Pub. L. 97-365 and 4 CFR 101.1 et seq.), Collection by Offset From 
Indebted Government Employees (5 CFR 550.1101 et seq.), Federal Claims 
Collection Standards (4 CFR 101.1 et seq.), and Administrative Offset 
(31 U.S.C. 3716).
    (b) These regulations provide procedures for administrative offset 
of a Federal employee's salary without his/her consent to satisfy 
certain debts owed to the Federal Government. The regulations covered in 
this part apply to all current and former Federal employees who owe 
debts to the Board and to current Board employees who owe debts to other 
Federal agencies. The regulations set forth herein do not apply when the 
employee consents to recovery from his/her current pay account.
    (c) These regulations do not apply to debts or claims arising under:
    (1) The Social Security Act;
    (2) The Internal Revenue Code of 1954;
    (3) The tariff laws of the United States; or
    (4) Any case where a collection of a debt by salary offset is 
explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute.
    (d) These regulations also do not preclude the compromise, 
suspension, or termination of collection action, where appropriate, 
under the standards implementing the Federal Claims Collection Act (31 
U.S.C. 3711 et seq., 4 CFR 101.1 et seq.). These regulations do not 
preclude an employee's requesting a waiver of a salary overpayment 
(i.e., alleged indebtedness) under 5 U.S.C. 5584, 10 U.S.C. 2774, or 32 
U.S.C. 716, or in any way questioning the amount or validity of a debt 
by submitting a claim to the General Accounting Office (GAO), or 
requesting a waiver under statutory provisions pertaining to the 
particular debt.
    (e) The Board's regulations governing debt collection for entities 
and individuals who are not current or former government employees are 
contained in 49 CFR part 1018.

    (a) Upon the Administrative Law Judge's determination of an 
employee's compliance with Sec. 1017.4(b)(8) or Sec. 1017.4(c)(7) of 
this part, whichever is applicable, he/she shall set the time, date, and

    (b) All significant matters discussed at the hearing shall be 
documented, although a verbatim transcript of the hearing shall not be 
made.
    (c) The Administrative Law Judge may exclude any evidence he/she 
deems irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious.

and amount of the debt.
    (f) The employee requesting the hearing shall bear the ultimate 
burden of proof.
    (g) The evidence presented by the employee must prove that no debt 
exists or cast sufficient doubt that reasonable minds could differ as to

<R05>
Sec. 1017.6  Result if employee fails to meet deadlines.

whichever is applicable. However, failure to file within the requisite 
time period set out in Sec. 1017.4(b)(8) or Sec. 1017.4(c)(9) of this 
part whichever is applicable, will not result in denial of a hearing or 
in immediate offset, if the Administrative Law Judge excuses the late 
filing if the employee can show that the delay was because of 
circumstances beyond his/her control or because of failure to receive 
notice of the filing deadline.
    (b) Is scheduled to appear and fails to appear at the hearing 
without good cause.


<R05>
Sec. 1017.7  Written decision following hearing.

accordance with procedures prescribed by GAO.


<R05>
Sec. 1017.8  Exception to entitlement to notice, hearing, written responses and final decisions.

    The Board shall except from the provisions of Sec. 1017.4 through 
Sec. 1017.7 any adjustment to pay arising out of an

[[Page 58]]

employee's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal 
benefits program, requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the amount 
to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less.


<R05>
Sec. 1017.9  Coordinating offset with another Federal agency.

    (a) The Board as creditor agency. When the Chief, Budget and Fiscal 
Office, determines that an employee of another Federal agency owes a 
delinquent debt to the Board, he/she shall:
    (1) Arrange for a hearing upon proper petitioning by the employee;
    (2) Certify in writing to the other Federal agency that the employee 
owes the debt, the amount and basis of the debt, the date on which 
payment is due, the date the Government's right to collect the debt 
accrued, that the Board's regulations for administrative offset have 
been approved by the Office of Personnel Management, and that the 
provisions of 4 CFR 102.3(f) have been fully complied with;
    (3) If collection must be made in installments, advise the paying 
agency of the amount or percentage of disposable pay to be collected in 
each installment;
    (4) Advise the paying agency of any action taken under 5 U.S.C. 
5514(a);
    (5) If the employee is in the process of separating, the Board must 
submit its debt claim to the paying agency as provided in this part. The 
paying agency must certify any amounts already collected, notify the 
employee, and send a copy of the certification and notice of the 
employee's separation to the creditor agency--if the paying agency is 
aware that the employee is entitled to money from the Civil Service 
Retirement and Disability Fund, it must certify to the Office of 
Personnel Management (OPM) that:
    (i) The debtor owes the U.S. a debt, including the amount of that 
debt;
    (ii) The Board has complied with the applicable statutes, 
regulations, and procedures of OPM; and
    (iii) The Board has complied with the requirements of 4 CFR 102.3, 
including any hearing or review; and
    (6) If the employee has already separated and all payments due from 
the paying agency have been paid, the Chief, Budget and Fiscal Office, 
may request from OPM, unless otherwise prohibited, that money payable to 
the employee from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or 
other similar funds be collected by administrative offset and provide 
the certification described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
    (b) The Board as paying agency. (1) Upon receipt of a properly 
certified debt claim from another agency, deductions will be scheduled 
to begin at the next established pay interval. The employee must receive 
written notice that the Board has received a certified debt claim from 
the creditor agency, the amount of the debt, the date administrative 
offset will begin, and the amount of the deduction(s). The Board shall 
not review the merits of the creditor agency's determination of the 
validity or the amount of the certified claim.
    (2) When the Board receives an incomplete debt from another 
(creditor) agency, the Board must return the debt claim with a notice 
that procedures under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR 1108 must be provided and 
a properly certified debt claim received before action will be taken to 
collect from the employee's current pay account.
    (3) If the employee transfers to another agency after the creditor 
agency has submitted its debt claim to the Board and before the debt is 
fully collected, the Board must certify the total amount collected to 
the creditor agency, along with notice of the transfer, and furnish a 
copy of same to the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 1017.10  Procedures for administrative offset.

    (a) Debts will be collected in one lump sum where possible. If the 
employee is financially unable to pay in one lump sum, collection shall 
be made in installments.
    (b) Debts shall be collected by deduction at officially established 
pay intervals from an employee's current pay account, unless alternative 
arrangements for repayment are made.
    (c) Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater 
than the anticipated period of employment. The size of installment 
deductions must bear a reasonable relationship to

[[Page 59]]

the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. The deduction 
for the pay intervals for any period shall not exceed 15 percent of 
disposable pay, unless the employee has agreed in writing to a deduction 
of a greater amount.
    (d) Unliquidated debts may be offset against any financial payment 
due to a separated employee (including, but not limited to, final salary 
payment or lump-sum payment for leave).


<R05>
Sec. 1017.11  Refunds.

    (a) The Board shall promptly refund any amounts deducted to satisfy 
debts owed to it when the debt is waived, found not owed to the Board, 
or when directed by an administrative or judicial order.
    (b) A creditor agency will promptly return any amounts deducted by 
the Board to satisfy debts owed to a creditor agency when the debt is 
waived, found not owed, or when directed by an administrative or 
judicial order.
    (c) Unless required by law, refunds under this subsection shall not 
bear interest.


<R05>
Sec. 1017.12  Statute of limitations.

    If a debt has been outstanding for more than 10 years after the 
agency's right to collect the debt first accrued, the agency may not 
collect by salary offset unless facts material to the Government's right 
to collect were not known and could not reasonably have been known by 
the official or officials who were charged with the responsibility for 
discovery and collection of such debts.


<R05>
Sec. 1017.13  Nonwaiver of rights.

    An employee's involuntary payment of all or any part of a debt 
collected under these regulations will not be construed as a waiver of 
any rights that employee may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514 or any other 
provision of law.


<R05>
Sec. 1017.14  Interest, penalties, and administrative costs.

    (a) The rate of interest assessed shall be the rate of the current 
value of funds to the U.S. Treasury (i.e., the Treasury tax and loan 
account rate), as prescribed and published by the Secretary of the 
Treasury in the Federal Register and the Treasury Financial Manual 
Bulletins. A higher rate of interest can be assessed if the Board can 
reasonably determine that a higher rate is necessary to protect the 
interests of the United States. The rate of interest, as initially 
assessed, shall remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness, 
except where a debtor has defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks 
to enter into a new agreement. The Board may set a new interest rate 
which reflects the current value of funds to the Treasury at the time 
the new agreement is executed. The Board shall waive the collection of 
interest on the debt or any portion of the debt which is paid within 30 
days after the date on which interest began to accrue.
    (b) The Board shall assess a penalty charge not to exceed 6 percent 
a year on any portion of a debt that is delinquent as defined in 4 CFR 
101.2(b) for more than 90 days. This charge need not be calculated until 
the 91st day of delinquency, but shall accrue from the date that the 
debt became delinquent.
    (c) The Board shall assess against a debtor charges to cover 
administrative costs incurred as a result of a delinquent debt--that is, 
the additional costs incurred in processing and handling the debt 
because it became delinquent as defined in 4 CFR 101.2(b).
    (d) When a debt is paid in partial or installment payments, amounts 
received by the agency shall be applied first to outstanding penalty and 
administrative cost charges, second to accrued interest, and third to 
outstanding principal.

                   Subpart A--Application and Coverage


<R05>
Sec. 1018.1  Application.

    (a) This part applies to claims for the payment of debts owed to the 
United States Government in the form of money or property and unless a 
different procedure is specified in a statute, regulation, or a 
contractual agreement with the Board, prescribes procedures by which the 
Board:
    (1) Collects, compromises, suspends, and terminates collection 
actions for claims;
    (2) Determines and collects interest and other charges on these 
claims; and
    (3) Refers unpaid claims to the General Accounting Office (GAO) and 
the Department of Justice (DOJ) for litigation.
    (b) The following are examples of the kinds of debts to which 
special statutory and administrative procedures apply:
    (1) A claim against an employee for erroneous payment of pay and 
allowances subject to waiver under 5 U.S.C. 5584 and other claims 
against employees which are handled under 49 CFR part 1017.
    (2) A claim involving the payment of civil penalties or forfeitures 
which may arise under provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act or 
legislation supplemental thereto. Those claims are handled under 
procedures set forth in 49 CFR part 1021.
    (3) A claim involved in a case pending before any Federal Contract 
Appeals Board or Grant Appeals Board. However, nothing in this part 
prevents negotiation and settlement of a claim pending before a Board.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.2  Definitions.

    (a) Administrative offset means withholding money payable by the 
United States to, or held by the Government for, a person to satisfy a 
debt the person owes the Government.
    (b) Claim and debt are used synonymously and interchangeably for 
purposes of this part. These terms refer to an amount of money or 
property which has been determined by an appropriate agency official to 
be owed to the United States by any person, organization,

[[Page 61]]

or entity except another Federal agency.
    (c) Delinquent. A debt is considered delinquent if it has not been 
paid by the date specified in the initial written demand for payment or 
applicable contractual agreement with the Board, unless other 
satisfactory payment arrangements have been made by that date. If the 
debtor fails to satisfy an obligation under a payment agreement with the 
Board after other payment arrangements have been made, the debt becomes 
a delinquent debt.
    (d) Payment in full means payment of the total debt due the United 
States, including any interest, penalty, and administrative costs of 
collection assessed against the debtor.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.3  Communications.

    Unless otherwise specified, all communications concerning the 
regulations in this part should be addressed to Chief, Budget and Fiscal 
Office, Surface Transportation Board, room 1330, Washington, DC 20423.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.4  Claims that are covered.

    (a) These procedures generally apply to any claim for payment of a 
debt which:
    (1) Results from activities of the Board including fees imposed 
under 49 CFR part 1002; or
    (2) Is referred to the Board for collection.
    (b) These procedures do not apply to:
    (1) A claim based on a civil monetary penalty for violation of a 
requirement of the Interstate Commerce Act or an order or regulation of 
the Board unless 49 CFR part 1021 provides otherwise;
    (2) A claim as to which there is an indication of fraud, the 
presentation of a false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of the 
debtor, or any other party having an interest in the claim;
    (3) A claim between Federal agencies; and
    (4) A claim once it becomes subject to salary offset which is 
governed by 5 U.S.C. 5514.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.5  Monetary limitation on Board authority.

    The Board's authority to compromise a claim or to terminate or 
suspend collection action on a claim covered by these procedures is 
limited by 31 U.S.C. 3711(a) to claims that:
    (a) Have not been referred to another Federal agency, including the 
GAO, for further collection action; and
    (b) Do not exceed $100,000, exclusive of interest, penalties, and 
administrative costs (the monetary limitation).


<R05>
Sec. 1018.6  Omissions not a defense.

    (a) The failure of the Board to include in this part any provision 
of the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 4 CFR parts 101 through 105, 
does not prevent the Board from applying these provisions.
    (b) A debtor may not use the failure of the Board to comply with any 
provision of this part or the Federal Claims Collection Standards as a 
defense to the debt.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.7  Conversion claims.

    These procedures are directed primarily to the recovery of money on 
behalf of the Government. The Board may demand:
    (a) The return of specific property; or
    (b) Either the return of property or the payment of its value.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.8  Subdivision of claims.

    The Board shall consider a debtor's liability arising from a 
particular transaction or contract as a single claim in determining 
whether the claim is less than the monetary limitation for the purpose 
of compromising or suspending or terminating collection action. A claim 
may not be subdivided to avoid the monetary limitation established by 31 
U.S.C. 3711(a)(2) and Sec. 1018.5 of this part.


<R04>
             Subpart B--Administrative Collection of Claims


<R05>
Sec. 1018.20  Written demand for payment.

    (a) The Board shall make appropriate written demand upon the debtor 
for payment of money in terms which specify:
    (1) The basis for the indebtedness and the right of the debtor to 
request review within the Board;
    (2) The amount claimed;
    (3) The date by which payment is to be made, which normally should 
not be more than 30 days from the date that

[[Page 62]]

the initial demand letter statement was mailed, unless otherwise 
specified by contractual agreement, established by Federal statute or 
regulation, or agreed to under a payment agreement;
    (4) The applicable standards for assessing interest, penalties, and 
administrative costs (4 CFR 102.13 and 49 CFR 1018.30); and
    (5) The applicable policy for reporting the delinquent debt to 
consumer reporting agencies.
    (b) The Board normally shall send three progressively stronger 
written demands at not more than 30-day intervals, unless circumstances 
indicate that alternative remedies better protect the Government's 
interest, that the debtor has explicitly refused to pay, or that sending 
a further demand is futile. Depending upon the circumstances of the 
particular case, the second and third demands may:
    (1) Offer or seek to confer with the debtor;
    (2) State the amount of the interest and penalties that will be 
added on a daily basis, as well as the administrative costs that will be 
added to the debt until the debt is paid; and
    (3) State that the authorized collection procedures include any 
procedure authorized in this part including:
    (i) Contacts with the debtor's employer when the debtor is employed 
by the Federal Government or is a member of the military establishment 
or the Coast Guard;
    (ii) Possible referral of the debt to a private agency for 
collection;
    (iii) Possible reporting of the delinquent debt to consumer 
reporting agencies in accordance with the guidelines and standards 
contained in 4 CFR 102.5 and the Board's procedures set forth in 
Sec. 1018.23 of this part;
    (iv) The suspension or revocation of a license or other remedy under 
Sec. 1018.25 of this part;
    (v) Installment payments possibly requiring security; and
    (vi) The right to refer claims to GAO or DOJ for litigation.
    (c) The failure to state in a letter of demand a matter described in 
Sec. 1018.20 is not a defense for a debtor and does not prevent the 
Board from proceeding with respect to that matter.
[58 FR 7749, Feb. 9, 1993; 58 FR 11099, Feb. 23, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 1018.21  Telephone inquiries and investigations.

    (a) If a debtor has not responded to one or more written demands, 
the Board shall make reasonable efforts by telephone to determine the 
debtor's intentions. If the debtor cannot be reached by telephone at the 
debtor's place of employment, the Board may telephone the debtor at his 
or her residence between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m.
    (b) The Board may undertake an investigation to locate a debtor, if 
the whereabouts of a debtor is a problem, or if a debtor cannot be 
contacted by telephone. The Board may also send a representative to a 
debtor's place of employment if the debtor cannot be contacted by phone 
or the debtor does not respond to written demands by the Board for 
payment of claims.
    (c) The Board under 15 U.S.C. 1681(f) may obtain consumer credit 
information from private firms, including name, address, former address, 
place of employment, and former place of employment of a debtor.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.22  Personal interviews.

    (a) The Board may seek an interview with the debtor at the offices 
of the Board when:
    (1) A matter involved in the claim needs clarification;
    (2) Information is needed concerning the debtor's circumstances; or
    (3) An agreement of payment might be negotiated.
    (b) The Board shall grant an interview with a debtor upon the 
debtor's request. The Board will not reimburse a debtor's interview 
expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.23  Use of consumer reporting agencies.

    (a) In addition to assessing interest, penalties, and administrative 
costs under Sec. 1018.30 of this part, the Board may report a debt that 
has been delinquent for 90 days to a consumer reporting agency, if all 
the conditions of this paragraph are met.
    (1) The debtor has not:

[[Page 63]]

    (i) Paid or agreed to pay the debt under a written payment plan that 
has been signed by the debtor and agreed to by the Board; or
    (ii) Filed for review of the debt under Sec. 1018.23(a)(2)(iv) of 
this section.
    (2) The Board has included a notification in the third written 
demand (see Sec. 1018.20(b)) to the debtor stating:
    (i) That the account has been reviewed and payment of the debt is 
delinquent;
    (ii) That, within not less than 60 days after the date of 
notification, the Board intends to disclose to a consumer reporting 
agency that the individual is responsible for the debt;
    (iii) The specific information to be disclosed to the consumer 
reporting agency; and
    (iv) That the debtor has the right to a complete explanation of the 
debt (if that has not already been given), to dispute information on 
Board records about the debt, and to request reconsideration of the debt 
by administrative appeal or review of the debt.
    (3) The Board has sent at least one written demand by either 
registered or certified mail with the notification described in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (4) The Board has reconsidered its initial decision on the debt when 
the debtor has requested a review under Sec. 1018.23(a)(2)(iv).
    (5) The Board has taken reasonable action to locate a debtor for 
whom the Board does not have a current address to send the notifications 
provided for in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (b) If there is a substantial change in the condition or amount of 
the debt, the Board shall:
    (1) Promptly disclose that fact(s) to each consumer reporting agency 
to which the original disclosure was made;
    (2) Promptly verify or correct information about the debt, on 
request of a consumer reporting agency for verification of any or all 
information so disclosed by the Board; and
    (3) Obtain satisfactory assurances from each consumer reporting 
agency that they are complying with all applicable Federal, state, and 
local laws relating to its use of consumer credit information.
    (c) The information the Board discloses to the consumer reporting 
agency is limited to:
    (1) Information necessary to establish the identity of the 
individual debtor, including name, address, and taxpayer identification 
number;
    (2) The amount, status, and history of the debt; and
    (3) The Board activity under which the claim arose.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.24  Contact with the debtor's employing agency.

    If a debtor is employed by the Federal government or is a member of 
the military establishment or the Coast Guard, and collection by offset 
cannot be accomplished in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5514, the Board shall 
contact the employing agency to arrange with the debtor for payment of 
the indebtedness by allotment or otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.25  Sanctions.

    (a) Closure of accounts. If a tariff filing fee or insurance filing 
fee account is past due more than 90 days, the Board will freeze the 
account until the account is made current. The Board will notify the 
account holder that the account has been frozen and that until the 
account balance including any applicable interest, penalties, and 
administrative costs are paid, all future filings, must be accompanied 
by a certified or cashier's check or a money order. The Board reserves 
the right to refuse to maintain an account which is repeatedly 
delinquent.
    (b) Suspension or revocation of tariff or insurance filing 
privileges. If the account holder fails to satisfy all claims for tariff 
or insurance filing fees including applicable interest, penalties, and 
the administrative costs of collection of the debt, the Board may 
suspend or prohibit a tariff or insurance filing fee account holder from 
submitting tariff or insurance filings in its own name or on behalf of 
others.
    (c) Suspension or revocation of certificates, licenses, or permits 
granted by the Board. The Board may suspend or revoke any certificates, 
permits, or licenses which the Board has granted to an account holder or 
other debtor for any inexcusable, prolonged, or repeated

[[Page 64]]

failure or refusal to pay a delinquent debt.
    (d) Procedures for suspension or revocation of filing privileges or 
certificates, licenses, or permits for failure to pay tariff or 
insurance filing fees. Before suspending or revoking an account holder's 
privilege to submit tariff or insurance filings or suspending or 
revoking any certificate, license, or permit which the Board has granted 
to any account holder, the Board shall issue to the account holder an 
order to show cause why the tariff or insurance filing privilege or any 
certificate, license, or permit should not be suspended or revoked. The 
Board shall allow the debtor no more than 30 days to pay the debt in 
full including applicable interest, penalties, and administrative costs 
of collection of the delinquent debt. The Board may suspend or revoke 
any certificate, license, permit, approval or filing privilege at the 
end of this period upon a finding of willful noncompliance with the 
Board's order. If any certificate, license, permit, or filing privilege 
is revoked under this authority of this part, a new application with 
appropriate fees must be made to the Board, and all previous delinquent 
debts of the debtor to the Board must be paid before the Board will 
consider such application.
    (e) Other sanctions. The remedies and sanctions available to the 
Board in this area are not exclusive. The Board may impose other 
sanctions, where permitted by law for any inexcusable, prolonged, or 
repeated failure of a debtor to pay such claim. In such cases, the Board 
will provide notice and a hearing, as required by law, to the debtor 
prior to the imposition of any such sanctions.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.26  Disputed debts.

    (a) A debtor who disputes a debt shall explain why the debt is 
incorrect in fact or law within 30 days from the date that the initial 
demand letter was mailed. The debtor may support the explanation by 
submitting affidavits, statements certified under penalty of perjury, 
canceled checks, or other relevant evidence.
    (b) The Board may extend the interest waiver period as described in 
Sec. 1018.30(j) pending a final determination of the existence or amount 
of the debt.
    (c) The Board may investigate the facts involved in the dispute and 
if necessary, the Board may arrange for a conference at which the debtor 
may present evidence and arguments in support of the debtor's positions.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.27  Contracting for collection services.

    The Board may contract for collection services in order to recover 
delinquent debts. However, the Board retains the authority to resolve 
disputes, compromise claims, suspend or terminate collection action, and 
initiate enforced collection through litigation. When appropriate, the 
Board shall contract in accordance with 4 CFR 102.6.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.28  Collection by administrative offset.

    (a) The Board may administratively undertake collection by offset on 
each claim which is liquidated or certain in amount in accordance with 
the guidelines and the standards contained in 4 CFR 102.2, 102.3, and 
102.4 and 5 U.S.C. 5514, as applicable. The Board may not initiate 
administrative offset to collect a debt more than 10 years after the 
Government's right to the debt first accrued, unless facts material to 
the Government's right to collect the debt were not known and could not 
reasonably have been known to the Board.
    (b) Collection by administrative offset of amounts payable from the 
Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, the Federal Employees 
Retirement System, or other similar fund is made pursuant to 4 CFR 102.4 
and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section.
    (c) Salary offset is governed by 5 U.S.C. 5514.
    (d) The following procedures apply when the Board seeks to collect a 
debt by offset against any payment to be made to a debtor or against the 
assets of a holder of a certificate, permit, license, or authorization 
issued by the Board.
    (1) Before the offset is made, the Board shall provide the debtor 
written notice of the nature and amount of the debt and:

[[Page 65]]

    (i) Notice of the Board's intent to collect the debt by offset;
    (ii) An opportunity to inspect and copy Board records pertaining to 
the debt;
    (iii) An opportunity to request reconsideration of the debt by the 
Board, or if provided for by statute, waiver of the debt;
    (iv) An opportunity to enter into a written agreement with the Board 
to repay or pay the debt, as the case may be;
    (v) An explanation of the debtor's rights under this subpart; and
    (vi) An opportunity for a hearing when required under the provisions 
of 4 CFR 102.3(c).
    (2) If the Board learns that other agencies of the Government are 
holding funds payable to the debtor, the Board shall provide the other 
agencies with written certification that the debt is owed to the Board 
and that the Board has complied with the provisions of 4 CFR 102.3. The 
Board shall request that funds which are due the debtor and which are 
necessary to offset the debt to the Board be transferred to the Board.
    (3) The Board may accept a repayment or payment agreement, as 
appropriate, in lieu of offset, but will do so only after balancing the 
Government's interest in collecting the debts against fairness to the 
debtor. If the debt is delinquent and the debtor has not disputed its 
existence or amount, the Board may accept a repayment or payment 
agreement in lieu of offset only if the debtor is able to establish 
under sworn affidavit or statement certified under penalty of perjury 
that offset would result in financial hardship or would result in undue 
financial hardship or would be against equity and good conscience.
    (4) Administrative offset is not authorized with respect to:
    (i) Debts owed by any State or local government;
    (ii) Debts once they become subject to the salary offset provisions 
of 5 U.S.C. 5514; or
    (iii) Any case in which collection of the type of debt involved by 
administrative offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by 
another statute.
    (5) The Board reserves the right to take any other action in respect 
to offset as is permitted under 4 CFR 102.3.
    (e) The Board shall make appropriate use of the cooperative efforts 
of other agencies including the Army Holdup List in effecting 
collections by offset. The Army Holdup List is a list of contractors 
indebted to the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.29  Payments.

    (a) Payment in full. The Board shall make every effort to collect a 
claim in full before it becomes delinquent. The Board shall impose 
charges for interest, penalties, and administrative costs as specified 
in Sec. 1018.30.
    (b) Payment in installments. If a debtor furnishes satisfactory 
evidence of inability to pay a claim in one lump sum, payment in regular 
installments may be arranged. Evidence may consist of a financial 
statement or a signed statement certified under penalty of perjury to be 
true and correct that application for a loan to enable the debtor to pay 
the claim in full was rejected. Except for a claim described at 5 U.S.C. 
5514, all installment payment arrangements must be in writing and 
require the payment of interest and administrative charges.
    (1) Installment note forms including confess-judgement notes may be 
used. The written installment agreement must contain a provision 
accelerating the debt payment in the event the debtor defaults. If the 
debtor's financial statement discloses the ownership of assets which are 
free and clear of liens or security interests, or assets in which the 
debtor owns equity, the debtor may be asked to secure the payment of an 
installment note by executing a Security Agreement and Financial 
Statement transferring to the United States a security interest in the 
assets until the debt is discharged.
    (2) If the debtor owes more than one debt and designates how a 
voluntary installment payment is to be applied among those debts, the 
Board shall follow that designation. If the debtor does not designate 
the application of the payment, the Board shall apply the payment to the 
various debts in accordance with the best interest of the United States 
as determined by the

[[Page 66]]

facts and circumstances of the particular case.
    (c) To whom payment is made. Payment of a debt is made by check, 
money order, or credit card (VISA or MASTERCARD) payable to the Surface 
Transportation Board and mailed or delivered to the Budget and Fiscal 
Office, room 1330, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC 20423, 
unless payment is:
    (1) Made pursuant to arrangements with the GAO or DOJ;
    (2) Ordered by a Court of the United States; or
    (3) Otherwise directed in any other part of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.30  Interest, penalties, and administrative costs.

    (a) The Board shall assess interest, penalties, and administrative 
costs on debts owed to the United States Government in accordance with 
the guidance provided under the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 4 
CFR 102.13 unless otherwise directed by statute, regulation, or 
contract.
    (b) Before assessing any charges on delinquent debts, the Board 
shall mail a written notice to debtor explaining its requirements 
concerning these charges under 4 CFR 102.2 and 102.13.
    (c) Interest begins to accrue from the date on which the initial 
invoice is first mailed to the debtor unless a different date is 
specified on a statute, regulation, or contract.
    (d) The Board shall assess interest based upon the rate of the 
current value of funds to the United States Treasury (the Treasury tax 
and loan account rate) prescribed by statute, regulation, or contract.
    (e) Interest is computed only on the principal of the debt, and the 
interest rate remains fixed for the duration of the indebtedness, unless 
the debtor defaults on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a 
new agreement.
    (f) The Board shall assess against a debtor charges to cover 
administrative costs incurred as a result of a delinquent debt. 
Administrative costs may include costs incurred in obtaining a credit 
report or in using a private debt collector, to the extent they are 
attributable to the delinquency.
    (g) The Board shall assess a penalty charge of six percent a year on 
any portion of a debt that is delinquent for more than 90 days. The 
charge accrues retroactively to the date that the debt became 
delinquent.
    (h) Amounts received by the Board as partial or installment payments 
are applied first to outstanding penalty and administrative cost 
charges, second to accrued interest, and third to outstanding principal.
    (i) The Board shall waive collection of interest on the debt or any 
portion of the debt which is paid in full within 30 days after the date 
on which interest began to accrue.
    (j) The Board may waive interest during the periods a debt disputed 
under Sec. 1018.26 is under investigation or review before the Board. 
This additional waiver is not automatic and must be requested before the 
expiration of the initial 30-day waiver period. The Board may grant the 
additional waiver only when it finds merit in the explanation the debtor 
has submitted under Sec. 1018.26.
    (k) The Board may waive the collection of interest, penalties, and 
administrative costs if it finds that one or more of the following 
conditions exists:
    (1) The debtor is unable to pay any significant sum toward the debt 
within a reasonable time;
    (2) Collection of interest, penalties, and administrative costs will 
jeopardize collection of the principal of the debt;
    (3) The Board is unable to enforce collection in full within a 
reasonable time by enforced collection proceedings; or
    (4) Collection would be against equity and good conscience or not in 
the best interest of the United States, including the situation in which 
an administrative offset or installment payment agreement is in effect.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.31  Use of credit reports.

    The Board may institute a credit investigation of the debtor at any 
time following receipt of knowledge of the debt in order to aid the 
Board in making appropriate determinations as to:
    (a) The collection and compromise of a debt;

[[Page 67]]

    (b) The collection of interest, penalties, and administrative costs;
    (c) The use of administrative offset;
    (d) The use of other collection methods; and
    (e) The likelihood of collecting the debt.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.32  Bankruptcy claims.

    When the Board receives information that a debtor has filed a 
petition in bankruptcy or is the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, it 
shall suspend all collection actions against the debtor in accordance 
with 11 U.S.C. 362 and shall furnish information concerning the debt 
owed the United States to the Department of Justice's Nationwide Central 
Intake Facility to permit the filing of a claim.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.33  Use and disclosure of mailing addresses.

    (a) When attempting to locate a debtor in order to collect or 
compromise a debt under this part, the Board may send a written request 
to the Secretary of the Treasury (or designee) in order to obtain a 
debtor's mailing address from the records of the Internal Revenue 
Service.
    (b) The Board may disclose a mailing address obtained under 
paragraph (a) of this section to other agents, including collection 
service contractors, in order to facilitate the collection or compromise 
of debts under this part, except that a mailing address may be disclosed 
to a consumer reporting agency only for the limited purpose of obtaining 
a commercial credit report on the particular taxpayer.
    (c) The Board and its agents, including consumer reporting agencies 
and collection services, must comply with the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 
6103(p)(4) and applicable regulations of the Internal Revenue Service.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.34  Additional administrative collection action.

    Nothing contained in this part is intended to preclude any other 
administrative remedy which may be available.


<R04>
                    Subpart C--Compromise of a Claim


<R05>
Sec. 1018.50  When a claim may be compromised.

    The Board may compromise a claim not in excess of the monetary 
limitation if it has not been referred to GAO or DOJ for litigation. 
Only the Comptroller General of the United States or designee may effect 
the compromise of a claim that arises out of the exceptions made by the 
GAO in that account of an accountable officer, including a claim against 
the payee, prior to its referral by GAO for litigation.
[58 FR 7749, Feb. 9, 1993; 58 FR 11099, Feb. 23, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 1018.51  Reasons for compromising a claim.

    (a) A claim may be compromised for one or more reasons set forth 
below:
    (1) The full amount cannot be collected because:
    (i) The debtor is unable to pay the full amount within a reasonable 
time; or
    (ii) The debtor refuses to pay the claim in full, and the Government 
is unable to enforce collection in full within a reasonable time; or
    (2) There is a real doubt concerning the Government's ability to 
prove its case in Court for the full amount claimed, either because of 
the legal issues involved or a bona fide dispute as to the facts; or
    (3) The costs of collecting the claim do not justify the enforced 
collection of the full amount. The Board shall apply this reason for 
compromise in accordance with the guidelines in 4 CFR 103.4.
    (b) The Board shall determine the debtor's inability to pay, the 
Government's ability to enforce collection, and the amounts which are 
acceptable in compromise in accordance with the Federal Claims 
Collection Standards, 4 CFR part 103.
    (c) Compromises payable in installments are discouraged, but, if 
necessary, must be in the form of a legally enforceable agreement for 
the reinstatement of the prior indebtedness less sums paid thereon. The 
agreement

[[Page 68]]

also must provide that in the event of default:
    (1) The entire balance of the debt becomes immediately due and 
payable; and
    (2) The Government has the right to enforce any security agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.52  Restrictions on the compromise of a claim.

    (a) The Board may not accept a percentage of a debtor's profits or 
stock in a debtor's corporation in compromise of a claim. In negotiating 
a compromise with a business concern, consideration is given to 
requiring a waiver of the tax-loss-carry-forward and tax-loss-carry-back 
rights of the debtor.
    (b) If two or more debtors are jointly or severally liable, 
collection action is not withheld against one debtor until the other or 
others pay their share. The amount of a compromise with one debtor is 
not considered a precedent or binding in determining the amount which 
will be required from other debtors jointly and severally liable on the 
claim.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.53  Finality of a compromise.

    An offer of compromise must be in writing and signed by the debtor. 
An offer of compromise which is accepted by the Board is final and 
conclusive on the debtor and on all officials, agencies and courts of 
the United States, unless obtained by fraud, misrepresentation, the 
presentation of a false claim, or mutual mistake of fact.


<R04>
        Subpart D--Suspension or Termination of Collection Action


<R05>
Sec. 1018.60  When collection action may be suspended or terminated.

    The Board may suspend or terminate collection action on a claim not 
in excess of the monetary limitation, exclusive of interest, penalties, 
and administrative costs, after deducting the amount of partial 
payments, if any, if it has not been referred to GAO or DOJ for 
litigation.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.61  Reasons for suspending collection action.

    Collection action may be suspended temporarily:
    (a) When the debtor cannot be located after diligent efforts, and 
there is reason to believe that future collection action may be 
sufficiently productive to justify periodic review and action on the 
claim considering the size of the claim and the amount which may be 
realized on it; or
    (b) When the debtor owns no substantial equity in realty and is 
unable to make payments on the Government's claim or effect a compromise 
on it at the time, but the debtor's future prospects justify retention 
of the claim for periodic review and action:
    (1) The applicable statute of limitations has been tolled or started 
anew; or
    (2) Future collection can be effected by offset notwithstanding the 
statute of limitations.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.62  Reasons for terminating collection action.

    Collection action may be terminated:
    (a) When it becomes clear that the Government cannot collect or 
enforce collection of any significant sum from the debtor having due 
regard for the judicial remedies available to the Government, the 
debtor's future financial prospects, and the exemptions available to the 
debtor under State and Federal law;
    (b) When the debtor cannot be located, there is no security 
remaining to be liquidated, the applicable statute of limitations has 
run, and the prospects of collecting by offset, notwithstanding the bar 
of the statute of limitations, are too remote to justify retention of 
the claim; or
    (c) When it is likely that the cost of the collection action will 
exceed the amount recoverable.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.63  Termination of collection action.

    Collection action shall be terminated:
    (a) Whenever it is determined that the claim is legally without 
merit; or
    (b) When it is determined that the evidence necessary to prove the 
claim cannot be produced, or necessary witnesses are unavailable, and 
efforts to induce voluntary payments have been unavailing.

[[Page 69]]


<R05>
Sec. 1018.64  Transfer of a claim.

    The Board may refer a claim to GAO when there is doubt as to whether 
or not a collection action should be suspended or terminated.


<R04>
                     Subpart E--Referral of a Claim


<R05>
Sec. 1018.70  Prompt referral.

    (a) A claim which requires enforced collection is referred to GAO or 
DOJ for litigation. A referral is made as early as possible consistent 
with aggressive collection action and, in, any event, well within the 
time required to bring a timely suit against the debtor. Ordinarily, 
referrals are made within 1 year of the Board's final determination of 
the fact and the amount of the debt.
    (b) When the merits of the Board's claim, the amount owed on the 
claim, or the propriety of acceptance of a proposed compromise, 
suspension, or termination of collection actions is in doubt, the Board 
shall refer the matter to GAO for resolution and instruction prior to 
proceeding with collection actions and/or referral to DOJ for 
litigation.
    (c) The Board may refer a claim to GAO or DOJ even though the 
termination of collection activity might otherwise be given 
consideration under Sec. 1018.63 if:
    (1) A significant enforcement policy is involved in reducing a 
statutory penalty or forfeiture to judgment; or
    (2) Recovery of a judgement is a prerequisite to the imposition of 
administrative sanctions, such as suspension or revocation of a license 
or privilege of participating in a Government sponsored program.
    (d) Once a claim has been referred to GAO or DOJ under this subpart, 
the Board shall refrain from any contact with the debtor and shall 
direct the debtor to GAO or DOJ as appropriate, when questions 
concerning the claim are raised by the debtor. The Board shall 
immediately advise GAO or DOJ, as appropriate, of any payments by the 
debtor.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.71  Referral of a compromise offer.

    The Board may refer a debtor's firm written offer of compromise 
which is substantial in amount to GAO or to DOJ if the Board is 
uncertain whether the offer should be accepted.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.72  Referral to the Department of Justice.

    (a) Claims for which the gross original amount is over $500,000 must 
be referred to the Commercial Litigation Branch, Civil Division, 
Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530. Claims for which the gross 
original amount is $500,000 or less must be referred to the Department 
of Justice's Nationwide Central Intake Facility.
    (b) A claim of less than $600, exclusive of interest, is not 
referred for litigation unless:
    (1) Referral is important to a significant enforcement policy; or
    (2) The debtor has the clear ability to pay the claim, and the 
government can effectively enforce payment.
    (c) A claim on which the Board holds a judgment is referred to DOJ 
for further action if renewal of the judgment lien or enforced 
collection proceedings are justified under the criteria discussed in 
this part.
    (d) Claims must be referred to the Department of Justice in the 
manner prescribed by 4 CFR 105.2. Care must be taken to preserve all 
files, records, and exhibits on claims referred under paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of this section.


<R04>
              Subpart F--Internal Revenue Service Procedure


<R05>
Sec. 1018.80  Reporting discharged debts to the Internal Revenue Service.

    When the Board discharges a debt for less than the full value of the 
indebtedness, it will report the outstanding balance discharged, not 
including interest to the Internal Revenue Service, using IRS Form 1099-
G or any other form prescribed by the IRS, when:
    (a) The principal amount of the debt not in dispute is $600 or more;
    (b) The obligation has not been discharged in a bankruptcy 
proceeding; and
    (c) The obligation is no longer collectible either because the time 
limit in the applicable statute for enforcing collection expired during 
the tax year, or because during the tax year a formal compromise 
agreement was reached in

[[Page 70]]

which the debtor was legally discharged of all or a portion of the 
obligation.


<R04>
                      Subpart G--Tax Refund Offset


<R05>
Sec. 1018.90  Purpose.

    This subpart establishes procedures for the Board to refer past-due 
debts to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the offset against the 
income tax refunds of persons owing debts to the Board. It specifies the 
Board's procedures and the rights of the debtor applicable to claims for 
the payment of debts owed to the Board.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.91  Applicability and scope.

    (a) These regulations implement 31 U.S.C. 3720A which authorizes the 
IRS to reduce a tax refund by the amount of a past-due legally 
enforceable debt owed to the Government of the United States.
    (b) For purposes of this section, a past-due legally enforceable 
debt referable to the IRS is a debt which is owed to the Government of 
the United States and:
    (1) Except in the case of a judgment debt, has been delinquent for 
at least 3 months but has not been delinquent for more than 10 years at 
the time the offset is made;
    (2) Cannot be currently collected pursuant to the salary offset 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1);
    (3) Is ineligible for administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) 
by reason of 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(2) or cannot be collected by 
administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) by the Board against 
amounts payable to or on behalf of the debtor by or on behalf of the 
Board.
    (4) With respect to which the Board has given the taxpayer at least 
60 days from the date of notification to present evidence that all or 
part of the debt is not past-due or legally enforceable, has considered 
evidence presented by such taxpayer, and has determined that an amount 
of such debt is past-due and legally enforceable.
    (5) Has been disclosed by the Board to a consumer reporting agency 
as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3711(f), unless a consumer reporting agency 
would be prohibited from using such information by 15 U.S.C. 1681c, or 
unless the amount of the debt does not exceed $100.00;
    (6) With respect to which the Board has notified or has made a 
reasonable attempt to notify the taxpayer that the debt is past-due and, 
unless repaid within 60 days thereafter, the debt will be referred to 
the IRS for offset against any overpayment of tax;
    (7) Is at least $25.00;
    (8) All other requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720A and the Department of 
the Treasury regulations codified at 26 CFR 301.6402-6T relating to the 
eligibility of a debt for tax return offset have been satisfied.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.92  Administrative charges.

    In accordance with 49 CFR 1018.30, all administrative charges 
incurred in connection with the referral of the debts to the IRS shall 
be assessed on the debt and thus increase the amount of the offset.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.93  Notice requirement before offset.

    A request for reduction of an IRS tax refund will be made only after 
the Board makes a determination that an amount is owed and past-due and 
provides the debtor with 60 days written notice. The Board's notice of 
intention to collect by IRS tax refund offset (Notice of intent) will 
state:
    (a) The amount of the debt;
    (b) That unless the debt is repaid within 60 days from the date of 
the Board's Notice of Intent, the Board intends to collect the debt by 
requesting that the IRS reduce any amount payable to the debtor as 
Federal Income tax refunds an amount equal to amount of the debt 
including all accumulated interest and other charges;
    (c) That the debtor has the right to present evidence that all or 
part of the debt is not past-due or legally enforceable; and
    (d) A mailing address for forwarding any written correspondence and 
a contact name and phone number for any questions.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.94  Review within the Board.

    (a) Notification by Debtor. A debtor who receives a Notice of Intent 
has the right to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not 
past-due or not

[[Page 71]]

legally enforceable. To exercise this right, the debtor must:
    (1) Send a written request for a review of the evidence to the 
address provided in the notice.
    (2) State in the request the amount disputed and the reasons why the 
debtor believes that the debt is not past-due or is not legally 
enforceable.
    (3) Include in the request any documents which the debtor wishes to 
be considered or state that additional information will be submitted 
within the 60-day period.
    (b) Submission of evidence. The debtor may submit evidence showing 
that all or part of the debt is not past-due or not legally enforceable 
along with the notification required by paragraph (a) of this section. 
Failure to submit the notification and evidence within 60 days will 
result in an automatic referral of the debt to the IRS without further 
action by the Board.
    (c) Review of the evidence. The Board will consider all available 
evidence related to the debt. Within 30 days, if feasible, the Board 
will notify the debtor whether the Board has sustained, amended, or 
canceled its determination that the debt is past-due and legally 
enforceable.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.95  Board determination.

    (a) Following review of the evidence, the Board will issue a written 
decision which will include the supporting rationale for the decision.
    (b) If the Board either sustains or amends its determination, it 
shall notify the debtor of its intent to refer the debt to the IRS for 
offset against the debtor's Federal income tax refund. If the Board 
cancels its original determination, the debt will not be referred to 
IRS.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.96    Stay of offset.

    If the debtor timely notifies the Board that the debtor is 
exercising the right described in Sec. 1018.94(a) of this subpart, any 
notice to the IRS will be stayed until the issuance of a written 
decision which sustains or amends its original determination.

to the car has furnished the car to the rail carrier making the election 
was entered into after January 1, 1991.
    (B) An election shall be irrevocable and binding only for the term 
of the transaction pursuant to which the car was furnished to the rail 
carrier making the election as to that rail carrier and all users and 
subsequent owners if:
    (1) That rail carrier does not have legal title to the car and does 
not obtain written consent or such election from the party holding legal 
title;
    (2) The transaction was entered into prior to January 1, 1991; and
    (3) The transaction does not provide that the compensation to be 
paid to the party furnishing the car is to be based in whole or in part 
directly on the car hire earnings of the car; provided, however, that if 
the rail carrier making the election subsequently obtains legal title to 
the car, such election shall then be irrevocable and binding as to the 
rail carrier and all users and subsequent owners.
    (C) The party holding legal title to the car may revoke an election 
subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section 
only:
    (1) At the time the transaction pursuant to which the car was 
furnished to the rail carrier making the election is first extended or 
renewed after January 1, 1991; or
    (2) If such transaction is not extended or renewed, at the time such 
transaction terminates.

If such election is so revoked, a rail carrier may make a new election 
only with the written consent of the party holding legal title to the 
car, and such election shall be irrevocable and binding as to the rail 
carrier making the election and all users and subsequent owners.
    (ii) Nothing in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section shall be 
construed to limit the rights of parties to any transaction to provide 
for the consent of any party to an election made pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(3)(i) of this section.
    (c) Market rate cars. (1) Market rate cars shall not be subject to 
prescribed rates or to the provisions of 49 CFR 1039.14(c)(1) (i) and 
(ii) and (c)(4).
    (2) (i) The Board shall not prescribe car hire for market rate cars.
    (ii) The Code of Car Hire Rules referenced in the Association of 
American Railroads Car Service and Car Hire Agreement provides that 
owners and users party to that agreement shall resolve car hire disputes 
thereunder. The Board may review allegations of abuse of the car hire 
dispute resolution process established under those rules.
    (iii) Car hire disputes involving an owner or user not a party to 
that agreement may be resolved by the Board.
    (d) Car hire agreements. Rail carriers are authorized to negotiate 
and enter into agreements governing car hire.
    (e) Effective date. This part shall take effect on January 1, 1994.

    Editorial Note: For service orders issued under this part before

CFR Sections Affected in the Finding Aids section of this volume.

    Authority:  49 U.S.C. 721, 11123.


<R05>
Sec. 1034.1  Temporary authority.

    (a) Authority. Any railroad subject to regulation under 49 U.S.C. 
10501 may reasonably divert or reroute traffic to other carriers, if it 
is unable due to circumstances beyond its control promptly to transport 
traffic over a portion of its lines. Traffic necessarily diverted under 
this authority shall be rerouted to preserve as much as possible the 
participation and revenues of other carriers provided in the original 
routing. This authority may be exercised for no more than 30 days 
following the day on which the rerouting begins. If a carrier needs more 
than 30 days before its disability or the disability of a receiving 
carrier is cured, it may automatically extend its rerouting for 
additional 30-day periods. To extend the period, it must submit a 
written or telegraphic notice to the Association of American Railroads 
and the Board's Railroad Service Board explaining why the rerouting is 
necessary, when it began, when the disability occurred, why an extension 
is necessary, the specific lines disabled, the rerouting to be 
continued, which shippers are affected, and any other important facts.
    (b) Concurrence by carriers. A railroad rerouting traffic must 
receive the concurrence of other railroads to which the traffic will be 
diverted or rerouted, before the rerouting or diversion begins. A 
rerouting carrier must also confirm the inability of a disabled 
receiving carrier to handle the traffic before rerouting that traffic. 
If the receiving carrier is no longer disabled, it must accept the 
traffic according to the routing originally designated.
    (c) Notice by rerouting carrier. A rerouting carrier must notify the 
Board's Railroad Service Board, the Association of American Railroads, 
Car Service Division, as agent of all railroads subscribing to car 
service and car hire agreements, and the American Short Line Railroad 
Association before the rerouting or diversion begins. The originating 
carrier must notify each shipper at the time each shipment is rerouted 
or diverted and furnish to each shipper the rerouting, except when the 
disability requiring the rerouting occurs after the movement has begun. 
When a rerouting carrier submits to the Board a notice and explanation 
for an extension of the rerouting period, it must immediately also 
submit a copy of that notice and explanation to the AAR, the ASLRA and 
all shippers that have been affected or that the carrier believes will 
be affected or that request a copy.
    (d) Notice by AAR. The AAR shall notify all carriers affected by 
rerouting or by an extension of a rerouting period, in a manner similar 
to that used for embargoes.
    (e) Applicable rates. The rates applicable on shipments rerouted or 
diverted will be the rates applicable over the route originally 
designated at the time the shipments are tendered.
    (f) Divisions. The carriers involved in the rerouting or diversion 
shall proceed even though no contracts, agreements, or arrangements 
exist between them at the time concerning the divisions of the rates 
applicable to the traffic. Divisions shall be, during the time the 
rerouting is in effect, those voluntarily agreed upon by the carriers.

Sec. 1035.1  Requirement for certain forms of bills of lading.

    (a) All common carriers, except express companies, engaged in the 
transportation of property other than livestock and wild animals, by 
rail or by water subject to the Interstate Commerce Act are required to 
use straight bills of lading as prescribed in Appendix A and B to this 
part, or order bills of lading as prescribed in Appendix A and B to this 
Part, except that order bills of lading shall:
    (1) Be entitled ``Uniform Order Bill of Lading'' and be designated 
as ``Negotiable'' on the front (appendix A to this part);
    (2) Indicate consignment ``to the order of * * * '' on the front 
(appendix A to this part); and
    (3) Provide for endorsement on the back portion (appendix B to this 
part).
    (b) All such bills of lading:
    (1) May be either documented on paper or issued electronically;
    (2) May be a copy, reprographic or otherwise, of a printed bill of 
lading, free from erasure and interlineation;
    (3) May vary in the arrangement and spacing of the printed matter on 
the face of the form.


<R05>
Sec. 1035.2  Modification of front of uniform bill of lading.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of Sec. 1035.1(a), with respect 
to the information called for, the front portion only (appendix A to 
this part) of a bill of lading may deviate from the language prescribed 
in this part so long as the deviation conforms with approved national 
standards for the electronic data interchange or other commercial 
requirements for bill of lading information; provided that no such 
deviation in the language shall affect the obligations of any shipper to 
provide information absent the consent of such shipper nor shall such 
deviation be deemed to alter any rights or obligations conferred by 
statute or regulation on either carriers or shippers with respect to the 
preparation or issuance of bills of lading.

                         Appendix B to Part 1035

                      Contract Terms and Conditions

    Sec. 1. (a) The carrier or party in possession of any of the 
property herein described shall be liable as at common law for any loss 
thereof or damage thereto, except as hereinafter provided.
    (b) No carrier or party in possession of all or any of the property 
herein described shall be liable for any loss thereof or damage thereto 
or delay caused by the act of God, the public enemy, the authority of 
law, or the act or default of the shipper or owner, or for natural 
shrinkage. The carrier's liability shall be that of warehouseman, only, 
for loss, damage, or delay caused by fire occurring after the expiration 
of the free time allowed by tariffs lawfully on file (such free time to 
be computed as therein provided) after notice of the arrival of the 
property at destination or at the port of export (if intended for 
export) has been duly sent or given, and after placement of the property 
for delivery at destination, or tender of delivery of the property to 
the party entitled to receive it, has been made. Except in case of 
negligence of the carrier or party in possession (and the burden to 
prove freedom from such negligence shall be on the carrier or party in 
possession), the carrier or party in possession shall not be liable for 
loss, damage, or delay occurring while the property is stopped and held 
in transit upon the request of the shipper, owner, or party entitled to 
make such request, or resulting from a defect or vice in the property, 
or for country damage to cotton, or from riots or strikes.

[[Page 78]]

    (c) In case of quarantine the property may be discharged at risk and 
expense of owners into quarantine depot or elsewhere, as required by 
quarantine regulations or authorities, or for the carrier's dispatch at 
nearest available point in carrier's judgment, and in any such case 
carrier's responsibility shall cease when property is so discharged, or 
property may be returned by carrier at owner's expense to shipping 
point, earning freight both ways. Quarantine expenses of whatever nature 
or kind upon or in respect to property shall be borne by the owners of 
the property or be a lien thereon. The carrier shall not be liable for 
loss or damage occasioned by fumigation or disinfection or other acts 
required or done by quarantine regulations or authorities even though 
the same may have been done by carrier's officers, agents, or employees, 
nor for detention, loss, or damage of any kind occasioned by quarantine 
or the enforcement thereof. No carrier shall be liable, except in case 
of negligence, for any mistake or inaccuracy in any information 
furnished by the carrier, its agents, or officers, as to quarantine laws 
or regulations. The shipper shall hold the carriers harmless from any 
expense they may incur, or damages they may be required to pay, by 
reason of the introduction of the property covered by this contract into 
any place against the quarantine laws or regulations in effect at such 
place.
    Sec. 2. (a) No carrier is bound to transport said property by any 
particular train or vessel, or in time for any particular market or 
otherwise than with reasonable dispatch. Every carrier shall have the 
right in case of physical necessity to forward said property by any 
carrier or route between the point of shipment and the point of 
destination. In all cases not prohibited by law, where a lower value 
than actual value has been represented in writing by the shipper or has 
been agreed upon in writing as the released value of the property as 
determined by the classification or tariffs upon which the rate is 
based, such lower value plus freight charges if paid shall be the 
maximum amount to be recovered, whether or not such loss or damage 
occurs from negligence.
    (b) As a condition precedent to recovery, claims must be filed in 
writing with the receiving or delivering carrier, or carrier issuing 
this bill of lading, or carrier on whose line the loss, damage, injury 
or delay occurred, within nine months after delivery of the property 
(or, in case of export traffic, within nine months after delivery at 
port of export) or, in case of failure to make delivery, then within 
nine months after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed; and suits 
shall be instituted against any carrier only within two years and one 
day from the day when notice in writing is given by the carrier to the 
claimant that the carrier has disallowed the claim or any part or parts 
thereof specified in the notice. Where claims are not filed or suits are 
not instituted thereon in accordance with the foregoing provisions, no 
carrier hereunder shall be liable, and such claims will not be paid.
    (c) Any carrier or party liable on account of loss of or damage to 
any of said property shall have the full benefit of any insurance that 
may have been effected upon or on account of said property, so far as 
this shall not avoid the policies or contracts of insurance: Provided, 
That the carrier reimburse the claimant for the premium paid thereon.
    Sec. 3. Except where such service is required as the result of 
carrier's negligence, all property shall be subject to necessary 
cooperage and baling at owner's cost. Each carrier over whose route 
cotton or cotton linters is to be transported hereunder shall have the 
privilege, at its own cost and risk, of compressing the same for greater 
convenience in handling or forwarding, and shall not be held responsible 
for deviation or unavoidable delays in procuring such compression. Grain 
in bulk consigned to a point where there is a railroad, public or 
licensed elevator, may (unless otherwise expressly noted herein, and 
then if it is not promptly unloaded) be there delivered and placed with 
other grain of the same kind and grade without respect to ownership (and 
prompt notice thereof shall be given to the consignor), and if so 
delivered shall be subject to a lien for elevator charges in addition to 
all other charges hereunder.
    4. (a) Property not removed by the party entitled to receive it 
within the free time allowed by tariffs, lawfully on file (such free 
time to be computed as therein provided), after notice of the arrival of 
the property at destination or at the port of export (if intended for 
export) has been duly sent or given, and after placement of the property 
for delivery at destination has been made, may be kept in vessel, car, 
depot, warehouse or place of delivery of the carrier, subject to the 
tariff charge for storage and to carrier's responsibility as 
warehouseman, only, or at the option of the carrier, may be removed to 
and stored in a public or licensed warehouse at the place of delivery or 
other available place, at the cost of the owner, and there held without 
liability on the part of the carrier, and subject to a lien for all 
freight and other lawful charges, including a reasonable charge for 
storage.
    (b) Where nonperishable property which has been transported to 
destination hereunder is refused by consignee or the party entitled to 
receive it, or said consignee or party entitled to receive it fails to 
receive it within 15 days after notice of arrival shall have been duly 
sent or given, the carrier may sell the same at public auction to the 
highest bidder, at such place as may be designated by the carrier: 
Provided, That the carrier shall have first mailed, sent, or given

[[Page 79]]

to the consignor notice that the property has been refused or remains 
unclaimed, as the case may be, and that it will be subject to sale under 
the terms of the bill of lading if disposition be not arranged for, and 
shall have published notice containing a description of the property, 
the name of the party to whom consigned, or, if shipped order notify, 
the name of the party to be notified, and the time and place of sale, 
once a week for two successive weeks, in a newspaper of general 
circulation at the place of sale or nearest place where such newspaper 
is published: Provided, That 30 days shall have elapsed before 
publication of notice of sale after said notice that the property was 
refused or remains unclaimed was mailed, sent, or given.
    (c) Where perishable property which has been transported hereunder 
to destination is refused by consignee or party entitled to receive it, 
or said consignee or party entitled to receive it shall fail to receive 
it promptly, the carrier, may, in its discretion, to prevent 
deterioration or further deterioration, sell the same to the best 
advantage at private or public sale: Provided, That if time serves for 
notification to the consignor or owner of the refusal of the property or 
the failure to receive it, and request for disposition of the property, 
such notification shall be given, in such manner as the exercise of due 
diligence requires, before the property is sold.
    (d) Where the procedure provided for in the two paragraphs last 
preceding is not possible, it is agreed that nothing contained in said 
paragraphs shall be construed to abridge the right of the carrier at its 
option to sell the property under such circumstances and in such manner 
as may be authorized by law.
    (e) The proceeds of any sale made under this section shall be 
applied by the carrier to the payment of freight, demurrage, storage, 
and any other lawful charges and the expense of notice, advertisement, 
sale, and other necessary expense and of caring for and maintaining the 
property, if proper care of the same requires special expense, and 
should there be a balance it shall be paid to the owner of the property 
sold hereunder.
    (f) Property destined to or taken from a station, wharf, or landing 
at which there is no regularly appointed freight agent shall be entirely 
at risk of owner after unloaded from cars or vessels or until loaded 
into cars or vessels, and except in case of carrier's negligence, when 
received from or delivered to such stations, wharves, or landings shall 
be at owner's risk until the cars are attached to and after they are 
detached from locomotive or train or until loaded into and after 
unloaded from vessels.
    Sec. 5. No carrier hereunder will carry or be liable in any way for 
any documents, specie, or for any articles of extraordinary value not 
specifically rated in the published classifications or tariffs unless a 
special agreement to do so and a stipulated value of the articles are 
indorsed hereon.
    Sec. 6. Every party, whether principal or agent, shipping explosives 
or dangerous goods, without previous full written disclosure to the 
carrier of their nature, shall be liable for and indemnify the carrier 
against all loss or damage cased by such goods, and such goods may be 
warehoused at owner's risk and expense or destroyed without 
compensation.
    Sec. 7. The owner or consignee shall pay the freight and average, if 
any, and all other lawful charges accruing on said property; but, except 
in those instances where it may lawfully be authorized to do so, no 
carrier by railroad shall deliver or relinquish possession at 
destination of the property covered by this bill of lading until all 
tariff rates and charges thereon have been paid. The consignor shall be 
liable for the freight and all other lawful charges, except that if the 
consignor stipulates, by signature, in the space provided for that 
purpose on the face of this bill of lading that the carrier shall not 
make delivery without requiring payment of such charges and the carrier, 
contrary to such stipulation, shall make delivery without requiring such 
payment, the consignor (except as hereinafter provided) shall not be 
liable for such charges. Provided, that, where the carrier has been 
instructed by the shipper or consignor to deliver said property to a 
consignee other than the shipper or consignor, such consignee shall not 
be legally liable for transportation charges in respect of the 
transportation of said property (beyond those billed against him at the 
time of delivery for which he is otherwise liable) which may be found to 
be due after the property has been delivered to him, if the consignee 
(a) is an agent only and has no beneficial title in said property, and 
(b) prior to delivery of said property has notified the delivering 
carrier in writing of the fact of such agency and absence of beneficial 
title, and, in the case of a shipment reconsigned or diverted to a point 
other than that specified in the original bill of lading, has also 
notified the delivering carrier in writing of the name and address of 
the beneficial owner of said property; and, in such cases the shipper or 
consignor, or, in the case of a shipment so reconsigned or diverted, the 
beneficial owner, shall be liable for such additional charges. If the 
consignee has given to the carrier erroneous information as to who the 
beneficial owner is, such consignee shall himself be liable for such 
additional charges. On shipments reconsigned or diverted by an agent who 
has furnished the carrier in the reconsignment or diversion order with a 
notice of agency and the proper name and address of the beneficial 
owner, and where such shipments are refused or abandoned at ultimate 
destination, the said beneficial owner shall be liable for all legally 
applicable

[[Page 80]]

charges in connection therewith. If the reconsignor or diverter has 
given to the carrier erroneous information as to who the beneficial 
owner is, such reconsignor or diverter shall himself be liable for all 
such charges.
    If a shipper or consignor of a shipment of property (other than a 
prepaid shipment) is also the consignee named in the bill of lading and, 
prior to the time of delivery, notifies, in writing, a delivering 
carrier by railroad (a) to deliver such property at destination to 
another party, (b) that such party is the beneficial owner of such 
property, and (c) that delivery is to be made to such party only upon 
payment of all transportation charges in respect of the transportation 
of such property, and delivery is made by the carrier to such party 
without such payment, such shipper or consignor shall not be liable (as 
shipper, consignor, consignee, or otherwise) for such transportation 
charges but the party to whom delivery is so made shall in any event be 
liable for transportation charges billed against the property at the 
time of such delivery, and also for any additional charges which may be 
found to be due after delivery of the property, except that if such 
party prior to such delivery has notified in writing the delivering 
carrier that he is not the beneficial owner of the property, and has 
given in writing to such delivering carrier the name and address of such 
beneficial owner, such party shall not be liable for any additional 
charges which may be found to be due after delivery of the property; but 
if the party to whom delivery is made has given to the carrier erroneous 
information as to the beneficial owner, such party shall nevertheless be 
liable for such additional charges. If the shipper or consignor has 
given to the delivering carrier erroneous information as to who the 
beneficial owner is, such shipper or consignor shall himself be liable 
for such transportation charges, notwithstanding the foregoing 
provisions of this paragraph and irrespective of any provisions to the 
contrary in the bill of lading or in the contract of transportation 
under which the shipment was made. The term ``delivering carrier'' means 
the line-haul carrier making ultimate delivery.
    Nothing herein shall limit the right of the carrier to require at 
time of shipment the prepayment or guarantee of the charges. If upon 
inspection it is ascertained that the articles shipped are not those 
described in this bill of lading, the freight charges must be paid upon 
the articles actually shipped.
    Where delivery is made by a common carrier by water the foregoing 
provisions of this section shall apply, except as may be inconsistent 
with part III of the Interstate Commerce Act.
    Sec. 8. If this bill of lading is issued on the order of the 
shipper, or his agent, in exchange or in substitution for another bill 
of lading, the shipper's signature to the prior bill of lading as to the 
statement of value or otherwise, or election of common law or bill of 
lading liability, in or in connection with such prior bill of lading, 
shall be considered a part of this bill of lading as fully as if the 
same were written or made in or in connection with this bill of lading.
    Sec. 9. (a) If all or any part of said property is carried by water 
over any part of said route, and loss, damage or injury to said property 
occurs while the same is in the custody of a carrier by water the 
liability of such carrier shall be determined by the bill of lading of 
the carrier by water (this bill of lading being such bill of lading if 
the property is transported by such water carrier thereunder) and by and 
under the laws and regulations applicable to transportation by water. 
Such water carriage shall be performed subject to all the terms and 
provisions of, and all the exemptions from liability contained in the 
Act of Congress of the United States, approved on February 13, 1893, and 
entitled ``An act relating to the navigation of vessels, etc.'' and of 
other statutes of the United States according carriers by water the 
protection of limited liability as well as the following subdivisions of 
this section: and to the conditions contained in this bill of lading not 
inconsistent with this section, when this bill of lading becomes the 
bill of lading of the carrier by water.
    (b) No such carrier by water shall be liable for any loss or damage 
resulting from any fire happening to or on board the vessel, or from 
explosion, bursting of boilers or breakage of shafts, unless caused by 
the design or neglect of such carrier.
    (c) If the owner shall have exercised due diligence in making the 
vessel in all respects seaworthy and properly manned, equipped and 
supplied, no such carrier shall be liable for any loss or damage 
resulting from the perils of the lakes, seas, or other waters, or from 
latent defects in hull, machinery, or appurtenances whether existing 
prior to, at the time of, or after sailing, or from collision, 
stranding, or other accidents of navigation, or from prolongation of the 
voyage. And, when for any reason it is necessary, any vessel carrying 
any or all of the property herein described shall be at liberty to call 
at any port or ports, in or out of the customary route, to tow and be 
towed, to transfer, trans-ship, or lighter, to load and discharge goods 
at any time, to assist vessels in distress, to deviate for the purpose 
of saving life or property, and for docking and repairs. Except in case 
of negligence such carrier shall not be responsible for any loss or 
damage to property if it be necessary or is usual to carry the same upon 
deck.
    (d) General Average shall be payable according to the York-Antwerp 
Rules of 1924, sections 1 to 15, inclusive, and sections 17 to 22, 
inclusive, and as to matters not covered thereby according to the laws 
and usages of

[[Page 81]]

the Port of New York. If the owners shall have exercised due diligence 
to make the vessel in all respects seaworthy and properly manned, 
equipped and supplied, it is hereby agreed that in case of danger, 
damage or disaster resulting from faults or errors in navigation, or in 
the management of the vessel, or from any latent or other defects in the 
vessel, her machinery or appurtenance, or from unseaworthiness, whether 
existing at the time of shipment or at the beginning of the voyage 
(provided the latent or other defects or the unseaworthiness was not 
discoverable by the exercise of due diligence), the shippers, consignees 
and/or owners of the cargo shall nevertheless pay salvage and any 
special charges incurred in respect of the cargo, and shall contribute 
with the shipowner in general average to the payment of any sacrifices, 
losses or expenses of a general average nature that may be made or 
incurred for the common benefit or to relieve the adventure from any 
common peril.
    (e) If the property is being carried under a tariff which provides 
that any carrier or carriers party thereto shall be liable for loss from 
perils of the sea, then as to such carrier or carriers the provisions of 
this section shall be modified in accordance with the tariff provisions, 
which shall be regarded as incorporated into the conditions of this bill 
of lading.
    (f) The term ``water carriage'' in this section shall not be 
construed as including lighterage in or across rivers, harbors, or 
lakes, when performed by or on behalf of rail carriers.
    Sec. 10. Any alteration, addition, or erasure in this bill of lading 
which shall be made without the special notation hereon of the agent of 
the carrier issuing this bill of lading, shall be without effect, and 
this bill of lading shall be enforceable according to its original 
tenor.

PART 1037--BULK GRAIN AND GRAIN PRODUCTS--LOSS AND DAMAGE CLAIMS--Table of Contents

<R05>


Sec.
1037.1  Weights and weighing.
1037.2  Cars.
1037.3  Claims.

    Authority:  49 U.S.C. 721.

    Source:  40 FR 49342, Oct. 22, 1975, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1037.1  Weights and weighing.

    (a) How determined--Accuracy of the weights used in determining the 
quantity of grain and grain products received for transportation by 
carriers and delivered by them to consignees being of primary and 
fundamental importance, the use of estimated weights based upon the 
cubical contents of the load and the test weight per bushel of the grain 
and grain products, or otherwise, will not be accepted. All shipments 
shall be carefully weighed by competent weighers upon scales that are 
known to be accurate within the limits of tolerance stated in scale 
specifications.
    (b) Inspection of scales--Before weighing grain and grain products 
to and from cars, the scale and all other facilities to be used must be 
thoroughly inspected to ascertain whether they are in proper working 
condition, necessary adjustments or repairs, if any required, must be 
made, and an accurate and complete record thereof shall be entered at 
the time of inspection.
    (c) Shipping weights--Where the shipper weighs the grain or grain 
products for shipment and a claim for loss and damage is subsequently 
filed on that shipment, the shipper shall furnish the carrier with whom 
the claim is filed certificates of weight showing car initials and 
number; the kind of grain or grain products; the total scale weight; the 
type and house number of the scale used; the number of drafts and weight 
of each draft; the date and time of weighing; whether the weight is 
official, board-of-trade, grain-exchange, State, or other supervised 
weight; and the number of grain doors used. This information should be 
furnished at the time the claim is filed.
    (d) Destination weights--Where the consignee weighs a shipment of 
grain or grain products and a claim for loss and damage is subsequently 
filed on the shipment, the consignee shall furnish the carrier with whom 
the claim is filed certificates of weight showing the car initials and 
number; the kind of grain or grain products; the total scale weight; the 
type and house number of the scale used; the number of drafts and weight 
of each draft, and the date and time of weighing; and whether the weight 
is official, board-of-trade, grain-exchange, State, or other supervised 
weight. This information should be furnished at the time the claim is 
filed.
    (e) A difference in weights at origin and destination, both of which 
are

[[Page 82]]

based on supervised scales, establishes prima facie that the loss 
occurred in transit and that the railroad is liable. When a difference 
in weights is based in part on an unsupervised weight, which 
nevertheless, was accepted by the railroad as the basis for assessing 
freight charges, such unsupervised weight in combination with a 
supervised weight establishes prima facie that the loss occurred in 
transit and the railroad is liable. When a difference in weights is 
based in part on an unsupervised weight, with the above exception, a 
prima facie case of railroad liability for loss in transit has not been 
established. Such difference in weights is a factor, however, to be 
considered in connection with other evidence that a clear-record car 
arrived at destination with seals intact and unbroken or that the 
shipper made a written complaint that any car placed for loading was 
defective, in response to which the railroad filed a written report 
after investigation of the complaint. See paragraph (c) of Sec. 1037.3.


<R05>
Sec. 1037.2  Cars.

    A car is not in suitable condition for the transportation of bulk 
grain and grain products when it is defective. The rules prescribed in 
this part 1037 apply on shipments transported solely in railroad-owned 
and railroad-leased cars.
[57 FR 54334, Nov. 18, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 1037.3  Claims.

    (a) In computing the amount of the loss for which the carrier will 
pay there will be deducted from the gross amount of the ascertained 
actual loss one-fourth of 1 percent of the established loading weight to 
cover invisible loss and waste; provided, however, that where grain and 
grain products heat in transit and investigation shows that the 
invisible loss resulting therefrom exceeded one-fourth of 1 percent of 
such other amount as may hereafter be fixed in the manner above stated, 
and that the carrier is not otherwise liable for said loss, then the 
ascertained actual amount of the invisible loss due to heating of the 
grain and grain products will be deducted.
    (b) Where investigation discloses a defect in equipment, seal or 
seal record, or a transfer in transit by the carrier of a carload of 
bulk grain or grain products upon which the unloading weight is less 
than the loading weight and the shipper furnishes duly attested 
certificates showing the correctness of the claimed weight, and 
investigation fails to show that the discrepancy is due to defective 
scales or other shipper facilities, or to inaccurate weighing or other 
error at point of origin or destination, or to fraud, then the resulting 
claim will be adjusted subject to the deductions authorized in the 
immediately preceding paragraph (a) of this Sec. 1037.3; provided, 
however, that the clear record of either the carrier's or shippers' 
facilities shall not be interpreted as affecting or changing the burden 
of proof now lawfully resting upon either party. Therefore, movement in 
a clear-record car is not conclusive evidence of the fact that the car 
is not defective. It must be considered along with other evidence to 
determine liability. See paragraph (e) of Sec. 1037.1
    (c) In case of a disputed claim, the records of both the carrier and 
the claimant affecting the shipment involved shall be available to both 
parties. These records shall include a written complaint, if any, filed 
by the shipper with the railroad at the time the car was placed for 
loading that the car was defective, and the written report of an 
investigation of the complaint, filed by the railroad with the shipper, 
if made.

    (a) Commodities exempted. Except as indicated in paragraph (b) of

exempt from the provisions of 49 U.S.C. subtitle IV. The Standard

Other than the specific recyclable commodities listed above, also 
excepted from this exemption are those recyclable products specifically 
identified by the Board at 356 I.C.C. 445-447, those commodities 
previously exempt, and any transportation service regarding which the 
Board has made a finding of market dominance. However, this exemption 
shall not be construed as affecting in any way the existing regulations, 
agreements, prescriptions, conditions, allowances or levels of 
compensation regarding the use of equipment, whether shipper or railroad 
owned or leased, including car hire, per diem and mileage allowances, 
and also including exemption from the anti-trust laws necessary to 
negotiate car service regulations or mandatory interchange of equipment 
or to maintain and execute such agreements. Nor shall this exemption be 
construed to affect existing Class III railroad ``protections'' in the 
case of boxcars.
    (b) Conditions. Carriers must continue to comply with Board 
accounting and reporting requirements. All railroad tariffs pertaining 
to the transportation of these miscellaneous commodities will no longer 
apply. This exemption shall remain in effect, unless modified

Sec. 1039.12  Long and short haul transportation exemption.

    (a) All rates and charges for rail transportation are exempt from 
the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 10726 to the extent that:
    (1) Board approval or consideration before the effective date of 
these rates and charges is not required; and
    (2) Section 10707 will not apply to rates to the extent that they 
are challenged on the basis of alleged violations of section 10726.
    (b) This exemption does not extend to review by the Board upon the 
filing of a formal complaint alleging a violation of section 10726. 
Board review will, however, be subject to the following conditions:
    (1) A showing that a rate violates section 10726 will not create a 
presumption that the higher rate is unreasonably high, and
    (2) A finding by the Board that a rate or charge violates the 
provisions of section 10726 will not, absent a specific showing of 
damages, afford a basis for an award of reparations.

<R05>
Sec. 1039.14  Boxcar transportation exemptions and rules.

    (a) The Rail transportation of all commodities in boxcars is exempt 
from the provisions of 49 U.S.C. subtitle IV except as otherwise 
provided in this section.
    (b) The Board retains jurisdiction in the following areas:
    (1) Car hire and car service.
    (2) Mandatory interchange of equipment.
    (3) Reciprocal switching or joint use of terminal facilities.
    (4) Car supply.
    (5) Freight car pooling agreements.
    (6) Freight rates applicable to boxcar traffic originating or 
terminating at an industry facility served physically by a Class III 
rail carrier, to the extent provided in paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(5) of 
this section.
    (c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, 
carriers are authorized to take the following actions with respect to 
boxcar equipment use:
    (i) Assess charges for empty movement of cars where movements are 
made at the request of the car owner, the Association of American 
Railroads, or the Board. The empty mileage charge is subject to a 
maximum of 35 cents per mile, as adjusted for inflation or deflation 
using the rail cost adjustment factors published periodically by the 
Board in Ex Parte No. 290 (Sub-No. 2), Railroad Cost Recovery 
Procedures. In applying those factors, the figure of 35 cents will be 
treated as having been in effect on October 1, 1982.
    (ii) Store empty cars and reclaim car hire payments beginning at the 
expiration of a 72-hour grace period after the car is made empty.
    (iii) Negotiate bilateral agreements governing car hire rates, empty 
movements, and storage.
    (2) The authorization in paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (ii) of this 
section will not apply to excluded carriers, as defined in paragraph 
(c)(2)(i) of this section, nor will it apply to any boxcar which, on 
December 30, 1983, was owned or leased by a carrier which then would 
have qualified as an excluded carrier and which bears the reporting 
marks of an excluded carrier.
    (i) An ``excluded carrier'' is a Class III carrier or a Class II 
carrier not affiliated with one or more Class I carriers. To be 
affiliated, the Class II carrier must be more than 50 percent owned by 
one or more Class I carriers.
    (ii) The boxcar exclusion of paragraph (c)(2) of this section will 
apply:
    (A) To an excluded boxcar whenever it is owned or leased by any 
Class III carrier and bears a Class III carrier's reporting marks; and

[[Page 86]]

    (B) To an excluded boxcar owned or leased by an excluded Class II 
carrier beginning on October 16, 1986, and ending on October 31, 1990, 
so long as such boxcar has not been otherwise owned or leased by another 
carrier during this period.
    (iii) The exclusion will not apply during any period in which an 
excluded boxcar is leased or assigned to a Class I or affiliated Class 
II carrier. If an excluded Class II carrier becomes a Class III carrier 
within the period under Sec. 1039.14(c)(2)(ii)(B), that carrier will 
thereafter, for purposes of this rule, be treated as if it had been a 
Class III carrier on December 10, 1983.
    (iv) Nothing in paragraph (c)(2) of this section will affect the 
right of any carrier to negotiate bilateral agreements governing car 
hire rates and rules.
    (3) The hourly and mileage car hire rates in effect on January 1, 
1985, as published in AAR Traffic Circular No. OT-10, for any boxcar 
excluded under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, will remain in effect 
without regard to the aging of such car subsequent to January 1, 1986, 
and any modification to the existing car hire formula will not apply to 
such cars. With respect to an excluded boxcar owned or leased by an 
excluded Class II carrier, those car hire rates shall remain in effect 
through October 31, 1990. Any improvements subsequent to January 1, 
1985, to the excluded boxcars capitalized under OT-37 criteria or under 
rebuilt criteria will be subject to the same formula applicable to OT-37 
or rebuilt cars under Ex Parte No. 334 or any other railroad car hire 
proceeding, including any efficiency ratio, if adopted. Any improvements 
or repairs subsequent to December 31, 1990, to the excluded boxcars 
performed under OT-37 criteria or under rebuilt criteria or any other 
criteria shall not result in any increases, additions, or surcharges in 
the car hire rates for such cars.
    (4) No freight rate made effective after April 1, 1985, that applies 
to traffic moving by boxcar and originating or terminating at an 
industry facility served physically by a Class III rail carrier may 
discriminate while these rules are in effect on the basis of:
    (i) The ownership of the boxcar used or the reporting marks any such 
boxcar bears;
    (ii) The car hire rate applicable to the boxcar used; or
    (iii) Any car hire discounts, in the form of reclaims or otherwise, 
available to any carriers with respect to the boxcar used.

Except as prohibited above, carriers may use car ownership or car marks 
for identification purposes when establishing rates.
    (5) The provisions of 49 U.S.C. 10705 and 10705a applicable to joint 
rates and through routes will be effective as to rates and routes 
applicable to boxcar traffic originating or terminating at an industry 
facility served physically by a Class III rail carrier.
    (6) The following carriers are not regarded as Class III or 
unaffiliated Class II carriers for the purpose of this section:

Central New York Railroad Corporation
Cooperstown and Charlotte Valley Railway Corporation
Fonda, Johnstown & Gloversville Railroad Corporation
Lackawaxen and Stourbridge Railroad Corporation
New York, Susquehanna & Western Railway Corporation
Rahway Valley Railroad Company
Staten Island Railway Corporation.
    (d) Carriers must continue to comply with Board accounting and 
reporting requirements. Railroad tariffs pertaining to the exempted 
transportation of commodities in boxcars will no longer apply. This 
exemption shall remain in effect, unless modified or revoked by a 
subsequent order of this Board.

[51 FR 27046, July 29, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 1039.22  Exemption of certain payments, services, and commitments from the Elkins Act and related provisions.

    (a) Whenever a rail carrier:
    (1) Provides payments or services for industrial development 
activities; or,
    (2) Makes commitments regarding future transportation;

and reasonably determines that such payments, services or commitments 
would not be eligible for inclusion in rail contracts under 49 U.S.C. 
10713, such transaction(s) shall be exempt from 49 U.S.C. 10761(a), 
10762(a)(1), 11902, 11903, and 11904(a), subject to the conditions set 
forth in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.
    (b) If any interested person(s) believes a transaction is eligible 
for inclusion in one or more contracts under 49 U.S.C. 10713, that 
person's exclusive remedy shall be to request the Board to so determine, 
and if the Board does so, the transaction shall no longer be exempted by 
this section commencing 60 days after the date of the Board's 
determination.
    (c) Transactions that are exempt under paragraph (a) of this section 
shall be subject to all other applicable provisions of Title 49 U.S.C. 
Subtitle IV and to the antitrust laws to the extent that the activity 
does not fall within the Board's exclusive jurisdiction.
    (d) For any actual movement of traffic, a carrier must file any 
required tariff or section 10713 contract, and conform to all other 
applicable provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act, but this paragraph 
shall not be interpreted to limit, revoke, or remove the effect of the 
exemption granted under paragraph (a) of this section with respect to 
any payments, services, or commitments made prior to the filing of the 
rate or contract.
    (e) When any person files with the Board a petition to revoke the 
exemption granted by this section as to any specific transaction, the 
rail carrier shall have the burden of showing that, with respect to such 
transaction, all requirements of paragraph (a) of this section were met, 
and the carrier reasonably expected, before undertaking such payments, 
services or commitments, that such payments, services or commitments 
would result, within a reasonable time, in a contribution to the 
carrier's going concern value.
    (f) This exemption shall remain in effect unless modified or revoked 
by a subsequent order of this Board.

Sec. 1090.1  Definition of TOFC/COFC service.

    (a) Rail trailer-on-flatcar/container-on-flatcar (TOFC/COFC) service 
means the transportation by rail, in interstate or foreign commerce, 
of--
    (1) Any freight-laden highway truck, trailer, or semitrailer,
    (2) The freight-laden container portion of any highway truck, 
trailer, or semitrailer having a demountable chassis,
    (3) Any freight-laden multimodal vehicle designed to operate both as 
a highway truck, trailer, or semitrailer and as a rail car,
    (4) Any freight-laden intermodal container comparable in dimensions 
to a highway truck, trailer, or semitrailer and designed to be 
transported by more than one mode of transportation, or
    (5) Any of the foregoing types of equipment when empty and being 
transported incidental to its previous or subsequent use in TOFC/COFC 
service.
    (b) Highway TOFC/COFC service means the highway transportation, in 
interstate or foreign commerce, of any of the types of equipment listed 
in paragraph (a) of this section as part of a continuous intermodal 
movement that includes rail TOFC/COFC service, and during which the 
trailer or container is not unloaded.
[52 FR 23660, June 24, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 1090.2  Exemption of rail and highway TOFC/COFC service.

    Except as provided in 49 U.S.C. 10505 (e) and (g), 109229(1), and 
10530, rail TOFC/COFC service and highway TOFC/COFC service provided by 
a rail carrier either itself or jointly with a motor carrier as part of 
a continuous intermodal freight movement is exempt from the requirements 
of 49 U.S.C. subtitle IV, regardless of the type, affiliation, or 
ownership of the carrier performing the highway portion of the service. 
Motor carrier TOFC/COFC pickup and delivery services arranged 
independently with the shipper or receiver (or its representative/agent) 
and performed immediately before or after a TOFC/COFC movement provided 
by a rail carrier are similarly exempt. Tariffs heretofore applicable to 
any transportation service exempted by this section shall no longer 
apply to such service. The exemption does not apply to a motor carrier 
service in which a rail carrier participates only as the motor carrier's 
agent (Plan I TOFC/COFC), nor does the exemption operate to relieve any 
carrier of any obligation it would otherwise have, absent the exemption, 
with respect to providing contractual terms for liability and claims.

Sec. 1090.3  Use of TOFC/COFC service by motor and water carriers.

    (a) Except as otherwise prohibited by these rules, motor and water 
common and contract carriers may use rail TOFC/COFC service in the 
preformance of all or any portion of their authorized service.
    (b) Motor and water common carriers may use rail TOFC/COFC service 
only if their tariff publications give notice that such service may be 
used at their option, but that the right is reserved to the user of 
their services to direct that in any particular instance TOFC/COFC 
service not be used.
    (c) Motor and water contract carriers may use rail TOFC/COFC service 
only if their transportation contracts and tariffs (for water carriers) 
make appropriate provisions therefor.

[[Page 89]]

    (d) Tariffs of motor and water common or water contract carriers 
providing for the use of rail TOFC/COFC service shall set forth the 
points between which TOFC/COFC service may be used.

<R05>
Sec. 1103.1  Register of practitioners.

    The Board maintains a register containing the names of all non-

according to the individual non-attorney practitioner's name and not by 
corporate or firm name. Corporations and firms are not admitted or 
recognized as practitioners before the Board.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.2  Attorneys-at-law--qualifications and requirements to practice before the Board.

    Any person who is a member in good standing of the bar of the

<R05>
Sec. 1103.3  Persons not attorneys-at-law--qualifications and requirements for practice before the Board.

    (a) In general. Any citizen or resident of the United States, not an 
attorney-at-law, who files an application for admission to practice, 
accompanied by the payment of the fee prescribed by rule or order of the 
Board, and who successfully completes the practitioners' examination, 
and shows that applicant possesses the necessary legal and technical 
qualifications to enable applicant to render valuable service before the 
Board and that applicant is competent to advise and assist in the 
presentation of matters before the Board, may be permitted to practice 
before the Board.
    (b) Qualifications standards. A non-attorney applicant for admission 
to practice must meet one of the following requirements:
    (1) An applicant must have completed 2 years (60 semester hours or 
90 quarter hours) of post secondary education and must possess technical 
knowledge, training or experience in the field of transportation which 
is regarded by the Board as the equivalent of 2 additional years of 
college education;
    (2) An applicant must have worked in the field of transportation for 
at least 10 years;
    (3) An applicant must have received a bachelor's degree with at 
least 12 semester hours or 18 quarter hours in transportation or 
business; or
    (4) An applicant must have received a bachelor's degree and worked 
in the field of transportation for at least one year. An applicant's 
statement of college education must be supported by a transcript of 
records attached to the original application. Transcripts from any 
college accredited by the U.S. Department of Education will be accepted 
without question. With all other institutions, the burden of proof is on 
the applicant to establish that the formal education satisfies the 
standards set forth above. The qualifications standards are intended as 
general guidelines. Individual situations that vary from the standards 
will continue to be evaluated on their own merits.
    (c)(1) Application for admission. An application filed pursuant to 
this rule under oath for admission to practice

[[Page 94]]

shall be submitted between January and May 1 of the year in which the 
examination is to be taken. The application is to be completed in full 
on the form provided by the Board, and shall be addressed to the 
Secretary, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC 20423, to the 
attention of the room number indicated on the form.
    (2) Certification: All applicants must complete the following 
certification:

    I, __________ (Name) __________, certify under penalty of perjury 
under the laws of the United States, that I have not been convicted, 
after September 1, 1989, of any Federal or State offense involving the 
distribution or possession of a controlled substance, or that if I have 
been so convicted, I am not ineligible to receive Federal Benefits, 
either by court order or operation of law, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 853a.

    (d) Application fee. Each application filed pursuant to this rule 
must be accompanied by the non-refundable fee in the amount set forth in 
49 CFR 1002.2(f)(100). Payment must be made either by check or money 
order payable to the Surface Transportation Board. Cash payment will not 
be accepted.
    (e) Additional certification. (1) When an application meets the 
required standards, a copy will be referred to the Association of 
Surface Transportation Board Practitioners for a report to the Board as 
to the reputation and character of the applicant. Inquiry also will be 
made by the Board of the sponsors as to their knowledge of the 
applicant's legal and technical qualifications as contemplated by the 
Board's Rules of Practice. If the Board is satisfied as to the 
applicant's qualifications, reputation and character, then applicant 
will be considered eligible to take the examination.
    (2) The Board may require an applicant's sponsors to provide a 
detailed statement of the nature and extent of their knowledge of 
applicant's qualifications. Upon consideration of this material, if the 
Board is not satisfied as to the adequacy of applicant's qualifications, 
the applicant will be notified by registered mail. Applicant may then 
request a hearing to prove his qualifications. If applicant makes such a 
request, the Board will allow a hearing. In the absence of a request for 
a hearing within 20 days after receipt of the notice, the application 
will be considered withdrawn.
    (f) Scope of examination. If applicant meets the educational and 
experience standards, and is found to be of good character, the 
applicant will be permitted to take the examination. The examination 
tests the applicant's experience and knowledge of the principal 
regulations, laws, and economic principles in the field of 
transportation as well as knowledge of the Board's Rules of Practice and 
Canons of Ethics.
    (g) Time and place of examination. The examination will be conducted 
once a year on the second Tuesday in July. Notice of the time and place 
to appear for the examination will be mailed to qualifying applicants 
approximately 30 days prior to the date of the examination.
    (h) Location of examination. Examinations will ordinarily be 
conducted in selected cities where Board offices are located. A listing 
of the available sites will be attached to the application form. 
Applicants may select their preferred examination site. If a group of 
prospective applicants (three applicants or more) wishes to take the 
examination at a location not listed, a letter stating the preferred 
test site should be included with the application. The Board will make 
every effort to administer the test at the requested location.
    (i) Cancellation of examination. If the Board determines that there 
is an insufficient number of applicants to warrant conducting the 
examination, the Board will cancel the examination for that year. Notice 
of the cancellation will be mailed to applicants on or before June 15 
and the application fee will be refunded. The Board will conduct the 
examination the next year following the cancellation of the examination.
    (j) Examination results. Results will be released within 90 days 
after the examination. Individual results will be forwarded to the 
applicants at least 1 week before being publicly released. To protect 
the privacy of those taking the examination, individual grades will not

must be accompanied by a filing fee in the amount set forth in 49 CFR 
1002.2(f)(100).

Education and Practice is responsible, under the general supervision of 
the Vice-Chairman, for the examination of non-attorney applicants, for 
the preparation of examination questions, and for grading examinations. 
The Board consists of two attorneys and one non-attorney appointed by 
the Chairman with the approval of the Board. Under the supervision of 
this Board, a seven-member Committee of Examiners will grade the 
examination questions. The members of this Committee must have at least 
2 years experience with the Board and are appointed for a 2 year term by 
the Chairman, with the approval of the Board. Members may be reappointed 
and, to the extent possible, no more than three members of the Committee 
will be replaced at one time.
    (p) Applicant's oath. No applicant shall be admitted to practice 
before the Board until applicant shall subscribe to an oath or

[[Page 96]]


<R04>
                       Subpart B--Canons of Ethics


<R05>
Sec. 1103.10  Introduction.

    The following canons of ethics are adopted as a general guide for 
those admitted to practice before the Surface Transportation Board. The 
practitioners before the Board include (a) lawyers, who have been 
regularly admitted to practice law and (b) others who have fulfilled the 
requirements set forth in Sec. 1103.3. The former are bound by a broad 
code of ethics and unwritten rules of professional conduct which apply 
to every activity of a lawyer. The canons do not release the lawyer from 
any of the duties or principles of professional conduct by which lawyers 
are bound. They apply similarly to all practitioners before the Board, 
but do not negate the applicability of other ethical codes. The canons 
are organized under three headings, The Practitioner's Duties and 
Responsibilities to the Board, The Practitioner's Duties and 
Responsibilities to the Client, The Practitioner's Duties and 
Responsibilities to Other Litigants, Witnesses and the Public.

     The Practitioner's Duties and Responsibilities Toward the Board


<R05>
Sec. 1103.11  Standards of ethical conduct in courts of the United States to be observed.

    These canons further the purpose of the Board's Rules of Practice 
which direct all persons appearing in proceedings before it to conform, 
as nearly as possible, to the standards of ethical conduct required of 
practice before the courts of the United States. Such standards are 
taken as the basis for these specifications and are modified as the 
nature of the practice before the Board requires.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.12  The practitioner's duty to and attitude toward the Board.

    (a) It is the duty of the practitioner to maintain a respectful 
attitude toward the Board and for the importance of the functions it 
administers. In many respects the Board functions as a Court, and 
practitioners should regard themselves as officers of that Court and 
uphold its honor and dignity.
    (b) It is the right and duty of the practitioner to submit 
grievances about a member or employee of the Board to the proper 
authorities when proper grounds for complaint exists. In such cases, 
charges should be encouraged and the person making them should be 
protected.
    (c) It is the duty of the practitioner to be punctual in attendance, 
and to be concise and direct in the trial and disposition of causes.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.13  Attempts to exert political or personal influence on the Board are prohibited.

    (a) It is unethical for a practitioner to attempt to influence the 
judgment of the Board by threats of political or personal reprisal.
    (b) Marked attention and unusual hospitality on the part of a 
practitioner to a Board Member, administrative law judge, or other 
representative of the Board, which is unwarranted by the personal 
relationship of the parties, is subject to misconstruction of motive and 
should be avoided.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.14  Private communications with the Board are prohibited.

    To the extent that the Board acts in a quasi-judicial capacity, it 
is improper for litigants, directly or through any counsel or 
representative, to communicate privately with a Board Member, 
administrative law judge, or other representative of the Board about a 
pending case, or to argue privately the merits thereof in the absence of 
the adversaries or without notice to them. Practitioners at all times 
shall scrupulously refrain from going beyond ex parte representations 
which are clearly proper in view of the administrative work of the Board 
in their communication with the Board and its staff.

     The Practitioner's Duties and Responsibilities Toward a Client


<R05>
Sec. 1103.15  The practitioner's duty to clients, generally.

    The practitioner shall be respectful of the law and its official 
ministers, and shall not be involved in corruption of public officials 
or deception of the public. In giving improper service or

[[Page 97]]

advice, the practitioner invites and deserves stern condemnation. The 
practitioner shall observe and advise all clients to observe the 
statutory law to the best of his knowledge or as interpreted by 
competent adjudication. The practitioner owes a general duty to practice 
candor toward his client with respect to all aspects to his service to 
the client.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.16  Adverse influences and conflicting interests.

    (a) At the time of the retainer, the practitioner shall disclose to 
the client all circumstances of his relations to the parties, and any 
interest in or connection with the case.
    (b) It is unethical for a practitioner to represent conflicting 
interests, except by express consent of all concerned given after a full 
disclosure of the facts. Within the meaning of this section, a 
practitioner represents conflicting interest, when on behalf of one 
client, it is his duty to contend for that which duty to another client 
requires him to oppose.
    (c) The obligation to represent the client with undivided fidelity 
and not to divulge secrets or confidence forbids also the subsequent 
acceptance of retainers or employment from others in matters adversely 
affecting any interest of the client with respect to which confidence 
has been reposed.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.17  Joint association of practitioners and conflicts of opinion.

    (a) A client's offer of the assistance of an additional practitioner 
should not be regarded as evidence of lack of confidence, but the matter 
should be left to the determination of the client. A practitioner shall 
decline association as colleague if it is objectionable to the 
practitioner first retained, but if the client should relieve the 
practitioner first retained, another may come into the case.
    (b) When practitioners jointly associated in a case cannot agree as 
to any matter vital to the interest of the client the conflict of 
opinion should be frankly stated to the client for final determination. 
The client's decision should be accepted by them unless the nature of 
the difference makes it impracticable for the practitioner whose 
judgment has been overruled to cooperate effectively. In that event, it 
is the practitioner's duty to ask the client to relieve him of his 
obligation.
    (c) It is the right of any practitioner to give proper advice to 
those seeking relief against an unfaithful or neglectful practitioner. 
The practitioner against whom the complaint is made should be notified 
of such action.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.18  Withdrawal from employment.

    The right of a practitioner to withdraw from employment, once begun, 
arises only from good cause. The desire or consent of the client is not 
always sufficient cause for withdrawal. The practitioner shall not 
abandon the unfinished task to the detriment of the client except for 
reasons of honor, or the client's persistence over the practitioner's 
remonstrance in presenting frivolous defenses, or the client's 
deliberate disregard of an obligation as to fees or expenses. In these 
cases, the practitioner may be warranted in withdrawing after due notice 
to the client with time allowed for the employment of another 
practitioner. Other reasons for withdrawal might include instances in 
which a practitioner discovers that his client has no cause and the 
client is determined to continue the cause, or the practitioner's own 
inability to conduct a case effectively. Upon withdrawing from a case, 
the practitioner shall refund any part of a retainer which clearly has 
not been earned.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.19  Advising upon the merits of a client's cause.

    A practitioner shall try to obtain full knowledge of his client's 
cause before advising thereon. The practitioner shall give a candid 
opinion of the merits and probable result of bringing the case or of any 
related pending or contemplated litigation. The practitioner shall 
beware of bold and confident assurances to clients, especially where 
employment may depend upon such assurances. Whenever a fair settlement 
can be reached, the client shall be advised to avoid or to end 
litigation.

[[Page 98]]


<R05>
Sec. 1103.20  Practitioner's fees and related practices.

    (a) Establishing fees. In establishing fees, a practitioner shall 
avoid charges which overestimate the value of his advice and services. A 
client's ability to pay cannot justify a charge in excess of the value 
of the service although a client's poverty may require a lesser charge 
or even no charge at all. Publicly quoted fees should be adhered to when 
actual charges are made. Practitioners are bound to charge no more than 
the quoted rates for 30 days following the date of their quotations 
unless a different period of time for the effectiveness of such rates is 
clearly specified when quoted, or unless permission to charge a higher 
rate is obtained from the Vice Chairman of the Board.
    (b) Compensation, Boards and rebates. A practitioner shall accept no 
compensation, Boards, rebates or other advantages from the parties in a 
proceeding other than his client without the knowledge and consent of 
his client after full disclosure.
    (c) Contingent fees. Contingent fees should be only those sanctioned 
by law. In no case, except a charity case, should fees be entirely 
contingent upon success.
    (d) Division of fees. Fees for services should be divided only with 
another member of the bar of practitioners and should be based upon a 
division of service or responsibility. It is unethical for a 
practitioner to retain laymen to solicit his employment in pending or 
prospective cases, and to reward them by a share of the fees. Such a 
practice cannot be too severely condemned.
    (e) Suing clients for fees. Controversies with clients concerning 
compensation are to be entered into only insofar as they are compatible 
with self-respect and with the right to receive reasonable compensation 
for services. Lawsuits against clients should be resorted to only to 
prevent injustice, imposition or fraud.
    (f) Acquiring interest in litigation. The practitioner shall not 
purchase or otherwise acquire any pecuniary interest in the subject 
matter of litigation which the practitioner is conducting.
    (g) Expenses. A practitioner may not properly agree with a client 
that the practitioner shall pay or bear the expenses of litigation. He 
may in good faith advance expenses as a matter of convenience but must 
do so subject to reimbursement by the client. A practitioner shall bill 
and collect from a client, and thereafter retain only such payments and 
reimbursements for expenses as have actually been incurred in behalf of 
the client.
    (h) Witnesses' compensation. Compensation of a witness is not to be 
made contigent on the success of a case in which the witness is called.
    (i) Dealing with trust property. Money of the client or other trust 
property coming into the possession of the practitioner should be 
reported promptly, and, except with the client's knowledge and consent, 
should not be commingled with the practitioner's private property or be 
put to the practitioner's private use.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.21  How far a practitioner may go in supporting a client's cause.

    A practitioner shall put forth his best effort to maintain and 
defend the rights of his client. Fear of disfavor of the Board or public 
unpopularity should not cause a practitioner to refrain from the full 
discharge of his duty. The client is entitled to the benefit of any and 
every remedy and defense authorized by law. The client may expect his 
counsel to assert every such remedy or defense. However, the 
practitioner shall act within the bounds of the law. A practitioner 
shall not violate the law or be involved in any manner of fraud or 
chicanery for any client.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.22  Restraining clients from improprieties.

    A practitioner should see that his clients act with the same 
restraint that the practitioner himself uses, particularly with 
reference to the client's conduct toward the Board, fellow 
practitioners, witnesses and other litigants. If a client persists in 
improper conduct, the practitioner should terminate their relationship.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.23  Confidences of a client.

    (a) The practitioner's duty to preserve his client's confidence 
outlasts the practitioner's employment by the

[[Page 99]]

client, and this duty extends to the practitioner's employees as well. 
Neither practitioner nor his employees shall accept employment which 
involves the disclosure or use of a client's confidences without 
knowledge and consent of the client even though there are other 
available sources of information. A practitioner shall not continue 
employment when he discovers that this obligation presents a conflict in 
his duty between the former and the new client.
    (b) If a practitioner is falsely accused by his client, he is not 
precluded from disclosing the truth in respect to the false accusation. 
The announced intention of a client to commit a crime is not included in 
the confidence which a practitioner is bound to respect. The 
practitioner may properly make such disclosures to prevent the act or 
protect those against whom that is threatened.

  The Practitioner's Duties and Responsibilities Regarding Witnesses, 
                     Other Litigants and the Public


<R05>
Sec. 1103.24  Use of adverse witnesses.

    A practitioner shall not be deterred from seeking information from a 
witness connected with or reputed to be biased in favor of an adverse 
party, if the ascertainment of the truth requires that such a person be 
called as a witness in a proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.25  Treatment of witnesses, litigants and other counsel.

    (a) A practitioner shall always treat adverse witnesses and other 
litigants with fairness and due consideration. He should never minister 
to the prejudice of a client in a trial or conduct in a cause. The 
client has no right to demand that the practitioner representing him 
abuse the opposing party or indulge in offensive personal attacks.
    (b) A practitioner shall not attempt to obstruct Board 
investigations or corruptly to influence witnesses and potential 
witnesses during an investigation.
    (c) In conducting a case it is improper for a practitioner to allude 
to the personal history or the personal peculiarities or idiosyncracies 
of practitioners on the other side, or otherwise engage in personal 
abuse of other practitioners.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.26  Discussion of pending litigation in the public press.

    Attempts to influence the action and attitude of the members and 
administrative law judges of the Board through propaganda or through 
colored or distorted articles in the public press, should be avoided. 
However, it is not against the public interest or unfair to the Board if 
the facts of pending litigation are made known to the public through the 
press in a fair and unbiased manner and in dispassionate terms. When the 
circumstances of a particular case appear to justify a statement to the 
public through the press, it is unethical to make it anonymously.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.27  Candor and fairness in dealing with other litigants.

    (a) The conduct of practitioners before the Board and with other 
practitioners should be characterized by candor and fairness. The 
practitioner shall observe scrupulously the principles of fair dealing 
and just consideration for the rights of others.
    (b) It is not candid or fair for a practitioner knowingly to 
misstate or misquote the contents of a paper, the testimony of a 
witness, the language or the argument of an opposing practitioner, or 
the language or effect of a decision or a text book; or, with knowledge 
of its invalidity to cite as authority a decision which has been 
overruled or otherwise impaired as a precedent or a statute which has 
been repealed; or in argument to assert as a fact that which has not 
been proved, or to mislead his opponent by concealing or withholding 
positions in his opening argument upon which his side then intends to 
rely.
    (c) It is dishonorable to deal other than candidly with the facts in 
taking the statements of witnesses, in drawing affidavits and other 
documents, and in the presentation of cases.
    (d) A practitioner shall not offer evidence which he knows the Board 
should reject, in order to get the same before the Board by argument for 
its admissibility, or arguments upon any point

[[Page 100]]

not properly calling for determination. He shall not introduce into an 
argument remarks or statements intended to influence the bystanders.
    (e) A practitioner shall rely on his judgment concerning matters 
incidental to the trial which may, in some cases, affect the proceeding. 
For example, a practitioner should not force a matter to trial when 
there is affliction or bereavement on the part of the opposing 
practitioner if no harm will come from postponing the proceeding.
    (f) A practitioner shall not ignore known customs or practice of the 
Board, even when the law permits, without giving timely notice to the 
opposing practitioner.
    (g) Insofar as is possible, important agreements affecting the 
rights of the clients should be made in writing. It is, however, 
dishonorable to avoid performance of an agreement fairly made only 
because it is not made in writing.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.28  Negotiations with opposing party.

    A practitioner shall not in any way communicate upon the subject of 
controversy with a party represented by another practitioner except upon 
express agreement with the practitioner representing such party. He 
shall not negotiate or make compromises with the other party, but shall 
deal only with the opposing practitioner. The practitioner shall avoid 
everything that may tend to mislead a party not represented by a 
practitioner and should not advise that party as to the law.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.29  Public communication and solicitation.

    (a) A practitioner shall not make any public communication or 
solicitation for employment containing a false, fraudulent, misleading, 
or deceptive statement or claim. This prohibition includes, but is not 
limited to:
    (1) The use of statements containing a material misrepresentation of 
fact or omission of a material fact necessary to keep the statement from 
being misleading;
    (2) Statements intended or likely to create an unjustifiable 
expectation; statements of fee information which are not complete and 
accurate;
    (3) Statements containing information on past performance or 
prediction of future success;
    (4) Statements of prior Board employment outside the context of 
biographical information; statements containing a testimonial about or 
endorsement of a practitioner;
    (5) Statements containing an opinion as to the quality of a 
practitioner's services, or statements intended or likely to attract 
clients by the use of showmanship, puffery, or self-laudation, including 
the use of slogans, jingles, or sensational language or format.
    (b) A practitioner shall not solicit a potential client who has 
given the practitioner adequate notice that he does not want to receive 
communications from the practitioner, nor shall a practitioner make a 
solicitation which involves the use of undue influence.
    (c) A practitioner shall not solicit a potential client who is 
apparently in a physical or mental condition which would make it 
unlikely that he could exercise reasonable, considered judgment as to 
the selection of a practitioner.
    (d) A practitioner shall not pay or otherwise assist any other 
person who is not also a practitioner and a member or associate of the 
same firm to solicit employment for the practitioner.
    (e) If a public communication is to be made through use of radio or 
television, it must be prerecorded and approved for broadcast by the 
practitioner. A recording of the actual transmission must be retained by 
the practitioner for a period of 1 year after the date of the final 
transmission.
    (f) A paid advertisement must be identified as such unless it is 
apparent from the context that it is a paid advertisement.
    (g) A practitioner shall not compensate or give anything of value to 
a representative of any communication medium in anticipation of or in 
return for professional publicity in a news item.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.30  Acceptance of employment.

    (a) The practitioner must decline to conduct a case or to make a 
defense when convinced that it is intended

[[Page 101]]

merely to harass or to injure the opposing party, or to work oppression 
or wrong. Otherwise, it is the practitioner's right, and having accepted 
retainer, it becomes the practitioner's duty, to insist upon the 
judgment of the Board as to the merits of the client's claim. The 
practitioner's acceptance of a case is equivalent to the assertion that 
the client's case is proper for determination.
    (b) No practitioner is obliged to act either as adviser or advocate 
for every potential client. The practitioner has the right to decline 
employment. Every practitioner shall decide what employment he will 
accept, what cases he will bring before the Board for complainants, or 
contest for defendants or respondents.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.31  Responsibility for litigation.

    The practitioner bears the responsibility for advising as to 
questionable transactions, bringing questionable proceedings, or urging 
questionable defenses. Client's instructions cannot be used as an excuse 
for questionable practices.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.32  Discovery of imposition and deception and duty to report corrupt or dishonest conduct.

    (a) The practitioner, upon detecting fraud or deception practiced 
against the Board or a party in a case, shall make every effort to 
rectify the practice by advising his client to forgo any unjustly earned 
advantage. If such advice is refused, the practitioner should inform the 
injured party or that party's practitioner so that appropriate steps may 
be taken.
    (b) Practitioners shall expose without fear or favor before the 
proper tribunals any corrupt or dishonest conduct and should accept 
without hesitation employment against a practitioner who has wronged his 
client. The practitioner upon the trial of a case in which perjury has 
been committed owes it to the Board and to the public to bring the 
matter to the knowledge of the prosecuting authorities.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.33  Responsibility when proposing a person for admission to practice before the Board.

    The practitioner shall aid in guarding the bar of the Board against 
admission of candidates unfit or unqualified because deficient in either 
moral character or qualification. A practitioner shall propose no person 
for admission to practice before the Board unless from personal 
knowledge or after reasonable inquiry he sincerely believes and is able 
to vouch that such person possesses the qualifications prescribed in 
Sec. 1103.3.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.34  Intermediaries.

    (a) The services of a practitioner should not be controlled or 
exploited by any lay agency, personal or corporate, which intervenes 
between client and practitioner. The responsibility and qualifications 
of the practitioner are individual. The practitioner shall avoid all 
relations which direct the performance of his duties in the interest of 
such intermediaries. The practitioner's relationship and responsibility 
to the client should be direct.
    (b) The practitioner may accept employment from any organization 
(such as an association, club or trade organization) authorized by law 
to be a party to proceedings before the Board, to render services in 
such proceedings in any matter in which the organization, as an entity, 
is interested. This employment should only include the rendering of such 
services to the members of the organization in respect to the individual 
affairs as are consistent with the free and faithful performance of his 
duties to the Board.
    (c) Nothing in this canon shall be construed as conflicting with 
Sec. 1103.20(d).


<R05>
Sec. 1103.35  Partnership or professional corporation names and titles.

    In the formation of a partnership or professional corporation among 
practitioners care should be taken to avoid any misleading name or 
representation which would create a false impression as to the position 
or privileges of a

[[Page 102]]

member not duly authorized to practice. No person should be held as a 
practitioner who is not duly qualified under Sec. 1103.2 or Sec. 1103.3 
of these rules. No person who is not duly admitted to practice should be 
held out in a way which will give the impression that he is so admitted. 
No false or assumed or trade name should be used to disguise the 
practitioner or his partnership or professional corporation.

    (a) Signature of attorney or practitioner. If a party is represented 
by a practitioner or an attorney, the original of each paper filed 
should be signed in ink by the practitioner or attorney, whose address 
should be stated. The signature of a practitioner or attorney 
constitutes a certification that the representative:
    (1) Has read the pleading, document or paper;
    (2) Is authorized to file it;
    (3) Believes that there is good ground for the document;
    (4) Has not interposed the document for delay;

A pleading, document or paper thus signed need not be verified or 
accompanied by affidavit unless required elsewhere in these rules.
    (b) Signature by one not authorized to represent others before the

person, in whose behalf it is filed, or by a duly authorized officer of 
the corporation in whose behalf it is filed. If the pleading is a 
complaint, at least one complainant must sign and verify the pleading.

<R05>
Sec. 1104.5  Affirmation or declarations under penalty of perjury in accordance with 18 U.S.C. 1621 in lieu of oath.

    (a) An affirmation will be accepted in lieu of an oath.
    (b) Whenever any rule of this Board requires or permits matter to be 
supported, evidenced, established, or proved by sworn declaration, 
verification, certificate, statement, oath, or affidavit, in writing of 
the person making the same (other than a deposition, oath of office, or 
an oath required to be taken before a special official other than a 
notary public), such matter may, with like force and effect, be 
supported, evidenced, established, or proven by the unsworn declaration, 
certificate, verification, or statement, in writing of such person which 
is subscribed by him, as true under penalty of perjury and dated, in the 
following form:

  I ____________________________, declare (certify, verify, or state) 
          under penalty of perjury (``under the laws of the United 
          States,'' if executed outside of the United States) that the 
          foregoing is true and correct. Further, I certify that I am 
          qualified and authorized to file this (specify type of 
          document). Executed on (date).

    Signature
    (c) Knowing and willful misstatements or omissions of material facts 
constitute federal criminal violations punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001

<R05>
Sec. 1104.6  Timely filing required.

    Documents must be received for filing at the Board's offices in 
Washington, DC within the time limits set for filing. The date of 
receipt at the Board, and not the date of deposit in the mail, 
determines the timeliness of filing. However, if a document is mailed by 
United States express mail, postmarked at least one day prior to the due 
date, it will be accepted as timely. Other express mail, received by the 
private express mail carrier at least one day prior to the due date, 
also will be accepted as timely filed. The term express mail means that 
the carrier or delivery service offers next day delivery to Washington, 
DC.
[47 FR 49554, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 52711, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1104.7  Computation and extension of time.

    (a) Computation. In computing any period of time, the day of the 
act, event, or default upon which the designated period of time begins 
to run is not included. The last day of the period is included unless it 
is Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday in the District of Columbia, in 
which event the period

[[Page 104]]

runs until the end of the next day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or 
holiday. This rule applies to forward and backward measurement of time.
    (b) Extensions. Any time period, except those provided by law or 
specified in these rules respecting informal complaints seeking damage 
may be extended by the Board in its discretion, upon request and for 
good cause. Requests for extensions must be served on all parties of 
record at the same time and by the same means as service is made on the 
Board, except if service is made on the Board in person and personal 
service on other parties is not feasible, service on other parties 
should be made by first class or express mail. A request for an 
extension must be filed not less than 10 days before the due date. Only 
the original of the request and certificate of service need be filed 
with the Board. If granted, the party making the request should promptly 
notify all parties to the proceeding of the extension and so certify to 
the Board, except that this notification is not required in rulemaking 
proceedings.
    (c) Exception to time computation rules. See 49 CFR part 1152 for 
special abandonment rules.
[47 FR 49554, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 52711, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1104.8  Objectionable matter.

    The Board may order that any redundant, irrelevant, immaterial, 
impertinent, or scandalous matter be stricken from any document.
[47 FR 49554, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 52711, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1104.9  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1104.10  Rejection of a deficient document.

    (a) The Board may reject a document, submitted for filing if the 
Board finds that the document does not comply with the rules.
    (b) The Board may either return the material unfiled or tentatively 
accept the material for filing and advise the person tendering it of the 
deficiency and require that the deficiency be corrected.
[47 FR 49554, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 52711, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1104.11  Amendments.

    Leave to amend any document is a matter of the Board's discretion.
[47 FR 49554, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 52711, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1104.12  Service of pleadings and papers.

    (a) Generally. Every document filed with the Board should include a 
certificate showing simultaneous service upon all parties to the 
proceeding. Service on the parties should be by the same method and 
class of service used in serving the Board, with charges, if any, 
prepaid. One copy should be served on each party. If service is made on 
the Board in person, and personal service on other parties is not 
feasible, service should be made by first-class or express mail. When a 
party is represented by a practitioner or attorney, service upon the 
practitioner is deemed to be service upon the party.
    (b) Exceptions. Copies of letters to the Board relating to oral 
argument under part 1116, and subpoenas under Sec. 1113.2, need not be

<R05>
Sec. 1105.2  Responsibility for administration of these rules.

    The Director of the Office of Economics shall have general 
responsibility for the overall management and functioning of the Section 
of Energy and Environment. The Director is delegated the authority to 
sign, on behalf of the Board, memoranda of agreement entered into 
pursuant to 36 CFR 800.5(e)(4) regarding historic preservation matters. 
The Chief of the Section of Energy and Environment is responsible for 
the preparation of documents under these rules and is delegated the 
authority to provide interpretations of the Board's NEPA process, to 
render

[[Page 106]]

initial decisions on requests for waiver or modification of any of these 
rules for individual proceedings, and to recommend rejection of 
environmental reports not in compliance with these rules. This delegated 
authority shall be used only in a manner consistent with Board policy. 
The Director may further delegate procedural authority to the Chief of 
the Section of Energy and Environment as appropriate. Appeals to the 
Board will be available as a matter of right.


<R05>
Sec. 1105.3  Information and assistance.

    Information and assistance regarding the rules and the Board's 
environmental and historic review process is available from the Section 
of Energy and Environment, Surface Transportation Board, 12th & 
Constitution Ave. NW., Washington, DC 20423, telephone: 202-927-6211.

<R05>
Sec. 1105.4  Definitions.

    In addition to the definitions contained in the regulations of the 
Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR part 1508), the following 
definitions apply to these regulations:
    (a) Act means the Interstate Commerce Act, Subtitle IV of Title 49, 
U.S. Code, as amended.
    (b) Applicant means any person or entity seeking Board action, 
whether by application, petition, notice of exemption, or any other 
means that initiates a formal Board proceeding.
    (c) Board means the Surface Transportation Board.
    (d) Environmental Assessment or ``EA'' means a concise public 
document for which the Board is responsible that contains sufficient 
information for determining whether to prepare an Environmental Impact 
Statement or to make a finding of no significant environmental impact.
    (e) Environmental documentation means either an Environmental Impact 
Statement or an Environmental Assessment.
    (f) Environmental Impact Statement or ``EIS'' means the detailed 
written statement required by the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 
U.S.C. 4332(2)(c), for a major Federal action significantly affecting 
the quality of the human environment.
    (g) Environmental Report means a document filed by the applicant(s) 
that:
    (1) Provides notice of the proposed action; and
    (2) Evaluates its environmental impacts and any reasonable 
alternatives to the action. An environmental report may be in the form 
of a proposed draft Environmental Assessment or proposed draft 
Environmental Impact Statement.
    (h) Filing means any request for STB authority, whether by 
application, petition, notice of exemption, or any other means that 
initiates a formal Board proceeding.
    (i) Section of Energy and Environment or ``SEE'' means the Section 
that prepares the Board's environmental documents and analyses.
    (j) Third-Party Consultant means an independent contractor, utilized 
by the applicant, who works with SEE's approval and under SEE's 
direction to prepare any necessary environmental documentation. The 
third party consultant must act on behalf of the Board. The railroad may 
participate in the selection process, as well as in the subsequent 
preparation of environmental documents. However, to avoid any 
impermissible conflict of interest (i.e, essentially any financial or 
other interest in the outcome of the railroad-sponsored project), the 
railroad may not be responsible for the selection or control of 
independent contractors.


<R05>
Sec. 1105.5  Determinative criteria.

    (a) In determining whether a ``major Federal action'' (as that term 
is defined by the Council on Environmental Quality in 40 CFR 1508.18) 
has the potential to affect significantly the quality of the human 
environment, the Board is guided by the definition of ``significantly'' 
at 40 CFR 1508.27.
    (b) A finding that a service or transaction is not within the STB's 
jurisdiction does not require an environmental analysis under the 
National Environmental Policy Act or historic review under the National 
Historic Preservation Act.
    (c) The environmental laws are not triggered where the STB's action 
is

[[Page 107]]

nothing more than a ministerial act, as in:
    (1) The processing of abandonments proposed under the Northeast Rail 
Services Act (45 U.S.C. 744(b)(3));
    (2) Statutorily-authorized interim trail use arrangements under 16 
U.S.C. 1247(d) [see, 49 CFR 1152.29]; or
    (3) Financial assistance arrangements under 49 U.S.C. 10905 (see 49 
CFR 1152.27).

Finally, no environmental analysis is necessary for abandonments that 
are authorized by a bankruptcy court, or transfers of rail lines under 
plans of reorganization, where our function is merely advisory under 11 
U.S.C. 1166, 1170, and 1172.
[56 FR 36105, July 31, 1991; 56 FR 49821, Oct. 1, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 1105.6  Classification of actions.

    (a) Environmental Impact Statements will normally be prepared for 
rail construction proposals other than those described in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section.
    (b) Environmental Assessments will normally be prepared for the 
following proposed actions:
    (1) Construction of connecting track within existing rail rights-of-
way, or on land owned by the connecting railroads;
    (2) Abandonment of a rail line (unless proposed under the Northeast 
Rail Services Act or the Bankruptcy Act);
    (3) Discontinuance of passenger train service or freight service 
(except for discontinuances of freight service under modified 
certificates issued under 49 CFR 1150.21 and discontinuances of trackage 
rights where the affected line will continue to be operated);
    (4) An acquisition, lease or operation under 49 U.S.C. 10901 or 
10910, or consolidation, merger or acquisition of control under 49 
U.S.C. 11343, if it will result in either
    (i) Operational changes that would exceed any of the thresholds 
established in Sec. 1105.7(e) (4) or (5); or
    (ii) An action that would normally require environmental 
documentation (such as a construction or abandonment);
    (5) A rulemaking, policy statement, or legislative proposal that has 
the potential for significant environmental impacts;
    (6) Water carrier licensing under 49 U.S.C. 10922 that:
    (i) Involves a new operation (i.e., one that adds a significant 
number of barges to the inland waterway system requiring the addition of 
towing capacity, or otherwise significantly alters an existing 
operation, or introduces service to a new waterway that has had no 
previous traffic, or involves the commencement of a new service that is 
not statutorily exempt); or
    (ii) Involves the transportation of hazardous materials; and
    (7) Any other proceeding not listed in paragraphs (a) or (c) of this 
section.
    (c) No environmental documentation will normally be prepared 
(although a Historic Report may be required under section 1105.8) for 
the following actions:
    (1) Motor carrier, broker, or freight forwarder licensing and water 
carrier licensing not included in section 1105.6(b)(6);
    (2) Any action that does not result in significant changes in 
carrier operations (i.e., changes that do not exceed the thresholds 
established in section 1105.7(e) (4) or (5)), including (but not limited 
to) all of the following actions that meet this criterion:
    (i) An acquisition, lease, or operation under 49 U.S.C. 10901 or 
10910, or consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control under 49 
U.S.C. 11343 that does not come within subsection (b)(4) of this 
section.
    (ii) Transactions involving corporate changes (such as a change in 
the ownership or the operator, or the issuance of securities or 
reorganization) including grants of authority to hold position as an 
officer or director;
    (iii) Declaratory orders, interpretation or clarification of 
operating authority, substitution of an applicant, name changes, and 
waiver of lease and interchange regulations;
    (iv) Pooling authorizations, approval of rate bureau agreements, and 
approval of shipper antitrust immunity;
    (v) Approval of motor vehicle rental contracts, and self insurance;
    (vi) Determinations of the fact of competition;
    (3) Rate, fare, and tariff actions;

[[Page 108]]

    (4) Common use of rail terminals and trackage rights;
    (5) Discontinuance of rail freight service under a modified 
certificate issued pursuant to 49 CFR 1150.21;
    (6) Discontinuance of trackage rights where the affected line will 
continue to be operated; and
    (7) A rulemaking, policy statement, or legislative proposal that has 
no potential for significant environmental impacts.
    (d) The Board may reclassify or modify these requirements for 
individual proceedings. For actions that generally require no 
environmental documentation, the Board may decide that a particular 
action has the potential for significant environmental impacts and that, 
therefore, the applicant should provide an environmental report and 
either an EA or an EIS will be prepared. For actions generally requiring 
an EA, the Board may prepare a full EIS where the probability of 
significant impacts from the particular proposal is high enough to 
warrant an EIS. Alternatively, in a rail construction, an applicant can 
seek to demonstrate (with supporting information addressing the 
pertinent aspects of Sec. 1105.7(e)) that an EA, rather than an EIS, 
will be sufficient because the particular proposal is not likely to have 
a significant environmental impact. Any request for reclassification 
must be in writing and, in a rail construction, should be presented with 
the prefiling notice required by Sec. 1105.10(a)(1) (or a request to 
waive that prefiling notice period).
    (e) The classifications in this section apply without regard to 
whether the action is proposed by application, petition, notice of 
exemption, or any other means that initiates a formal Board proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 1105.7  Environmental reports.

    (a) Filing. An applicant for an action identified in Sec. 1105.6 (a) 
or (b) must submit to the Board (with or prior to its application, 
petition or notice of exemption) except as provided in paragraph (b) for 
abandonments and discontinuances) an Environmental Report on the 
proposed action containing the information set forth in paragraph (e) of 
this section.
    (b) At least 20 days prior to the filing with the Board of a notice 
of exemption, petition for exemption, or an application for abandonment 
or discontinuance, the applicant must serve copies of the Environmental 
Report on:
    (1) The State Clearinghouse of each State involved (or other State 
equivalent agency if the State has no clearinghouse);
    (2) The State Environmental Protection Agency of each State 
involved;
    (3) The State Coastal Zone Management Agency for any state where the 
proposed activity would affect land or water uses within that State's 
coastal zone;
    (4) The head of each county (or comparable political entity 
including any Indian reservation) through which the line goes;
    (5) The appropriate regional offices of the Environmental Protection 
Agency;
    (6) The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service;
    (7) The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers;
    (8) The National Park Service;
    (9) The U.S. Soil Conservation Service;

Geodetic Survey) as designated agent for the National Geodetic Survey 
and the U.S. Geological Survey; and
    (11) Any other agencies that have been consulted in preparing the 
report.

For information regarding the names and addresses of the agencies to be 
contacted, interested parties may contact SEE at the address and 
telephone number indicated in Sec. 1105.3.
    (c) Certification. In its Environmental Report, the applicant must 
certify that it has sent copies of the Environmental Report to the 
agencies listed and within the time period specified in paragraph (b) of 
this section and that it has consulted with all appropriate agencies in 
preparing the report. These consultations should be made far enough in 
advance to afford those agencies a reasonable opportunity to provide 
meaningful input. Finally, in every abandonment exemption case, 
applicant shall certify that it has published in a newspaper of general 
circulation in each county through which the line passes a notice that 
alerts the public to

[[Page 109]]

the proposed abandonment, to available reuse alternatives, and to how it 
may participate in the STB proceeding.
    (d) Documentation. Any written responses received from agencies that 
were contacted in preparing the Environmental Report shall be attached 
to the report. Oral responses from such agencies shall be briefly 
summarized in the report and the names, titles, and telephone numbers of 
the persons contacted shall be supplied. A copy of, or appropriate 
citation to, any reference materials relied upon also shall be provided.
    (e) Content. The Environmental Report shall include all of the 
information specified in this paragraph, except to the extent that 
applicant explains why any portion(s) are inapplicable. If an historic 
report is required under Sec. 1105.8, the Environmental Report should 
also include the Historic Report required by that section.
    (1) Proposed action and alternatives. Describe the proposed action, 
including commodities transported, the planned disposition (if any) of 
any rail line and other structures that may be involved, and any 
possible changes in current operations or maintenance practices. Also 
describe any reasonable alternatives to the proposed action. Include a 
readable, detailed map and drawings clearly delineating the project.
    (2) Transportation system. Describe the effects of the proposed 
action on regional or local transportation systems and patterns. 
Estimate the amount of traffic (passenger or freight) that will be 
diverted to other transportation systems or modes as a result of the 
proposed action.
    (3) Land use. (i) Based on consultation with local and/or regional 
planning agencies and/or a review of the official planning documents 
prepared by such agencies, state whether the proposed action is 
consistent with existing land use plans. Describe any inconsistencies.
    (ii) Based on consultation with the U.S. Soil Conservation Service, 
state the effect of the proposed action on any prime agricultural land.
    (iii) If the action affects land or water uses within a designated 
coastal zone, include the coastal zone information required by 
Sec. 1105.9.
    (iv) If the proposed action is an abandonment, state whether or not 
the right-of-way is suitable for alternative public use under 49 U.S.C. 
10906 and explain why.
    (4) Energy. (i) Describe the effect of the proposed action on 
transportation of energy resources.
    (ii) Describe the effect of the proposed action on recyclable 
commodities.
    (iii) State whether the proposed action will result in an increase 
or decrease in overall energy efficiency and explain why.
    (iv) If the proposed action will cause diversions from rail to motor 
carriage of more than:
    (A) 1,000 rail carloads a year; or
    (B) An average of 50 rail carloads per mile per year for any part of 
the affected line, quantify the resulting net change in energy 
consumption and show the data and methodology used to arrive at the 
figure given. To minimize the production of repetitive data, the 
information on overall energy efficiency in Sec. 1105.7(e)(4)(iii) need 
not be supplied if the more detailed information in 
Sec. 1105.7(e)(4)(iv) is required.
    (5) Air. (i) If the proposed action will result in either:
    (A) An increase in rail traffic of at least 100 percent (measured in 
gross ton miles annually) or an increase of at least eight trains a day 
on any segment of rail line affected by the proposal, or
    (B) An increase in rail yard activity of at least 100 percent 
(measured by carload activity), or
    (C) An average increase in truck traffic of more than 10 percent of 
the average daily traffic or 50 vehicles a day on any affected road 
segment, quantify the anticipated effect on air emissions. For a 
proposal under 49 U.S.C. 10901 (or 10505) to construct a new line or 
reinstitute service over a previously abandoned line, only the eight 
train a day provision in subsection (5)(i)(A) will apply.
    (ii) If the proposed action affects a class I or nonattainment area 
under the Clean Air Act, and will result in either:
    (A) An increase in rail traffic of at least 50 percent (measured in 
gross ton miles annually) or an increase of at

[[Page 110]]

least three trains a day on any segment of rail line,
    (B) An increase in rail yard activity of at least 20 percent 
(measured by carload activity), or
    (C) An average increase in truck traffic of more than 10 percent of 
the average daily traffic or 50 vehicles a day on a given road segment, 
then state whether any expected increased emissions are within the 
parameters established by the State Implementation Plan. However, for a 
rail construction under 49 U.S.C. 10901 (or 49 U.S.C. 10505), or a case 
involving the reinstitution of service over a previously abandoned line, 
only the three train a day threshold in this item shall apply.
    (iii) If transportation of ozone depleting materials (such as 
nitrogen oxide and freon) is contemplated, identify: the materials and 
quantity; the frequency of service; safety practices (including any 
speed restrictions); the applicant's safety record (to the extent 
available) on derailments, accidents and spills; contingency plans to 
deal with accidental spills; and the likelihood of an accidental release 
of ozone depleting materials in the event of a collision or derailment.
    (6) Noise. If any of the thresholds identified in item (5)(i) of 
this section are surpassed, state whether the proposed action will 
cause:
    (i) An incremental increase in noise levels of three decibels Ldn or 
more; or
    (ii) An increase to a noise level of 65 decibels Ldn or greater. If 
so, identify sensitive receptors (e.g., schools, libraries, hospitals, 
residences, retirement communities, and nursing homes) in the project 
area, and quantify the noise increase for these receptors if the 
thresholds are surpassed.
    (7) Safety. (i) Describe any effects of the proposed action on 
public health and safety (including vehicle delay time at railroad grade 
crossings).
    (ii) If hazardous materials are expected to be transported, 
identify: the materials and quantity; the frequency of service; whether 
chemicals are being transported that, if mixed, could react to form more 
hazardous compounds; safety practices (including any speed 
restrictions); the applicant's safety record (to the extent available) 
on derailments, accidents and hazardous spills; the contingency plans to 
deal with accidental spills; and the likelihood of an accidental release 
of hazardous materials.
    (iii) If there are any known hazardous waste sites or sites where 
there have been known hazardous materials spills on the right-of-way, 
identify the location of those sites and the types of hazardous 
materials involved.
    (8) Biological resources. (i) Based on consultation with the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service, state whether the proposed action is likely 
to adversely affect endangered or threatened species or areas designated 
as a critical habitat, and if so, describe the effects.
    (ii) State whether wildlife sanctuaries or refuges, National or 
State parks or forests will be affected, and describe any effects.
    (9) Water. (i) Based on consultation with State water quality 
officials, state whether the proposed action is consistent with 
applicable Federal, State or local water quality standards. Describe any 
inconsistencies.
    (ii) Based on consultation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 
state whether permits under section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 
U.S.C. 1344) are required for the proposed action and whether any 
designated wetlands or 100-year flood plains will be affected. Describe 
the effects.
    (iii) State whether permits under section 402 of the Clean Water Act 
(33 U.S.C. 1342) are required for the proposed action. (Applicants 
should contact the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or the state 
environmental protection or equivalent agency if they are unsure whether 
such permits are required.)
    (10) Proposed Mitigation. Describe any actions that are proposed to 
mitigate adverse environmental impacts, indicating why the proposed 
mitigation is appropriate.
    (11) Additional Information for Rail Constructions. The following 
additional information should be included for rail construction 
proposals (including connecting track construction):

[[Page 111]]

    (i) Describe the proposed route(s) by State, county, and 
subdivision, including a plan view, at a scale not to exceed 1:24,000 
(7\1/2\ minute U.S.G.S. quadrangle map), clearly showing the 
relationship to the existing transportation network (including the 
location of all highway and road crossings) and the right-of-way 
according to ownership and land use requirements.
    (ii) Describe any alternative routes considered, and a no-build 
alternative (or why this would not be applicable), and explain why they 
were not selected.
    (iii) Describe the construction plans, including the effect on the 
human environment, labor force requirements, the location of borrow 
pits, if any, and earthwork estimates.
    (iv) Describe in detail the rail operations to be conducted upon the 
line, including estimates of freight (carloads and tonnage) to be 
transported, the anticipated daily and annual number of train movements, 
number of cars per train, types of cars, motive power requirements, 
proposed speeds, labor force, and proposed maintenance-of-way practices.
    (v) Describe the effects, including indirect or down-line impacts, 
of the new or diverted traffic over the line if the thresholds governing 
energy, noise and air impacts in Secs. 1105.7(e)(4), (5), or (6) are 
met.
    (vi) Describe the effects, including impacts on essential public 
services (e.g., fire, police, ambulance, neighborhood schools), public 
roads, and adjoining properties, in communities to be traversed by the 
line.
    (vii) Discuss societal impacts, including expected change in 
employment during and after construction.
    (f) Additional information. The Board may require applicants to 
submit additional information regarding the environmental or energy 
effects of the proposed action.
    (g) Waivers. The Board may waive or modify, in whole or in part, the 
provisions of this section where a railroad applicant shows that the 
information requested is not necessary for the Board to evaluate the 
environmental impacts of the proposed action.

Sec. 1105.6 (a) or (b), or an action in Sec. 1105.6(c) that will result 
in the lease, transfer, or sale of a railroad's line, sites or 
structures, must submit (with its application, petition or notice) the 
Historic Report described in paragraph (d) of this section, unless 
excepted under paragraph (b) of this section. This report should be 
combined with the Environmental Report where one is required. The 
purpose of the Historic Report is to provide the Board with sufficient 
information to conduct the consultation process required by the National 
Historic Preservation Act.
    (b) Exceptions. The following proposals do not require an historic 
report:
    (1) A sale, lease or transfer of a rail line for the purpose of 
continued rail operations where further STB approval is required to 
abandon any service and there are no plans to dispose of or alter 
properties subject to STB jurisdiction that are 50 years old or older.
    (2) A sale, lease, or transfer of property between corporate 
affiliates where there will be no significant change in operations.
    (3) Trackage rights, common use of rail terminals, common control 
through stock ownership or similar action which will not substantially 
change the level of maintenance of railroad property.
    (4) A rulemaking, policy statement, petition for declaratory order, 
petition for waiver of procedural requirements, or proceeding involving 
transportation rates or classifications.
    (c) Distribution. The applicant must send the Historic Report to the 
apropriate State Historic Preservation Officer(s), preferably at least 
60 days in advance of filing the application, petition, or notice, but 
not later than 20 days prior to filing with the Board.

[[Page 112]]

    (d) Content. The Historic Report should contain the information 
required by Sec. 1105.7(e)(1) and the following additional historic 
information:
    (1) A U.S.G.S. topographic map (or an alternate map drawn to scale 
and sufficiently detailed to show buildings and other structures in the 
vicinity of the proposed action) showing the location of the proposed 
action, and the locations and approximate dimensions of railroad 
structures that are 50 years old or older and are part of the proposed 
action;
    (2) A written description of the right-of-way (including approximate 
widths, to the extent known), and the topography and urban and/or rural 
characteristics of the surrounding area;
    (3) Good quality photographs (actual photographic prints, not 
photocopies) of railroad structures on the property that are 50 years 
old or older and of the immediately surrounding area;
    (4) The date(s) of construction of the structure(s), and the date(s) 
and extent of any major alterations, to the extent such information is 
known;
    (5) A brief narrative history of carrier operations in the area, and 
an explanation of what, if any, changes are contemplated as a result of 
the proposed action;
    (6) A brief summary of documents in the carrier's possession, such 
as engineering drawings, that might be useful in documenting a structure 
that is found to be historic;
    (7) An opinion (based on readily available information in the 
railroad's possession) as to whether the site and/or structures meet the 
criteria for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (36 CFR 
60.4), and whether there is a likelihood of archeological resources or 
any other previously unknown historic properties in the project area, 
and the basis for these opinions (including any consultations with the 
State Historic Preservation Office, local historical societies or 
universities);
    (8) A description (based on readily available information in the 
railroad's possession) of any known prior subsurface ground disturbance 
or fill, environmental conditions (naturally occurring or manmade) that 
might affect the archeological recovery of resources (such as swampy 
conditions or the presence of toxic wastes), and the surrounding 
terrain.
    (9) Within 30 days of receipt of the historic report, the State 
Historic Preservation Officer may request the following additional 
information regarding specified nonrailroad owned properties or groups 
of properties immediately adjacent to the railroad right-of-way: 
photographs of specified properties that can be readily seen from the 
railroad right-of-way (or other public rights-of-way adjacent to the 
property) and a written description of any previously discovered 
archeological sites, identifying the location and type of the site 
(i.e., prehistoric or native American).
    (e) Any of these requirements may be waived or modified when the 
information is not necessary to determine the presence of historic 
properties and the effect of the proposed action on them.
    (f) Historic preservation conditions imposed by the Board in rail 
abandonment cases generally will not extend beyond the 330-day statutory 
time period in 49 U.S.C. 10904 for abandonment proceedings.

Sec. 1105.9  Coastal Zone Management Act requirements.

    (a) If the proposed action affects land or water uses within a State 
coastal zone designated pursuant to the Coastal Zone Management Act (16 
U.S.C. 1451 et seq.) applicant must comply with the following 
procedures:
    (1) If the proposed action is listed as subject to review in the 
State's coastal zone management plan, applicant (with, or prior to its 
filing) must certify (pursuant to 15 CFR 930.57 and 930.58) that the 
proposed action is consistent with the coastal zone management plan.
    (2) If the activity is not listed, applicant (with, or prior to its 
filing) must certify that actual notice of the proposal was given to the 
State coastal zone manager at least 40 days before the effective date of 
the requested action.
    (b) If there is consistency review under 15 CFR 930.54, the Board 
and the

[[Page 113]]

applicant will comply with the consistency certification procedures of 
15 CFR 930. Also, the Board will withhold a decision, stay the effective 
date of a decision, or impose a condition delaying consummation of the 
action, until the applicant has submitted a consistency certification 
and either the state has concurred in the consistency certification, or 
an appeal to the Secretary of Commerce (under 15 CFR 930.64(e)) is 
successful.


<R05>
Sec. 1105.10  Board procedures.

    (a) Environmental Impact Statements. (1) Prefiling Notice. Where an 
environmental impact statement is required or contemplated, the 
prospective applicant must provide the Section of Energy and Environment 
with written notice of its forthcoming proposal at least 6 months prior 
to filing its application.
    (2) Notice and scope of EIS. When an Environmental Impact Statement 
is prepared for a proposed action, the Board will publish in the Federal 
Register a notice of its intent to prepare an EIS, with a description of 
the proposed action and a request for written comments on the scope of 
the EIS. Where appropriate, the scoping process may include a meeting 
open to interested parties and the public. After considering the 
comments, the Board will publish a notice of the final scope of the EIS. 
If the Environmental Impact Statement is to be prepared in cooperation 
with other agencies, this notice will also indicate which agencies will 
be responsible for the various parts of the Statement.
    (3) Notice of availability. The Board will serve copies of both the 
draft Environmental Impact Statement (or an appropriate summary) and the 
full final Environmental Impact Statement (or an appropriate summary) on 
all parties to the proceeding and on appropriate Federal, State, and 
local agencies. A notice that these documents are available to the 
public will be published (normally by the Environmental Protection 
Agency) in the Federal Register. (Interested persons may obtain copies 
of the documents by contacting the Section of Energy and Environment.)
    (4) Comments. The notice of availability of the draft Environmental 
Impact Statement will establish the time for submitting written 
comments, which will normally be 45 days following service of the 
document. When the Board decides to hold an oral hearing on the merits 
of a proposal, the draft Environmental Impact Statement will be made 
available to the public in advance, normally at least 15 days prior to 
the portion of the hearing relating to the environmental issues. The 
draft EIS will discuss relevant environmental and historic preservation 
issues. The final Environmental Impact Statement will discuss the 
comments received and any changes made in response to them.
    (5) Supplements. An Environmental Impact Statement may be 
supplemented where necessary and appropriate to address substantial 
changes in the proposed action or significant new and relevant 
circumstances or information. If so, the notice and comment procedures 
outlined above will be followed to the extent practical.
    (b) Environmental Assessments. In preparing an Environmental 
Assessment, the Section of Energy and Environment will verify and 
independently analyze the Environmental Report and/or Historic Report 
and related material submitted by an applicant pursuant to sections 
1105.7 and 1105.8. The Environmental Assessment will discuss relevant 
environmental and historic preservation issues. SEE will serve copies of 
the Environmental Assessment on all parties to the proceeding and 
appropriate federal, state, and local agencies, and will announce its 
availability to the public through a notice in the Federal Register. In 
the case of abandonment applications processed under 49 U.S.C. 10903, 
the availability of the Environmental Assessment must be announced in 
the applicant's Notice of Intent filed under 49 CFR 1152.21. The 
deadline for submission of comments on the Environmental Assessment will 
generally be within 30 days of its service (15 days in the case of a 
notice of abandonment under 49 CFR 1152.50). The comments received will 
be addressed in the Board's decision. A supplemental Environmental 
Assessment may be issued where appropriate.

[[Page 114]]

    (c) Waivers. (1) The provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(4) of 
this section or any STB-established time frames in paragraph (b) of this 
section may be waived or modified where appropriate.
    (2) Requests for waiver of Sec. 1105.10(a)(1) must describe as 
completely as possible the anticipated environmental effects of the 
proposed action, and the timing of the proposed action, and show that 
all or part of the six month lead period is not appropriate.
    (d) Third-Party Consultants. Applicants may utilize independent 
third-party consultants to prepare any necessary environmental 
documentation, if approved by SEE. The environmental reporting 
requirements that would otherwise apply will be waived if a railroad 
hires a consultant, SEE approves the scope of the consultant's work, and 
the consultant works under SEE's supervision. In such a case, the 
consultant acts on behalf of the Board, working under SEE's direction to 
collect the needed environmental information and compile it into a draft 
EA or draft EIS, which is then submitted to SEE for its review, 
verification, and approval. We encourage the use of third-party 
consultants.
    (e) Service of Environmental Pleadings. Agencies and interested 
parties sending material on environmental and historic preservation 
issues directly to the Board should send copies to the applicant. Copies 
of Board communications to third-parties involving environmental and 
historic preservation issues also will be sent to the applicant where 
appropriate.
    (f) Consideration in decisionmaking. The environmental documentation 
(generally an EA or an EIS) and the comments and responses thereto 
concerning environmental, historic preservation, CZMA, and endangered 
species issues will be part of the record considered by the Board in the 
proceeding involved. The Board will decide what, if any, environmental 
or historic preservation conditions to impose upon the authority it 
issues based on the environmental record and its substantive 
responsibilities under the Interstate Commerce Act. The Board will 
withhold a decision, stay the effective date of an exemption, or impose 
appropriate conditions upon any authority granted, when an environmental 
or historic preservation issue has not yet been resolved.
    (g) Finding of No Significant Impact. In all exemption cases, if no 
environmental or historic preservation issues are raised by any party or 
identified by SEE in its independent investigation, the Board will issue 
a separate decision making a Finding of No Significant Impact 
(``FONSI'') to show that it has formally considered the environmental 
record.

<R05>
Sec. 1108.1  Definitions.

    (a) Arbitrator means an arbitrator appointed pursuant to these 
provisions.
    (b) ICC means the Interstate Commerce Commission.
    (c) Interstate Commerce Act means the Interstate Commerce Act as 
amended from time to time, including the amendments made by the ICC 
Termination Act of 1995.
    (d) RSTAC means the Rail-Shipper Transportation Advisory Council 
established pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 726.
    (e) STB means the Surface Transportation Board.
    (f) Statutory jurisdiction means the jurisdiction conferred on the 
STB by the Interstate Commerce Act, including jurisdiction over rail 
transportation or services that have been exempted from regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 1108.2  Statement of purpose, organization, and jurisdiction.

    (a) These provisions are intended to provide a means for the 
binding, voluntary arbitration of certain disputes subject to the 
statutory jurisdiction of the STB, either between two or more railroads 
subject to the jurisdiction of the STB or between any such railroad and 
any other person.
    (b) These procedures shall not be available to obtain the grant, 
denial, stay or revocation of any license, authorization (e.g., 
construction, abandonment, purchase, trackage rights, merger, pooling) 
or exemption, or to prescribe for the future any conduct, rules, or 
results of general, industry-wide applicability. Nor are they available 
for arbitration that is conducted pursuant to labor protective 
conditions. These procedures are intended for the resolution of specific 
disputes between specific parties involving the payment of money or 
involving rates or practices related to rail transportation or service 
subject to the statutory jurisdiction of the STB.
    (c) The alternative means of dispute resolution provided for herein 
are established pursuant to the authority of the STB to take such 
actions as are necessary and appropriate to fulfill its jurisdictional 
mandate and not pursuant to the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act, 5 
U.S.C. 571 et seq.
    (d) On January 1, 1996, the STB replaced the ICC. For purposes of 
these procedures, it is immaterial whether

[[Page 117]]

an exemption from regulation was granted by the ICC or the STB.


<R05>
Sec. 1108.3  Matters subject to arbitration.

    (a) Any controversy between two or more parties, subject to 
resolution by the STB, and subject to the limitations in Sec. 1108.2 
hereof, may be processed pursuant to the provisions of this part 1108, 
if all necessary parties voluntarily subject themselves to arbitration 
under these provisions after notice as provided herein.
    (b) Arbitration under these provisions is limited to matters over 
which the STB has statutory jurisdiction and may include disputes 
arising in connection with jurisdictional transportation, including 
service being conducted pursuant to an exemption. An Arbitrator should 
decline to accept, or to render a decision regarding, any dispute that 
exceeds the STB's statutory jurisdiction. Such Arbitrator may resolve 
any dispute properly before him/her in the manner and to the extent 
provided herein, but only to the extent of and within the limits of the 
STB's statutory jurisdiction. In so resolving any such dispute, the 
Arbitrator will not be bound by any procedural rules or regulations 
adopted by the STB for the resolution of similar disputes, except as 
specifically provided in this part 1108; provided, however, that the 
Arbitrator will be guided by the Interstate Commerce Act and by STB and 
ICC precedent.


<R05>
Sec. 1108.4  Relief.

    (a) Subject to specification in the complaint, as provided in 
Sec. 1108.7 herein, an Arbitrator may grant the following types of 
relief:
    (1) Monetary damages, to the extent available under the Interstate 
Commerce Act, with interest at a reasonable rate to be specified by the 
Arbitrator.
    (2) Specific performance of statutory obligations (including the 
prescription of reasonable rates), but for a period not to exceed 3 
years from the effective date of the Arbitrator's award.
    (b) A party may petition an Arbitrator to modify or vacate an 
arbitral award in effect that directs future specific performance, based 
on materially changed circumstances or the criteria for vacation of an 
award contained in 9 U.S.C. 10.
    (1) A petition to modify or vacate an award in effect should be 
filed with the STB. The petition will be assigned to the Arbitrator that 
rendered the award unless that Arbitrator is unavailable, in which event 
the matter will be assigned to another Arbitrator.
    (2) Any such award shall continue in effect pending disposition of 
the request to modify or vacate. Any such request shall be handled as 
expeditiously as practicable with due regard to providing an opportunity 
for the presentation of the parties' views.


<R05>
Sec. 1108.5  Fees and costs.

    (a) Fees will be utilized to defray the costs of the STB in 
administering this alternate dispute resolution program in accordance 
with 31 U.S.C. 9701. The fees for filing a complaint, answer, third 
party complaint, third party answer, appeals of arbitration decisions, 
and petitions to modify or vacate an arbitration award will be as set 
forth in 49 CFR 1002.2(f)(87). All fees are non-refundable except as 
specifically provided and are due with the paying party's first filing 
in any proceeding.
    (b) The parties may agree among themselves who will bear the 
expenses of arbitration, including compensation of the arbitrator. 
Absent an agreement, each party will bear its own expenses, including, 
without limitation, fees of experts or counsel. Absent an agreement, the 
fees of the Arbitrator will be paid by the party or parties losing an 
arbitration entirely. If no party loses an arbitration entirely (as 
determined by the Arbitrator), the parties shall share equally (or pro 
rata if more than two parties) the fees and expenses, if any, of the 
Arbitrator, absent an agreement otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 1108.6  Arbitrators.

    (a) Arbitration shall be conducted by an arbitrator (or panel of 
arbitrators) selected, as provided herein, from a roster of persons 
(other than active government officials) experienced in rail 
transportation or economic issues similar to those capable of arising 
before the STB. The initial roster of arbitrators shall be established 
by the

[[Page 118]]

RSTAC in consultation with the Chairman of the STB, and shall contain 
not fewer than 21 names. The roster shall thereafter be maintained by 
the Chairman of the STB, who may augment the roster at any time to 
include other eligible arbitrators and may remove from the roster any 
arbitrators who are no longer available. The initial roster shall be 
published; thereafter the roster shall be available to the public, upon 
request, at all times. For each arbitrator on the roster, the roster 
shall disclose the level of the fee (or fee range) charged by that 
arbitrator.
    (b) The parties to a dispute may select an arbitrator (or panel of 
arbitrators) and submit the name(s) (and, if not already on the roster 
of arbitrators, the qualifications) of the agreed-upon person(s) in 
writing to the Chairman of the STB. Any person(s) so designated who is 
not already on the roster, if found to be qualified, will be added to 
the roster and may be used as the arbitrator(s) for that dispute.
    (c) If the parties cannot agree upon an arbitrator (or panel of 
arbitrators), then each party shall, using the roster of arbitrators, 
strike through the names of any arbitrators to whom they object, number 
the remaining arbitrators on the list in order of preference, and submit 
its marked roster to the Chairman of the STB. The Chairman will then 
designate the arbitrator (or panel of arbitrators, if mutually preferred 
by the parties) in order of the highest combined ranking of all of the 
parties to the arbitration.
    (d) The process of selecting an Arbitrator pursuant to this section 
shall be conducted confidentially following the completion of the 
Arbitration Commencement Procedures set forth in Sec. 1108.7 hereof.
    (e) If, at any time during the arbitration process, a selected 
Arbitrator becomes incapacitated, unwilling or unable to fulfill his/her 
duties, or if both parties agree that the arbitrator should be replaced, 
a replacement Arbitrator will be promptly selected under the process set 
forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1108.7  Arbitration commencement procedures.

    (a) Each demand for arbitration shall be commenced with a written 
complaint. Because arbitration under these procedures is both voluntary 
and binding, the complaint must set forth in detail: the nature of the 
dispute; the statutory basis of STB jurisdiction; a clear, separate 
statement of each issue as to which arbitration is sought; and the 
specific relief sought. Each complaint shall contain a sworn, notarized 
verification, by a responsible official of the complaining party, that 
the factual allegations contained in the complaint are true and 
accurate. Each complaint must contain a statement that the complainant 
is willing to arbitrate pursuant to these arbitration rules and be bound 
by the result thereof in accordance with those rules, and must contain a 
demand that the defendants likewise agree to arbitrate and be so bound.
    (b) The complaining party shall serve, by overnight mail or hand 
delivery, a signed and dated original of the complaint on each defendant 
(on a responsible official at his or her usual place of business), and 
an original and two copies on the STB, accompanied by the filing fee 
prescribed under Sec. 1108.5(a) and set forth in 49 CFR 1002.2(f)(87). 
Each complaint served on a defendant shall be accompanied by a copy of 
this part 1108.
    (c) Any defendant willing to enter into arbitration under these 
rules must, within 30 days of the date of a complaint, answer the 
complaint in writing. The answer must contain a statement that the 
defendant is willing to arbitrate each arbitration issue set forth in 
the complaint or specify which such issues the defendant is willing to 
arbitrate. If the answer contains an agreement to arbitrate some but not 
all of the arbitration issues in the complaint, the complainant will 
have 10 days from the date of the answer to advise the defendant and the 
STB in writing whether the complainant is willing to arbitrate on that 
basis. Upon the agreement of the parties to arbitrate, these rules will 
be deemed incorporated

[[Page 119]]

by reference into the arbitration agreement.
    (d) The answer of a party willing to arbitrate shall also contain 
that party's specific admissions or denials of each factual allegation 
contained in the complaint, affirmative defenses, and any counterclaims 
or set-offs which the defendant wishes to assert against the 
complainant. The right of a defendant to advance any counterclaims or 
set-offs, and the capacity of an Arbitrator to entertain and render an 
award with respect thereto, is subject to the same jurisdictional limits 
as govern the complaint.
    (e) A defendant's answer must be served on the complainant, other 
parties, and the STB in the same manner as the complaint.
    (f) A defendant willing to enter into arbitration under these 
procedures only if it is able to obtain cross-relief against another 
defendant or a non-party may serve an answer containing an agreement to 
arbitrate that is conditioned upon the willingness of any such third 
party to enter into arbitration as a third party defendant. 
Simultaneously with the service of any such conditional answer, the 
defendant making such answer shall serve a complaint and demand for 
arbitration on the party whose presence that defendant deems to be 
essential, such complaint and demand to be drawn and served in the same 
manner as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. A 
defendant receiving such a complaint and demand for arbitration and that 
is willing to so arbitrate shall respond in the same manner as provided 
in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section.
    (g) Upon receipt of a complaint and demand for arbitration served by 
a complainant on a defendant, or by a defendant on a third-party 
defendant, the STB promptly will notify the parties serving and 
receiving such documents of any patent deficiencies, jurisdictional or 
otherwise, which the STB deems fatal to the processing of the complaint, 
and will suspend the timetable for processing the arbitration until 
further notice. If the complainant is unwilling or unable to remedy such 
deficiencies to the satisfaction of the STB within such time as the STB 
may specify, the complaint shall be deemed to be withdrawn without 
prejudice. Upon satisfaction that two or more parties have 
unconditionally agreed to arbitrate under these procedures, the STB will 
so notify the parties and commence procedures for the selection of an 
Arbitrator.
    (h) An agreement to arbitrate pursuant to these rules will be deemed 
a contract to arbitrate, subject to limited review by the STB pursuant 
to Sec. 1108.11(c), for the purpose of subjecting the arbitration award 
to the provisions of 9 U.S.C. 9 (court enforcement of an arbitration 
award), and 9 U.S.C. 10 (vacation of an arbitration award by a court on 
certain limited grounds).


<R05>
Sec. 1108.8  Arbitration procedures.

    (a) The Arbitrator will establish rules, including timetables, for 
each arbitration proceeding.
    (1) The evidentiary process will be completed within 90 days from 
the start date established by the arbitrator, and the arbitrator's 
decision will be issued within 30 days from the close of the record. The 
parties may agree to vary these timetables, however, subject to the 
approval of the arbitrator. Matters handled through arbitration under 
these rules are exempted from any applicable statutory time limits, 
pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 10502.
    (2) Discovery will be available only upon the agreement of the 
parties.
    (b) Evidence will be submitted under oath. Evidence may be submitted 
in writing or orally, at the direction of the Arbitrator. Hearings for 
the purpose of cross-examining witnesses will be permitted at the sound 
discretion of the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator, at his/her discretion, may 
require additional evidence.
    (c) Subject to alteration by the Arbitrator or by agreement of the 
parties in individual proceedings, as a general rule, where evidence is 
submitted in written form, the complaining party will proceed first, and 
the defendant will proceed next. The complainant will then be given an 
opportunity to submit a reply. At the discretion of the Arbitrator, 
argument may be submitted with each evidentiary filing or in the form of 
a brief after the submission of all evidence. Page limits will be set

[[Page 120]]

by each Arbitrator for all written submissions of other than an 
evidentiary nature.
    (d) Any written document, such as a common carrier rate schedule, 
upon which a party relies should be submitted as part of that party's 
proof, in whole or in relevant part. The Arbitrator will not be bound by 
formal rules of evidence, but will avoid basing a decision entirely or 
largely on unreliable proof.
    (e) Where proof submitted to an Arbitrator addresses railroad costs, 
such proof should be prepared in accordance with the standards employed 
by the STB in ascertaining the costs at issue. Discovery should be 
sufficient to enable parties to meet these standards.
    (f) Where the Arbitrator is advised that any party to an arbitration 
proceeding wishes to keep matters relating to the arbitration 
confidential, the Arbitrator shall take such measures as are reasonably 
necessary to ensure that such matters are treated confidentially by the 
parties or their representatives and are not disclosed by the Arbitrator 
to non-authorized persons. If the Arbitrator regards any confidential 
submission as being essential to his/her written decision, such 
information may be considered in the decision, but the Arbitrator will 
make every effort to omit confidential information from his/her written 
decision.


<R05>
Sec. 1108.9  Decisions.

    (a) Decisions of the Arbitrator shall be in writing and shall 
contain findings of fact and conclusions. All such decisions shall be 
served by the Arbitrator by hand delivery or overnight mail on the 
parties. At the same time, the arbitrator shall notify the STB, in 
writing, that a decision has been rendered.
    (b) By agreeing to arbitrate pursuant to these procedures, each 
party agrees that the decision and award of the Arbitrator shall be 
binding and judicially enforceable in law and equity in any court of 
appropriate jurisdiction, subject to a limited right of appeal to the 
STB as provided below.


<R05>
Sec. 1108.10  Precedent.

    Decisions rendered by arbitrators pursuant to these procedures shall 
have no precedential value.


<R05>
Sec. 1108.11  Enforcement and appeals.

    (a) An arbitration decision rendered pursuant to these procedures 
may be appealed to the STB within 20 days of service of such decision. 
Any such appeal shall be served by hand delivery or overnight mail on 
the parties and on the STB, together with a copy of the arbitration 
decision. Replies to such appeals may be filed within 20 days of the 
filing of the appeal with the Board. An appeal or a reply under this 
paragraph shall not exceed 20 pages in length. The parties shall furnish 
to the STB an original and 10 copies of appeals and replies filed 
pursuant to this section. The filing fee for an appeal will be as set 
forth in 49 CFR 1002.2(f)(87).
    (b) The filing of an appeal, as allowed in paragraph (a) of this 
Sec. 1108.11, automatically will stay an arbitration decision pending 
disposition of the appeal. The STB will decide any such appeal within 50 
days after the appeal is filed. Such decision by the STB shall be served 
in accordance with normal STB service procedures.
    (c) The STB will review, and may vacate or amend, an arbitration 
award, in whole or in part, only on the grounds that such award
    (1) Exceeds the STB's statutory jurisdiction; or
    (2) Does not take its essence from the Interstate Commerce Act.
    (d) Effective arbitration decisions rendered pursuant to these 
procedures, whether or not appealed to the STB, may only be enforced in 
accordance with 9 U.S.C. 9 and vacated by a court in accordance with 9 
U.S.C. 10, except that an STB decision vacating an arbitration award is 
reviewable under the Hobbs Act, 28 U.S.C. 2321, 2342.


<R05>
Sec. 1108.12  Additional matters.

    Where an arbitration demand is filed by one or more complainants 
against one or more defendants, the complainants as a group and the 
defendants as a group shall be entitled to exercise those rights, with 
respect to the selection of arbitrators, as are conferred on individual 
arbitration parties.

Sec. 1109.1  Invoking ADR in Board proceedings.

    Any proceeding may be held in abeyance for 90 days while 
administrative dispute resolution (ADR) procedures (such as arbitration 
and mediation) are pursued. (Additional 90 day periods can be 
requested.) The period while any proceeding is held in abeyance to 
facilitate ADR will not be counted towards the statutory deadlines. All 
parties are required to indicate their written consent for ADR 
treatment. Requests that a proceeding be held in abeyance while ADR 
procedures are pursued should be submitted to the Office of the 
Secretary. The Secretary shall promptly issue an order in response to 
such requests. Unless arbitration or some other binding process 
involving a neutral has been undertaken, any party believing that ADR 
procedures are not yielding the intended results shall inform the 
Secretary and all parties in writing, and normal agency procedures will 
be reactivated by the Secretary by notice served on all the parties.


<R05>
Sec. 1109.2  Appeals from arbitration decisions.

    Appeals are limited to clear errors of general transportation 
importance, and not issues of causation or fact. Arbitration awards can 
be challenged on the basis that they do not take their essence from the 
Interstate Commerce Act, or are not limited to the matters the parties 
have referred for arbitration. Appeals are limited to 10 typewritten 
pages. Parties will have 20 days from the service date of the decision 
to file, and opposing parties 20 days to answer. Arbitration decisions 
will become effective in 30 days unless a party seeks a stay of the 
decision within 10 days of its issuance, and we grant the stay. Appeals 
and stay petitions should be limited to extraordinary circumstances.

Board, adopted under the procedures of section 553 of title 5 of the 
United States Code (the Administrative Procedure Act).


<R05>
Sec. 1110.2  Opening of proceeding.

    (a) The Board may open a rulemaking proceeding on its own motion. In 
doing so, it may consider the recommendations of other agencies of the 
United States and of other persons.
    (b) Any person may petition the Board to issue, amend, or repeal a 
rule.

[[Page 122]]

    (c) Each petition seeking the institution of a proceeding, filed

    (1) Be submitted, along with 15 copies if possible, to the 
Secretary, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC 20423;
    (2) Set forth the text or substance of the rule or amendment 
proposed or specify the rule that the petitioner wants to have repealed 
or modified;
    (3) Explain the interest of the petitioner in the action requested; 
and
    (4) Contain any information and arguments available to the 
petitioner to support the action sought and may detail any 
environmental, energy, or small business considerations.
    (d) In rail cases, the Board will grant or deny a petition within 
120 days of its receipt.
    (e) If the Board determines that a petition contains adequate 
justification, it will open a rulemaking proceeding pursuant to

adequate justification for opening a rulemaking proceeding, the petition 
will be denied, with a brief statement of the grounds for denial, and 
the petitioner will be notified of the Board's action.
    (g) If a petition under this section concerning a common carrier by 
railroad is granted, the Board will proceed as soon as it is 
practicable. If the petition is denied, the Board will publish a 
statement of the reasons for the denial in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 1110.3  Publication of notices.

    (a) Interpretive rules, general statements of policy, and rules 
relating to organization, procedure, or practice may be issued as final 
without notice or other public rulemaking proceedings.
    (b) General rulemaking proceedings will be opened by the issuance of 
either a notice of intent to institute a rulemaking proceeding, an 
advance notice of proposed rulemaking, or a notice of proposed rules. 
The Board will publish the notice in the Federal Register, and it will 
invite the public to participate in the rulemaking proceeding. No notice 
will be issued when the Board finds for good cause, that notice is 
impractical or unnecessary or contrary to the public interest.
    (c) Notices of proposed rulemakings will include:
    (1) The proposed rules, if prepared;
    (2) A discussion of why the rulemakings are needed and what they are

can provide further information concerning the proceedings;
    (6) Any supplementary information required; and
    (7) Reference to the legal authority under which the rules are 
proposed.
    (d) In addition to being published in the Federal Register, notices 
of proposed rulemaking and subsequent notices and decisions in 
rulemaking proceedings, will be served on the parties and made available 
to the public through the Office of the Secretary. To the extent 
possible, the date of service will be the same as the date of 
publication in the Federal Register. When the service and publication 
dates are not the same, the date of publication in the Federal Register 
is controlling for the purpose of determining time periods set by these 
procedures or by notices issued in individual proceedings.


<R05>
Sec. 1110.4  Participation.

    Any person may participate in rulemaking proceedings by submitting 
written information or views. In addition, the Board may invite persons

proceedings. Information contained in written submissions will be given 
the same consideration.


<R05>

other parties.


<R05>

    (a) Any person may petition the Board for an extension of time to 
submit comments in response to a notice of proposed rulemaking. The 
petition and one copy must be submitted at least 10 days prior to the 
deadline for filing comments. The filing of the petition does not 
automatically extend the time for the filing of petitioner's comments.
    (b) The Board will grant the petition only if the petitioner shows a 
substantive interest in the proposed rule and good cause for the 
extension, and if the extension is in the public interest. If an 
extension is granted, notice of it will be published in the Federal 
Register, and it will apply to all persons.


<R05>
Sec. 1110.7  Availability of dockets.

<R05>
Sec. 1111.1   Content of formal complaints; joinder.

    (a) General. A formal complaint must contain the correct, 
unabbreviated names and addresses of each complainant and defendant. It 
should set forth briefly and in plain language the facts upon which it 
is based. It should include specific reference to pertinent statutory 
provisions and Board regulations, and should advise the Board and the 
defendant fully in what respects these provisions or regulations have 
been violated. The complaint should contain a detailed statement of the 
relief requested. Relief in the alternative or of several different 
types may be demanded, but the issues raised in the formal complaint 
should not be broader than those to which complainant's evidence is to 
be directed at the hearing. In a complaint challenging the 
reasonableness of a rail rate, the complainant should indicate whether, 
in their view, the reasonableness of the rate should be examined using 
constrained market pricing or simplified standards to be adopted 
pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 10701(d)(3). The complainant should specify the 
basis for this assertion.
    (b) Multiple causes of action. Two or more grounds of complaint 
concerning the same principle, subject, or statement of facts may be 
included in one

[[Page 124]]

complaint, but should be stated and numbered separately.
    (c) Joinder. Two or more complainants may join in one complaint 
against one or more defendants if their respective causes of action 
concern substantially the same alleged violations and like facts.


<R05>
Sec. 1111.2   Amended and supplemental complaints.

    An amended or supplemental complaint may be tendered for filing by a 
complainant against a defendant or defendants named in the original 
complaint, stating a cause of action alleged to have accrued within the 
statutory period immediately preceding the date of such tender, in favor 
of complainant and against the defendant or defendants. The time limits 
for responding to an amended or supplemental complaint are computed 
pursuant to Secs. 1111.4 and 1111.5 of this part, as if the amended or 
supplemental complaint was an original complaint.


<R05>
Sec. 1111.3   Service.

    A complainant is responsible for serving formal complaints, amended 
or supplemental complaints, and cross complaints on the defendant(s). 
Service shall be made by sending a copy of such complaint to the chief 
legal officer of each defendant by either confirmed facsimile and first-
class mail or express overnight courier. The cover page of each such 
facsimile and the front of each such first-class mail or overnight 
express courier envelope shall include the following legend: ``Service 
of STB Complaint''. Service of the complaint shall be deemed completed 
on the date on which the complaint is served by confirmed facsimile or, 
if service is made by express overnight courier, on the date such 
complaint is actually received by the defendant. When the complaint 
involves more than one defendant, service of the complaint shall be 
deemed completed on the date on which all defendants have been served. 
An original and ten copies of the complaint should be filed with the 
Board together with an acknowledgment of service by the persons served 
or proof of service in the form of a statement of the date and manner of 
service, of the names of the persons served, and of the addresses to 
which the papers were mailed or at which they were delivered, certified 
by the person who made service. If complainant cannot serve the 
complaint, an original of each complaint accompanied by a sufficient 
number of copies to enable the Board to serve one upon each defendant 
and to retain 10 copies in addition to the original should be filed with 
the Board.
[61 FR 52711, Oct. 8, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 58491, Nov. 15, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1111.4   Answers and cross complaints.

    (a) Generally. An answer shall be filed within the time provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section. An answer should be responsive to the 
complaint and should fully advise the Board and the parties of the 
nature of the defense. In answering a complaint challenging the 
reasonableness of a rail rate, the defendant should indicate whether it 
will contend that the Board is deprived of jurisdiction to hear the 
complaint because the revenue-variable cost percentage generated by the 
traffic is less than 180 percent, or the traffic is subject to effective 
product or geographic competition.
    (b) Time for filing; copies; service. An answer must be filed within 
20 days after the service of the complaint or within such additional 
time as the Board may provide. The original and 10 copies of an answer 
must be filed with the Board. The defendant must serve copies of the 
answer upon the complainant and any other defendants.
    (c) Cross complaints. A cross complaint alleging violations by other 
parties to the proceeding or seeking relief against them may be filed 
with the answer. An answer to a cross complaint shall be filed within 20 
days after the service date of the cross complaint. The party shall 
serve copies of an answer to a cross complaint upon the other parties.
    (d) Failure to answer complaint. Averments in a complaint are 
admitted when not denied in an answer to the complaint.


<R05>
Sec. 1111.5   Motions to dismiss or to make more definite.

    An answer to a complaint or cross complaint may be accompanied by a 
motion to dismiss the complaint or

[[Page 125]]

cross complaint or a motion to make the complaint or cross complaint 
more definite. A motion to dismiss can be filed at anytime during a 
proceeding. A complainant or cross complainant may, within 10 days after 
an answer is filed, file a motion to make the answer more definite. Any 
motion to make more definite must specify the defects in the particular 
pleading and must describe fully the additional information or details 
thought to be necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 1111.6   Satisfaction of complaint.

    If a defendant satisfies a formal complaint, either before or after 
answering, a statement to that effect signed by the complainant must be 
filed (original only need be filed), setting forth when and how the 
complaint has been satisfied. This action should be taken as 
expeditiously as possible.


<R05>
Sec. 1111.7   Investigations on the Board's own motion.

    (a) Service of decision. A decision instituting an investigation on 
the Board's own motion will be served by the Board upon respondents.
    (b) Default. If within the time period stated in the decision 
instituting an investigation, a respondent fails to comply with any 
requirement specified in the decision, the respondent will be deemed in 
default and to have waived any further proceedings, and the 
investigation may be decided forthwith.


<R05>
Sec. 1111.8   Procedural schedule in stand-alone cost cases.

    Absent a specific order by the Board, the following general 
procedural schedule will apply in stand-alone cost cases:

Day 0--Complaint filed, discovery period begins.
Day 7 or before--Conference of the parties convened pursuant to 
    Sec. 1111.9(b).
Day 20--Defendant's answer to complaint due.
Day 75--Discovery completed.
Day 120--Complainant files opening evidence on absence of intermodal and 
    intramodal competition, variable cost, and stand-alone cost issues. 
    Defendant files opening evidence on existence of product and 
    geographic competition, and revenue-variable cost percentage 
    generated by complainant's traffic.
Day 180--Complainant and defendant file reply evidence to opponent's 
    opening evidence.
Day 210--Complainant and defendant file rebuttal evidence to opponent's 
    reply evidence.
[61 FR 52711, Oct. 8, 1996; 61 FR 53996, Oct. 16, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1111.9   Meeting to discuss procedural matters.

    (a) Generally. In all complaint proceedings, other than those 
challenging the reasonableness of a rail rate based on stand-alone cost, 
the parties shall meet, or discuss by telephone, discovery and 
procedural matters within 7 days after an answer to a complaint is 
filed. Within 14 days after an answer to a complaint is filed, the 
parties, either jointly or separately, shall file a report with the 
Board setting forth a proposed procedural schedule to govern future 
activities and deadlines in the case.
    (b) Stand-alone cost complaints. In complaints challenging the 
reasonableness of a rail rate based on stand-alone cost, the parties 
shall meet, or discuss by telephone, discovery and procedural matters 
within 7 days after a complaint is filed. The parties should inform the 
Board as soon as possible thereafter whether there are unresolved 
disputes that require Board intervention and, if so, the nature of such 
disputes.

<R05>
Sec. 1112.1  When modified procedure is used.

    The Board may decide that a proceeding be heard under modified 
procedure when it appears that substantially all material issues of fact 
can be resolved through submission of written statements, and efficient 
disposition of the proceeding can be accomplished without oral 
testimony. Modified procedure may be ordered on the Board's initiative, 
or upon approval of a request by any party.
[47 FR 49558, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 52712, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1112.2  Decisions directing modified procedure.

    A decision directing that modified procedure be used will set out 
the schedule for filing verified statements by all parties and will list 
the names and addresses of all persons who at that time are on the 
service list in the proceeding. In this part, a statement responding to 
an opening statement is referred to as a ``reply'', and a statement 
responding to a reply is referred to as a ``rebuttal''. Replies to 
rebuttal material are not permitted. The filing of motions or other 
pleadings will not automatically stay or delay the established 
procedural schedule. Parties will adhere to this schedule unless the 
Board issues an order modifying the schedule.
[47 FR 49558, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 58491, Nov. 15, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1112.3  Default for failure to comply with schedule; effect of default.

    If a party fails to comply with the schedule for submission of 
verified statements, or any other requirements established by the 
modified procedure decision, that party will be deemed to be in default 
and to have waived any further participation in the proceeding. 
Thereafter, the proceeding may be disposed of without notice to and 
without participation by parties in default.


<R05>
Sec. 1112.4  Petitions to intervene.

    (a) The Board may grant a petition to intervene in a proceeding set 
for modified procedure if intervention:
    (1) Will not unduly disrupt the schedule for filing verified 
statements, except for good cause shown; and
    (2) Would not unduly broaden the issues raised in the proceeding.
    (b) The petition to intervene shall set out:
    (1) The petitioner's interest in the proceeding;
    (2) Whether the petitioner supports or opposes the relief sought or 
the action proposed or is otherwise concerned with the issues presented 
in the proceeding; and
    (3) The petitioner's request, if any, for relief.
[47 FR 49558, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 52712, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1112.5  Joint pleadings.

    Parties with common interests are encouraged to prepare joint 
pleadings whenever possible.


<R05>
Sec. 1112.6  Verified statements; contents.

    A verified statement should contain all the facts upon which the 
witness relies, and to the extent that it contains arguments, they 
should be based only on those facts. Parties filing reply and rebuttal 
verified statements will be considered to have admitted the truth of 
material allegations of fact contained in their opponents' statements 
unless those allegations are specifically challenged. Rebuttal 
statements shall be confined to issues raised in the reply statements to 
which they are directed.


<R05>
Sec. 1112.7  Records in other Board proceedings.

    If any portion of the record before the Board in any proceeding 
other than the proceeding at issue is offered in evidence, a true copy 
should be presented for the record.
[47 FR 49558, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 52712, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1112.8  Verification.

    The original of any pleading filed must show the signature, 
capacity, and seal, if any, of the person administering the oath, and 
the date thereof.

<R05>
Sec. 1112.10   Requests for oral hearings and cross examination.

    (a) Requests. Requests for oral hearings in matters originally 
assigned for handling under modified procedure must include the reasons 
why the matter cannot be properly resolved under modified procedure. 
Requests for cross examination of witnesses must include the name of the 
witness and the subject matter of the desired cross examination.
    (b) Disposition. Unless material facts are in dispute, oral hearings 
will not be held. If held, oral hearings will normally be confined to 
material issues upon which the parties disagree. The decision setting a 
matter for oral hearing will define the scope of the hearing.
[61 FR 52712, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1112.11  Authority of officers.

    Except to the extent that they apply only to the conduct of a public 
hearing, the officer assigned to handle a proceeding under the modified 
procedure shall have the same authority as officers assigned to conduct 
oral hearings as described in Sec. 1113.3(a) and (b).

<R05>
Sec. 1113.1  Scheduling hearings; continued hearings.

    (a) Assignment; service and posting of notice. In those proceedings 
in which an oral hearing is to be held, the Board will assign a time and 
place for hearing. Notice of hearings will be posted in the Office of 
the Secretary of the Board and will be served upon the parties and such 
other persons as may be entitled to receive notice under the Act.
    (b) Requests for changes in assignment. Requests for postponements 
of date of hearing will be granted only in exceptional circumstances.
    (c) Continuances. (1) A continuance may be granted at the descretion 
of the presiding officer.
    (2) If the presiding officer announces the time and place of a 
continued hearing on the record, no further notice need be given.
[47 FR 49559, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 52712, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1113.2  Subpoenas.

    (a) Issuance. A subpoena may be issued upon the direction of the 
Board on its own motion or upon request. A subpoena may be issued by the 
Board or by the officer presiding at a hearing and must be signed by the 
Secretary or a member of the Board.
    (b) Requests. (1) A request for a subpoena to compel the appearance 
of a person at a hearing to give oral testimony, but not to produce 
documents, may be made either by letter (only the original need be filed 
with the Board) or orally upon the record at the hearing. A showing of 
general relevance and reasonable scope of the evidence sought

[[Page 128]]

to be introduced through the subpoenaed person may be required.
    (2) A request for a subpoena to compel a witness to produce 
documentary evidence should be made in writing by petition. The petition 
should specify with particularity the books, papers, or documents 
desired and facts expected to be proved, and should show the general 
relevance and reasonable scope of the evidence sought. The officer 
presiding at a hearing may grant a request for such a subpoena made 
orally upon the record.
    (c) Service. The original subpoena should be exhibited to the person 
served, should be read to him if he is unable to read, and a copy should 
be delivered to him by the officer or person making service.
    (d) Return. If service of subpoena is made by a United States 
marshal or his deputy, service should be evidenced by his return on the 
subpoena. If made by any other person, such person shall make an 
affidavit stating the date, time and manner of service; and return such 
affidavit on, or with, the original subpoena in accordance with the form 
thereon. In case of failure to make service the reasons for the failure 
should be stated on the original subpoena. The written acceptance of 
service of a subpoena by the person subpoenaed will be sufficient 
without other evidence of return. The original subpoena bearing or 
accompanied by the required return, affidavit, statement, or acceptance 
of service, should be returned forthwith to the Secretary of the Board, 
unless otherwise directed.
    (e) Witness fees. A witness who is summoned and responds to the 
summons is entitled to the same fee as is paid for like service in the 
courts of the United States. Such fee is to be paid by the party at 
whose instance the testimony is taken at the time the subpoena is 
served, except that when the subpoena is issued on behalf of the United 
States or an officer or agency thereof, fees and mileage need not be 
tendered at the time of service.
[47 FR 49559, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 52712, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1113.3  Authority of officers.

    (a) General. (1) The presiding officer has the authority to regulate 
the procedure in the hearing before him, and has authority to take all 
measures necessary or proper for the efficient performance of the duties 
assigned him. These include authority: (i) To hold hearings; (ii) to 
administer oaths and affirmations; (iii) to grant intervention; (iv) to 
accept any pleading; (v) to establish special rules of procedure 
appropriate to the effective handling of the particular proceeding; (vi) 
to examine witnesses; (vii) to issue subpoenas at the hearing; (viii) to 
dispose of requests for discovery; (ix) to hold conferences for the 
settlement and simplification of issues; (x) to rule on motions and 
dispose of procedural requests; (xi) to make initial decisions; (xii) to 
exclude any person from the hearing for contemptuous conduct; and (xiii) 
to take any other action authorized by this part, by the Administrative 
Procedure Act, or by the Interstate Commerce Act and related acts.
    (2) The presiding officer has the authority: (i) To terminate 
examination or cross-examination of repetitious or cumulative nature; 
(ii) to limit direct examination to material matters; (iii) to limit 
cross-examination to disputed material facts; (iv) to require that 
principal examination or cross-examination be conducted by one or more 
counsel representing similar interests in proceedings where several 
parties are involved; (v) to set reasonable schedules for the 
presentation of witnesses; (vi) and to set reasonable time limits for 
the examination or cross-examination of witnesses. In order to enforce 
this paragraph, the officer may require a clear statement on the record 
of the nature of the testimony to be given by any witness.
    (b) Motions to dismiss; amendments. (1) The presiding officer shall 
have power to decide any motion to dismiss the proceeding or other 
motion which involves final determination of the merits of the 
proceeding.
    (2) The presiding officer may grant leave to amend any application 
or complaint.
    (c) Preparation of the decision by the prevailing party. Any 
proceeding in which an oral hearing is held and in which the officer is 
able to announce his decision either:

[[Page 129]]

    (1) On the record after the close of the taking of testimony and the 
hearing of arguments by the officer, or
    (2) By appropriate notification to the parties after the close of 
hearing, may be made the subject of an initial decision prepared by a 
party or parties in whose favor the officer decides, within a period 
specified by the officer, and subject to such changes as the officer 
considers appropriate in the draft prepared for him.
    (d) Recording; media coverage. The presiding officer shall have 
authority to permit or to refuse to permit the recording of the hearing 
by means of live or delayed television or radio broadcast, or the use of 
a tape recorder or other electronic or photographic equipment by any 
person other than the official reporter.
[47 FR 49559, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 52712, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1113.4  Prehearing conferences.

    (a) Purposes. Upon written notice by the Board in any proceeding, or 
upon written or oral instruction of an officer, parties or their 
representatives may be directed to appear before an officer at a 
specified time and place for a conference, prior to or during the course 
of a hearing, or in lieu of personally appearing, to submit suggestions 
in writing, for the purpose of formulating issues and considering:
    (1) The simplification of issues;
    (2) The necessity or desirability of amending the pleadings either 
for the purpose of clarification, amplification, or limitation;
    (3) The possibility of making admissions of certain averments of 
fact or stipulations concerning the use by any or all parties of matters 
of public record, such as annual reports and the like, to avoid the 
unnecessary introduction of proof;
    (4) The procedure at the hearing;
    (5) The limitation of the number of witnesses;
    (6) The propriety of prior mutual exchange between or among the 
parties of prepared testimony and exhibits; and
    (7) Such other matters, including disposition of requests for 
discovery, as may aid in the simplification of the evidence and 
disposition of the proceeding. Parties may request a prehearing 
conference.
    (b) Facts disclosed privileged. Facts disclosed in the course of the 
prehearing conference are privileged and, except by agreement, will not 
be used against participating parties either before the Board or 
elsewhere unless fully corroborated by other evidence.
    (c) Recordation and decision. Action taken at the conference, 
including a recitation of the amendments allowed to the pleadings, the 
agreements made by the parties as to any of the matters considered, and 
defining the issues, will be recorded in an appropriate decision unless 
the parties enter into a written stipulation as to such matters, or 
agree to a statement thereof made on the record by the officer.
    (d) Objection to the decision; subsequent proceedings. If a decision 
is entered, the parties may, within 20 days of the date of service, or 
within such lesser time as is set by the officer, present objections on 
the grounds that the decision does not fully or correctly embody the 
agreements reached at the conference. Thereafter the terms of the 
written stipulation or statement of the officer, as the case may be, 
will determine the subsequent course of the proceedings, unless modified 
to prevent manifest injustice.
[47 FR 49559, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 52712, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1113.5  Stipulations.

    Apart from the procedure contemplated by the prehearing provisions, 
the parties may, by stipulation in writing filed with the Board at any 
stage of the proceeding, or orally made at the hearing, agree upon any 
pertinent facts in the proceeding. The parties should agree to facts in 
this manner whenever practicable.
[47 FR 49559, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 52712, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1113.6  Appearances; withdrawal or absence from hearing.

    (a) Who may appear. Any individual may appear for himself. Any 
member of a partnership which is a party to any proceeding may appear 
for such partnerships upon adequate identification.

[[Page 130]]

A bona fide officer or a full-time employee of a corporation, 
association, or of an individual may appear for such corporation, 
association, or individual by permission of the officer presiding at the 
hearing. A party also may be represented by a practitioner.
    (b) Withdrawal or absence from hearing. A practitioner who has 
entered his appearance at the hearing shall not be permitted to withdraw 
from the hearing, or willfully be absent therefrom, except for good 
cause and, wherever practicable, only with the permission of the 
presiding officer. If a person who has entered an appearance withdraws 
from the hearing in a manner other than that specified, the Board or the 
Officer may take such action as, in the interest of justice and the 
protection of the lawful rights of all parties to the proceeding, the 
circumstances of the case may warrant, including the striking out of all 
or any part of any pleading of the offending party, and including the 
possible dismissal of the action or proceeding, or any part thereof, the 
entry of an order of default against that party, or if the withdrawal is 
without the permission of the presiding officer, disciplining of the 
practitioner concerned.
[47 FR 49559, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 52712, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1113.7  Intervention; petitions.

    (a) How requested. Intervention will normally be granted only upon 
petition. In exceptional circumstances, where the issues would not be 
broadened or the proceeding delayed, an officer may, at his or her 
discretion, allow intervention upon motion made orally at the hearing.
    (b) Content generally. A petition for leave to intervene must set 
forth the grounds for the proposed intervention, the position and 
interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and whether petitioner's 
position is in support of or in opposition to the relief sought. If the 
proceeding is by formal complaint and affirmative relief is sought by 
petitioner, the petition should conform to the requirements for a formal 
complaint.
    (c) When filed. A petition for leave to intervene in any proceeding 
should be filed prior to or at the time the proceeding is called for 
hearing, but not after, except for good cause shown.
    (d) Broadening issues; filing. If the petition seeks a broadening of 
the issues and shows that they would not thereby be unduly broadened, 
and in respect thereof seeks affirmative relief, the petition should be 
filed in time to permit service upon and answer by the parties in 
advance of the hearing.
    (e) Copies; service; replies. When a petition for leave to intervene 
is tendered at the hearing, sufficient copies of the petition must be 
provided for distribution to the parties represented at the hearing. If 
leave is granted at the hearing, 10 copies of the petition must be 
furnished for the use of the Board. When a petition for leave to 
intervene is not tendered at the hearing, the original and 10 copies of 
the petition should be submitted to the Board together with a 
certificate that service has been made by petitioner. Any reply in 
opposition to a petition for leave to intervene not tendered at the 
hearing must be filed within 20 days after service of the petition to 
intervene. At the discretion of the Board leave to intervene may be 
granted or denied before the expiration of the time allowed for replies.
    (f) Disposition. Leave to intervene will be granted only when the 
petitioner addresses issues reasonably pertinent to the issues already 
presented and which do not unduly broaden them. If leave is granted the 
petitioner becomes an intervener and a party to the proceeding.
[47 FR 49559, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 53 FR 19301, May 27, 1988; 61 
FR 52712, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1113.8  Witness examination; order of procedure.

    Witnesses will be orally examined under oath before the officer 
unless the facts are presented to the Board in the manner provided under 
modified procedure. In formal complaint, application, and investigation 
proceedings, complainant, applicant, and respondent, respectively, shall 
open and close at the hearing. In the event of further hearings granted 
on petition, the petitioners requesting further hearing shall open and 
close the proceeding. Instances exist in which parties other

[[Page 131]]

than the respondent may open and close in investigations where the 
burden of proof is not upon the respondent. Interveners shall follow the 
party in whose behalf the intervention is made. The foregoing order of 
presentation may be varied by the officer.
[47 FR 49559, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 52712, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1113.9  Prepared statements.

    With the approval of the officer, a witness may read into the 
record, as his testimony, statements of fact or expressions of opinion 
prepared by the witness, or written answers to interrogatories of 
counsel. A prepared statement of a witness who is present at the hearing 
may be received as an exhibit, provided that the statement does not 
include argument. Before any such statement is read or admitted in 
evidence, the witness shall deliver to the officer, the reporter, and to 
opposing counsel, as may be directed by the officer, a copy of such 
statement or of such interrogatories and the written answers thereto. 
The admissibility of the evidence contained in such statement will be 
subject to the same rules as if such testimony was produced orally, 
including the right of cross-examination of the witness. The officer may 
require that the witness testify orally if, in the officer's opinion, 
the memory or demeanor of the witness may be of importance.


<R05>
Sec. 1113.10  Records in other Board proceedings.

    A portion of the record before the Board in another proceeding may 
be offered in evidence at an oral hearing. A party making such an offer 
must provide, as an exhibit, a certified copy of the material sought to 
be introduced. A hearing officer may waive the requirement that a copy 
be provided, subject to such conditions as he or she may impose to 
assure that a copy will be available later, if needed, at no expense to 
the Board and to assure that the interests of other parties are not 
prejudiced. An offer of evidence under this section will be subject to 
objection by other parties.
[47 FR 49559, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 52712, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1113.11  Abstracts of documents.

    When documents, such as freight bills or bills of lading, are 
numerous, the officer may refuse to receive all the documents in 
evidence and instead admit only a limited number of representative 
documents. He may instruct, if the proffer be for the purpose of proving 
damage, that introduction be deferred until there is opportunity to 
comply with Sec. 1133.2. If the proffer be for another purpose the 
officer may require the party in orderly fashion to abstract the 
relevant data from the documents, affording other parties reasonable 
opportunity to examine both the documents and the abstract, and 
thereupon offer such abstract in evidence in exhibit form.
[47 FR 49559, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 52713, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1113.12  Exhibits.

    (a) Copies. Unless the officer otherwise directs, the original and 
10 copies of each exhibit of a documentary character should be furnished 
for the use of the Board. The original will be delivered to the 
reporter, and the copy to the officer. If the hearing is before a board, 
a copy of the exhibit should be furnished to each member of the board, 
unless the board otherwise directs. Unless the officer for cause directs 
otherwise, a reasonable number of copies should be furnished to counsel 
in attendance at the hearing.
    (b) Interchange prior to hearing. Whenever practicable, the parties 
should interchange copies of exhibits or other pertinent material or 
matter before or at the commencement of the hearing; and the Board or 
presiding officer may so direct.
    (c) When excluded how treated. When exhibit has been identified, 
objected to, and excluded, the officer will develop whether the party 
offering the exhibit withdraws the offer, and if so, permit the return 
of the exhibit to him. If the excluded exhibit is not withdrawn, it 
should be given an exhibit number for identification and be incorporated 
in the record. Exhibit numbers once used

[[Page 132]]

for identification will not be duplicated thereafter.
[47 FR 49559, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 53 FR 19301, May 27, 1988; 61 
FR 52712, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1113.13  Filing evidence subsequent to hearing; copies.

    Except as provided in this section or as expressly may be permitted 
in a particular instance, the Board will not receive in evidence or 
consider as part of the record any documents, letters, or other writings 
submitted for consideration in connection with any proceeding after 
close of the hearing, and may return any such documents to the sender. 
Before the close of a hearing the officer may, at the request of a party 
or upon his own motion, or upon agreement of the parties, require that a 
party furnish additional documentary evidence that supplements the 
existing record, within a stated period of time. Documentary evidence to 
be furnished in this way will be given an exhibit number at the time of 
filing and the parties advised accordingly. Unless otherwise directed by 
the officer, the original and 10 copies of such submission should be 
filed with the Board.
[47 FR 49559, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 53 FR 19301, May 27, 1988; 61 
FR 52712, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1113.14  Objections to rulings.

    It is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling is made or 
sought, make known to the officer on the record the action which he 
desires the officer to take or his objection to the action of the 
officer and his grounds for that objection. An objection not pressed in 
brief will be considered as waived. Where no brief is filed an objection 
will be considered as waived if not pressed in an appeal or reply to an 
appeal, if filed, or in a separate petition dealing only with that 
objection.


<R05>
Sec. 1113.15  Interlocutory appeals.

    Rulings of the presiding officer may be appealed prior to service of 
the initial decision only if:
    (a) The ruling denies or terminates any person's participation,
    (b) The ruling grants a request for the inspection of documents not 
ordinarily available for public inspection,
    (c) The ruling overrules an objection based on privilege, the result 
of which ruling is to require the presentation of testimony or 
documents, or
    (d) The presiding officer finds that the ruling may result in 
substantial irreparable harm, substantial detriment to the public 
interest, or undue prejudice to a party.


<R05>
Sec. 1113.16  Oral argument before the hearing officer.

    At the discretion of the hearing officer and upon reasonable notice 
to the parties, oral argument may be made at the close of testimony 
before him as an alternative to the filing of written briefs. Such 
argument, which should include requested findings and conclusions, will 
be recorded and made a part of the transcript of testimony, and will be 
available to the Board for consideration in deciding the case. The 
making of such argument will not preclude oral argument before the 
Board.

    (a) Filing. After the close of the hearing, the complete transcript 
of the testimony taken and the exhibits shall be part of the record in 
the proceeding.
    (b) Corrections. A suggested correction in a transcript ordinarily 
will be considered only if offered not later than 20 days after the date 
each transcript is filed with the Board. A copy of the letter (original 
only need be filed with the Board) requesting the suggested corrections 
should be served upon all parties of record and with 2 copies to the 
official reporter.
    (c) Objections to corrections. Parties disagreeing with corrections 
suggested pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section should file written 
objections in the same manner as suggested corrections are to be filed. 
Objections to suggested corrections should be filed not later than 15 
days after the filing with the Board of suggested corrections. If no 
objections are timely filed, the Secretary of the Board shall make the 
suggested corrections to the transcript. If objections are timely filed, 
the officer who presided at the hearing shall determine the merits of 
the suggested

[[Page 133]]

correction and enter an appropriate decision in the proceeding.
    (d) No free copies. The Board will not furnish free copies of the 
transcript to any party to any proceeding.

<R05>
Sec. 1113.18  Briefs.

    (a) When filed. In a proceeding which has been the subject of oral 
hearing, and in which briefs are to be filed, that fact will be stated 
by the officer on the record. The officer shall fix the time for filing 
briefs. Simultaneous filing will normally be required, and reply briefs 
will not normally be permitted.
    (b) Evidence abstract. A brief filed after a hearing may contain an 
abstract of the evidence relied upon by the party filing it, preferably 
assembled by subjects, with reference to the pages of the record, if 
written, or exhibit where the evidence appears. In the event the party 
elects not to include a separate abstract in his brief, he should give 
specific reference to the portions of the record, whether transcript or 
otherwise, relied upon in support of the respective statements of fact 
made throughout the brief.
    (c) Requested findings. Each brief should include such requests for 
specific findings, separately stated and numbered, as the party desires 
the Board to make.
    (d) Exhibit reproduction. Exhibits should not be reproduced in the 
brief, but may be shown, within reasonable limits, in an appendix to the 
brief. Analysis of such exhibits should be included in the brief where 
pertinent.
[47 FR 49559, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 52712, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1113.19  Pleadings: part of the record.

    Matters of fact that are verified and filed prior to oral hearing 
and that are not specifically denied constitute evidence and are part of 
the record. A witness, who would present such evidence, must be made 
available for cross-examination if a request is reasonably made. This 
rule does not apply to protest against tariffs or schedules.

                  Subpart A--General Rules of Evidence


<R05>
Sec. 1114.1  Admissibility.

    Any evidence which is sufficiently reliable and probative to support 
a decision under the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, or 
which would be admissible under the general statutes of the United 
States, or under the rules of evidence governing proceedings in matters 
not involving trial by jury in the courts of the United States, will be 
admissible in hearings before the Board. The rules of evidence will be 
applied in any proceeding to the end that necessary and proper evidence 
will be conveniently, inexpensively, and speedily produced, while 
preserving the substantial rights of the parties.
[47 FR 49562, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 52713, Oct. 8, 1996]

[[Page 134]]


<R05>
Sec. 1114.2  Official records.

    An official record or an entry therein, when admissible for any 
purpose, may be evidenced by an official publication thereof or by a 
copy attested by the officer having the legal custody of the record, or 
by a deputy, and accompanied with a certificate that such officer has 
the custody. If the office in which the record is kept is within the 
United States or within a territory or insular possession subject to the 
dominion of the United States, the certificate may be made by a judge of 
a court of record of the district or political subdivision in which the 
record is kept, authenticated by the seal of the court, or may be made 
by any public officer having a seal of office and having official duties 
in the district or political subdivision in which the record is kept, 
authenticated by the seal of his office. If the office in which the 
record is kept is in a foreign state or country, the certificate may be 
made by a secretary of embassy or legation, consul general, consul, vice 
consul, or consular agent or by officer in the foreign service of the 
United States stationed in the foreign state or country in which the 
record is kept, and authenticated by the seal of his office. A written 
statement signed by an officer having the custody of an official record 
or by his deputy that after diligent search no record or entry of a 
specified tenor is found to exist in the records of his office, 
accompanied by a certificate as above provided, is admissible as 
evidence that the records of this office contain no such record or 
entry. This section does not prevent the proof of official records or of 
entry or lack of entry therein or official notice thereof by a method 
authorized by any applicable statute or by the rules of evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 1114.3  Admissibility of business records.

    Any writing or record, whether in the form of an entry in a book or 
otherwise, made as a memorandum or record of any act, transaction, 
occurrence, or event, will be admissible as evidence thereof if it 
appears that it was made in the regular course of business, and that it 
was the regular course of business to make such memorandum or record at 
the time such record was made, or within a reasonable time thereafter.


<R05>
Sec. 1114.4  Documents in Board's files.

    If a party offers in evidence any matter contained in a report or 
other document open to public inspection in the files of the Board, such 
report or other document need not be made available at the hearing.
[47 FR 49562, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 52713, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1114.5  Records in other Board proceedings.

    If any portion of the record before the Board in any proceeding 
other than the proceeding at issue is offered in evidence, a true copy 
will be presented for the record.
[47 FR 49562, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 52713, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1114.6  Official notice of corroborative material.

    The Board or a hearing officer may take notice of official records, 
records in other Board proceedings, or other materials which are 
otherwise subject to specific rules governing admissibility regardless 
of compliance with the full technical provisions of such rules, where 
the admissibility of the evidence is for purposes of corroboration of 
testimony presented or to evaluate the credibility of testimony or 
allegations made in proceedings where the public interest is not 
otherwise adequately represented by counsel capable of fully complying 
with such rules.
[47 FR 49562, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 52713, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1114.7  Exhibits.

    Whenever practical the sheets of each exhibit and the lines of each 
sheet should be numbered. If the exhibit consists of five or more 
sheets, the first sheet or title-page should be confined to a brief 
statement of what the exhibit purports to show with reference by sheet 
and line to illustrative or typical examples contained therein. The 
exhibit should bear an identifying number, letter, or short title which 
will readily distinguish it from other exhibits offered by the same 
party. It is desirable that, whenever practicable,

[[Page 135]]

evidence should be condensed into tables. Whenever practicable, 
especially in proceedings in which it is likely that many documents will 
be offered, all the documents produced by a single witness should be 
assembled and bound together, suitably arranged and indexed, so that 
they may be identified and offered as one exhibit. Exhibits should not 
be argumentative and should be limited to statements of facts, and be 
relevant and material to the issue, which can better be shown in that 
form than by oral testimony.
[47 FR 49562, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 52713, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R04>
                          Subpart B--Discovery


<R05>
Sec. 1114.21  Applicability; general provisions.

    (a) When discovery is available. (1) Parties may obtain discovery 
under this subpart regarding any matter, not privileged, which is 
relevant to the subject matter involved in a proceeding other than an 
informal proceeding. For the purpose of this subchapter, informal 
proceedings are those not required to be determined on the record after 
hearing and include informal complaints and all proceedings assigned for 
initial disposition to employee boards under Sec. 1011.6.
    (2) It is not grounds for objection that the information sought will 
be inadmissible as evidence if the information sought appears reasonably 
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
    (b) How discovery is obtained. All discovery procedures may be used 
by parties without filing a petition and obtaining prior Board approval.
    (c) Protective conditions. Upon motion by any party, by the person 
from whom discovery is sought, or by any person with a reasonable 
interest in the data, information, or material sought to be discovered 
and for good cause shown, any order which justice requires may be 
entered to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, 
oppression, or undue burden or expense, or to prevent the raising of 
issues untimely or inappropriate to the proceeding. Relief through a 
protective order may include one or more of the following:
    (1) That the discovery not be had;
    (2) That the discovery may be had only on specified terms and 
conditions, including a designation of the time and place;
    (3) That the discovery may be had only upon such terms and 
conditions as the Board may impose to insure financial responsibility 
indemnifying the party or person against whom discovery is sought to 
cover the reasonable expenses incurred;
    (4) That the discovery may be had only by a method other than that 
selected by the party seeking discovery;
    (5) That certain matters not be inquired into or that the scope of 
discovery be limited to certain matters;
    (6) That discovery be conducted with no one present except persons 
designated in the protective order;
    (7) That a deposition after being sealed be opened only by order of 
the Board;
    (8) That a trade secret or other confidential research development 
or commercial information not be disclosed or be disclosed only in a 
designated way; and
    (9) That the parties simultaneously file specified documents or 
information enclosed in sealed envelopes to be opened only upon 
direction or order of the Board.

If the motion for a protective order is denied in whole or in part, the 
Board may, on such terms and conditions as it deems just, enter an order 
requiring any party or person to provide or permit discovery. A 
protective order under this paragraph may only be sought after, or in 
conjunction with, an effort by any party to obtain relief under 
Secs. 1114.24(a), 1114.26(a), or 1114.31.
    (d) Sequence and timing of discovery. Unless the Board upon motion, 
for the convenience of parties and witnesses and in the interest of 
justice, orders otherwise, methods of discovery may be used in any 
sequence and the fact that a party is conducting discovery, whether by 
deposition or otherwise, should not operate to delay any party's 
discovery.
    (e) Stipulations regarding discovery. Unless otherwise ordered, a 
written stipulation entered into by all the parties and filed with the 
Board may:

[[Page 136]]

    (1) Provide that depositions be taken before any person, at any time 
or place, upon sufficient notice, and in any manner and when so taken 
may be used like other depositions; and
    (2) Modify the procedures provided by these rules for other methods 
of discovery.
    (f) Service of discovery materials. Unless otherwise ordered by the 
Board, depositions, interrogatories, requests for documents, requests 
for admissions, and answers and responses thereto, shall be served on 
other counsel and parties, but shall not be filed with the Board. Any 
such materials, or portions thereof, should be appended to the 
appropriate pleading when used to support or to reply to a motion, or 
when used as an evidentiary submission.
[47 FR 49562, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 52713, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1114.22   Deposition.

    (a) Purpose. The testimony of any person, including a party, may be 
taken by deposition upon oral examination.
    (b) Request. A party requesting to take a deposition and perpetuate 
testimony:
    (1) Should notify all parties to the proceeding and the person 
sought to be deposed; and
    (2) Should set forth the name and address of the witness, the place 
where, the time when, the name and office of the officer before whom, 
and the cause or reason why such deposition will be taken.
[61 FR 52713, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1114.23  Depositions; location, officer, time, fees, absence, disqualification.

    (a) Where deposition should be taken. Unless otherwise ordered or 
agreed to by stipulation, depositions should be taken in the city or 
municipality where the deponent is located.
    (b) Officer before whom taken. Within the United States or within a 
territory or insular possession subject to the dominion of the United 
States, depositions should be taken before an officer authorized to 
administer oaths by the laws of the United States or of the place where 
the examination is held. Within a foreign country, depositions may be 
taken before an officer or person designated by the Board or agreed upon 
by the parties by stipulation in writing to be filed with the Board.
    (c) Fees. A witness whose deposition is taken pursuant to these 
rules and the officer taking same, unless he be employed by the Board, 
shall be entitled to the same fee paid for like service in the courts of 
the United States, which fee should be paid by the party at whose 
instance the deposition is taken.
    (d) Failure to attend or to serve subpoena; expenses. (1) If the 
party who filed a petition for discovery fails to attend and proceed 
with the taking of the deposition and another party attends in person or 
by representative pursuant to an order of the Board granting discovery 
the Board may order the party who filed the petition to pay to such 
other party the reasonable expenses incurred by him and his 
representative in so attending, including reasonable attorney's fees.
    (2) If the party who filed a petition for discovery fails to serve a 
subpoena upon the witness and the witness because of such failure does 
not attend, and if another party attends in person or by representative 
because he expects the deposition of the witness to be taken, the Board 
may order the party who filed the petition to pay to such other party 
the reasonable expenses incurred by him and his representative in so 
attending, including reasonable attorney's fees.
    (e) Disqualification for interest. No deposition should be taken 
before a person who is a relative or employee or representative or 
counsel of any of the parties, or is a relative or employee of such 
representative or counsel or is financially interested in the 
proceeding.
[47 FR 49562, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 52713, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1114.24  Depositions; procedures.

    (a) Examination. Examination and cross-examination of witnesses 
should proceed as permitted at a hearing and should be limited to the 
subject matter specified in the order granting discovery. All objections 
made at the time of the examination to the qualifications of the officer 
taking the deposition, or to the manner of taking it, or to the

[[Page 137]]

evidence presented, or to the conduct of any party, and any other 
objection to the proceedings, should be noted by the officer upon the 
deposition. Evidence objected to should be taken subject to the 
objections. In lieu of participating in the oral examination, parties 
may serve written questions in a sealed envelope on the party taking the 
deposition, and shall transmit them to the officer, who shall open the 
sealed envelope, propound the questions to the witness, and record the 
answers verbatim.
    (b) Use of depositions. At the hearings, any part or all of a 
deposition, so far as admissible under the rules of evidence, may be 
used against any party who was present or represented at the taking of 
the deposition or who had due notice thereof, in accordance with any one 
of the following provisions:
    (1) Any deposition may be used by any party for the purpose of 
contradicting or impeaching the testimony of the deponent as a witness.
    (2) The deposition of a party or of anyone who at the time of taking 
the deposition was an officer, director, or managing agent, or a person 
designated to testify on behalf of a public or private corporation, 
partnership, association or governmental agency (other than this Board, 
except in those instances where the Board itself is a party to the 
proceeding) which is a party, may be used by an adverse party for any 
purpose.
    (3) The deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be used 
by any party for any purpose if the presiding officer or Board finds:
    (i) That the witness is dead; or
    (ii) That the witness is at a greater distance than 100 miles from 
the place of hearing or is out of the United States, unless it appears 
that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the 
deposition; or
    (iii) That the witness is unable to attend or testify because of 
age, illness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or
    (iv) That the party offering the deposition has been unable to 
procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or
    (v) Upon application and notice, that such exceptional circumstances 
exist as to make it desirable, in the interest of justice and with due 
regard to the importance of presenting the testimony of witness orally 
at public hearing, to allow the deposition to be used.
    (4) If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, 
an adverse party may require him to introduce any other part which ought 
in fairness to be considered with the part introduced, and any party may 
introduce any other parts. Substitution of parties does not affect the 
right to use depositions previously taken.
    (c) Effect of taking or using depositions. A party should not be 
deemed to make a person his own witness for any purpose by taking his 
deposition. The introduction in evidence of the deposition or any part 
thereof for any purpose other than that of contradicting or impeaching 
the deponent makes the deponent the witness of the party introducing the 
deposition, but this should not apply to the use of an adverse party of 
a deposition under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. At the hearing any 
party may rebut any relevant evidence contained in a deposition whether 
introduced by him or by any other party.
    (d) Motions to protect. At any time during the taking of the 
deposition, on motion of any party or of the deponent and upon a showing 
that the examination is being conducted in bad faith or in such manner 
as unreasonably to annoy, embarrass, or oppress the deponent or party, 
the Board may order the officer conducting the examination to cease 
forthwith from taking the deposition, or may limit the scope and manner 
of the taking of the deposition as provided in Sec. 1114.21(c). If the 
order made terminates the examination, it should be resumed thereafter 
only if so ordered. Upon demand of the objecting party or deponent, the 
taking of the deposition should be suspended for the time necessary to 
make a motion for an order.
    (e) Recordation. The officer before whom the deposition is to be 
taken shall observe the provisions of Sec. 1113.6 respecting appearances 
and typographical specifications, shall put the witness under oath, and 
shall personally, or by someone acting under his direction and in his 
presence, record and

[[Page 138]]

transcribe the testimony of the witness as required by these rules.
    (f) Signing. When the testimony is fully transcribed or otherwise 
recorded, the deposition should be submitted to the witness for 
examination and should be read to or by him unless such examination and 
reading are waived by the witness and the parties. Any changes in form 
or substance which the witness desires to make should be entered upon 
the deposition by the officer with a statement of the reasons given by 
the witness for making them. The witness shall then sign the deposition, 
unless the parties by stipulation waive the signing or the witness is 
ill or cannot be found or refuses to sign. If the deposition is not 
signed by the witness within 15 days of its submission to him, the 
officer shall sign it and state on the record the fact of the waiver or 
of the illness or absence of the witness or the fact of the refusal to 
sign together with the reason, if any, given therefor; and the 
deposition may then be used fully as though signed, unless, on a motion 
to suppress, it is found that the reasons given for refusal to sign 
require rejection of the deposition in whole or in part.
    (g) Attestation. The officer shall certify on the deposition that 
the witness was duly sworn by him and that the deposition is a true 
record of the testimony given by the witness, and that the officer is: 
(1) Not a relative, employee, representative or counsel of any of the 
parties, (2) not a relative or employee of such representative or 
counsel, and (3) not financially interested in the proceeding.
    (h) Return. The officer shall securely seal the deposition in an 
envelope endorsed with sufficient information to identify the proceeding 
and marked ``Deposition of (here insert name of witness)'' and shall 
either personally deliver or promptly send the original and one copy of 
all exhibits by registered mail to the Secretary of the Board. A 
deposition to be offered in evidence must reach the Board not later than 
5 days before the date it is to be so offered.
    (i) Notice. The party taking the deposition shall give prompt notice 
of its filing to all other parties.
    (j) Copies. Upon payment of reasonable charges, the officer before 
whom the deposition is taken shall furnish a copy of it to any 
interested party or to the deponent.
[47 FR 49562, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 52713, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1114.25  Effect of errors and irregularities in depositions.

    (a) As to disqualification of officer. Objection to taking a 
deposition because of disqualification of the officer before whom it is 
to be taken is waived unless made before the taking of the deposition 
begins or as soon thereafter as the disqualification becomes known or 
could be discovered with reasonable diligence.
    (b) As to taking of deposition. (1) Objections to the competency of 
a witness or to the competency, relevancy, or materiality of testimony 
are not waived by failure to make them before or during the taking of 
the deposition, unless the ground of the objection is one which might 
have been obviated or removed if presented at that time.
    (2) Errors and irregularities occurring at the oral examination in 
the manner of taking the deposition, in the form of the questions or 
answers in the oath or affirmation, or in the conduct of parties, and 
errors of any kind which might be obviated, removed, or cured if 
promptly presented, are waived unless seasonable objection thereto is 
made at the taking of the deposition.
    (c) As to completion and return of deposition. Errors and 
irregularities in the manner in which the testimony is transcribed or 
the deposition is prepared, signed, certified, sealed, endorsed, 
transmitted, filed, or otherwise dealt with by the officer under 
Sec. 1114.23 and 1114.24 are waived unless a motion to suppress the 
deposition or some part thereof is made with reasonable promptness after 
such defect is, or with due diligence might have been, ascertained.


<R05>
Sec. 1114.26  Written interrogatories to parties.

    (a) Availability; procedures for use. Subject to the provisions of 
Sec. 1114.21(b)(2), any party may serve upon any other party written 
interrogatories to be answered by the party

[[Page 139]]

served, or if the party served is a public or private corporation, 
partnership, association, or Governmental agency (other than this Board, 
except in those instances where the Board itself is a party to the 
proceeding), by any officer or agent, who shall furnish such information 
as is available to the party. Each interrogatory should be answered 
separately and fully in writing, unless it is objected to, in which 
event the reasons for objection should be stated in lieu of an answer. 
The answers are to be signed by the person making them and subscribed by 
an appropriate verification generally in the form prescribed in 
Sec. 1112.9. Objections are to be signed by the representative or 
counsel making them. The person upon whom the interrogatories have been 
served shall serve a copy of the answers and objections within the time 
period designated by the party submitting the interrogatories, but not 
less than 15 days after the service thereof.
    (b) Option to produce business records. Where the answer to an 
interrogatory may be derived or ascertained from the business records of 
the party upon whom the interrogatory has been served or from an 
examination, audit, or inspection of such business records or from a 
compilation, abstract, or summary based thereon, and the burden of 
deriving or ascertaining the answer is substantially the same for the 
party serving the interrogatory as for the party served, it is a 
sufficient answer to such interrogatory to specify the records from 
which the answer may be derived or ascertained and to afford to the 
party serving the interrogatory reasonable opportunity to examine, 
audit, or inspect such records and to make copies thereof, or 
compilation, abstracts, or summaries therefrom. If information sought is 
contained in computer runs, punchcards, or tapes which also contain 
privileged or proprietary information or information the disclosure of 
which is proscribed by the act, it will be sufficient response under 
these rules that the person upon whom the interrogatory has been served 
is willing to make available to and permit an independent professional 
organization not interested in the proceeding and paid by the party 
serving the interrogatory to extract from such runs, punchcards, or 
tapes the information sought in the interrogatory that is not privileged 
or proprietary information or information the disclosure of which is 
proscribed by the act.
    (c) Service of interrogatories in those proceedings not requiring a 
petition. No written interrogatories shall be served within 20 days 
prior to the date assigned for commencement of hearing or the filing of 
opening statements of fact and argument under the modified procedure, 
and when the written interrogatories are to be served in a foreign 
country, they shall not be served within 40 days prior to such date.
[47 FR 49562, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 52713, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1114.27  Request for admission.

    (a) Availability; procedures for use. Subject to the provisions of 
Sec. 1114.21(b)(2), a party may serve upon any other party a written 
request for the admission, for purposes of the pending proceeding only, 
of the truth of any matters within the scope of Sec. 1114.21 set forth 
in the request, including the genuineness of any documents described in 
the request for admission. Copies of documents should be served with the 
request unless they have been or are otherwise furnished or made 
available for inspection and copying. Each matter of which an admission 
is requested should be separately set forth. The matter is admitted 
unless, within a period designated in the request, not less than 15 days 
after service thereof, the party to whom the request is directed serves 
upon the party requesting the admission a written answer or objection 
addressed to the matter, signed by the party or his representative or 
counsel. If objection is made, the reasons therefor should be stated. 
The answer should specifically deny the matter or set forth in detail 
the reasons why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny the 
matter. A denial should fairly meet the substance of the requested 
admission, and when good faith requires that a party qualify his answer 
or deny only a part of the matter of which an admission is requested, he 
shall specify so much of it as is true and qualify or deny the 
remainder. An answering party may not give lack of information

[[Page 140]]

or knowledge as a reason for failure to admit or deny unless he states 
that he has made reasonable inquiry and that the information known or 
readily obtainable by him is insufficient to enable him to admit or 
deny. A party who considers that a matter of which an admission has been 
requested presents a genuine issue for hearing may not, on that ground 
alone, object to the request; he may, subject to the provisions of 
Sec. 1114.31, deny the matter or set forth reasons why he cannot admit 
or deny it.
    (b) Effect of admission. Any matter admitted under this rule is 
conclusively established unless upon petition and a showing of good 
cause the Board enters an order permitting withdrawal or amendment of 
the admission. Any admission made by a party under this rule is for the 
purpose of the pending proceeding only and is not an admission by him 
for any other purpose nor may it be used against him in any other 
proceeding.
    (c) Service of written requests for admission in those proceedings 
not requiring a petition. No requests for admission should be served 
within 20 days prior to the date assigned for commencement of hearing or 
the filing of opening statements of fact and argument under the modified 
procedure, and when requests for admission are to be served in a foreign 
country they should not be served within 40 days prior to such date.

<R05>
Sec. 1114.28  Depositions, requests for admission, written interrogatories, and responses thereto: inclusion in record.

    At the oral hearing, or upon the submission of statements under the 
modified procedure, depositions, requests for admission and written 
interrogatories, and respective responses may be offered in evidence by 
the party at whose instance they were taken. If not offered by such 
party, they may be offered in whole or in part by any other party. If 
only part of a deposition, request for admission or written 
interrogatory, or response thereto is offered in evidence by a party, 
any other party (where the matter is being heard orally) may require him 
to introduce all of it which is relevant to the part introduced, and any 
party may introduce any other parts. Such depositions, requests for 
admission and written interrogatories, and responses thereto should be 
admissible in evidence subject to such objections as to competency of 
the witness, or competency, relevancy, or materiality of the testimony 
as were noted at the time of their taking or are made at the time they 
are offered in evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 1114.29  Supplementation of responses.

    A party who has responded to a request for discovery with a response 
that was complete when made is under a duty to supplement his response 
to include information thereafter acquired in the following instances:
    (a) A party is under a duty seasonably to supplement his response 
with respect to any question directly addressed to:
    (1) The identity and locations of persons having knowledge of 
discoverable matters, and
    (2) The identity of each person expected to be called as an expert 
witness at the hearing, the subject matter on which he is expected to 
testify, and the substance of his testimony.
    (b) A party who knows or later learns that his response is incorrect 
is under a duty seasonably to correct his response.
    (c) A duty to supplement responses may be imposed by order, 
agreement of the parties, or at any time prior to the hearing or the 
submission of verified statements under the modified procedure through 
new requests for supplementation of prior responses.


<R05>
Sec. 1114.30   Production of documents and records and entry upon land for inspection and other purposes.

    (a) Scope. Any party may serve on any other party a request:
    (1) To produce and permit the party making the request to inspect 
any designated documents (including writings, drawings, graphs, charts, 
photographs, phonograph records, tapes, and other data compilations from 
which information can be obtained, translated, if necessary, with or 
without the use of detection devices into reasonably usable

[[Page 141]]

form), or to inspect and copy, test, or sample any tangible things which 
are in the possession, custody, or control of the party upon whom the 
request is served, but if the writings or data compilations include 
privileged or proprietary information or information the disclosure of 
which is proscribed by the Act, such writings or data compilations need 
not be produced under this rule but may be provided pursuant to 
Sec. 1114.26(b) of this part; or
    (2) To permit, subject to appropriate liability releases and safety 
and operating considerations, entry upon designated land or other 
property in the possession or control of the party upon whom the request 
is served for the purpose of inspecting and measuring, surveying, 
photographing, testing, or sampling the property or any designated 
object or operation thereon.
    (b) Procedure. Any request filed pursuant to this rule should set 
forth the items to be inspected either by individual item or by category 
and describe each item and category with reasonable particularity. The 
request should specify a reasonable time, place, and manner of making 
the inspection and performing the related acts.
[61 FR 52713, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1114.31  Failure to respond to discovery.

    (a) Failure to answer. If a deponent fails to answer or gives an 
evasive answer or incomplete answer to a question propounded under 
Sec. 1114.24(a), or a party fails to answer or gives evasive or 
incomplete answers to written interrogatories served pursuant to 
Sec. 1114.26(a), the party seeking discovery may apply for an order 
compelling an answer by motion filed with the Board and served on all 
parties and deponents. Such motion to compel an answer must be filed 
with the Board and served on all parties and deponents. Such motion to 
compel an answer must be filed with the Board within 10 days after the 
failure to obtain a responsive answer upon deposition, or within 10 days 
after expiration of the period allowed for submission of answers to 
interrogatories. On matters relating to a deposition on oral 
examination, the proponent of the question may complete or adjourn the 
examination before he applies for an order.
    (b) Failure to comply with order. (1) If a party or other witness 
refuses to be sworn or refuses to answer any question after being 
directed to do so by the Board, such refusal may subject the refusing 
party or person to action by the Board under 49 U.S.C. 721(c) and (d) to 
compel appearance and compliance with the Board's order.
    (2) If any party or an officer, director, managing agent, or 
employee of a party or person refuses to obey an order made under 
paragraph (a) of this section requiring him to answer designated 
questions, or an order made under Sec. 1114.30 requiring him to produce 
any document or other thing for inspection, copying, testing, sampling, 
or photographing or to permit it to be done, or to permit entry upon 
land or other property, the Board may make such orders in regard to the 
refusal as are just, and among others the following:
    (i) An order that the matters regarding which questions were asked, 
or the character or description of the thing or land, or the contents of 
the paper, or any other designated facts should be taken to be 
established for the purposes of the proceeding in accordance with the 
claim of the party obtaining the order:
    (ii) An order refusing to allow the disobedient party to support or 
oppose designated claims or defenses, or prohibiting him from 
introducing in evidence designated documents or things or items of 
testimony:
    (iii) An order striking out pleadings or parts thereof, or staying 
further proceedings until the order is obeyed, or dismissing the 
proceedings or any party thereof.
    (iv) In lieu of any of the foregoing orders, or in addition thereto, 
the Board shall require the party failing to obey the order or the 
attorney advising that party, or both, to pay the reasonable expenses, 
including attorney's fees, caused by the failure, unless the Board finds 
that the failure was substantially justified or that other circumstances 
make an award of expenses unjust.
    (c) Expenses on refusal to admit. If a party, after being served 
with a request under Sec. 1114.27 to admit the genuineness

[[Page 142]]

of any document or the truth of any matter of fact, serves a sworn 
denial thereof, and if the party requesting the admission thereafter 
proves the genuineness of any such document or the truth of any such 
matter of fact the Board may order the party making such denial to pay 
to such other party the reasonable expenses incurred in making that 
proof, including reasonable attorney's fees.
    (d) Failure of party to attend or serve answers. If a party or a 
person or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party 
or person willfully fails to appear before the officer who is to take 
his deposition, after being served with a proper notice, or fails to 
serve answers to interrogatories submitted under Sec. 1114.26, after 
proper service of such interrogatories, the Board on motion and notice 
may strike out all or any part of any pleading of that party or person, 
or dismiss the proceeding or any part thereof. In lieu of any such order 
or in addition thereto, the Board shall require the party failing to act 
or the attorney advising that party or both to pay the reasonable 
expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure, unless the 
Board finds that the failure was substantially justified or that other 
circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.
    (e) Expenses against United States. Expenses and attorney's fees are 
not to be imposed upon the United States under this rule.

<R05>
Sec. 1115.1  Scope of rule.

    (a) These appellate procedures apply in cases where a hearing is 
required by law or Board action. They do not apply to informal matters 
such as car service, temporary authority, suspension, special permission 
actions, or to other matters of an interlocutory nature. Abandonments 
and discontinuance proceedings instituted under 49 U.S.C. 10903 are 
governed by separate appellate procedures exclusive to those 
proceedings. (See 49 CFR part 1152)
    (b) Requests for appellate relief may relate either to initial 
decisions or to Board actions other than initial decisions. For each 
category, this rule describes the types of appeal permitted, the 
requirements to be observed in filing an appeal, provisions for stay of 
the action, and the status of the action in the absence of a stay.
    (c) Appeals from the decisions of employees acting under authority 
delegated to them by the Chairman of the Board pursuant to Sec. 1011.7 
will be acted upon by the entire Board. Appeals must be filed within 10 
days of the date of the action taken by the employee, and responses to 
appeals must be filed within 10 days thereafter. Such appeals are not 
favored; they will be granted only in exceptional circumstances to 
correct a clear error of judgment or to prevent manifest injustice.

Sec. 1115.2  Initial decisions.

    This category includes the initial decision of an administrative law 
judge, individual Board Member, or employee board.
    (a) An appeal of right is permitted.
    (b) Appeals must be based on one or more of the following grounds:
    (1) That a necessary finding of fact is omitted, erroneous, or 
unsupported by substantial evidence of record;
    (2) That a necessary legal conclusion, or finding is contrary to 
law, Board precedent, or policy;
    (3) That an important question of law, policy, or discretion is 
involved which is without governing precedent;

[[Page 143]]

    (4) That prejudicial procedural error has occurred.
    (c) Appeals must detail the assailed findings with supporting 
citations to the record and authorities.
    (d) Appeals and replies shall not exceed 30 pages in length, 
including argument, and appendices or other attachments, but excluding a 
table of cases and an index of subject matter.
    (e) Appeals must be filed within 20 days after the service date of 
the decision or within any further period (not to exceed 20 days) the 
Board may authorize. Replies must be filed within 20 days of the date 
the appeal is filed.
    (f) The timely filing of an appeal to an initial decision will stay 
the effect of the action pending determination of the appeal.
    (g) If an appeal of an initial decision is not timely filed or the 
Board does not stay the effectiveness on its own motion, the order set 
forth in the initial decision shall become the action of the Board and 
be effective at the expiration of the time for filing, unless otherwise 
provided.

<R05>
Sec. 1115.3   Board actions other than initial decisions.

    (a) A discretionary appeal of an entire Board action is permitted. 
Such an appeal should be designated a ``petition for reconsideration.''
    (b) The petition will be granted only upon a showing of one or more 
of the following points:
    (1) The prior action will be affected materially because of new 
evidence or changed circumstances.
    (2) The prior action involves material error.
    (c) The petition must state in detail the nature of and reasons for 
the relief requested. When, in a petition filed under this section, a 
party seeks an opportunity to introduce evidence, the evidence must be 
stated briefly and must not appear to be cumulative, and an explanation 
must be given why it was not previously adduced.
    (d) The petition and any reply must not exceed 20 pages in length. A 
separate preface and summary of argument, not exceeding 3 pages, may 
accompany petitions and replies and must accompany those that exceed 10 
pages in length.
    (e) Petitions must be filed within 20 days after the service of the 
action or within any further period (not to exceed 20 days) as the Board 
may authorize.
    (f) The filing of a petition will not automatically stay the effect 
of a prior action, but the Board may stay the effect of the action on 
its own motion or on petition. A petition to stay may be filed in 
advance of the petition for reconsideration and shall be filed within 10 
days of service of the action. No reply need be filed. However, if a 
party elects to file a reply, it must reach the Board no later than 16 
days after service of the action. In all proceedings, the action, if not 
stayed, will become effective 30 days after it is served, unless the 
Board provides for the action to become effective at a different date. 
On the day the action is served parties may initiate judicial review.

<R05>
Sec. 1115.4  Petitions to reopen administratively final actions.

    A person at any time may file a petition to reopen any 
administratively final action of the Board pursuant to the requirements 
of Sec. 1115.3 (c) and (d) of this part. A petition to reopen must state 
in detail the respects in which the proceeding involves material error, 
new evidence, or substantially changed circumstances and must include a 
request that the Board make such a determination.
[61 FR 52714, Oct. 8, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1115.5  Petitions for other relief.

    (a) A party may petition for a stay of an action pending a request 
for judicial review, for extension of the compliance date, or for 
modification of the date the terms of the decision take effect. The 
reasons for the desired relief must be stated in the petition, and the 
petition must be filed not less than 10 days prior to the date the terms 
of the action take effect. No reply need be filed. If a party elects to 
file a reply, the reply must reach the Board no later than 5 days after 
the petition is filed.

[[Page 144]]

    (b) When the terms of a Board action take effect on less than 15 
days' notice, a petition for stay pending a request for judicial review 
must be filed prior to the institution of court action and as close to 
the service date as practicable. No reply need be filed. Where time 
permits, a party may elect to file a reply.
    (c) A petition or reply must not exceed 10 pages in length.

<R05>
Sec. 1115.6  Exhaustion of remedies and judicial review.

    These rules do not relieve the requirement that a party exhaust its 
administrative remedies before going to court. Any action appealable as 
of right must be timely appealed. If an appeal, discretionary appeal, or 
petition seeking reopening is filed under Sec. 1115.2 or Sec. 1115.3 of 
this part, before or after a petition seeking judicial review is filed 
with the courts, the Board will act upon the appeal or petition after 
advising the court of its pendency unless action might interfere with 
the court's jurisdiction.

Sec. 1115.8  Petitions to review arbitration decisions.

    An appeal of right is permitted. The appeal must be filed within 20 
days of a final arbitration decision, unless a later date is authorized 
by the Board, and is subject to the page limitations of Sec. 1115.2(d). 
Standards for Board review of arbitration decisions are set forth in 
Chicago and North Western Transp. Co.--Abandonment, 3 I.C.C.2d 729 
(1987), aff'd sub nom. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers 
v. STB, No. 87-1629 (D.C. Cir. November 25, 1988). The timely filing of 
a petition will not automatically stay the effect of the arbitration 
decision. A stay may be requested under Sec. 1115.5.

    (2) The ruling grants a request for the inspection of documents not 
ordinarily available for public inspection;
    (3) The ruling overrules an objection based on privilege, the result 
of which ruling is to require the presentation of testimony or

substantial detriment to the public interest, or undue prejudice to a 
party.
    (b) In stand-alone cost complaints, any interlocutory appeal of a 
ruling shall be filed with the Board within three (3) business days of 
the ruling. Replies to any interlocutory appeal shall be filed with the 
Board within three (3) business days after the filing of any such 
appeal. In all other cases, interlocutory appeals shall be filed with 
the Board within seven (7) calendar days of the ruling and replies to 
interlocutory appeals shall be filed with Board within seven (7)

    Discovery shall follow the procedures set forth at 49 CFR part 1114, 
subpart B. Discovery may begin upon the filing of the petition for 
exemption or petition for revocation of an exemption. In petitions to 
revoke an exemption, a party must indicate in the petition whether it is 
seeking discovery. If it is, the party must file its discovery requests 
at the same time it files its petition to revoke. Discovery shall be 
completed 30 days after the petition to revoke is filed. The party 
seeking discovery may supplement its petition to revoke 45 days after 
the petition is filed. Replies to the supplemental petition are due 15 
days after the supplemental petition is filed.


<R05>
Sec. 1121.3  Content.

    (a) A party filing a petition for exemption shall provide its case-
in-chief, along with its supporting evidence, workpapers, and related 
documents at the time it files its petition.
    (b) A petition must comply with environmental or historic reporting 
and notice requirements of 49 CFR part 1105, if applicable.
    (c) A party seeking revocation of an exemption or a notice of 
exemption shall provide all of its supporting information at the time it 
files its petition. Information later obtained through discovery can be 
submitted in a supplemental petition pursuant to 49 CFR 1121.2.


<R05>
Sec. 1121.4  Procedures.

    (a) Exemption proceedings are informal, and public comments are 
generally not sought during consideration of exemption petition 
proposals, except as provided in Sec. 1121.4(c). However, the Board may 
consider during its deliberation any public comments filed in response 
to a petition for exemption.
    (b) If the Board determines that the criteria in 49 U.S.C. 10502 are 
met for the proposed exemption, it will issue the exemption and publish 
a notice of exemption in the Federal Register.

[[Page 147]]

    (c) If the impact of the proposed exemption cannot be ascertained 
from the information contained in the petition or accompanying 
submissions, or significant adverse impacts might occur if the proposed 
exemption were granted, or a class exemption is sought, the Board will:
    (1) Direct that additional information be filed; or
    (2) Publish a notice in the Federal Register requesting public 
comments.
    (d) Exemption petitions containing proposals that are directly 
related to and concurrently filed with a primary application will be 
considered along with that primary application.
    (e) Unless otherwise specified in the decision, an exemption 
generally will be effective 30 days from the service date of the 
decision granting the exemption. Unless otherwise provided in the 
decision, petitions to stay must be filed within 10 days of the service 
date, and petitions for reconsideration or petitions to reopen under 49 
CFR part 1115 or 49 CFR 1152.25(e) must be filed within 20 days of the 
service date.
    (f) Petitions to revoke an exemption or the notice of exemption may 
be filed at any time. The person seeking revocation has the burden of 
showing that the revocation criteria of 49 U.S.C. 10502(d) have been 
met.
    (g) In abandonment exemptions, petitions to revoke in part to impose 
public use conditions under 49 CFR 1152.28, or to invoke the Trails Act, 
16 U.S.C. 1247(d), may be filed at any time prior to the consummation of 
the abandonment, except that public use conditions may not prohibit 
disposal of the properties for any more than the statutory limit of 180 
days after the effective date of the decision granting the exemption.
    (h) In transactions for the acquisition or operation of rail lines 
by Class II rail carriers under 49 U.S.C. 10902, the exemption may not 
become effective until 60 days after applicant certifies to the Board 
that it has posted at the workplace of the employees on the affected 
line(s) and served a notice of the transaction on the national offices 
of the labor unions with employees on the affected line(s), setting 
forth the types and numbers of jobs expected to be available, the terms 
of employment and principles of employee selection, and the lines that 
are to be transferred.

<R05>
Sec. 1130.1  When no damages sought.

    (a) Form and content; copies. Informal complaint may be by letter or 
other writing and will be serially numbered as filed. The complaint must 
contain the essential elements of a formal complaint as specified at 49 
CFR 1131.1 and may embrace supporting papers. The original and one copy 
must be filed with the Board.
    (b) Correspondence handling. When an informal complaint appears 
susceptible of informal adjustment, the Board will send a copy or 
statement of the complaint to each subject of the complaint in an 
attempt to have it satisfied by correspondence, thereby avoiding the 
filing of a formal complaint.
    (c) Discontinuance of informal proceeding. The filing of an informal 
complaint does not preclude complainant from filing a formal complaint. 
If a formal complaint is filed, the informal proceeding will be 
discontinued.

<R05>
Sec. 1130.2  When damages sought.

    (a) Actual filing required. Notification to the Board that an 
informal complaint may or will be filed later seeking damages is not a 
filing within the meaning of the statute.
    (b) Content. An informal complaint seeking damages must be filed 
within the statutory period, and should identify with reasonable 
definiteness the involved shipments or transportation services. The 
complaint should include:

[[Page 148]]

    (1) A statement that complainant seeks to recover damages;
    (2) The names of each individual seeking damages;
    (3) The names and addresses of defendants against which claim is 
made;
    (4) The commodities, the rate applied, the date on which the charges 
were paid, the names of the parties paying the charges, and, if 
different, the names of the parties bearing the charges;
    (5) The period of time within which or the specific dates upon which 
the shipments were made, and the dates when they were delivered or 
tendered for delivery;
    (6) The specific origin and destination points or, where they are 
numerous, the territorial or rate group of the origin and destination 
points and, if known, the routes of movement; and
    (7) The nature and amount of the injury sustained by each claimant.
    (c) Statement of prior claim. A complaint filed under paragraph (b) 
of this section containing a claim which has been the subject of a 
previous informal or formal complaint must specifically refer to the 
previous complaint.
    (d) Copies. The original of an informal complaint seeking damages 
must be accompanied by a sufficient number of copies to enable the Board 
to send one to each defendant named.
    (e) [Reserved]
    (f) Notification to the parties; six months' rule. If an informal 
complaint seeking damages (other than a contested tariff reconciliation 
petition) cannot be disposed of informally or is denied or withdrawn by 
complainant, the parties affected will be so notified in writing by the 
Board. Contested tariff reconciliation petitions either will be granted 
or denied by the entry of a decision. Unless within six months after the 
date on which a notice is mailed or a decision is served, a party either 
files a formal complaint or resubmits its informal complaint on an 
additional-fact basis, the matter in the complaint or petition will not 
be reconsidered. The claim will be considered abandoned and no complaint 
seeking damages on the same cause of action will be accepted unless 
filed within the statutory period. Any filing or resubmission satisfying 
the six months' requirement will be considered filed as of the date of 
the original filing and must specifically refer to that date and to the 
Board's file number. An original and 10 copies of a petition for 
reconsideration should be filed.
    (g) Tariff reconciliation proceedings for motor common carriers--(1) 
Petitions to waive collection or permit payment. Subject to Board review 
and approval, motor common carriers (other than household goods 
carriers) and shippers may resolve, by mutual consent, overcharge and 
undercharge claims under the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 14709. Petitions 
for appropriate authority may be filed by either the carrier, shipper or 
consignee on the Board's tariff reconciliation docket by submitting a 
letter of intent to depart from the filed rate. The petitions will be 
deemed the equivalent of an informal complaint and answer admitting the 
matters stated in the petition. Petitions shall be sent to the Office of 
Compliance and Enforcement, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC 
20423. The petitions shall contain, at a minimum, the following 
information:
    (i) The name(s) and address(es) of the payer(s) of the freight 
charges;
    (ii) The name(s) of the carrier(s) involved in the traffic;
    (iii) An estimate of the amount(s) involved;
    (iv) The time period when the shipment(s) involved were delivered or 
tendered for delivery;
    (v) A general description of the point(s) of origin and destination 
of the shipment(s);
    (vi) A general description of the commodity(ies) transported;
    (vii) A statement certifying that the carrier(s) and shipper(s) 
participating in the shipment(s) or the payer(s) of the freight charges 
concur(s) with the intent to depart from the filed rate; and
    (viii) A brief explanation of the incorrect tariff provision(s) or 
billing error(s) causing the request to depart from the filed rate.
    (2) Public notice and protest. Tariff reconciliation petitions 
(letters of intent) shall be served on all parties named in the petition 
by the party that files the petition and will be made

[[Page 149]]

available by the Board for public inspection in the Office of Compliance 
and Enforcement Public File, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, 
DC 20423. Any interested person may protest the granting of a petition 
by filing a letter of objection with the Office of Compliance and 
Enforcement within 30 days of Board receipt of the petition. Letters of 
objection shall identify the tariff reconciliation proceeding, shall 
clearly state the reasons for the objection, and shall certify that a 
copy of the letter of objection has been served on all parties named in 
the petition. The Board may initiate an investigation of the petition on 
its own motion.
    (3) Uncontested petitions. If a petition is not contested, and if 
the Board does not initiate an investigation of the petition on its own 
motion, approval is deemed granted without further action by the Board, 
effective 45 days after Board receipt of the petition.
    (4) Contested petitions. If a petition is contested or the Board 
initiates an investigation of the petition on its own motion, 15 days 
will be allowed for reply. The 15-day period will commence on the date 
of service of the objections or, if the Board initiates an investigation 
on its own motion, on the date of service of the decision initiating the 
investigation. After the period for reply has expired, the Board will 
issue a decision approving or disapproving the petition, or requesting 
further submissions from the parties, and then will issue a decision 
based on the further submissions.

<R05>


Sec.
1132.1  Protests against collective ratemaking actions.
1132.2  Procedures in certain suspension matters.

    Authority:  49 U.S.C. 721, 13301(f), and 13703.

    Source:  62 FR 50885, Sept. 29, 1997, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1132.1  Protests against collective ratemaking actions.

    (a) Content. The protested collective ratemaking action sought to be 
suspended, whether or not contained in a tariff filed with the Board, 
should be identified by making reference to: The name of the publishing 
carrier or collective ratemaking organization; the identification of the 
tariff, if applicable, or the identification of the collective 
ratemaking action publication if it is not contained in a tariff filed 
with the Board; the specific items or particular provisions protested; 
and the effective date of the tariff or other collective ratemaking 
action publication. Reference should also be made to the tariff or 
collective ratemaking action, and the specific provisions proposed to be 
superseded. The protest should state the grounds in support thereof, and 
indicate in what respect the protested collective ratemaking action is 
considered to be unlawful. Such protests will be considered as addressed 
to the discretion of the Board. Should a protestant desire to proceed 
further against a collective ratemaking action which is not suspended, 
or which has been suspended and the suspension vacated, a separate later 
formal complaint or petition should be filed.
    (b) When filed. Protests against, and requests for suspension of, 
collective ratemaking actions will not be considered unless made in 
writing and filed with the Board at Washington, DC. If the protestant 
desires action by the Board before the effective date of the collective 
action, protests and requests for suspension shall reach the Board at 
least 12 days (except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section) 
before such effective date. If the protested collective ratemaking 
action is already in effect, or if the protestant does not desire action 
before its effective date, protests and requests for suspension can be 
filed at any time.
    (c) Motor carrier tariff bureau filings. When motor common carrier 
tariff bureaus take collective actions subject to the special procedures 
adopted in Ex Parte No. MC-82, New Procedures in Motor Carrier Rev. 
Proc. 340 I.C.C. 1 (1971), and set forth at 49 CFR part 1139, protests 
must reach the Board at least 22 days before the effective dates of

[[Page 150]]

those actions if protestants desire action by the Board before such 
effective dates. All statements should be served by express mail or an 
equivalent expedited delivery service upon any party undertaking to bear 
the cost. Written request for this expedited service must be made no 
less than 5 days before the statement is due to be filed with the Board.
    (d) Copies; service. In connection with proceedings involving 
proposals subject to the special procedures in Ex Parte No. MC-82, New 
Procedures in Motor Carrier Rev. Proc. 339 I.C.C. 324, and set forth at 
49 CFR part 1139, an original and 10 copies of every protest or reply 
filed under this section should be furnished for the use of the Board. 
Except as provided for proposals subject to the special procedures in Ex 
Parte No. MC-82, the original and 10 copies of each protest, or of each 
reply filed under this section, must be filed with the Board, and one 
copy simultaneously must be served upon the publishing carrier or 
collective ratemaking organization, and upon other persons known by 
protestant to be interested. These pleadings should be directed to the 
attention of the Secretary, Surface Transportation Board.
    (e) Reply to protest. A reply to a protest filed at least 12 days 
before the effective date of proposed collective action provisions must 
reach the Board not later than the fourth working day prior to the 
scheduled effective date of the protested provisions unless otherwise 
provided. Replies to protests against motor carrier rate bureau 
proposals subject to Ex Parte No. MC-82 procedures, to be assured of 
consideration, must reach the Board no later than 14 days before the 
scheduled effective date of the protested provisions.


<R05>
Sec. 1132.2  Procedures in certain suspension matters.

    (a) A petition for reconsideration may be filed by any interested 
person within 20 days after the date of service of a Board decision 
which results in an order for:
    (1) Investigation and suspension of collective ratemaking actions, 
or
    (2) Investigation (without suspension) of collective ratemaking 
actions.
    (b) Any interested person may file and serve a reply to any petition 
for reconsideration permitted under paragraph (a) of this section within 
20 days after the filing of such petition with the Board, but if the 
facts stated in any such petition disclose a need for accelerated 
action, such action may be taken before expiration of the time allowed 
for reply. In all other respects, such petitions and replies thereto 
will be governed by the rules of general applicability of the Rules of 
Practice.

Sec. 1133.2  Statement of claimed damages based on Board findings.

    (a) When the Board finds that damages are due, but that the amount 
connot be ascertained upon the record before it, the complainant should 
immediately prepare a statement showing details of the shipments on 
which damages are claimed, in accordance with the following form:

    Claim of ______ under decision of the Surface Transportation Board 
in Docket No. ______.
    ______ Date of shipment.
    ______ Date of delivery or tender of delivery.
    ______ Date charges were paid.

    Claimant hereby certifies that this statement includes claims only 
on shipments covered by the findings in the docket above described and 
contains no claim for reparation previously filed with the Board by or 
on behalf of claimant or, so far as claimant knows, by or on behalf of 
any person, in any other proceedings, except as follows: (Here indicate 
any exceptions, and explanation thereof).

    (b) The statement should not include any shipment not covered by the 
Board's findings, or any shipment on which complaint was not filed with 
the Board within the statutory period. The filing of a statement will 
not stop the running of the statute of limitations as to shipments not 
covered by complaint or supplemental complaint. If the shipments moved 
over more than one route, a separate statement should be prepared for 
each route, and separately numbered, except that shipments as to which 
the collecting carrier is in each instance the same may be listed in a 
single statement if grouped according to routes. The statement, together 
with the paid freight bills on the shipments, or true copies thereof, 
should then be forwarded to the carrier which collected the charges, for 
verification and certification as to its accuracy. If the statement is 
not forwarded immediately to the collecting carrier for certification, a 
letter request from defendants that forwarding be expedited will be 
considered to the end that steps be taken to have the statement 
forwarded immediately. All discrepancies, duplications, or other errors 
in the statements should be adjusted by the parties and corrected agreed 
statements submitted to the Board. The certificate must be signed in ink 
by a general accounting officer of the carrier and should cover all of 
the information shown in the statement. If the carrier which collected 
the charges is not a defendant in the case, its certificate must be 
concurred in by like signature on behalf of a carrier defendant. 
Statements so prepared and certified shall be filed with the Board 
whereupon it will consider entry of a decision awarding damages.

PART 1135--RAILROAD COST RECOVERY PROCEDURES--Table of Contents

<R05>


    Authority:  : 5 U.S.C. 553 and 49 U.S.C. 721 and 10708.


<R05>
Sec. 1135.1  Quarterly adjustment of rates.

    (a) Rail carriers may adjust rates and charges quarterly in order to 
compensate for inflationary cost increases. The quarterly adjustment 
shall not exceed the percentage change in the all inclusive index of 
railroad costs as proposed by the Association of American Railroads and 
modified by the Board. The Board will make modifications of the 
revisions to the index as necessary.
    (b) The allowable increase will be based on a projection of the 
index to the midpoint of the quarter to which the index will apply. The 
percentage change must be calculated from a comparison of the forecast 
index for the midpoint of the quarter during which the rates will be in 
effect with the forecast index for the midpoint of the previous quarter. 
Each quarterly index will be adjusted for forecast error in the index 
issued six months earlier. The adjustments will be made by adding or 
subtracting, as appropriate, the difference between the index using 
actual data for the second prior quarter and the index using forecasted 
data for that quarter. Additionally, AAR shall

[[Page 152]]

file an index adjusted for productivity changes. The adjustment will be 
made by applying the multi-year average annual growth in productivity 
spread evenly over four quarters, compounded each quarter. Productivity 
adjustments shall compound in the same manner as rate changes.
    (c) The Association of American Railroads must file its calculations 
with the Board on the fifth day of the last month of the prior quarter 
(or the closest business day if the fifth is a Saturday, Sunday or 
holiday). The calculations are to be for the mid-point of the next 
quarter.
    (d) Tariffs containing adjustments under the provisions of this rule 
may be filed to become effective on not less than ten days notice when 
the Rail Cost Adjustment Factor adopted by the Board does not differ 
from that proposed by the Association of American Railroads. When the 
Rail Cost Adjustment Factor adopted by the Board differs from that 
proposed by the Association of American Railroads the notice period 
shall be not less than five days. Reductions to rates published in the 
initial RCCR tariff may be published on one day's notice during the 
period between the publication of the tariff and the first day of the 
calendar quarter for which that tariff applies.
    (e) Increases in rates consistent with these standards will not be 
investigated or suspended by the Board unless the filing results in a 
double recovery of inflation-based cost increases.
    (f) All cost recovery tariffs filed with the Board shall state that 
they are being filed in conformity with the rules in 49 CFR 1135.1 and 
1312.17(k), and shall be amended under the same timetable applicable to 
rate increases, to reflect declines in the cost index. Any declines in 
the index below the level in effect on December 31, 1985, will be 
addressed by postponing authorizations for future cost recovery rate 
increases pursuant to a ``banking'' procedure described more fully in Ex 
Parte No. 290 (Sub-No. 2), Railroad Cost Recovery Procedures, served 
October 17, 1986.
    (g) In accordance with the procedures outlined in Sec. 1312.17(k), 
each carrier shall timely file (either directly or through a duly 
authorized tariff-publishing agent) with the regulatory authority of 
each State in which it operates, all tariffs filed with the Board in 
accordance with these procedures. The carrier will file with the State 
at the same time that it files with the Board.

[[Page 153]]

shall contain the case-in-chief. All supporting papers shall be made 
available to opposing parties for inspection and copying. Complaints 
(and cross complaints) are subject to the same copy requirements as in

the modified procedure, unless oral hearing is shown to be necessary.
    (f) Discovery. If the notice of intent procedure was used, discovery 
shall be available to all parties only prior to the filing of the 
complaint. If the notice procedure was not used, discovery shall be 
available to defendants only and must be exercised under the time 
restrictions contained in paragraph (d) of this section. Prehearing 
conferences may be requested to adjudicate discovery requests, or they 
may be resolved by written pleadings.
    (g) Evidentiary guidelines. (1) Traffic and cost studies, either 
individual or joint, may be submitted. Studies shall be accepted for 
consideration as long as they do not delay the process or conflict with 
other applicable deadlines. Cost studies should be developed, absent a 
more specific method, in accordance with Rail Form A (or URCS, if 
implemented), adjusted to reflect the specific traffic and updated to a 
current level. Studies may include the types of evidence discussed in 
appendix D of Expeditious Handling of Divisions of Revenue Cases, 353 
I.C.C. 349, 388 (1976).
    (2) The following evidentiary standards apply:
    (i) Costs associated with exempt or contract traffic shall not be 
included, except that allocation of certain common costs to regulated 
traffic may be acceptable if adequately explained.
    (ii) Elements of profit, income tax, and passenger, commuter, and 
LCL deficits are not proper expense items for developing fully allocated 
cost [See Rules to Govern Assembling and Presenting Cost Evidence, 337 
I.C.C. 298 (1970)], but will be treated under the issue of revenue need.
    (iii) Passenger and commuter service costs shall be considered only 
in relation to the carrier's revenue need.
    (iv) All subsidies shall be disclosed and explained.
    (v) The same divisional basis shall apply on ``border point'' 
traffic.
    (h) Time periods for completion of proceedings. In accordance with 
section 10705(f)(1)(A)(ii), a party, for good cause, may seek extension 
of any applicable filing deadline. If a requested extension will result 
in an evidentiary period in excess of 9 months and the proceeding does 
not involve Class III carriers, the request shall contain sufficient 
information to allow the required report to Congress and set forth the 
reasons why the extension is necessary. When the proceeding involves a 
railroad in reorganization or a contention that the divisions do not 
cover the variable costs of handling the traffic, requests for extension 
of filing deadlines shall be viewed with disfavor. The Act directs us to 
give these proceedings preference and to take final action at the 
earliest practicable time. 49 U.S.C. 10705(f)(1)(A)(i).

Sec. 1137.2  Expeditious procedures for publication of separate rates for distinct services.

    (a) Purpose. These regulations are designed to facilitate the 
publication of and thus encourage the use of separate rates for distinct 
rail services. Increased utilization of such rates will

[[Page 154]]

also increase the attractiveness of investing in railroads and rail 
service related enterprises by creating a keener competition among rail 
carriers and other modes of transportation. Encouraging these goals, the 
Board also seeks to promote experimentation and innovative ratemaking 
through the initiation of rail carriers and the requests of their 
customers. Special permission requests for publication on short notice 
will be granted whenever feasible, and any proceedings involving 
separate rates for distinct services will be expedited.
    (b) Definitions. (1) Distinct rail services are those railroad 
transportation services, which are separate from line-haul 
transportation services necessary for the movement of freight, and for 
which a specific tariff item is published by the railroads either upon 
their own initiative or upon the request of any shipper or receiver of 
freight.

The following definitions refer to those factors included in 
Sec. 1137.2(h) in the determination of reasonableness:
    (2) The term ``cash-outlays'' as used in 49 U.S.C. 10728 shall 
consist of the following:
    (i) The annualized operating expenses, rents and taxes (including 
labor, materials and supplies, fuel and utilities, but excluding 
depreciation, amortization, and Federal income taxes) which change 
directly with the carrier's production of a distinct rail service.
    (ii) The annualized cash-outlays equivalent to the carrier's capital 
investment, including the cost of providing such capital, which change 
directly with the carrier's production of a distinct rail service. These 
cash-outlays may be determined based on either the cost of sunk and new 
investment combined or the cost of new investment only.
    (3) Demand is the willingness of a shipper to purchase a distinct 
rail service (as that term is defined in Sec. 1137.2(b)(1)) at a 
specified price under the prevailing circumstances.
    (c) Title page. In addition to requirements of Sec. 1312.12, a 
tariff title page must also state whether the tariff or supplement 
contains new or changed rates for distinct rail services as defined in 
Sec. 1137.2(b) and bear the following notation:

    This tariff (or supplement or loose leaf amendment) contains 
separate rates for distinct rail services (see item(s)______) within the 
meaning of Sec. 1137.2(b).

    (d) Letters of transmittal. In connection with separate rates for 
distinct rail services filed with the Board, the letter of transmittal 
(required in Sec. 1312.4) must also bear the notation found in 
Sec. 1137.2(c).
    (e) Justification statements. Justification statements in support of 
the publication of a separate rate or charge for a distinct rail service 
may be filed concurrently with the filing of the tariff. Information of 
the type specified in Sec. 1137.2(h), if included in the justification 
statement, would assist the Board in its initial evaluation of the 
proposal.
    (f) Protest(s) and investigation. Protests to a tariff (or 
supplement) making reference on the title page to Sec. 1137.2(b) must be 
verified and filed in accordance with Sec. 1132.1(g). In the event of 
investigation or suspension, these proceedings will be accorded 
priority, and modified procedure (49 CFR Part 1112), to the extent 
feasible, will be followed.
    (g) Reply to protest. Replies to protests of rates proposals under 
this section must be verified and should be filed and served promptly in 
accordance with Sec. 1132.1(f). Respondents are urged to submit the 
information specified in Sec. 1137.2(h) unless previously furnished.
    (h) Initial statement. In order to expedite the proceedings in the 
event of the suspension of tariff schedules setting forth separate rates 
for distinct rail services or in the event that investigation without 
suspension of such schedules is ordered, respondent railroad or 
railroads shall submit in writing, under verfication, support of the 
tariff in issue. Such data should consist of the following:
    (1) Cash-outlays. The dollars of ``cash-outlays'' as that term is 
defined in Sec. 1137.2(b)(2). A full explanation of the methods, 
procedures and data used to determine ``cash-outlays'' should be 
supplied.
    (2) Demand. Evidence supporting existence of a ``demand'' for the 
proposed

[[Page 155]]

service as that term is defined in Sec. 1137.2(b)(3).
    (3) Market dominance. If the proposal involves a new or increased 
charge for a distinct service, evidence prepared in accordance with the 
guidelines established in Ex Parte No. 320 (Sub-No. 2), 365 ICC 118 
should be supplied. However, if such data has been previously submitted 
in the same proceeding, a notation to that effect will suffice.
    (4) Revenues. The annualized dollars of revenue to be obtained from 
the rate or charge associated with providing the distinct rail service.
    (5) Outputs. The annualized number of service outputs associated 
with the rate or charge per service unit. For example, if the proposed 
rate is stated in cents per hundredweight, per car switched, or per 
stop, then the number of service outputs should be expressed as x number 
of hundredweight, cars switched, or stops made.
    (6) Ratios. The revenue-to-cost ratio (percentage) for the distinct 
rail service, based on the revenues to be obtained, and the carrier's 
``cash-outlays.''
    (7) Effect. A statement as to how the proposed rate on the distinct 
rail service will encourage competition; promote increased reinvestment 
by the railroad; or encourage and facilitate increased non-railroad 
investment in the production of rail services.
    (8) Alternative data. The submission of the above evidence, 
paragraphs (h)(1) through (7) of this section, represents data which the 
Board believes would provide a basis for meaningful analysis of the 
lawfulness of such rates. However, in lieu thereof or in addition 
thereto, respondents may justify their proposal on the basis of other 
relevant evidence or cost levels. A full explanation of the methods and 
procedures used shall be provided.
    (i) Reporting requirements. For the 6-month period beginning 
February 5, 1977, all common carriers by rail, subject to 49 U.S.C. 
11145; shall submit information showing those distinct rail service 
rates published in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 10728, showing actual or 
estimated revenues derived therefrom during the 6-month period. In 
addition, these reports, which shall be filed with the Board by July 30, 
1977, shall state whether the rates accomplished their intended purpose, 
and if not whether they intend any change in the level of charge or 
other change.

<R05>
Sec. 1139.1  Application.

    (a) Upon the filing by the tariff publishing agencies named 
hereinafter on behalf of their motor common carrier members, or by such 
other agencies as

[[Page 156]]

the Board may by order otherwise designate, of agency tariff schedules 
which contain (1) proposed general increases in rates or charges on 
general freight where such proposal would result in an increase of $1 
million or more in the annual operating revenues on the tariff affected 
by the proposal, or (2) a proposed general adjustment with the objective 
of restructuring the rates on a wide range of traffic, involving both 
increases and reductions in rates and charges, where such proposal would 
result in a net increase of $1 million or more in annual operating 
revenues, the motor common carriers of general freight on whose behalf 
such schedules are filed shall, concurrently with the filing of those 
tariff schedules, file and serve, as provided hereinafter, a verified 
statement presenting and comprising the entire evidential case which is 
relied upon to support the proposed general increase or rate 
restructuring. Carriers thus required to submit their evidence when they 
file their schedules are hereby notified that special permission to file 
those schedules shall be conditioned upon the publishing of an effective 
date at least 45 days later than the date of filing, to enable proper 
evaluation of the evidence presented. Data to be submitted in accordance 
with Secs. 1139.2 through 1139.5 of this part represent the minimum data 
required to be filed and served, and in no way shall be considered as 
limiting the type of evidence that may be presented at the time of 
filing of the schedules. If a formal proceeding is instituted, the 
carriers are not precluded from updating the evidence submitted at the 
time of filing of the schedules to reflect the contemporary situation.
    (b) The motor common carriers of general freight which are subject 
to the provisions of this section are those which are members of the 
following tariff publishing agencies:

Central and Southern Motor Freight Tariff Association, Inc.
Central States Motor Freight Bureau, Inc.
The Eastern Central Motor Carriers Association, Inc.
Middle Atlantic Conference
Middlewest Motor Freight Bureau
The New England Motor Rate Bureau, Inc.
Pacific Inland Tariff Bureau, Inc.
Rocky Mountain Motor Tariff Bureau, Inc.
Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference

    (c) Upon the filing of tariff schedules other than those described 
hereinabove, the carriers or their tariff publishing agencies shall be 
required to comply with such procedures as the Board may direct in the 
event an investigation is instituted. In any proceeding involving a 
proposed rate restructuring which would produce additional net revenue 
of less than $1 million the carriers will be required to submit only the 
data sought in Secs. 1139.2 and 1139.3. Nothing stated in this part 
shall relieve the carriers of their burden of proof imposed under the 
Interstate Commerce Act.


<R05>
Sec. 1139.2  Traffic study.

    (a) The respondents shall submit a traffic study for the most 
current 12-month calendar year available, which shall be referred to as 
the ``base-calendar year--actual.'' This year shall be the calendar year 
that has ended at least 7 months prior to the published effective date 
of the tariff schedules. If the effective date is less than 7 months 
following the end of the preceding calendar year, than the second 
preceding calendar year shall be considered at the ``base-calendar 
year--actual.'' The study shall include a probability sampling of the 
actual traffic handled during identical time periods for each study 
carrier.
    (b) The study carriers shall consist of those carriers subject to 
the requirements for allocation of expenses between line-haul and pickup 
and delivery services, as provided in Part 1207 of this chapter, 
Instructions 27 and 9002, which participate in one of the motor carrier 
industry's Continuous Traffic Studies, and which derive either $1 
million or more in annual operating revenues from this issue traffic or 
1 percent or more of the total annual operating revenues of all carriers 
from the issue traffic. A list of such carriers and the appropriate 
revenue data shall be submitted to corroborate the selection of the 
study carriers. ``Issue traffic'' consists of those shipments on which 
the freight rates or charges would be affected by the rate proposal.
    (c) Respondents shall take a sample of the traffic handled by the 
study carriers according to acceptable standards of probability sampling 
principles and

[[Page 157]]

practices, and shall explain and evaluate the probability sample from 
the standpoint of: Purpose, sample design (including explanation of 
estimation procedure and disclosure of sampling errors for derived 
characteristics), quality control aspects involved in processing and 
tabulating data and any statistical analysis performed on the sampled 
data.<SUP>4</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Although not adopted by the Board, attention is called to a 
staff report, ``Guidelines for the Presentation of the Results of Sample 
Studies,'' February 1, 1971, available from the Superintendent of 
Documents.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) For cost and revenue purposes, the ``carried'' tariff basis 
shall be used. ``Carried'' tariff means the issue traffic handled solely 
by the study carriers, either single-line or interline. Estimates of 
current revenues applicable to the issue traffic should reflect all 
rates and charges in effect no later than 45 days prior to the date of 
tariff filing.


<R05>
Sec. 1139.3  Cost study.

    (a) The respondents shall submit a cost study. Highway Form B may be 
used for this purpose. Service unit-costs shall be developed for each 
individual study carrier, adjusted by size of shipment and length of 
haul, and shall be applied to respective individual carrier's traffic 
service units as developed from its traffic study. Operating ratios 
shall be determined for the issue traffic handled by the study carriers 
on the ``carried'' basis by individual weight brackets included within 
the rate proposal, for: (1) The traffic study year, that is, the ``base-
calendar year--actual,'' as hereinbefore defined, (2) a ``present 
proforma year'' reflecting conditions prevailing on a date no later than 
45 days prior to the date of the tariff filing, and (3) a ``restated 
proforma year'' based on conditions anticipated on the effective date of 
the proposed rates, with a separation indicating projected operating 
ratios on two bases, namely, ``based on current revenues,'' and ``based 
on proposed revenues''. Operating ratios shall also be shown for all 
other traffic not affected by the rate proposal for the same weight 
brackets as shown for the issue traffic, but only for the period 
indicated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (b) In addition to the operating ratios, the cost study shall also 
be used to develop and provide the revenue-to-cost comparisons required 
in Appendix I hereto for the same time periods indicated for the 
operating ratios plus a ``restated proforma year'' based on constructed 
revenue need.
    (c) For both the operating ratios and the revenue-to-cost 
comparisons in Appendix I, the ``each-to-each'' costing method, i.e., 
the application of each individual study carrier's unit-cost to its 
traffic service units, applies only to the ``base calendar year--
actual.'' The application of possible labor and nonlabor cost increases 
for the purpose of updating the ``base calendar year--actual'' cost data 
may be accomplished by the use of either individual carrier data for 
each of the study carriers, or the composite carrier data for those 
study carriers whose revenue from the issue traffic amount to 50 percent 
or more of their total system revenues for the ``base calendar year--
actual.'' The sample values for expenses and revenues shall be expanded 
to full year values without adjustments to known annual report figures 
of any carrier.
    (d) Where cost studies are developed through the use of computer 
processing techniques, there shall be submitted a manual application of 
the costing procedures used for one traffic and cost study carrier 
(study carrier) in order to demonstrate the procedures by which the 
computer program distributes the annual report statistics, and applies 
service unit-costs to each shipment. An illustration of the application 
of service unit-costs to the applicable traffic service units generated 
by one single-line sample shipment and by one interline sample shipment 
shall also be submitted. These sample shipments shall be on the 
``Carried'' basis.


<R05>
Sec. 1139.4  Revenue need.

    Traffic and cost study carrier, i.e., the study carriers, shall 
submit evidence of the sum of money, in addition to operating expenses, 
including that needed to attract debt and equity capital, which they 
require to insure financial stability and the capacity to

[[Page 158]]

render service. This evidence shall include data required by Appendix I, 
parts I and II, and Appendix II.


<R05>
Sec. 1139.5  Affiliate data.

    Each individual traffic and cost study carrier having transactions 
with affiliates, subject to the reporting requirements of schedules 
9009-A and 9009-B in the annual report for class I motor carriers, shall 
submit appropriate data and analyses reflecting the effect on the parent 
carrier's profits of transactions with affiliates. Such data and 
analyses shall be adequately supported, and there shall be submitted 
such underlying data as will permit a reconciliation of these data to 
the data supplied in the appropriate schedules of each carrier's annual 
report.

<R05>
Sec. 1139.6  Official notice.

    The Board will take official notice of all of the proponent 
carriers' annual and quarterly reports on file with the Board.


<R05>
Sec. 1139.7  Service.

    The detailed information called for herein shall be in writing and 
shall be verified by a person or persons having knowledge thereof. The 
original and 10 copies of each verified statement for the use of the 
Board shall be filed with the Secretary, Surface Transportation Board, 
Washington, DC 20423. One copy of each statement shall be sent by first-
class mail to each of the regional offices of the Board in the area 
affected by the proposed increase, where it will be open to public 
inspection. A copy of each statement shall be mailed by first-class mail 
to each party of record in the last formal proceeding concerning a 
general rate increase in the affected area or territory. However, one 
copy of each statement shall be sent by express mail to any person 
undertaking to bear the cost. Written request for this expedited service 
must be made no less than 5 days before the statement is due to be filed 
with the Board. Otherwise, the service requirements of 49 CFR 1104.12 
should be observed. Information with respect to carrier affiliates may 
be served on the parties in summary form, if so desired. A copy of each 
statement shall be furnished to any interested person on request.
[47 FR 49577, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 53 FR 19302, May 27, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 1139.8  Availability of underlying data.

    All underlying data used in preparation of the material outlined 
above shall be made available in the office of the party serving such 
verified matter during usual office hours for inspection by any party of 
record desiring to do so, and shall be made available to the Board upon 
request therefor. The underlying data shall be made available also at 
the hearing, but only if and to the extent specifically requested in 
writing and required by any party for the purpose of cross-examination. 
Since appendix I data are to be submitted on a combined carrier basis, 
any underlying individual carrier data used to complete appendix I 
should be furnished to the Board for its use as well as for the use of 
parties opposing the sought increases.

Note A: This procedure allocates constant costs and the sum of money based on the ton and ton-mile method and   
  should be submitted for the information of the Board. How much of the constant and sum of money costs may or  
  should be recovered by any specific segment of traffic rest on (1) considerations including value of service, 
  demand, and ability to pay, and (2) considerations which involve matters relating to regulatory policy.

Note A: This procedure allocates constant costs and the sum of money based on the dollar (expense) method and   
  should be submitted for the information of the Board. How much of the constant and sum of money costs may or  
  should be recovered by any specific segment of traffic rests on (1) considerations including value of service,
  demand, and ability to pay, and (2) consideration which invlove matters relating to regulatory policy.        
Note B: Determine the amount of constant costs, including unrelated, by using Statement No. 6-68, Highway Form

Note C: Determine the amount of variable costs, including unrelated, by using Statement No. 6-68, Highway Form  
  B, Schedule A, line 111, column (3) multiplied by 90 percent to obtain the variable portion.

Footnotes to Appendix I:                                                                                        
                                                                                                                
Explanatory: The Purpose of Appendix I is twofold, namely: (1) to obtain, through part 1, Revenue Need, an      
  indication of the past actual, present, and restated system revenue needs of the traffic and cost study       
  carriers, which, along with the financial data required in appendix B, will facilitate an analysis of the     
  financial stability of these carriers, and (2) to allocate a part of these system revenue needs to the traffic
  at issue as provided for in part II, line 13. It is that portion of constant and sum of money costs resulting 
  from this allocation plus the related variable expenses (line 14) which produces the total costs assigned to  
  the issue traffic (line 16) which is then compared to the issue traffic revenues in the revenue-to-cost       
  comparison shown on line 17. This comparison provides some indication of how much the total issue traffic is  
  contributing to the carriers' overall revenue needs; and serves as a reference point for the consideration of 
  ratemaking factors, other than costs, which may influence the appropriateness of the issue traffic's          
  contribution.

Appendix I data should be completed and submitted for all traffic and cost study carriers combined. However,    
  data for the ``base calendar year--actual,'' column (3), should be developed and completed for each traffic   
  and cost study carrier and the results combined for all such carriers. The data in part I, columns (4) through
  (7), which reflect an updating of revenue need data for the ``base calendar year--actual'' to present and     
  restated levels, should be developed on either an individual carrier basis, or on a composite carrier basis   
  comprised of all traffic and cost study carriers. Data in part II, line 14 columns (4) through (7), which     
  reflect an updating of the cost and traffic study data for the ``base calendar year--actual'' to present and  
  restated levels, should be developed by the use of either individual carrier data for each of the study       
  carriers, or the composite carrier data for those study carriers whose revenues from the issue traffic amount 
  to 50 percent or more of their total system revenues for the ``base calendar year--actual.'' However, for line
  14, the method selected should be the same as that used to update the operating ratios to present and restated
  levels as required in .3 Cost study. As indicated above, appendix I data should be completed and submitted    
  only for all traffic and cost study carriers combined. Since appendix I are to be submitted on a combined     
  carrier basis, any underlying individual carrier data used to complete this appendix should be furnished to   
  the Board for its use as well as for the use of parties opposing the sought increases. Data in columns (4)    
  through (7) must be appropriately explained and supported. Each of the dollar figures called for in these     
  columns shall be accompanied by an explanation of the bases or methods of restatement, including explicit     
  identification of all projected or assumed changes in revenues, in wage rates, in price levels of other       
  expenses and property items, and in productivity, as compared with the preceeding (actual) year results. Note 
  that the time periods referred to in appendix I, that is, ``Base calendar year--actual,'' ``Present proforma  
  year'' and ``Restated proforma year'' are the same time periods indicated in Sec.  1139.3, Cost study.        
\1\ Sources in this column apply to column (3) ``Base calendar year--actual.'' Data for columns (4) through (7) 
  should rely on column (3) as a base in order to reflect data for the ``Present proforma year'' and the        
  ``Restated proforma year.'' Annual report sources apply to class I motor carriers for class II carriers use   
  comparable sources.                                                                                           
\2\ The data in column (3) should reflect the revenue need data (part 1), and the traffic and cost study data   
  (part II), for the traffic study year. That is, the ``Base calendar year--actual,'' which should coincide with
  the ``Base calendar year--actual'' referred to in the Cost study (Sec.  1139.3). Parts I and II should be     
  completed for each individual study carrier--the purpose being to allocate a portion of each carrier's system 
  revenue need to the traffic at issue as provided for in part II. The results for all study carriers should    
  then be aggregated and submitted on a combined carrier basis.                                                 
\3\ The data in column (4) should be based on present wage, price and productivity levels and reflect conditions
  prevailing on a date no later than the 45 days prior to the date of the tariff filing.                        
\4\ The data in columns (5), (6), and (7) should be based on wage, price, and productivity levels anticipated on
  the effective date of the proposed rates.                                                                     
\5\ The purpose of this column is to obtain data on what system revenue needs of the study carriers should be at
  a giving time. Part I should consider the sum of money in addition to operating expenses (including that      
  needed to attract debt and equity capital) which the carriers feel they require to insure financial stability 
  and the capacity to render service.                                                                           
\6\ In columns (4) through (7), show income taxes based on estimated taxable income reduced by the taxes        
  applicable to other income such as, for example, capital gains transactions.                                  
\7\ In columns (4) through (7), determine the net income based on data shown for lines 1 though 7. In column    
  (7), the estimate of the net income needed should be supported by evidence that it is a just and reasonable   
  amount.                                                                                                       
\8\ Show expenses and revenues allocated to the total issue traffic based on an expansion of the sample to a    
  full year. The amount shown on line 14 for variable expenses should agree with that shown in Method B, line   
  (d).

Sec. 1139.20  Application.

    (a) Upon the filing by the National Bus Traffic Association, Inc., 
(NBTA) on behalf of its carrier members, or by such other agencies as 
the Board may by order otherwise designate, of agency tariff schedules 
which contain proposed general increases in fares or charges where such 
proposal would result in an increase of $1 million or more in the annual 
operating revenues on the traffic affected by the proposal, the motor 
common carriers of passengers on whose behalf such schedules are filed 
shall, concurrently with the filing of those schedules, file and serve, 
as provided hereinafter, a verified statement presenting and comprising 
the entire evidential case which is relied upon to support the proposed 
general increase. Carriers thus required to submit their evidence when 
they file their schedules are hereby notified that special permission to 
file those schedules shall be conditioned upon the publishing of an 
effective date at least 30 days later than the date of filing, to enable 
proper evaluation of the evidence presented. Data to be submitted in 
accordance with Secs. 1139.21 through 1139.23 represent the minimum data 
required to be filed and served, and in no way shall be considered as 
limiting the type of evidence that may be presented at the time of 
filing of the schedules. If a formal proceeding is instituted, the 
carriers are not precluded from updating the evidence submitted at the 
time of filing of the schedules to reflect the current situation.
    (b) When filing tariff schedules other than those described 
hereinabove, the carriers or their tariff publishing agencies shall be 
required to comply with such procedures as the Board may direct in the 
event an investigation is instituted. Nothing stated in this part shall 
relieve the carriers of their burden of proof imposed under the 
Interstate Commerce Act.

Sec. 1139.21  Study carriers.

    (a) For the purposes of this proceeding the ``study carriers'' shall 
consist of those Class I motor common carriers of passengers which are 
members of

[[Page 163]]

NBTA and which, during the latest calendar year available preceding the 
filing date of the proposed increase in fares and/or charges, derived 
$500,000 or more in annual operating revenues from the issue traffic, or 
1 percent or more of the total annual operating revenues received by all 
Class I carriers from the issue traffic. Issue traffic is defined as 
that traffic (services) directly affected by the proposed increases in 
fares and/or charges.
    (b) To corroborate the selection of the above study carriers, and to 
provide a data base for a continuing evaluation of the validity and 
usefulness of those carriers as a study group, respondents shall submit, 
as a part of their verified statement (justification), a list of all 
Class I motor common carriers of passengers participating in the issue 
traffic (services). For the above specified calendar year, the dollar 
amounts of total system operating revenues for each such carrier shall 
be arrayed in descending order; and, there shall be shown the amount of 
annual operating revenues received by each carrier from the total 
traffic at issue. Also, to be shown is the percent that each such 
carrier's total issue traffic revenue is to its total system revenues, 
and the percent that each carrier's total issue traffic revenue is to 
the total issue traffic revenues for all Class I carriers indicated in 
the above list. This list of carriers and the carrier's applicable 
revenues shall be referred to as Schedule A, Class I Participating 
Carriers' Revenue Data.

Sec. 1139.22  Revenue data for study carriers.

    The study carriers, as identified above, shall submit the revenue 
data called for in Schedule B herein, the purpose of which is to 
determine the amount of increased revenues which might be expected under 
the proposed increase in fares and/or charges on the issue traffic, and 
to evaluate the revenue aspects of the non-issue traffic, including that 
traffic subject to Surface Transportation Board rate regulation but not 
here at issue, and that traffic which is intrastate in character and 
under the jurisdiction of state public Boards.

Sec. 1139.23  Revenue need.

    The ``study carriers'' shall submit evidence of the sum of money, in 
addition to operating expenses, including that needed to attract debt 
and equity capital, which they require to insure financial stability and 
the capability to render service. This evidence shall include data 
required by Schedules C through G.

class mail to each of the regional offices of the Board in the area 
affected by the proposed increase, where it will be open to public 
inspection. A copy of each statement shall be mailed by first-class mail 
to each party of record in the last formal proceeding concerning a 
general increase in bus passenger fares in the affected area or 
territory. Otherwise, the service requirements of Sec. 1130.1 shall be 
observed.

                         Explanatory--Schedule A

    Purpose. The purpose of Schedule A is to corroborate the selection 
of the ``study carriers'', as defined in Sec. 1139.21 of the prescribed 
procedures, and to provide a data base for the continuing evaluation of 
the validity and usefulness of the ``study carrier'' group.
    Calendar Year. For the purpose of this schedule use the latest 
calendar year available preceding the filing date of the proposed 
increased fares and/or charges.
    Column (a). The annual report number is that number assigned to the 
carrier by the Bureau of Accounts, Surface Transportation Board, for 
identification purposes.
    Column (b). List Class I carrier members of national Bus Traffic 
Association and other interested Class I carriers participating in the 
tariffs of NBTA which will be affected by the proposal, in descending 
order of total system operating revenues.
    Column (c). Use the following code for this column. For study 
carriers (as defined in Sec. 1139.21) insert ``S''. For non-study 
carriers insert ``NS''.
    Column (d). Use amount shown in carrier's Annual Report, Schedule 
2998, Line 9.
    Column (e). Issue traffic is defined as that traffic (services) 
directly affected by the proposed increase in fares and/or charges.
    Columns (f) and (g). These columns are self-explanatory and are 
obtained by calculations using columns (d) and (e).

                         Explanatory--Schedule B

    Purpose. The purpose of this schedule is to obtain--for each study 
carrier and by totals for all study carriers--(1) total operating 
revenue, (2) revenues attributable to the various types of traffic at 
issue, (3) revenue attributable to the total non-issue traffic, and (4) 
miscellaneous station and other operating revenues. These data shall be 
provided for the specified study periods, namely: Base year actual, pro 
forma year based on current revenues, and pro forma year based on 
proposed revenues.
    The pro forma year based on proposed revenues for the traffic at 
issue will be compared to the issue traffic revenues for the pro forma 
year based on current revenues and for the base year actual to determine 
the amount of the proposed revenue increase being sought over these two 
periods. In addition, the revenue data for the total issue traffic 
(column (d)), will be used in Schedule C, Part III as a basis for 
allocating increased costs, i.e., the increased operating expenses and 
the increased ``sum of money'' costs.
    Base Year Actual. Data to be reported in this and other schedules 
herein for the base year actual shall be based on the 4-quarter calendar 
year periods identified below:

                   Filing Month of Verified Statement                   
                                                                        
                                                                        
                                                                        
January...............................  Sept. 30, preceding year.       
February..............................      Do.                         
March.................................      Do.                         
April.................................  Dec. 31, preceding year.        
May...................................      Do.                         
June..................................      Do.                         
July..................................  Mar. 31, filing-month year.     
August................................      Do.                         
September.............................      Do.                         
October...............................  June 30, filing-month year.     
November..............................      Do.                         
December..............................  June 30, filing-month year.     
                                                                        

    The 4-quarter calendar year periods identified above represent the 
minimum requirement. However, in event a proposed fare/charge increase 
is filed at a time when data for a more current quarter than that 
specified are obtainable then that more current quarter may be used in 
the base year actual. For example, if an increase is filed in late March 
and data for the 4th quarter of the preceding year are obtainable, then 
the base year actual ending December 31 may be used in lieu of the base 
year actual ending September 30.
    Pro forma year data. Revenue data for the pro forma year shall be 
reported in two ways, namely: Based on current revenues and based on 
proposed revenues. Separate schedules are required for each pro forma 
year. These data do not represent a forecast but reflect the results of 
12 months of operation at particular rate levels. Thus, data for the pro 
forma year based on current revenues should be based on a restatement of 
the revenue data for the base year actual to reflect fares and/or 
charges which are currently in effect. Similarly data for the pro forma 
year based on proposed revenues should reflect a restatement of the base 
year actual data but at levels reflecting the proposed fares and/or 
charges.

    Column (a). Insert in this column the company name of each ``study 
carrier'' as defined in Sec. 1139.21 of the prescribed procedures.
    Column (b). Use carrier's Annual Report, Schedule 2998, Line 9. The 
dollar amount in this column, for each study carrier, should equal the 
total of columns (d), (e), and (f).
    Columns (c-1), (c-2), etc. As defined in Sec. 1139.21, ``issue 
traffic'' means that traffic (service) affected by the proposed increase 
in fares and/or charges, and is limited to the fares and/or charges 
published in schedules and tariffs filed with the Surface Transportation 
Board. For the purpose of the proposed increases filed under the 
prescribed procedures of this proceeding, column (c) should be 
subdivided into columns (c-1), (c-2), etc. to show separately the 
revenue for each type of traffic in issue and each column should be 
appropriately headed. For instance, a proposal to increase passenger 
fares and express rates would call for Intercity Passenger Revenue in 
column (c-1), and Express Revenue in column (c-2). If a third basic 
service is included in the proposed increase, column (c-3) should show 
revenue from that traffic with an appropriate identification in this 
column heading.
    Column (d). The total issue traffic revenues in this column should 
equal the sum of columns (c-1), (c-2), etc.
    Column (e). The revenues to be reported in this column shall consist 
of those revenues other than ``total issue traffic revenue'' (Column 
(d)), and ``miscellaneous station and other operating revenues'' (Column 
(f)). Thus, ``non-issue traffic revenue'' means those revenues accruing 
from providing the types of services indicated in columns (c-1), etc., 
but which may be ``intrastate'' in nature, are ``exempt'' as provided 
under 49 U.S.C. 10721, 10722, 10723 and 10724, or which are otherwise 
not at issue in a proposed fare and/or charge increase. Such non-issue 
traffic may also include a commuter or mass transportation service, 
which is the transportation of passengers generally performed within a 
city or town and the suburban areas contiguous thereto. However, in some 
instances this service may also be intercity in character where the 
cities involved are within relatively short distances of each other and 
the primary purpose is the mass transportation of commuter passengers to 
and from these cities.
    Column (f). For the purpose of this schedule the revenues to be 
reported in this column shall consist of those in Account 3600, 
Miscellaneous Station Revenue, and in Account 3900, Other Operating 
Revenue. (See 49 CFR Part 1206.)
    Presentation of statement on revenue sample studies. Historically, 
in order to separate interstate from intrastate revenues, it has not 
been necessary for annual report purposes for each carrier to conduct 
studies of its traffic operations, whether based upon sampling or 
otherwise, however, many of the Class I carriers make such studies for 
managerial purposes. In order to permit the evaluation of such studies, 
and the evidence derived therefrom, each study carrier, as defined in 
section 1139.21, shall submit an affidavit explaining how its study was 
conducted and how it appraises the reliability of the results. Carriers 
having studies based upon sampling should conform with the staff report 
entitled ``Guidelines for the Presentation of the Results of Sample 
Studies,'' February 1, 1971.

             Explanatory--Schedule C (Parts I, II, and III)

    Columns (d) through (h). These columns shall contain the pro forma 
year data.
    The data reported in column (d) shall be the base year actual 
(column (c)) restated to reflect conditions (wage, price, and 
productivity, etc.) prevailing on or near the effective date of the 
proposed increase. Revenues in column (d) shall be based on fares and 
charges which are currently in effect.
    The data reported in column (e) shall also be the base year actual 
(column (c)) restated to reflect conditions (wage, price, and 
productivity, etc.) prevailing on or near the effective date of the 
proposed increase. Unlike column (d), however, revenues in column (e) 
shall be based on the proposed fares and charges.
    The data reported in column (f) shall also be the base year actual 
(column (c)) restated to reflect conditions (wage, price, and 
productivity, etc.) prevailing on or near the effective date of the 
proposed increase plus allowable foreseeable future costs. Revenues 
shall be based on the proposed fares and charges.
    The data reported in columns (g) and (h) shall be based on what the 
system revenue needs of the study carriers should be at a given time, 
including the constructed projected and future operating expenses and 
the constructed ``sum of money'' above these expenses. The constructed 
``sum of money'' should be supported by evidence that it is a just and 
reasonable amount and is that needed to attract debt and equity capital 
and to insure financial stability and the capacity to render service. 
Such evidence should include an analysis of the adequacy of the 
carriers' earnings, the carriers' cost of debt and equity capital, the 
various kinds of risk attending their operations and the financing 
thereof, and the carriers' ongoing needs for working capital, new 
equipment and facilities.

                    Explanatory--Schedule D (Part I)

    Purpose. The purpose of Schedule D (Part I) is to ascertain the 
financial posture of Greyhound Lines, Inc. and all the study carrier 
carriers by an analysis of certain key financial data, with a view to 
determining revenue needs.
    Study Carrier Groupings. Schedule D (Part I) shall be prepared on 
the following two bases:
    1. Greyhound Lines, Inc.
    2. Trailways Combined (study carriers, only)
    3. All Study Carriers
    Column (b). The annual report sources in this column refer to the 
1976 Annual Report Form MP-1. For years prior or subsequent to 1976, use 
comparable sources.
    Column (c). If the fare/charge increase is filed during the first 
six months of the calendar year, the data reported in column (c) shall 
be based on the 3rd calendar year preceding the filing year. For 
example, if the rate increase is filed on May 15, 1977, column (c) shall 
report data for calendar year 1974.
    If the fare/charge increase is filed during the last six months of 
the calendar year, the data reported in column (c) shall be based on the 
2nd calendar year preceding the filing year. For example, if the rate 
increase is filed on Nov. 15, 1977, column (c) should report data for 
calendar year 1975.
    Column (d). If the fare/charge increase is filed during the first 
six months of the calendar year, the data reported in column (d) should 
be based on the 2nd calendar year preceding the filing year. For 
example, if the rate increase is filed on May 15, 1977, column (d) 
should report data for calendar year 1975.
    If the rate increase is filed during the last six months of the 
calendar year, the data reported in column (d) shall be based on the 1st 
calendar year preceding the filing year. If, for example, the fare/
charge increase is filed on November 15, 1977, column (d) should report 
data for calendar year 1976.
    Column (e). Data to be reported in this column for the base year 
actual shall be based on the 4-quarter calendar year periods identified 
below:

[[Page 173]]

December..............................      Do.                         
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The 4-quarter calendar year periods identified above represent the 
minimum requirement. However, in event a proposed fare/charge increase 
is filed at a time when data for a more current quarter than that 
specified are obtainable, the more current quarter may be used in the 
base year-actual. For example, if an increase is filed in late March and 
data for the 4th quarter of the preceding year is obtainable, the base 
year-actual ending December 31, may be used in lieu of the base year-
actual ending September 30.

                    Explanatory--Schedule D (Part II)

    Purpose. Schedule D (Part II) is designed to segregate the impacts 
of: (1) The Board's deferred tax accounting rule change; and (2) the 
impact of the investment tax credit on continuing operations.
    Study Carrier Groupings. The study carrier groups for Part II shall 
be the same as those designated for Part I.
    Column (b). The annual report sources in this column refer to the 
1976 Annual Report Form MP-1. For years prior or subsequent to 1976, use 
comparable sources.
    Columns (c), (d) and (e). The reporting periods for Part II shall 
correspond to those in Part I.
    Investment Tax Credit Impact. This impact is: (1) The amount by 
which Account 8000, Income Taxes on Income from Continuing Operations, 
was credited for the investment tax credit if the flow-through 
accounting method was elected or (2) the amount by which Account 8040, 
Provision for Deferred Taxes, was credited for the amortization of the 
investment tax credit if the deferral accounting method was elected.

                         Explanatory--Schedule E

    Purpose. Schedule E is designed to provide the Board with an 
indication of the carrier's sources and uses of funds over the recent 
past.
    Study Carrier Groupings. Schedule E shall be prepared on the 
following two bases:
    1. Greyhound Lines, Inc.
    2. Trailways Combined (study carriers, only)
    3. All Study Carriers

[[Page 175]]

    ``Funds''. The term ``Funds'' for the purpose of this schedule shall 
include all assets or financial resources even though a transaction may 
not directly affect cash or working capital. For example, the purchase 
of property in exchange for bonds or shares of stock would be an 
application of funds for investment in property provided by the issue of 
securities.
    Sources and uses of funds should be individually disclosed. For 
example, outlays for fixed assets should not be reported net of 
retirements.
    Column (b). The annual report sources in this column refer to the 
1976 Annual Report Form MP-1. For years prior or subsequent to 1976, use 
comparable sources.
    Column (c). If the fare/charge increase is filed during the first 
six months of the calendar year, the data reported in column (c) shall 
be based on the 3rd calendar year preceding the filing year. For 
example, if the rate increase is filed on May 15, 1977, column (c) shall 
report data for calendar year 1974.
    If the fare/charge increase is filed during the last six months of 
the calendar year, the data reported in column (c) shall be based on the 
2nd calendar year preceding the filing year. For example, if the rate 
increase is filed on Nov. 15, 1977, column (c) should report data for 
calendar year 1975.
    Column (d). If the fare/charge increase is filed during the first 
six months of the calendar year, the data reported in column (d) should 
be based on the 2nd calendar year preceding the filing year. For 
example, if the rate increase is filed on May 15, 1977, column (d) 
should report data for calendar year 1975.
    If the rate increase is filed during the last six months of the 
calendar year, the data reported in column (d) shall be based on the 1st 
calendar year preceding the filing year. If, for example, the fare/
charge increase is filed on November 15, 1977, column (d) should report 
data for calendar year 1976.
    Column (e). Data to be reported in this column for the base year-
actual shall be based on the 4-quarter calendar year periods identified 
below:

    The 4-quarter calendar year periods identified above represent the 
minimum requirement. However, in event a proposed fare/charge increase 
is filed at a time when data for a more current quarter than that 
specified are obtainable, the more current quarter may be used in the 
base year-actual. For example, if an increase is filed in late March and 
data for the 4th quarter of the preceding year is obtainable, the base 
year-actual ending December 31, may be used in lieu of the base year-
actual ending September 30.

year preceding the filing year.
    Column (d). Data to be reported in this column for the base year-

the 4th quarter of the preceding year is obtainable then the base year-
actual ending December 31, may be used in lieu of the base year-actual 
ending September 30.

  NBTA Will Undertake the Development of a Cost Allocation System for 
                      Motor Carriers of Passengers

    At the conclusion of the hearing in this proceeding, the 
Administrative Law Judge requested a discussion of the feasibility of 
NBTA undertaking the traffic and cost studies necessary to permit the 
separation of bus carrier expenses by types of service. As the record in 
this case indicates, no such studies have ever been undertaken and there 
is no present capability on the part of either the Board or the carriers 
themselves to allocate total operating expenses by types of carrier 
service. As the testimony of Mr. Bilz reveals, data derived from traffic 
studies is the source of only a few of the factors which must be 
developed to permit the identification of cost.<SUP>18</SUP> 
Consequently, the development of a carefully conceived overall cost 
allocation system must be accomplished first, and then a determination 
must be made of the types and kinds of studies needed to develop the 
specific factors required for implementation to the system.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>18</SUP> Tr. 183-186.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At its annual meeting held in Newton, Massachusetts, on September 
27-28, 1976, the members of the National Bus Traffic Association 
considered the question of undertaking the analyses, planning, and 
studies leading to the development and implementation of a cost 
allocation system and agreed to undertake such a program. Mr. Bilz, the 
cost analyst retained by the Association, has been request to work with 
appropriate carrier personnel and an initial meeting to outline the 
first steps is scheduled to be held during November of this year. In the 
meantime, after consultation with Mr. Bilz, we set forth the following 
discussion of what will be involved.
    In assessing the problems and complexities involved in formulating a 
procedure to develop costs by types of service for the bus lines, some 
parallels may be drawn with the procedure which has evolved over the 
years for general commodity motor carriers. Cost formulas for general 
commodity carriers were developed by the Cost Finding Section of the 
Surface Transportation Board more than thirty years ago. These cost 
formulas have been modified and refined from time-to-time in order to 
adjust for changing operating practices and conditions, improvements in 
accounting technology or the need to develop costs for particular kinds 
of service or types of traffic. At a later point in time when the need 
arose in general revenue increase cases for more detailed separations of 
the expenses of the general commodity carriers among types of service 
and types of traffic, procedures were developed whereby a continuing 
sample of traffic data could be developed to tie in with unit costs 
produced by the motor carrier cost formulas.<SUP>19</SUP> Thus, the 
detailed separation of traffic data developed in the continuing traffic 
studies was designed to tie in with existing cost allocation formulas. 
More recently, a complete revision of the Uniform System of Accounts for 
general commodity motor carriers necessitated further modification of 
the cost formulas; however, at the same time, such revisions served to 
increase the amount of expenses allocated in the formulas on a direct 
basis and reduced the amount of expenses which could only be allocated 
by means of factors derived from special studies or other means.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>19</SUP> Probability sampling of general freight motor carrier 
traffic did not develop until some 20 years after the Board's cost 
formulas for truck lines.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At the present time, the bus industry has committed itself to a 
review of its Uniform System of Accounts, jointly with the Bureau of 
Accounts of the Surface Transportation Board, to determine the need for 
revising the accounts to conform more closely with generally accepted 
accounting principles and, most importantly, to facilitate cost finding 
and financial analysis. In the review and analysis of the Uniform System 
of Accounts, consideration should be given to possible benefits from a 
matrix approach in accumulating operating expenses, similar in some 
respects but not necessarily as detailed as the approach used in 
redesigning the system of accounts for general commodity carriers. The 
separations of expenses for bus lines need not be as detailed as those 
made for general commodity carriers since the needs for expense 
segregations are not the same. However, use of a matrix system by the 
bus lines to accumulate operating expenses would result in the direct 
assignment of various categories of expense which would otherwise be 
included in a common pool of expense to be allocated on the basis of the 
best available data. Therefore, as a necessary preliminary step toward 
the development of a cost allocation system for the bus lines, the 
Uniform System of Accounts must be examined for the purpose of 
identifying expenses which can be directly assigned to particular 
services or operations.
    Basically, a cost study for the bus lines involves, first, a 
determination of the expenses chargeable to each of the various services 
provided by the carriers. These services include regular route intercity 
service, involving transportation of passengers, express, baggage, 
newspapers and mail, local service and special services including 
charter operations and tours. Secondly, the need for further separations 
within these categories must be explored. An all-out study would involve 
the allocation of expenses for regular route service among passengers 
and their baggage, express traffic and all other traffic;

[[Page 179]]

however, such detailed separations--which can only be made by means of 
specially-designed allocating procedures and special studies--may not be 
necessary, at least in the initial design of a cost allocation system 
for the bus lines. From the standpoint of current and potential use to 
be made of cost study data, it is reasonable, at this point, to design a 
system which will separate expenses for regular route service involving 
passenger and express traffic (including baggage) on the one hand, and 
all other services on the other. Finally, an additional separation of 
the expenses for regular route service between interstate and intrastate 
traffic is necessary.
    In connection with the first step, i.e., allocation of expenses 
among services, although a number of the various categories of expense 
incurred by the bus lines may be directly allocated to various services, 
there are additional items of expense which are jointly incurred in 
connection with two or more services and can only be separated among 
services on the basis of appropriate allocation factors. The same 
problems arise in the second and third steps, to an even greater extent, 
in determining the extent to which expenses assigned to a particular 
service must be allocated among the various types of traffic handled in 
that service and in making the further separation between interstate and 
intrastate traffic. These separations should be made by means of cost 
allocation factors which are functionally related to the fullest extent 
possible to each item of expense. This calls for the development of 
additional allocation factors which are not presently maintained by the 
bus lines.
    At the present time, the carriers can accurately determine from 
their regularly maintained accounting records the amount of revenue 
accruing from regular route operations, separately for passenger and 
express service, and from operations in connection with charter and 
special service. By means of established probability sampling 
procedures, Greyhound and Continental Trailways can further separate 
passenger revenue in intercity service between interstate and intrastate 
traffic. Other carriers are able to make the latter separation of 
revenue on various bases consistent with the size of their operations. 
It is possible that the probability sampling procedure and other bases 
employed by the smaller carriers may be expanded to include statistical 
data as well as revenue information. The bus lines currently maintain 
records, for the purpose of their annual reports to the Surface 
Transportation Board, of the number of bus miles operated separately for 
intercity service, local service and special services. Such data will 
undoubtedly come into use in allocating expenses among services. 
Similarly, records of the number of passengers carried in various 
services, maintained by the bus lines, may be used in some of the 
expense allocations. However, no continuing records are maintained 
showing the number of passengers carried separately in interstate and 
intrastate commerce nor are any separations made of the number of 
passenger miles in each category. Such statistical separations are 
required regardless of the methodology followed in the cost study, that 
is, whether the separations of expenses between interstate and 
intrastate traffic are made within the framework of a cost allocation 
formula or whether the expenses in each category are developed on the 
basis of average mileage-related and non-mileage unit costs developed 
from a cost formula and applied to traffic service units developed for 
interstate and intrastate traffic, i.e., number of passengers and number 
of passenger miles.
    As noted above, expenses for each type of traffic must be separated 
between those which are related to mileage operated and those which are 
not related to mileage. This brings in the problem of segregating the 
terminal activities of the carriers among services and types of traffic. 
Segregation of such expenses will probably require time and motion 
analyses, calculation of space utilization factors at various 
representative terminals and other special studies.
    The formulation of a cost allocation system and the gathering of 
input data for the system will require an extensive amount of work and 
expense on the part of the bus lines. If the amount of time required in 
developing acceptable cost allocation procedures for general freight 
motor carriers is any indication, several years may be required before a 
cost system for the bus lines can be formulated, applied and tested. The 
bus industry recognizes that, because of its workload and limited staff, 
the Cost Finding Section of the Board cannot take on the task of 
developing a cost allocation system for the bus lines as it did in 
connection with general freight motor carriers; however, it is hoped 
that the efforts of the bus lines in this regard will receive the full 
support and guidance of the Board's staff so that the best possible 
results may be achieved in the shortest possible time.

<R05>


    Authority:  49 U.S.C. 721.

[[Page 180]]


<R05>
Sec. 1141.1  Procedures to calculate interest rates.

    (a) For purposes of complying with a Board decision in a complaint 
or investigation proceeding, interest rates to be computed shall be the 
coupon equivalent yield (investment rate) of marketable securities of 
the United States Government having a duration of 91 days (3 months). 
The rate levels will be determined as follows:
    (1) For investigation proceedings, the interest rate shall be the 
coupon equivalent yield in effect on the date the statement is filed 
accounting for all amounts received under the new rates (See 49 U.S.C. 
10707(d)(1)).
    (2) For complaint proceedings, the interest rate shall be the coupon 
equivalent yield in effect on the first day of the calendar quarter in 
which an unlawful charge is paid. The interest rate in complaint 
proceedings shall be updated as of the first day of all subsequent 
calendar quarters, at the coupon equivalent yields in effect on those 
days. Updating will continue until the required reparation payments are 
made.
    (3) For purposes of this section, coupon equivalent yields shall be 
considered ``in effect'' on the date the securities are issued, not on 
the date they are auctioned. If the date the statement is filed (for 
investigation proceedings) or if the first day of the calendar quarter 
(for complaint proceedings) is the same as the issue date, then the 
yield on that date shall be used.
    (b) Interest in a complaint or investigation proceeding shall be 
compounded quarterly, as follows:
    (1) For investigation proceedings, the reparations period shall 
begin on the date the investigation is started. Thus, unless by 
coincidence, the quarterly compounding periods in investigation 
proceedings will not coincide with the calendar quarters.
    (2) For complaint proceedings, the reparations period shall begin on 
the date the unlawful charge is paid. However, in order for the 
quarterly compounding periods in complaint cases to coincide with the 
calendar quarters (so that only one interest rate is in effect during 
each compounding period), the first compounding period shall run from 
the date the unlawful charge is paid to the last day of the current 
calendar quarter, and all subsequent compounding periods shall coincide 
with the calendar quarters.
    (3) For both investigation and complaint proceedings, the annual 
effective interest rate shall be the same as the annual nominal (or 
stated) rate. Thus, the nominal rate must be factored exponentially to 
the power representing the portion of the year covered by the interest 
rate. A simple multiplication of the nominal rate by the portion of the 
year covered by the interest rate would not be appropriate because it 
would result in an effective rate in excess of the nominal rate. Under 
this ``exponential'' approach, the total cumulative reparations payment 
(including interest) is calculated by multiplying the interest factor 
for each quarterly period (or part thereof) by the principal amount for 
that period plus any accumulated interest from previous periods. The 
``interest factor'' for each period is 1.0 plus the interest rate for 
that period to the power representing the portion of the year covered by 
the interest rate. As an example, if the annual interest rate for the 
quarter is 5.6 percent, then the interest factor would be 1.01368, or 
1.056 to the power of 91/365.

<R05>
Sec. 1144.1  Notification, explanation, and justification.

    (a) Notification. A rail carrier proposing to cancel a through route 
and/or a joint rate shall comply with the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 
10762(c)(3) and

[[Page 181]]

10705a(f), as appropriate, and 49 CFR part 1312, and shall give notice 
of its intent to make such a cancellation 45 days prior to the effective 
date of the cancellation. For cancellations under 49 U.S.C. 10705(e), 
the 45-day period must consist of at least a 25-day notice of intent to 
file followed by a 20-day tariff filing in compliance with 49 U.S.C. 
10762(c)(3).
    (b) Explanation and justification--(1) Request. After a rail carrier 
has given notice of a proposed cancellation, any affected party may ask 
the canceling rail carrier to:
    (i) Explain how the proposed cancellation will affect the party, and
    (ii) Justify the application of the cancellation to a route or rate 
actively used by or participated in by the party.
    (2) Reply. The rail carrier proposing the cancellation must give the 
party the requested explanation and justification, including pertinent 
mileage and cost data, within 10 days of the date the request is made.
    (3) Time. By mutual agreement, the rail carrier proposing the 
cancellation and the affected party may alter the time frames of 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The 49 CFR part 1132 time periods for 
protests and replies apply.
    (4) Content. The content of the request and reply (other than 
pertinent mileage and cost data) will be left to the parties, though all 
information pertinent to the individual case should be included. The 
failure to provide information necessary to analyze the action under the 
criteria established in Sec. 1144.3 may be treated as an admission 
against interest.

<R05>
Sec. 1144.2  Negotiation.

    (a) Timing. At least 5 days prior to challenging a cancellation of a 
through route or joint rate, or seeking the prescription of a through 
route, joint rate, or reciprocal switching, the party intending to 
initiate such action must first seek to engage in negotiations to 
resolve its dispute with the prospective defendants.
    (b) Participation. Participation or failure to participate in 
negotiations does not waive a party's right to file a timely request for 
suspension and/or investigation or prescription.
    (c) Arbitration. The parties may use arbitration as part of the 
negotiation process, or in lieu of litigation before the Board.


<R05>
Sec. 1144.3  Suspension.

    (a) General. Under these rules the Board will suspend and 
investigate, investigate, or not suspend and investigate a proposed 
cancellation of a through route and/or joint rate. A persuasive 
presentation under all of the criteria below is sufficient for the Board 
to determine that the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 10707(c)(1) have been 
met warranting suspension and investigation of the proposed 
cancellation. Failure to convince the Board on any one of the criteria 
may result in either only an investigation (no suspension) or a 
determination not to investigate. This will be decided on a case-by case 
basis.
    (b) Statutory factors. A decision under (a) will be made based on 
the broad factors in 49 U.S.C. 10707(c)(1). The criteria considered in 
analyzing the factors in 49 U.S.C. 10707(c)(1) (A and B) are in 
paragraph (c) of this section. The requirements to keep account under 49 
U.S.C. 10707(c)(1)(C) cannot be applied to cancellation cases, and will 
not be considered.
    (c) Criteria. The Board will suspend and investigate if a protestant 
shows:
    (1) The cancellations of a through route and/or joint rate would 
eliminate effective railroad competition for the affected traffic 
between the origin and destination. Among other evidence, the Board will 
consider two rebuttable presumptions to show the elimination of 
effective railroad competition: (i) That the mileage between the origin 
and destination over the route to be canceled is not more than that of 
any feasible alternative rail route; and (ii) that the cost of operating 
via the route to be canceled is not more than that of any feasible 
alternative rail route; and
    (2) Either (i) a protesting shipper has used or would use the 
through route and/or joint rate proposed to be canceled to meet a 
significant portion of its current or future railroad transportation 
needs between the origin and destination; or

[[Page 182]]

    (ii) A protesting carrier has used or would use the affected through 
route and/or joint rate for a significant amount of traffic.


<R05>
Sec. 1144.4  Investigation of proposed cancellations.

    (a) General. The Board shall determine that a proposed cancellation 
of a through route and/or joint rate is contrary to the public interest 
under 49 U.S.C. 10705 if it finds that the cancellation, or a rate that 
would remain in place after the cancellation, is contrary to the 
competition policies of 49 U.S.C. 10101a or is otherwise 
anticompetitive.
    (b) Factors. In making its determination, the Board will take into 
account all relevant factors, including:
    (1) The revenues of the involved railroads on the affected traffic 
via the rail routes in question.
    (2) The efficiency of the rail routes in question, including the 
costs of operating via those routes.
    (3) The rates charged or sought to be charged by the canceling 
railroad or railroads.
    (4) The revenues, following the cancellation, of the involved 
railroads for the traffic in question via the affected through route; 
the costs of the involved railroads for that traffic via that route; the 
ratios of those revenues to those costs; and all circumstances relevant 
to any difference in those ratios; provided that the mere loss of 
revenue to an affected carrier will not be a basis for finding that a 
cancellation is anticompetitive.
    (c) Other considerations. (1) The Board will not consider product 
competition.
    (2) If a railroad wishes to rely in any way on geographic 
competition, it will have the burden of proving the existence of 
effective geographic competition by clear and convincing evidence.
    (3) Where a cancellation has been determined to be contrary to the 
competitive standards of this section, the overall revenue inadequacy of 
the canceling carrier will not excuse such a cancellation.
    (4) Any investigations of proposed cancellations under the terms of 
this paragraph will be conducted and concluded by the Board on an 
expedited basis.


<R05>
Sec. 1144.5  Prescription.

    (a) General. A through route or a through rate shall be prescribed 
under 49 U.S.C. 10705, or a switching arrangement shall be established 
under 49 U.S.C. 11103, if the Board determines:
    (1) That the prescription or establishment (i) is necessary to 
remedy or prevent an act that is contrary to the competition policies of 
49 U.S.C. 10101a or is otherwise anticompetitive, and (ii) otherwise 
satisfies the criteria of 49 U.S.C. 10705 and 11103, as appropriate. In 
making its determination, the Board shall take into account all relevant 
factors, including:
    (A) The revenues of the involved railroads on the affected traffic 
via the rail routes in question.
    (B) The efficiency of the rail routes in question, including the 
costs of operating via those routes.
    (C) The rates or compensation charged or sought to be charged by the 
railroad or railroads from which prescription or establishment is 
sought.
    (D) The revenues, following the prescription, of the involved 
railroads for the traffic in question via the affected route; the costs 
of the involved railroads for that traffic via that route; the ratios of 
those revenues to those costs; and all circumstances relevant to any 
difference in those ratios; provided that the mere loss of revenue to an 
affected carrier shall not be a basis for finding that a prescription or 
establishment is necessary to remedy or prevent an act contrary to the 
competitive standards of this section; and
    (2) That either:
    (i) The complaining shipper has used or would use the through route, 
through rate, or reciprocal switching to meet a significant portion of 
its current or future railroad transportation needs between the origin 
and destination; or
    (ii) The complaining carrier has used or would use the affected 
through route, through rate, or reciprocal switching for a significant 
amount of traffic.
    (b) Other considerations. (1) The Board will not consider product 
competition.
    (2) If a railroad wishes to rely in any way on geographic 
competition, it will

[[Page 183]]

have the burden of proving the existence of effective geographic 
competition by clear and convincing evidence.
    (3) When prescription of a through route, a through rate, or 
reciprocal switching is necessary to remedy or prevent an act contrary 
to the competitive standards of this section, the overall revenue 
inadequacy of the defendant railroad(s) will not be a basis for denying 
the prescription.
    (4) Any proceeding under the terms of this section will be conducted 
and concluded by the Board on an expedited basis.


<R05>
Sec. 1144.6  General.

    (a) These rules will govern the Board's adjudication of individual 
cases pending on or after the effective date of these rules (October 31, 
1985).
    (b) These rules supersede the rules at 49 CFR part 1132 to the 
extent they are inconsistent.
    (c) Discovery under these rules is governed by the Board's general 
rules of discovery at 49 CFR part 1114.
    (d) Any Board determinations or findings under this part with 
respect to compliance or non-compliance with the standards of 
Secs. 1144.4 and 1144.5 shall not be given any res judicata or 
collateral estoppel effect in any litigation involving the same facts or 
controversy arising under the antitrust laws of the United States.

              Subpart A--Applications Under 49 U.S.C. 10901


<R05>
Sec. 1150.1  Introduction.

    (a) When an application is required. This subpart governs 
applications under 49 U.S.C. 10901 for a certificate of public 
convenience and necessity authorizing the construction, acquisition or 
operation of railroad lines. Noncarriers require Board approval under 
section 10901 to construct, acquire or operate a rail line in interstate 
commerce. Existing carriers require approval under section 10901 only to 
construct a new rail line or operate a line owned by a noncarrier, since 
acquisition by a carrier of an active rail line owned by a carrier is 
covered by 49 U.S.C. 11343. We have exempted from these requirements the 
acquisition by a State entity of a rail line that has been approved for 
abandonment, as well as operations over these lines. See subpart C of 
this part. In addition, where appropriate, we have granted individual 
exemptions from these certification requirements. See 49 U.S.C. 10505.
    (b) Content of the application. Applications filed under this 
subpart shall include the information set forth in Secs. 1150.2 through 
1150.9. The applicant must also comply with the Energy and Environmental 
Regulations, at 49 CFR parts 1106 and 1105 (including consulting with 
the Board's Energy and Environmental Branch at least 6 months prior to 
filing an application, to begin the scoping process to identify 
environmental issues and outline procedures for analysis of this aspect 
of the proposal).

    (a) Waivers. Prior to filing an application, prospective applicants 
may seek an advance waiver, either on a permanent or temporary basis, of 
required information which is unavailable or not necessary or useful in 
analysis of the proposal. However, if the information is clearly not 
applicable to the individual proposal, a waiver is not necessary and 
need not be sought. A petition must specify the sections for which 
waiver or clarification is sought and the reasons why it should be 
granted. No replies will be permitted. Parties may, upon an appropriate 
showing, demonstrate their need to examine data which have previously 
been waived. In such circumstances, the Board only requires that it be 
produced under Sec. 1150.8 above.
    (b) Filing procedures. The original and 10 copies of the application

interested parties upon request. The application shall include a stamped 
self-addressed envelope to be used to notify applicant of the docket 
number. Additionally, if possible, telephonic communication of the 
docket number shall be made.
    (c) Signatures. The original of the application shall be signed by 
applicants (if a partnership, all general partners must sign; and if a 
corporation, association, or other similar form of organization, the 
signature should be that of the executive officer having knowledge of 
the matters and designated for that purpose). Applications shall be made 
under oath and shall contain an appropriate certification (if a 
corporation, by its secretary) showing that the affiant is duly 
authorized to verify and file the application. Any persons controlling 
an applicant shall also sign the application.
    (d) Related applications. Applicant shall file concurrently all

application.
    (e) Service. As soon as the docket number is obtained the applicant 
shall serve a conformed copy of the application by first-class mail upon 
the Governor (or Executive Officer), Public Service Board, and 
Department of Transportation of each State in which any part of the 
properties involved in the proposed transaction is located. Within 2 
weeks of filing, applicant shall submit to the Board a copy of the 
certificate of service indicating that all persons so designated have 
been served a copy of the application.
    (f) Publication. Within 2 weeks of filing, applicant shall have 
published the summary of the application (prepared under Sec. 1150.9) in 
a newspaper of general circulation in each county in which the line is 
located. The notice should inform interested parties of the date by 
which they must advise the Board of their interest in the proceeding. 
This date shall be calculated as the 35th day after the filing of the 
application which is neither a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday in the 
District of Columbia. Applicant must file an affidavit of publication 
immediately after the publication has been completed. The Board will, as 
soon as practicable, either publish the notice summary in the Federal 
Register or reject the application if it is incomplete.
    (g) Public participation. Written comments (with 10 copies) must be 
filed within 35 days of the filing of the application. Comments must 
contain the basis for the party's position either in support or 
opposition. Applicant must be served with a copy of each comment. On the

Branch, the Board will decide if a hearing is necessary. A hearing may 
be either oral or through receipt of

[[Page 187]]

written statements (modified procedure). (See 49 CFR 1112.1 et seq.) If 
there is no opposition to the application, additional evidence normally 
need not be filed, and a decision will be reached using the information 
in the application.
    (h) Replies to written comments. Applicant's replies will be 
considered by the Board provided they are filed and served within 5 days 
of the due date of the pleadings they address.

<R04>
                     Subpart B--Designated Operators


<R05>
Sec. 1150.11  Introduction.

    A certificate of designated operator will be issued to an operator 
providing service pursuant to a rail service continuation agreement 
under section 304 of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, as 
amended by the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 
1976. The designated operator (D-OP) may commence and terminate the 
service in accordance with the terms of the agreement. When service is 
terminated the D-OP must notify all shippers on the line. To obtain a D-
OP certificate, the information in this subpart must be filed with the 
Board. A copy of the certificate of designated operator shall be served 
on the Association of American Railroads.


<R05>
Sec. 1150.12  Information about the designated operator.

    (a) The name and address of the D-OP.
    (b) If a new corporation or other new business entity, a copy of the 
certificate of incorporation or, if unincorporated, the facts and 
official organizational documents relating to the business entity.
    (c) The names and addresses of all officers and directors, with a 
statement from each which indicates present affiliation, if any, with a 
railroad.
    (d) Sufficient information to establish its financial responsibility 
for the proposed undertaking, unless the D-OP is a common carrier by 
railroad. The nature and extent of all liability insurance coverage, 
including insurance binder or policy number, and name of insurer.


<R05>
Sec. 1150.13  Relevant dates.

    The exact dates of the period of operation which have been agreed 
upon by the D-OP, the offeror of the rail service continuation payment, 
and the owner of the line to be operated, in their lease and operating 
agreements.


<R05>
Sec. 1150.14  Proposed service.

    (a) A copy of all agreements between the D-OP, the offeror of the 
rail service continuation payment, and the owner of the line to be 
operated.
    (b) Any additional information which is necessary to provide the 
Board with a description of:
    (1) The line over which service is to be provided (e.g., U.S.R.A. 
Line); and
    (2) All interline connections, including the names of the connecting 
railroads.


<R05>
Sec. 1150.15  Information about offeror.

    (a) The name and address of the offeror of the rail service 
continuation payment.
    (b) Sufficient information to establish the financial responsibility 
of the offeror for the proposed undertaking, or if the offeror is a 
State or municipal corporation or authority, a statement that it has 
authority to perform the service or enter into the agreement for 
subsidy.


<R05>
Sec. 1150.16  Procedures.

    Upon receipt of this information, the matter will be docketed by the 
prefix initials ``D-OP.'' Operators may begin operating immediately upon 
the filing of the necessary information (plus three copies). Although 
the designated operator will not be required to seek and obtain 
authority from the Board either to commence or to terminate operations, 
the designated operator is a common carrier by railroad subject to all 
other applicable provisions of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle IV. However, we have 
exempted designated operators from some aspects of regulation. See 
``Exempting of Certain Designated Operators from section 11343, 361 STB 
379 (1979), as modified by No. 79-2457, John W. McGinness, Brotherhood 
of Locomotive Engineers and Railway Labor

[[Page 188]]

Executives' Association v. Surface Transportation Board and United 
States of America.'' (U.S.C.A. D.C. Cir., decided August 17, 1981).


<R04>
   Subpart C--Modified Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity


<R05>
Sec. 1150.21  Scope of rules.

    These special rules apply to operations over abandoned rail lines, 
which have been acquired (through purchase or lease) by a State. The 
rail line must have fully abandoned, or approved for abandonment by the 
Board or a bankruptcy court. As used in these rules, the term ``State'' 
includes States, political subdivisions of States, and all 
instrumentalities through which the State can act. An operator has the 
option of applying for a modified certificate of public convenience and 
necessity under this subpart or a common carrier certificate under 
Subpart A of this part. A copy of the modified certificate shall be 
served on the Association of American Railroads.


<R05>
Sec. 1150.22  Exemptions and common carrier status.

    The acquisition by a State of a fully abandoned line is not subject 
to the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board. The acquisition 
by a State of a line approved for abandonment and not yet fully 
abandoned is exempted from the Board's jurisdiction. If the State 
intends to operate the line itself, it will be considered a common 
carrier. However, when a State acquires a rail line described under 
Sec. 1150.21 and contracts with an operator to provide service over the 
line, only the operator incurs a common carrier obligation. The 
operators of these lines are exempted from 49 U.S.C. 10901 and 10903 
which are the statutory requirements governing the start up and 
termination of operations. Operators exempted from these requirements 
must comply with the requirements of this part and must apply for a 
modified certificate of public convenience and necessity. The operator 
is a common carrier and incurs all benefits and responsibilities under 
49 U.S.C. subtitle IV; however, the State through its operational 
agreement or the operator of the line may determine certain 
preconditions, such as payment of a subsidy, which must be met by 
shippers to obtain service over the line. The operator must notify the 
shippers on the line of any preconditions. The modified certificate will 
authorize service to shippers who meet these preconditions and the 
operator will be required to provide complete common carrier service 
under this certificate only to those shippers. (See 363 ICC 132.)


<R05>
Sec. 1150.23  Modified certificate of public convenience and necessity.

    (a) The operator must file a notice with the Board for a modified 
certificate of public convenience and necessity. Operations may commence 
immediately upon the filing; however, the Board will review the 
information filed, and if complete, will issue a modified certificate 
notice.
    (b) A notice for a modified certificate of public convenience and 
necessity shall include the following information:
    (1) The name and address of the operator and, unless the operator is 
an existing rail carrier:
    (i) Its articles of incorporation or, if it is unincorporated, the 
facts and organizational documents relating to its formation;
    (ii) The names and addresses of all of its officers and directors 
and a statement indicating any present affiliation each may have with a 
rail carrier; and
    (iii) Sufficient information to establish the financial 
responsibility of the operator.
    (2) Information about the prior abandonment, including docket 
number, status and date of the first decision approving the abandonment.
    (3) The exact dates of the period of operation which have been 
agreed upon by the operator and the State which owns the line (if there 
is any agreement, it should be provided);
    (4) A description of the service to be performed including, where 
applicable, a description of:
    (i) The line over which service is to be performed;
    (ii) All interline connections including the names of the connecting 
railroads;

[[Page 189]]

    (iii) The nature and extent of all liability insurance coverage, 
including binder or policy number and name of insurer; and
    (iv) Any preconditions which shippers must meet to receive service.
    (5) The name and address of any subsidizers, and
    (6) Sufficient information to establish the financial responsibility 
of any subsidizers (if the subsidizer is a State, the information should 
show that it has authority to enter into the agreement for subsidized 
operations).
    (c) The service offered and the applicable rates, charges, and 
conditions must be described in tariffs published by the operator to the 
Board's rules.


<R05>
Sec. 1150.24  Termination of service.

    The duration of the service may be determined in the contract 
between the State and the operator. An operator may not terminate 
service over a line unless it first provides 60 days' notice of its 
intent to terminate the service. The notice of intent must be:
    (a) Filed with the State and the Board, and
    (b) Mailed to all persons that have used the line within the 6 
months preceding the date of the notice.

          Subpart D--Exempt Transactions Under 49 U.S.C. 10901

    Source:  51 FR 2504, Jan. 17, 1986, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1150.31  Scope of exemption.

    (a) Except as indicated below, this exemption applies to all 
acquisitions and operations under section 10901 (See 1150.1, supra). 
This exemption also includes:
    (1) Acquisition by a noncarrier of rail property that would be 
operated by a third party;
    (2) Operation by a new carrier of rail property acquired by a third 
party;
    (3) A change in operators on the line; and
    (4) Acquisition of incidental trackage rights. Incidental trackage 
rights include the grant of trackage rights by the seller, or the 
assignment of trackage rights to operate over the line of a third party 
that occur at the time of the exempt acquisition or operation. This 
exemption does not apply when a class I railroad abandons a line and 
another class I railroad then acquires the line in a proposal that would 
result in a major market extension as defined at Sec. 1180.3(c).
    (b) Other exemptions that may be relevant to a proposal under this 
subpart are the exemption for control at Sec. 1180.2(d)(1) and (2), and 
the from securities regulation at 49 CFR part 1175.


<R05>
Sec. 1150.32  Procedures and relevant dates--transactions that involve creation of Class III carriers.

    (a) To qualify for this exemption, applicant must file a verified 
notice providing details about the transaction, and a brief caption 
summary, conforming to the format in Sec. 1150.34, for publication in 
the Federal Register.
    (b) The exemption will be effective 7 days after the notice is 
filed. The Board, through the Director of the Office of Proceedings, 
will publish a notice in the Federal Register within 30 days of the 
filing. A change in operators would follow the provisions at 
Sec. 1150.34, and notice must be given to shippers.
    (c) If the notice contains false or misleading information, the 
exemption is void ab initio. A petition to revoke under 49 U.S.C. 
10505(d) does not automatically stay the exemption.
    (d) Applicant must preserve intact all sites and structures more 
than 50 years old until compliance with the requirements of Section 106 
of the National Historic Preservation Act, 16 U.S.C. 470 is achieved.
    (e) If the projected annual revenue of the carrier to be created by 
a transaction under this exemption exceeds $5 million, applicant must, 
at least 60 days before the exemption becomes effective, post a notice 
of intent to undertake the proposed transaction at the workplace of the 
employees on the affected line(s) and serve a copy of the notice on the 
national offices of the labor unions with employees on the affected 
line(s), setting forth the types and numbers of jobs expected to be 
available, the terms of employment and principles of employee selection, 
and the lines that are to be transferred,

[[Page 190]]

and certify to the Board that it has done so.

Sec. 1150.33  Information to be contained in notice--transactions that involve creation of Class III carriers.

    (a) The full name and address of the applicant;
    (b) The name, address, and telephone number of the representative of 
the applicant who should receive correspondence;
    (c) A statement that an agreement has been reached or details about 
when an agreement will be reached;
    (d) The operator of the property;
    (e) A brief summary of the proposed transaction, including:
    (1) The name and address of the railroad transferring the subject 
property,

Sec. 1150.36  Exempt construction of connecting track.

    (a) Scope. This class exemption applies to proceedings involving the 
construction and operation of connecting lines of railroad within 
existing rail rights-of-way, or on land owned by connecting railroads, 
under 49 U.S.C. 10901 (a), (b), and (c). (See the reference to 
connecting track in 49 CFR 1105.6(b)(1).) This class exemption is 
designed to expedite and facilitate connecting track construction while 
ensuring full and timely environmental review. The Surface 
Transportation Board (Board) has found that its prior review of 
connecting track construction and operation is not necessary to carry 
out the rail transportation policy of 49 U.S.C. 10101; that continued 
regulation is not necessary to protect shippers from abuse of market 
power; and that the construction of connecting track would be of limited 
scope. See 49 U.S.C. 10502. To use this class exemption, a pre-filing 
notice, environmental report, historic report, and notice of exemption 
must be filed that complies with the procedures in Sec. 1150.36 (b) and 
(c), and the Board's environmental rules, codified at 49 CFR part 1105.
    (b) Environmental requirements. The environmental regulations at 49 
CFR part 1105 must be complied with fully. An environmental report 
containing the information specified at 49 CFR 1105.7(e), as well as an 
historic report containing the information specified at 49 CFR 
1105.8(d), must be filed either before or at the same time as the notice 
of exemption is filed. See 49 CFR 1105.7(a). The entity seeking the 
exemption authority must also serve copies of the environmental report 
on the agencies listed at 49 CFR 1105.7(b). Because the environmental 
report must include a certification that appropriate agencies have been 
consulted in its preparation (see 49 CFR 1105.7(c)), parties should 
begin environmental and historic consultations well before the notice of 
exemption is filed. Environmental requirements may be waived or modified 
where a petitioner demonstrates in writing that such action is 
appropriate. See 49 CFR 1105.10(c). It is to the advantage of parties to 
consult with the Board's Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) at the 
earliest possible date to begin environmental review.
    (c) Procedures and dates. (1) At least 20 days prior to the filing 
of a notice of exemption with the Board, the party

[[Page 192]]

seeking the exemption authority must notify in writing: the State Public 
Service Board, the State Department of Transportation (or equivalent 
agency), and the State Clearinghouse (if there is no clearinghouse, the 
State Environmental Protection Agency), of each State involved. The pre-
filing notice shall include: the name and address of the railroad (or 
other entity proposing to construct the line) and the proposed operator; 
a complete description of the proposed construction and operation, 
including a map; an indication that the class exemption procedure is 
being used; and the approximate date that construction is proposed to 
begin. This pre-filing notice shall include a certification that the 
petitioner will comply with the Board's environmental regulations, 
codified at 49 CFR part 1105, and a statement that those regulations 
generally require the Board to:
    (i) Prepare an environmental assessment (EA) (or environmental 
impact statement (EIS) if necessary),
    (ii) Make the document (EA or EIS, as appropriate) available to the 
parties (and to the public, upon request to SEA); and
    (iii) Accept for filing and consideration comments on the 
environmental document as well as petitions for stay and 
reconsideration.
    (2) Petitioner must file a verified notice of exemption with the 
Board at least 90 days before the construction is proposed to begin. In 
addition to the information contained in Sec. 1150.36(c)(1), the notice 
shall include a statement certifying compliance with the environmental 
rules at 49 CFR part 1105 and the pre-filing notice requirements of 49 
CFR 1150.36(c)(1).
    (3) The Board, through the Director of the Office of Proceedings, 
shall publish a notice in the Federal Register within 20 days after the 
notice of exemption is received that describes the construction project 
and invites comments. SEA will then prepare an EA (or, if necessary, an 
EIS). The EA generally will be made available 15 days after the Federal 
Register notice. It will be served on all parties and appropriate 
agencies. Others may request a copy from SEA. The deadline for 
submission of comments on the EA will generally be within 30 days of its 
availability (see 49 CFR 1105.10(b)). If an EIS is prepared, the time 
frames and procedures set forth in 49 CFR 1105.10(a) generally will 
apply.
    (4) The Board's environmental document (together with any comments 
and SEA's recommendations) shall be used in deciding whether to allow 
the particular construction project to proceed under the class exemption 
and whether to impose appropriate mitigating conditions upon its use 
(including use of an environmentally preferable route). If the Board 
concludes that a particular project will result in serious adverse 
environmental consequences that cannot be adequately mitigated, it may 
deny authority to proceed with the construction under the class 
exemption (the ``no-build'' alternative). Persons believing that they 
can show that the need for a particular line outweighs the adverse 
environmental consequences can file an application for approval of the 
proposed construction under 49 U.S.C. 10901.
    (5) No construction may begin until the Board has completed its 
environmental review and issued a final decision.
    (6) Petitions to stay the effective date of the notice of exemption 
on other than environmental and/or historic preservation grounds must be 
filed within 10 days of the Federal Register publication. Petitions to 
stay the effective date of the notice on environmental and/or historic 
preservation grounds may be filed at any time but must be filed 
sufficiently in advance of the effective date to allow the Board to 
consider and act on the petition before the notice becomes effective. 
Petitions for reconsideration must be filed within 20 days of the 
Federal Register publication.
    (7) The exemption generally will be effective 70 days after 
publication in the Federal Register, unless stayed. If the notice of 
exemption contains false or misleading information, the exemption is 
void ab initio and the Board shall summarily reject the exemption 
notice.
    (8) Where significant environmental issues have been raised or 
discovered during the environmental review process, the Board shall 
issue, on or before

[[Page 193]]

the effective date of the exemption, a final decision allowing the 
exemption to become effective and imposing appropriate mitigating 
conditions or taking other appropriate action such as selecting the ``no 
build'' alternative.
    (9) Where there has been full environmental review and no 
significant environmental issues have been raised or discovered, the 
Board, through the Director of the Office of Proceedings, shall issue, 
on or before the effective date of the exemption, a final decision 
consisting of a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) to show that 
the environmental record has been considered (see 49 CFR 1105.10(g)).
    (10) The Board, on its own motion or at the request of a party to 
the case, will stay the effective date of individual notices of 
exemption when an informed decision on environmental issues cannot be 
made prior to the date that the exemption authority would otherwise 
become effective. Stays will be granted initially for a period of 60 
days to permit resolution of environmental issues and issuance of a 
final decision. The Board expects that this 60-day period will usually 
be sufficient for these purposes unless preparation of an EIS is 
required. If, however, environmental issues remain unresolved upon 
expiration of this 60-day period, the Board, upon its own motion, or at 
the request of a party to the case, will extend the stay, as necessary 
to permit completion of environmental review and issuance of a final 
decision. The Board's order will specify the duration of each extension 
of the initial stay period. In cases requiring the preparation of an 
EIS, the Board will extend the stay for a period sufficient to permit 
compliance with the procedural guidelines established by the Board's 
environmental regulations.
    (d) Third-Party Consultants. An environmental and historic report 
required under 49 CFR 1105.7 and 1105.8 will not be required where a 
petitioner engages a third-party consultant who is approved by SEA and 
acts under SEA's direction and supervision in preparing the EA or EIS. 
In such a case, the third-party consultant must act on behalf of the 
Board, working under SEA's direction to collect the environmental 
information that is needed and to compile it into a draft EA or EIS, 
which is prepared under SEA's direction and then submitted to SEA for 
its final review and approval. See 49 CFR 1105.10(d).

Sec. 1151.1  Scope.

    This part governs applications filed under 49 U.S.C. 10910. The 
Board can require the sale of a rail line to a financially responsible 
person. A rail line is eligible for a forced sale if it appears in 
category 1 or 2 of the owning railroad's system diagram map (but the 
railroad has not filed an application to abandon the line), or the 
public convenience and necessity, as defined in 49 U.S.C. 10910(c)(1), 
permit or require the sale of the line.

Sec. 1151.2  Procedures.

    (a) Service. When an application is filed, applicant must 
concurrently

[[Page 196]]

serve a copy of the application by first class mail on:
    (1) The owning railroad;
    (2) All rail patrons who originated and/or received traffic on the 
line during the 12-month period preceding the month in which the 
application is filed;
    (3) The designated State agency in the State(s) where the property 
is located;
    (4) County governments where the line is located;
    (5) The National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) (if Amtrak 
operates on the line);
    (6) And the national offices of rail unions with employees on the 
line.
    (b) Acceptance or rejection of an application.
    (1) The Board, through the Director of the Office of Proceedings, 
will accept a complete application no later than 30 days after the 
application is filed by publishing a notice in the Federal Register. An 
application is complete if it has been properly served and contains 
substantially all information required by Sec. 1151.3, except as 
modified by advance waiver. The notice will also announce the schedule 
for filing of competing applications and responses.
    (2) The Board, through the Director of the Office of Proceedings, 
will reject an incomplete application by serving a decision no later 
than 30 days after the application is filed. The decision will explain 
specifically why the application was incomplete. A revised application 
may be submitted, incorporating portions of the prior application by 
reference.
    (c) Competing applications.
    (1) Unless otherwise scheduled in the notice, competing applications 
by other parties seeking to acquire all or any portion of the line 
sought in the initial application are due within 30 days after the 
initial application is accepted.
    (2) The Board, through the Director of the Office of Proceedings, 
will issue a decision accepting or rejecting a competing application no 
later than 15 days after it is filed. A competing application will be 
rejected if it does not substantially contain the information required 
by Sec. 1151.3, except as modified by advance waiver.
    (d) Incomplete applications.
    (1) If an applicant seeking to file an initial or competing 
application is unable to obtain required information that is primarily 
or exclusively within the personal knowledge of the owning carrier, the 
applicant may file an incomplete application if it files at the same 
time a request for discovery under 49 CFR part 1114 to obtain the needed 
information from the owning carrier.
    (2) The Board, through the Director of the Office of Proceedings, 
will by decision conditionally accept incomplete initial or competing 
applications, if the Director determines that the discovery sought is 
necessary for the application and primarily or exclusively within the 
knowledge of the owning carrier.
    (3) When the information sought through discovery has been filed for 
an initial application, Federal Register notice under paragraph (b) of 
this section will be published.
    (4) When the information sought through discovery has been filed for 
a competing application, a decision will be issued under paragraph (c) 
of this section.
    (e) Comments. Unless otherwise scheduled in the notice, verified 
statements and comments addressing both the initial and competing 
applications must be filed within 60 days after the initial application 
is accepted.
    (f) Replies. Unless otherwise scheduled in the notice, verified 
replies by applicants and other interested parties must be filed within 
80 days after the initial application is accepted.
    (g) Publication. If the Board finds that the public convenience and 
necessity require or permit sale of the line, the Board shall 
concurrently publish this finding in the Federal Register.
    (h) Acceptance or rejection. If the Board concludes that sale of the

make the necessary efforts to provide adequate service to shippers who 
transport traffic over the line;
    (B) The tranportation over the line is inadequate for the majority 
of shippers who transport traffic over the line;
    (C) The sale of the line will not have a significantly adverse 
financial effect on the rail carrier operating the line;
    (D) The sale of the line will not have an adverse effect on the 
overall operational performance of the rail carrier operating the line; 
and
    (E) The sale of the line will be likely to result in improved 
railroad transportation for shippers who transport traffic over the 
line.
    (ii) If the applicant seeks a finding that the line is currently in 
category 1 or 2 of the owning carrier's system diagram map, the relevant 
portion of the current map must be attached to the application.
    (12) A statement detailing applicant's election of exemption from 
the provisions of Title 49, United States Code, and a statement that if 
the application is approved, no further exemptions will be elected.

traffic. A statement shall be included that the applicant agrees to have 
its train and crew personnel take the operating rules examination of the 
railroad over which the operating rights are exercised.
    (14) If applicant requests Board prescribed joint rates and 
divisions in the feeder line proceeding, a description of any joint rate 
and division agreement that must be established. The description must 
contain the following information:
    (i) The railroad(s) involved;
    (ii) The estimated revenues that will result from the division(s);
    (iii) The total costs of operating the line segment purchased 
(including any trackage rights fees).
    (iv) Information sufficient to allow the Board to determine that the 
line sought to be acquired carried less than 3 million gross ton-miles 
of traffic per mile in the preceding calendar year \1\; and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Gross ton-miles are calculated by adding the ton-miles of the 
cargo and the ton-miles related to the tare (empty) weight of the 
freight cars used to transport the cargo in the loaded movement. In 
calculating the gross ton-miles, only those related to the portion of 
the segment purchased shall be included.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (v) Any other pertinent information.
    (15) The extent to which the owning railroad's employees who

<R05>
Sec. 1151.4  Board determination.

    (a) The Board shall determine whether each applicant is a 
financially responsible person. To be a financially responsible person, 
the Board must find that:
    (1) The applicant is capable of paying the constitutional minimum 
value of the line and able to assure that adequate transportation will 
be provided over the line for at least 3 years;
    (2) The applicant is not a class I or class II railroad or an entity 
affiliated with a class I or class II railroad.

[[Page 199]]

    (b) If the Board finds that one or more applicants are financially 
responsible parties, it shall determine whether the involved line or 
line segment is a qualified line. A line is a qualified line if:
    (1) Either
    (i) The public convenience and necessity require or permit the sale 
of line or line segment; or
    (ii) The line or line segment is classified in category 1 or 2 of 
the owning carrier's system diagram map; and
    (2) The traffic level on the line or line segment sought to be 
acquired was less than 3 million gross ton-miles of traffic per mile in 
the preceding calendar year (Note: This finding will not be required for 
applications filed after October 1, 1983).
    (c) If the Board finds that one or more financially responsible 
parties have offered to buy a qualifying line of railroad, the Board 
shall set the acquisition cost of the line at the higher of NLV or GCV, 
order the owning carrier to sell the rail line to one of the financially 
responsible applicants, and resolve any related issues raised in the 
application. If an applicant and the owning railroad agree on an 
acquisition price, that price shall be the final price.
    (d) If trackage rights are sought in the application, the Board 
shall, based on the evidence of record, set the adequate compensation 
for such rights, if the parties have not agreed.
    (e) If the applicant requests the Board to set joint rates or 
divisions and the line carried less than 3 million gross ton-miles of 
traffic per mile during the preceding calendar year, the Board shall, 
pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 10705(a), establish joint rates and divisions 
based on the evidence of record in the proceeding. Unless specifically 
requested to do so by the selling carrier, the Board will not set the 
rate for the selling railroad's share of the joint rate at less than the 
applicable level (for the year in which the acquisition is made) set by 
49 U.S.C. 10709(d)(2), which limits Board maximum ratemaking 
jurisdiction to rates above certain cost/price ratios.

    (C) If protestant's interest is limited to the retention of service 
over a portion of the line, a description of the portion of the line 
subject to protestant's interest (with milepost designations if 
available) and evidence showing that the applicant can operate the 
portion of the line profitably, including an appropriate return on its 
investment for those operations.
    (iii) Specific reasons why protestant opposes the application 
including information regarding protestant's reliance on the involved 
service (this information must be supported by affidavits of persons 
with personal knowledge of the fact(s)).
    (iv) Any rebuttal of material submitted by applicant.
    (v) Any request for a public use condition under 49 U.S.C. 10905 
(Sec. 1152.28 of the Board's rules) and any request for a trail use 
condition under 16 U.S.C. 1247(d) (Sec. 1152.29 of the Board's rules).
    (2) Additional information. In addition to the information required 
in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a commenting party or protestant 
may provide a statement of position and a summary of evidence regarding:

    (3) Feeder line application for all or part of the line subject to 
the abandonment application. In addition to the information required in 
paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, a commenting party or

line involved in the abandonment or discontinuance application;
    (iii) The feeder line application was filed prior to the date the 
abandonment or discontinuance application was filed; and
    (iv) The feeder line application is pending before the Board.
    (b) Employee or employee representative participation. Employees or 
their representatives may file protests or comments to an application. 
However, because the Board will impose employee protective conditions 
under 49 U.S.C. 10903(b)(2) if an application is granted, employees and 
their representatives need not file comments or protests seeking this 
protection.
    (c) Filing and service of written comments, protests, along with 
evidence and argument, and replies. (1) Written comments and protests, 
as well as public use and trail use requests, shall be filed with the 
Board (the Secretary, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC

discontinuance application.
    (2) An original and 10 copies of each written comment or protest 
shall be filed with the Board.
    (3) A copy of each written comment or protest shall be served on 
applicant or its representative at the time of filing with the Board. If 
the applicant carrier is in bankruptcy, each comment or protest shall 
also be filed on the Bankruptcy Court. Each filing shall contain a 
certificate of service.
    (4) Replies or rebuttal to written comments and protests shall be 
filed and served by applicants no later than 60 days after the filing of 
the application. An original and 10 copies of such replies shall be

    (d) Time limits. (1) Pleadings, requests or other papers or 
documents (including any comments or protests and any appeal from a 
Board decision) required or permitted to be filed under this part must 
be received for filing at the Board's Offices at Washington, DC within 
the time limits, if any, for such filing. The date of receipt at the 
Board and not the date of deposit in the mail is determinative, 
provided, however,

[[Page 211]]

that if such document is mailed by certified, registered, or express 
mail, postmarked at least 3 days prior to the due date, it will be 
accepted as timely filed.
    (2) In computing any time period prescribed or allowed by this part, 
the day of the act, event, or default after which the designated period 
of time begins to run is not to be included.
    (3) Any filing under this part which falls due on a Saturday, 
Sunday, or a legal holiday in the District of Columbia, may be filed at 
the Board by the end of the next day which is neither a Saturday, 
Sunday, nor a holiday, except as indicated in paragraph (d)(4) of this 
section. A half holiday shall not be considered as a holiday.
    (4) Offers of financial assistance made pursuant to Sec. 1152.27(c) 
must be filed on or before their statutory or regulatory due date as 
computed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, regardless of whether that 
date is a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday in the District of 
Columbia.
    (5) The Board will reject any pleading filed after its due date 
unless good cause is shown why the pleading is filed late.
    (6) Oral hearings. (i) Any oral hearing request is due 10 days after 
the filing of the application. The Board, through the Director of the 
Office of Proceedings, will issue a decision on any oral hearing request 
within 15 days after the filing of the application. If the Board decides 
to hold an oral hearing, the oral hearing shall be for the primary 
purpose of cross examination of witnesses filing verified statements in 
the proceeding. Any direct testimony, other than applicant's rebuttal 
evidence, shall be received at the discretion of the hearing officer.
    (ii) In addition to that contained in the application, the 
submission of written evidence prior to the commencement of the hearing 
shall be established by the Board.
    (iii) Post hearing legal briefs shall be due 10 days after the close 
of the oral hearing, or at an earlier date if established at the hearing 
by the hearing officer.
    (e) Appellate procedures--(1) Scope of rule. Except as specifically 
indicated below, these appellate procedures are to be followed in 
abandonment and discontinuance proceedings in lieu of the general 
procedures at 49 CFR 1115. Appeals of initial decisions of the Director 
of the Office of Proceedings determining:
    (i) Whether offers of financial assistance satisfy the standard of 
49 U.S.C. 10904(d) for purposes of instituting negotiations or, in 
exemption proceedings, for purposes of partial revocation and 
instituting negotiations;
    (ii) Whether partially to revoke or to reopen abandonment exemptions 
authorized, respectively, under 49 U.S.C. 10502 and 49 CFR part 1152 
subpart F for the purpose of imposing public use conditions under the 
criteria in 49 CFR 1152.28 and/or conditions limiting salvage of the 
rail properties for environmental and historic preservation purposes; 
and
    (iii) The applicability and administration of the Trails Act [16 
U.S.C. 1247(d)] in abandonment proceedings under 49 U.S.C. 10903 (and 
abandonment exemption proceedings), issued pursuant to delegations of 
authority at 49 CFR 1011.8(c) (4) and (5), will be acted on by the 
entire Board as set forth at 49 CFR 1011.2(a)(7). An original and 10 
copies of all appeals, and replies to appeals, under this section must 
be filed with the Board.
    (2) Appeals criteria. Appeals to the Board's decision in abandonment 
or discontinuance proceedings will not be entertained. Those decisions 
are administratively final upon the date they are served.
    (i) Parties seeking further administrative action may file a 
petition to reopen the proceeding under paragraph (e)(4) of this 
section. If an abandonment or discontinuance is granted and a party 
wishes the Board to have the opportunity to consider a petition to 
reopen before the abandonment or discontinuance authorization becomes 
effective, it must file its petition within 15 days after the 
administratively final decision is served together with a request for a 
stay of effectiveness under paragraph (e)(7) of this section. If such a 
petition to reopen and stay request is received within that 15-day 
period, any replies to the petition to reopen must be filed no later 
than 25 days after the date the decision is served, and any reply to the 
stay request must reach

[[Page 212]]

the Board no later than 5 days after the stay request is filed.
    (ii) The Board will grant a petition to reopen only upon a showing 
that the action would be affected materially because of new evidence, 
changed circumstances, or material error.
    (3) Form. A petition to reopen and any reply shall not exceed 30 
pages in length, including the index of subject matter, argument, and 
appendices or other attachments.
    (4) Petitions to reopen administratively final actions. A person may 
file a petition to reopen any administratively final action of the 
Board. A petition to reopen shall state in detail the respects in which 
the proceeding involves material error, new evidence, or substantially 
changed circumstances. An original and 10 copies of such petitions must 
be filed with the Board.
    (5) Judicial review. (i) Parties may seek judicial review of a Board 
action in an abandonment or discontinuance proceeding on the day the 
action of the Board becomes final.
    (ii) If a petition seeking reopening is filed under this section, 
before or after a petition seeking judicial review is filed with the 
courts, the Board will act upon the petition after advising the court of 
its pendency unless action might interfere with the court's 
jurisdiction.
    (6) Petitions to vacate. In the event of procedural defects (such as 
the loss of a properly filed protest, the failure of the applicant to 
afford the public the requisite notice of its proposed abandonment, 
etc.), the Board will entertain petitions to vacate the abandonment or 
discontinuance authorization. An original and 10 copies of these 
petitions to vacate must be filed with the Board.
    (7) Petitions to stay. (i) The filing of a petition to reopen shall 
not stay the effect of a prior action. An original and 10 copies of any 
petitions to stay must be filed with the Board.
    (ii) A petition to reopen an administratively final action may be 
accompanied by a petition for a stay of the effectiveness of the 
abandonment or discontinuance. As provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section, a petition to reopen must be accompanied by a stay request if 
the party wishes the Board to have the opportunity to consider the 
petition to reopen before the abandonment or discontinuance 
authorization becomes final.
    (iii) A party may petition for a stay of the effectiveness of 
abandonment or discontinuance authorization pending a request for 
judicial review. The reasons for the desired relief shall be stated in 
the petition, and the petition shall be filed not less than 15 days 
prior to the effective date of the abandonment authorization. No reply 
need be filed. If a party elects to file a reply, the reply must reach 
the Board no later than 5 days after the petition is filed.

Sec. 1152.26   Board determination under 49 U.S.C. 10903.

    (a) The following schedule shall govern the process for Board 
consideration and decisions in abandonment and discontinuance 
application proceedings from the time the application is filed until the 
time of the Board's decision on the merits:

Day 0--Application filed, including applicant's case in chief.
Day 10--Due date for oral hearing requests.
Day 15--Due date for Board decision on oral hearing requests.
Day 20--Due date for Notice of Application to be published in the 
    Federal Register.
Day 45--Due date for protests and comments, including opposition case in 
    chief, and for public use and trail use requests.
Day 60--Due date for applicant's reply to opposition case and for 
    applicant's response to trail use requests.
Day 110--Due date for service of decision on the merits.
Day 120--Due date for offers of financial assistance, except that if an 
    application has been granted by decision issued sooner than Day 110, 
    the offer of financial assistance shall be due 10 days after service 
    of the decision granting the application.

    (b) If an application for abandonment or discontinuance is filed by 
a bankrupt railroad, the Board shall base its decision (Report to the 
Bankruptcy Court) on the application and any responses to the 
application that are filed. In each such instance, the Board

[[Page 213]]

shall establish a reasonable period of time for filing responses to the 
application so that public input can be included in the Board's decision 
(Report) and so that the Board will be able to meet a deadline imposed 
or requested by the Bankruptcy Court. Because Board action on 
abandonment applications by bankrupt railroads is advisory only, no 
environmental filings or analysis is necessary. See 49 CFR 1105.5(c).
[61 FR 67883, Dec. 24, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 34670, June 27, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 1152.27   Financial assistance procedures.

    (a) Provision of information. An applicant must provide promptly 
upon request to a party considering an offer of financial assistance to 
continue existing rail service, and concurrently to the Board, the 
following:
    (1)(i) In an application or petition for exemption proceeding, an 
estimate of the annual subsidy and minimum purchase price required to 
keep the line or a portion of the line in operation;
    (ii) In a class exemption proceeding, either an estimate of the 
annual subsidy or the minimum purchase price, depending upon the type of 
financial assistance indicated in the potential offeror's formal 
expression of intent submitted under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this 
section;
    (2) Its most recent reports on the physical condition of the 
involved line; and
    (3) Traffic, revenue, and other data necessary to determine the 
amount of annual financial assistance that would be required to continue 
rail transportation over that part of the railroad line. In an exemption 
proceeding, the data to be provided must at a minimum include the 
carrier's estimate of the net liquidation value of the line, with 
supporting data reflecting available real estate appraisals, assessments 
of the quality and quantity of track materials in a line, and removal 
cost estimates (including the cost of transporting removed materials to 
point of sale or point of storage for relay use), and, if an offer of 
subsidy is contemplated, an estimate of the cost of rehabilitating the 
line to Federal Railroad Administration class 1 Safety Standards (49 CFR 
part 213).
    (b) Federal Register notice--(1) Abandonment and discontinuance 
applications. The Federal Register publication, which gives notice of 
the filing of the application 20 days after the application is filed, 
will serve as notice to persons intending to offer financial assistance 
to assure continued rail service under 49 U.S.C. 10904 and these 
regulations as they relate to abandonment and discontinuance 
applications. Offers of financial assistance will be due 120 days after 
the application is filed or 10 days after a decision granting the 
application is served, whichever occurs sooner.
    (2) Exemption proceedings. (i) If a petition for individual 
exemption from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 10903 is 
filed with the Board for abandonment or discontinuance of a line of 
railroad, the Board will publish notice of the petition in the Federal 
Register within 20 days of the filing of the petition. The Federal 
Register publication will serve as notice to persons with a potential 
interest in providing financial assistance to assure continued rail 
service on the line under 49 U.S.C. 10904 and these regulations as they 
relate to exempt abandonments and discontinuances. Offers of financial 
assistance will be due 120 days after the filing of the petition for 
exemption or 10 days after service of a Board decision granting the 
exemption, whichever occurs sooner.
    (ii) If a notice of exemption is filed under the class exemption, 
the Board will publish notice of the exemption in the Federal Register 
within 20 days of filing. The Federal Register publication will serve as 
notice to persons with a potential interest in providing financial 
assistance to assure continued rail service on the line under 49 U.S.C. 
10904 and these regulations as they relate to exempt abandonments and 
discontinuances. Offers of financial assistance will be due no later 
than 30 days after the date of the Federal Register publication giving 
notice of the exemption.
    (c) Submission of financial assistance offer--(1) Abandonment and 
discontinuance applications and petitions for exemption--(i) Service and 
filing. An

[[Page 214]]

offeror must serve its offer of assistance on the carrier owning and 
operating the line and all parties to the abandonment or discontinuance 
application or exemption proceeding. The offer must be filed 
concurrently with the Secretary, Surface Transportation Board, 
Washington, DC 20423.
    (A) An offer may be filed and served at any time after the filing of 
the abandonment or discontinuance application or petition for exemption. 
Once a decision is served granting an application or petition for 
exemption, however, the Board must be notified that an offer has 
previously been submitted.
    (B) An offer, or notification of a previously filed offer, must be 
filed and served no later than 10 days after service of the Board 
decision granting the application or petition for exemption. This filing 
and service is subject to the requirements of 49 CFR 1152.25 (d)(1), 
(d)(2), and (d)(4).
    (C) If, after a bona fide request, applicant or petitioner has 
failed to provide a potential offeror promptly with the information 
required under paragraph (a) of this section and if that information is 
not contained in the application or petition, the Board will entertain 
petitions to toll the 10-day period for submitting offers of financial 
assistance under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Petitions must be 
filed with the Board within 5 days after service of the decision 
granting the application or petition for exemption. Petitions should 
include copies of the prior written request for information or an 
accurate outline of the specific information that was orally requested. 
Replies to these petitions must be filed within 10 days after service of 
the decision granting the application or petition for exemption. These 
petitions and replies must be filed on or before their actual due date 
under 49 CFR 1152.25(d)(4). The Board will issue a decision on petitions 
within 15 days after service of the decision granting the application or 
petition for exemption.
    (ii) Contents of offer. The offeror shall set forth its offer in 
detail. The offer must:
    (A) Identify the line, or the portion of the line, in question;
    (B) Demonstrate that the offeror is financially responsible; that 
is, that it has or within a reasonable time will have the financial 
resources to fulfill proposed contractual obligations; governmental 
entities will be presumed to be financially responsible; and
    (C) Explain the disparity between the offeror's purchase price or 
subsidy if it is less than the carrier's estimate under paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section, and explain how the offer of subsidy or purchase is 
calculated.
    (2) Class exemption proceedings--(i) Expression of intent to file 
offer. Persons with a potential interest in providing financial 
assistance must, no later than 10 days after the Federal Register 
publication described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, submit to 
the carrier and the Board a formal expression of their intent to file an 
offer of financial assistance, indicating the type of financial 
assistance they wish to provide (i.e., subsidy or purchase). Such 
submissions are subject to the filing requirements of Sec. 1152.25(d)(1) 
through (d)(3). Submission of a formal expression of intent under this 
subsection will automatically stay the effective date of the notice of 
exemption under the class exemption for 40 days (normally, this will be 
10 days beyond the date stated in the Federal Register publication).
    (ii) Service and filing. An offeror must serve its offer of 
assistance on the carrier that instituted the exempt filing as well as 
all other parties to the proceeding. The offer must be filed 
concurrently with the Secretary, Surface Transportation Board, 
Washington, DC 20423.
    (A) An offer may be filed and served at any time after the filing of 
the notice of exemption. Once a notice of exemption is published in the 
Federal Register, however, the Board must be notified that an offer has 
previously been submitted.
    (B) An offer, or notification of a previously filed offer, must be 
filed and served no later than 30 days after the Federal Register 
publication described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. This 
filing and service is subject to the requirements of 49 CFR 1152.25 
(d)(1), (d)(2), and (d)(4).
    (C) If, after a bona fide request, applicant has failed to provide a 
potential offeror promptly with the information

[[Page 215]]

required under paragraph (a) of this section and if that information is 
not contained in the notice of exemption, the Board will entertain 
petitions to toll the 30-day period for submitting offers of financial 
assistance under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Petitions must be 
filed with the Board within 25 days after publication in the Federal 
Register (described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section). Petitions 
should include copies of the prior written request for information or an 
accurate outline of the specific information that was orally requested. 
Replies to these petitions must be filed within 30 days after the 
publication. These petitions and replies must be filed on or before 
their actual due date under 49 CFR 1152.25(d)(4). The Board will issue a 
decision on petitions to toll the offer period within 35 days after 
publication.
    (D) Upon receipt of a formal expression of intent to file an offer 
under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the rail carrier applicant 
may advise the Board and the potential offeror that additional time is 
needed to develop the information required under paragraph (a) of this 
section. Applicant shall expressly indicate the amount of time it 
considers necessary (not to exceed 60 days) to develop and submit the 
required information to the potential offeror. For the duration of the 
time period so indicated by the applicant, the 30-day period for 
submitting offers of financial assistance under paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section shall be tolled without formal Board action.
    (iii) Contents of offer. The offeror shall set forth its offer in 
detail. The offer must meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of 
this section.
    (d) Access to documents. Upon receipt by the carrier of a written 
comment under Sec. 1152.25 or a formal expression of intent under 
paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section indicating an intent to offer 
financial assistance, or upon receipt by the carrier of an offer of 
financial assistance, whichever occurs earlier, the carrier must make 
available to that party or offeror the records, accounts, appraisals, 
working papers, and other documents used in preparing Exhibit 1 
(Sec. 1152.36) or, if an exemption proceeding, those documents that 
would have been used in preparing Exhibit 1 had an abandonment or 
discontinuance application been filed, or other records, reports, and 
data in the possession of the carrier seeking the exemption that provide 
comparable data. These documents shall be made available during regular 
business hours at a time and place mutually agreeable to the parties.
    (e) Review of offers--(1) Abandonment and discontinuance 
applications. The Board will review each offer submitted to determine if 
a financially responsible person has offered assistance. If that 
criterion is met, the Board will issue a decision postponing the 
effective date of the authorization for abandonment or discontinuance. 
This decision will be issued within 15 days of the service of the 
decision granting the application (or within 5 days after the offer is 
filed if the time for filing has been tolled under paragraph 
(c)(1)(i)(C) of this section, or within 5 days after expiration of the 
120 day (4 month) period described in 49 U.S.C. 10904, if that occurs 
first). Under the delegation of authority at Sec. 1011.8, the Director 
of the Office of Proceedings will make the initial determination whether 
offers of financial assistance satisfy the standards of 49 U.S.C. 
10904(d) for purposes of instituting negotiations. Appeals of initial 
decisions determining whether offers of financial assistance satisfy the 
standards of 49 U.S.C. 10904(d) for purposes of instituting negotiations 
will be acted upon by the entire Board pursuant to 49 CFR 1011.2(a)(7).
    (2) Exemption proceedings. The Board will review each offer 
submitted to determine if a financially responsible person has offered 
assistance. If that criterion is met, the Board will postpone the 
effective date either of the decision granting a petition for individual 
exemption or the notice of exemption under the class exemption and 
partially revoke the exemption or (in the case of a class exemption) the 
notice of exemption to the extent it applies to 49 U.S.C. 10904. The 
decision to postpone and partially revoke will be issued within 15 days 
of the service date of a decision granting a petition for exemption, or 
within 35 days of the Federal Register publication described in 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section (or within 5 days after the offer

[[Page 216]]

is filed if the time for filing has been tolled under paragraph 
(c)(1)(i)(C) or (c)(2)(ii) (C) or (D) of this section). Under the 
delegation of authority at Sec. 1011.8, the Director of the Office of 
Proceedings will make the initial determination whether offers of 
financial assistance satisfy the standards of 49 U.S.C. 10904(d) for 
purposes of partial revocation and institution of negotiations. Appeals 
of initial decisions determining whether offers of financial assistance 
satisfy the standards of 49 U.S.C. 10904(d) for purposes of partial 
revocation and institution of negotiations will be acted upon by the 
entire Board pursuant to 49 CFR 1011.2(a)(7).
    (f) Agreement on financial assistance. (1) If the carrier and a 
person offering financial assistance enter into a subsidy agreement 
designed to provide for continued rail service, the Board will postpone 
the effective date of the abandonment or discontinuance. If a decision 
granting a petition for individual exemption, or a notice of exemption, 
has been issued, the Board will postpone the effective date of the 
decision or notice of exemption. The postponement will be for as long as 
the subsidy agreement is in effect.
    (2) If the carrier and a person offering to purchase a line enter 
into a purchase agreement which will result in continued rail service, 
the Board will approve the transaction and dismiss the application for 
abandonment or discontinuance, or the petition for exemption or notice 
of exemption. Board approval is not required under 49 U.S.C. 10901, 
10902, or 11323 for the parties to consummate the transaction or for the 
purchaser to institute service and operate as a railroad subject to 49 
U.S.C. 10501(a).
    (g) Failure to reach agreement on financial assistance. (1) If the 
carrier and a financially responsible person fail to agree on the amount 
or terms of subsidy or purchase, either party may request the Board to 
establish the conditions and amount of compensation. This request must 
be filed with the Board within 30 days after the offer is made and 
served concurrently by overnight mail on all parties to the proceeding. 
The request must be accompanied by the appropriate fee, codified at 49 
CFR 1002.2(f)(26). Replies will be due 5 days later.
    (2) If no agreement is reached within 30 days after the offer of 
purchase or subsidy is made, and no request is made to the Board to set 
the conditions and amount of compensation under paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section, the Board will serve a decision vacating the prior decision, 
which postponed the effective date of the decision granting the 
application, the decision granting the exemption, or the notice of 
exemption and, which, if applicable, partially revoked either the 
decision granting the exemption or (in the case of a class exemption) 
the notice of exemption. The Board will issue the decision to vacate 
within 10 days of the due date for requesting the Board to set the 
conditions and amount of compensation, and the Board will make the 
decision to vacate effective on its date of service.
    (h) Request to establish conditions and compensation for financial 
assistance. (1) If the Board is requested to establish conditions and 
compensation for financial assistance under paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section, the Board will issue a decision within 30 days after the 
request is due.
    (2) If the applicant receives multiple offers of financial 
assistance, requests to establish conditions and compensation will not 
be permitted before the applicant selects the offeror with whom it 
wishes to transact business. (See paragraph (l)(1) of this section.)
    (3) A party requesting the Board to establish conditions and 
compensation for financial assistance must, within the time period set 
forth in paragraph (h)(4) of this section, provide its case in chief, 
including reasons why its estimates are correct and the other 
negotiating party's estimates are incorrect, points of agreement and 
points of disagreement between the negotiating parties, and evidence 
substantiating these allegations. The offeror has the burden of proof as 
to all issues in dispute.
    (4) The offeror must submit all evidence and information supporting 
the terms it seeks within 30 days after the offer is made. The carrier's 
reply to this evidence and support for the terms it seeks are due within 
35 days after

[[Page 217]]

the offer is made. No rebuttal evidence will be permitted and evidence 
and information submitted after these dates will be rejected.
    (5) If requested, the Board will determine the amount and terms of 
subsidy based on the avoidable cost of providing continued rail 
transportation, plus a reasonable return on the value of the line. Under 
49 U.S.C. 10904(f)(4)(B), no subsidy arrangement approved under section 
10904 shall remain in effect for more than one year unless mutually 
agreed by the parties.
    (6) If requested, the Board will determine the price and other terms 
of sale. The Board will not set a price below the fair market value of 
the line (including, unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties, all 
facilities on the line or portion necessary to provide effective 
transportation services). Fair market value equals constitutional 
minimum value which is the greater of the net liquidation value of the 
line or the going concern value of the line. The constitutional minimum 
value is computed without regard to labor protection costs.
    (7) Within 10 days of the service date of the Board's decision, the 
offeror must accept or reject the Board's terms and conditions with a 
written notification to the Board and all parties to the proceeding. If 
the offeror accepts the terms and conditions set by the Board, the 
Board's decision is binding on both parties. If the offeror withdraws 
its offer or does not accept the terms and conditions set by the Board 
with a timely written notification, the Board will serve, within 20 days 
after the service date of the Board decision setting the terms and 
conditions, a decision vacating the prior decision, which postponed the 
effective date of either the decision granting the application or 
exemption or the notice of exemption, and which, if applicable, 
partially revoked the exemption or (in the case of a class exemption) 
the notice of exemption (unless other offers are being considered under 
paragraph (l) of this section). The decision to vacate will be effective 
on its date of service.
    (i) Substitution of purchasers and disposition after sale. (1) Prior 
to the consummation of a purchase under this section, an offeror may 
substitute its corporate affiliate as the purchaser under an agreement, 
provided the Board has determined either:
    (i) The original offeror has guaranteed the financial responsibility 
of its affiliate; or
    (ii) The affiliate has demonstrated financial responsibility in its 
own right.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(3) of this section, a 
purchaser under this section may not:
    (i) Transfer the line or discontinue service over the line prior to 
the end of the second year after consummation of the original sale under 
these provisions; or
    (ii) Transfer the line, except to the carrier from whom the line was 
purchased, prior to the end of the fifth year after consummation.
    (3) Paragraph (i)(2) of this section does not preclude a purchaser 
under this section from transferring the line to a corporate affiliate 
following the consummation of the original sale. Prior Board approval of 
the affiliate's acquisition and operation, however, is required under 49 
U.S.C. 10901, 10902, or 11323. A corporate affiliate acquiring a line 
under this section is prohibited from discontinuing service over the 
line or transferring the line to a party that is not a corporate 
affiliate during the time periods prescribed in paragraph (i)(2) of this 
section.
    (j) Discontinuance of subsidy. A subsidizer may discontinue a 
subsidy under this section by giving 60 days notice of the 
discontinuance to the applicant and all other parties to the proceeding. 
Unless another financially responsible party enters into a subsidy 
agreement as beneficial to the carrier as the discontinued subsidy 
agreement in a situation where the 1-year time limit of 49 U.S.C. 
10904(f)(4)(B) has not yet run, the carrier may by filing a request with 
the Board and serving the request on all parties to the abandonment or 
exemption proceeding obtain a decision vacating the decision postponing 
the effective date of either the decision granting the application, or 
petition for individual exemption, or the notice of exemption. The Board 
will issue a decision to vacate within 10 days after the filing and 
service of the

[[Page 218]]

request. This decision to vacate will be effective on its service date.
    (k) Default on agreement. If any party defaults on its obligations 
under a financial assistance agreement, any other party to the agreement 
may promptly inform the Board of that default. Upon notification, the 
Board will take appropriate action.
    (l) Multiple offers of financial assistance. (1) If an applicant 
receives more than one offer to purchase or subsidize the line from 
offerors found to be financially responsible, the applicant must select 
the offeror from those with whom it wishes to transact business. In 
abandonment and discontinuance application and petition for exemption 
proceedings within 25 days after service of the decision granting the 
application or petition for exemption, and in class exemption 
proceedings within 45 days after the Federal Register publication 
described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the railroad must:
    (i) File a written notification of its selection with the Board; and
    (ii) Serve a copy of the notification on all parties to the 
proceeding.
    (2)(i) Abandonment and discontinuance applications and petitions for 
exemption. If the applicant has received multiple offers of financial 
assistance from persons found to be financially responsible and has 
selected the offeror with whom it wishes to transact business, the 
negotiating parties shall complete the sale or subsidy agreement or 
request the Board to establish the conditions and amount of compensation 
within 40 days after the service date of the decision granting the 
application or petition for exemption. A request to the Board to set 
terms and conditions must be served concurrently on all parties to the 
proceeding. If no agreement on subsidy or sale is reached within the 40-
day period and the Board has not been requested to establish the 
conditions and amount of compensation, any other financially responsible 
offeror may request the Board to establish the conditions and amount of 
compensation. This request must be filed at the Board within 50 days of 
the service date of the decision granting the application or petition 
for exemption and served concurrently on all parties to the proceeding. 
If no other request is filed, the Board will issue a decision 
authorizing abandonment or discontinuance within 60 days of the service 
date of the decision granting the application or petition for exemption. 
This decision will be effective on the date of service.
    (ii) Class exemption proceedings. If the carrier seeking the 
exemption has received multiple offers of financial assistance from 
persons found to be financially responsible and has selected the offeror 
with whom it wishes to transact business, the negotiating parties shall 
complete the sale or subsidy agreement or request the Board to establish 
the conditions and amount of compensation within 60 days after the 
Federal Register publication described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this 
section. A request to the Board to set terms and conditions must be 
served concurrently on all parties to the proceeding. If no agreement on 
subsidy or sale is reached within the 60-day period and the Board has 
not been requested to establish the conditions and amount of 
compensation, any other financially responsible offeror may request the 
Board to establish the conditions and amount of compensation. This 
request must be filed at the Board within 70 days of the Federal 
Register publication described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section 
and served concurrently on all parties to the proceeding. If no other 
request is filed, the Board will issue a decision vacating the decision 
postponing the effective date of the notice of exemption within 80 days 
of the Federal Register publication described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of 
this section. The decision to vacate will be effective on the date of 
service.
    (3) If the Board has established the conditions and amount of 
compensation, and the original offer is withdrawn under paragraph (h)(7) 
of this section, any other offeror found to be financially responsible 
may accept the Board's decision within 20 days after the service date of 
the Board's decision setting terms and conditions. If the decision is 
accepted by another such offeror, the Board will require the applicant 
to accept the terms incorporated in the Board's decision.

[[Page 219]]

    (m) Additional time for filing. Notwithstanding the deadlines 
previously set forth in part 1152 for filing an offer of financial 
assistance, parties that can show that they would be materially 
prejudiced by having less than the full 4 months for filing an offer of 
financial assistance provided in 49 U.S.C. 10904(c) for application 
proceedings may seek relief under 49 CFR part 1117.


<R05>
Sec. 1152.28  Public use procedures.

    (a)(1) If the Board finds that the present or future public 
convenience and necessity require or permit abandonment or 
discontinuance, the Board will determine if the involved rail properties 
are appropriate for use for other public purposes.
    (2) A request for a public use condition under 49 U.S.C. 10905 must 
be in writing and set forth:
    (i) The condition sought;
    (ii) The public importance of the condition;
    (iii) The period of time for which the condition would be effective 
(up to the statutory maximum of 180 days); and
    (iv) Justification for the imposition of the time period. A copy of 
the request shall be mailed to the applicant.
    (3) For applications filed under part 1152, subpart C, a request for 
a public use condition must be filed not more than 45 days after the 
application is filed. A decision on the public use request will be 
issued by the Board or the Director of the Office of Proceedings prior 
to the effective date of the abandonment. For abandonment exemptions 
under part 1152, subpart F or exemptions granted on the basis of an 
individual petition for exemption filed under 49 U.S.C. 10502, a request 
for a public use condition must be filed not more than 20 days from the 
date of publication of the notice of exemption in the Federal Register 
in the case of class exemptions under subpart F of this part, or not 
more than 20 days from the date of publication of notice of the filing 
of the petition for individual exemption in the Federal Register.
    (b) If the Board finds that the rail properties are appropriate for 
use for other public purposes, the railroad may dispose of the rail 
properties only under the conditions described in the Board's decision. 
The conditions imposed by the Board may include a prohibition against 
the disposal of the rail assets for a period of not more than 180 days 
from the effective date of the decision authorizing the abandonment or 
discontinuance, unless the properties have first been offered, on 
reasonable terms, for sale for public purposes. This period will run 
concurrently with any other postponements. Jurisdiction to impose such 
conditions expires after 180 days from the effective date of the 
decision authorizing the abandonment or discontinuance.


<R05>
Sec. 1152.29  Prospective use of rights-of-way for interim trail use and rail banking.

    (a) If any state, political subdivision, or qualified private 
organization is interested in acquiring or using a right-of-way of a 
rail line proposed to be abandoned for interim trail use and rail 
banking pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 1247(d), it must file a comment or 
otherwise include a request in its filing (in a regulated abandonment 
proceeding) or a petition (in an exemption proceeding) indicating that 
it would like to do so. The comment/request or petition must include:
    (1) A map depicting, and an accurate description of, the right-of-
way, or portion thereof (including mileposts), proposed to be acquired 
or used;
    (2) A statement indicating the user's willingness to assume full 
responsibility: for managing the right-of-way; for any legal liability 
arising out of the use of the right-of-way (unless the user is immune 
from liability, in which case it need only indemnify the railroad 
against any potential liability); and for the payment of all taxes 
assessed against the right-of-way; and
    (3) An acknowledgment that interim trail use is subject to the 
user's continuing to meet its responsibilities described in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, and subject to possible future reconstruction 
and reactivation of the right-of-way for rail service. The statement 
must be in the following form:

       Statement of Willingness To Assume Financial Responsibility

    In order to establish interim trail use and rail banking under 16 
U.S.C. 1247(d) and 49

[[Page 220]]

CFR 1152.29, __________ (Interim Trail User) is willing to assume full 
responsibility for management of, for any legal liability arising out of 
the transfer or use of (unless the user is immune from liability, in 
which case it need only indemnify the railroad against any potential 
liability), and for the payment of any and all taxes that may be levied 
or assessed against the right-of-way owned by __________ (Railroad) and 
operated by __________ (Railroad). The property, known as __________ 
(Name of Branch Line), extends from railroad milepost __________ near 
__________ (Station Name), to railroad milepost __________, near 
__________ (Station name), a distance of __________ miles in 
[County(ies), (State(s)]. The right-of-way is part of a line of railroad 
proposed for abandonment in Docket No. STB AB-______ (Sub-No. ______).
    A map of the property depicting the right-of-way is attached.
     ______ (Interim Trail User) acknowledges that use of the right-of-
way is subject to the user's continuing to meet its responsibilities 
described above and subject to possible future reconstruction and 
reactivation of the right-of-way for rail service. A copy of this 
statement is being served on the railroad(s) on the same date it is 
being served on the Board.

    (b)(1) In abandonment application proceedings under 49 U.S.C. 10903, 
interim trail use statements are due within the 45-day protest and 
comment period following the date the abandonment application is filed. 
See Sec. 1152.25(c). The applicant carrier's response notifying the 
Board whether and with whom it intends to negotiate a trail use 
agreement is due within 15 days after the close of the protest and 
comment period (i.e., 60 days after the abandonment application is 
filed).
    (i) In every proceeding where a Trails Act request is made, the 
Board will determine whether the Trails Act is applicable.
    (ii) If the Trails Act is not applicable because of failure to 
comply with Sec. 1152.29(a), or is applicable but the carrier either 
does not intend to negotiate an agreement, or does not timely notify the 
Board of its intention to negotiate, a decision on the merits will be 
issued and no Certificate of Interim Trail Use or Abandonment will be 
issued. If the carrier is willing to negotiate an agreement, and the 
public convenience and necessity permit abandonment, the Board will 
issue a CITU.
    (2) In exemption proceedings, a petition containing an interim trail 
use statement is due within 10 days after the date the notice of 
exemption is published in the Federal Register in the case of a class 
exemption and within 20 days after publication in the Federal Register 
of the notice of filing of a petition for exemption in the case of a 
petition for exemption. When an interim trail use comment(s) or 
petition(s) is filed in an exemption proceeding, the railroad's reply to 
the Board (indicating whether and with whom it intends to negotiate an 
agreement) is due within 10 days after the date a petition requesting 
interim trail use is filed.
    (3) Late-filed trail use statements must be supported by a statement 
showing good cause for late filing.
    (c) Regular and NERSA abandonment proceedings. (1) If continued rail 
service does not occur pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 10904 and Sec. 1152.27, and 
a railroad agrees to negotiate an interim trail use/rail banking 
agreement, then the Board will issue a CITU to the railroad and to the 
interim trail user for that portion of the right-of-way to be covered by 
the agreement. The CITU will: Permit the railroad to discontinue 
service, cancel any applicable tariffs, and salvage track and material 
consistent with interim trail use and rail banking, as long as it is 
consistent with any other Board order, 30 days after the date it is 
issued (10 days after issuance in NERSA proceedings); and permit the 
railroad to fully abandon the line if no trail use agreement is reached 
180 days after it is issued, subject to appropriate conditions, 
including labor protection and environmental matters.
    (2) The CITU will indicate that any interim trail use is subject to 
future restoration of rail service, and subject to the user continuing 
to meet the financial obligations for the right-of-way. The CITU will 
also provide that, if the user intends to terminate trail use, it must 
send the Board a copy of the CITU and request that it be vacated on a 
specified date. The Board will reopen the abandonment proceeding, vacate 
the CITU, and issue a decision permitting immediate abandonment for the 
involved portion of the

[[Page 221]]

right-of-way. Copies of the decision will be sent to:
    (i) The abandonment applicant;
    (ii) The owner of the right-of-way; and
    (iii) The current trail user.
    (3) If an application to construct and operate a rail line over the 
right-of-way is authorized under 49 U.S.C. 10901 and 49 CFR part 1150, 
or exempted under 49 U.S.C. 10502, then the CITU will be vacated 
accordingly.
    (d) Exempt abandonment proceedings. (1) If continued rail service 
does not occur under 49 U.S.C. 10904 and Sec. 1152.27 and a railroad 
agrees to negotiate an interim trail use/rail banking agreement, then 
the Board will issue a Notice of Interim Trail Use or Abandonment (NITU) 
to the railroad and to the interim trail user for the portion of the 
right-of-way to be covered by the agreement. The NITU will: permit the 
railroad to discontinue service, cancel any applicable tariffs, and 
salvage track and materials, consistent with interim trail use and rail 
banking, as long as it is consistent with any other Board order, 30 days 
after the date it is issued; and permit the railroad to fully abandon 
the line if no agreement is reached 180 days after it is issued, subject 
to appropriate conditions, including labor protection and environmental 
matters.
    (2) The NITU will indicate that interim trail use is subject to 
future restoration of rail service, and subject to the user continuing 
to meet the financial obligations for the right-of-way. The NITU will 
also provide that, if the user intends to terminate trail use, it must 
send the Board a copy of the NITU and request that it be vacated on a 
specific date. The Board will reopen the exemption proceeding, vacate 
the NITU, and issue a decision reinstating the exemption for that 
portion of the right-of-way. Copies of the decision will be sent to:
    (i) The abandonment exemption applicant;
    (ii) The owner of the right-of-way; and
    (iii) The current trail user.
    (3) If an application to construct and operate a rail line over the 
right-of-way is authorized under 49 U.S.C. 10901 and 49 CFR part 1150, 
or exempted under 49 U.S.C. 10502, then the NITU will be vacated 
accordingly.
    (e)(1) Where late-filed trail use statements are accepted, the 
Director (or designee) will telephone the railroad to determine whether 
abandonment has been consummated and, if not, whether the railroad is 
willing to negotiate an interim trail use agreement. The railroad shall 
confirm, in writing, its response, within 5 days. If abandonment has 
been consummated, the trail use request will be dismissed. If 
abandonment has not been consummated but the railroad refuses to 
negotiate, then trail use will be denied. If abandonment has not been 
consummated and the railroad is willing to negotiate, the abandonment 
proceeding will be reopened, the abandonment decision granting an 
application, petition for exemption or notice of exemption will be 
vacated, and an appropriate CITU or NITU will be issued. The effective 
date of the CITU or NITU will be the same date as the vacated decision 
or notice.
    (2) A railroad that receives authority from the Board to abandon a 
line (in a regulated abandonment proceeding under 49 U.S.C. 10903, or by 
individual or class exemption issued under 49 U.S.C. 10502) shall file a 
notice of consummation with the Board to signify that it has exercised 
the authority granted and fully abandoned the line (e.g., discontinued 
operations, salvaged the track, canceled tariffs, and intends that the 
property be removed from the interstate rail network). The notice shall 
provide the name of the STB proceeding and its docket number, a brief 
description of the line, and a statement that the railroad has 
consummated, or fully exercised, the abandonment authority on a certain 
date. The notice shall be filed within 1 year of the service date of the 
decision permitting the abandonment (assuming that the railroad intends 
to consummate the abandonment). Notices will be deemed conclusive on the 
point of consummation if there are no legal or regulatory barriers to 
consummation (such as outstanding conditions, including Trails Act 
conditions). If, after 1 year from the date of service of a decision 
permitting abandonment, consummation has not been effected by the 
railroad's filing of a notice of consummation, and

[[Page 222]]

there are no legal or regulatory barriers to consummation, the authority 
to abandon will automatically expire. In that event, a new proceeding 
would have to be instituted if the railroad wants to abandon the line. 
Copies of the railroad's notice of consummation shall be filed with the 
Secretary of the Board. In addition, the notice of consummation shall be 
sent to the State Public Service Commission (or equivalent agency) of 
every state through which the line passes. If, however, any legal or 
regulatory barrier to consummation exists at the end of the 1-year time 
period, the notice of consummation must be filed not later than 60 days 
after satisfaction, expiration or removal of the legal or regulatory 
barrier. For good cause shown, a railroad may file a request for an 
extension of time to file a notice so long as it does so sufficiently in 
advance of the expiration of the deadline for notifying the Board of 
consummation to allow for timely processing.
    (f)(1) When a trail user intends to terminate trail use and another 
person intends to become a trail user by assuming financial 
responsibility for the right-of-way, then the existing and future trail 
users shall file, jointly:
    (i) A copy of the extant CITU or NITU; and
    (ii) A Statement of Willingness to Assume Financial Responsibility 
by the new trail user.
    (2) The parties shall indicate the date on which responsibility for 
the right-of-way is to transfer to the new trail user. The Board will 
reopen the abandonment or exemption proceeding, vacate the existing NITU 
or CITU; and issue an appropriate replacement NITU or CITU to the new 
trail user.
    (g) In proceedings where a timely trail use statement is filed, but 
due to either the railroad's indication of its unwillingness to 
negotiate interim trail use agreement, or its failure to timely notify 
the Board of its willingness to negotiate, a decision authorizing 
abandonment or an exemption notice or decision is issued instead of a 
CITU or NITU, and subsequently the railroad and trail use proponent 
nevertheless determine to negotiate an interim trail use agreement under 
the Trails Act, then the railroad and trail use proponent must file a 
joint pleading requesting that an appropriate CITU or NITU be issued. If 
the abandonment has not been consummated, the Board will reopen the 
proceeding, vacate the outstanding decision or notice (or portion 
thereof), and issue an appropriate CITU or NITU that will permit the 
parties to negotiate for a period agreed to by the parties in their 
joint filing, but not to exceed 180 days, at the end of which, the CITU 
or NITU will convert into a decision or notice permitting abandonment.

  Subpart D--Standards for Determining Costs, Revenues, and Return on 
                                  Value


<R05>
Sec. 1152.30  General.

    (a) Contents of subpart. (1) 49 U.S.C. 10904 directs the Board to 
determine the extent to which the avoidable costs of providing rail 
service plus a reasonable return on the value of the line exceed the 
revenues attributable to the line. This subpart contains the methodology 
for such determinations and the standards necessary for application of 
those terms in the context of a particular proceeding. Such data will be 
used in reaching the Board's findings on the merits of an abandonment or 
discontinuance proceeding and in making the necessary financial 
assistance determinations.
    (2) This subpart also sets forth a method by which the carrier may 
establish its Forecast Year estimates and Estimated Subsidy Payment to 
be included in its application (Sec. 1152.22(d) of this part). 
Furthermore, an offeror of financial assistance may use this method to 
formulate a subsidy offer and/or Proposed Subsidy Payment under 49 
U.S.C. 10904 and Sec. 1152.27 of subpart C of this part.
    (b) Data collection. The owning or operating carrier shall establish 
a system to collect at branch level the data necessary to compute the 
base year data and the final subsidy payment. The collection and 
compilation of such data shall be in accordance with the Branch Line 
Accounting System (49 CFR part 1201).

[[Page 223]]

    (c) Final payment of financial assistance. (1) When a financial 
assistance agreement is concluded, the final payment will be adjusted to 
reflect the actual revenues derived, avoidable costs incurred, and value 
of the properties used in the subsidy year.
    (2) Where an adjustment results in an increase in the Estimated 
Subsidy Payment upon which the financial assistance agreement is based, 
the amount of such increase is limited to 15 percent of the estimated 
payment. However, if the railroad notifies the subsidizer that the 
estimate will be exceeded by more than 15 percent in one of the 
Financial Status Reports (Sec. 1152.37) issued during the first 10 
months of the subsidy year or the increase results from an expense 
preapproved by the subsidizer, the adjusted amount shall be included in 
the final payment.


<R05>
Sec. 1152.31  Revenue and income attributable to branch lines.

    The revenue attributable to the rail properties is the total of the 
revenues assigned to the branch in accordance with this section, plus 
any subsidy payments that would cease upon discontinuance of service on 
the branch, for the subsidy year. The revenues assigned shall be derived 
from the following accounts:
    (a) Account 101--Freight. The revenue assigned under this account 
shall be the actual revenues, including transit revenues, accruing to 
the railroad, derived from waybills and other source documents, for all 
traffic that:
    (1) Originates and terminates on the branch;
    (2) Originates or terminates on the branch and is handled off the 
branch on the system but not on another carrier; and
    (3) Originates or terminates on the branch and is handled on another 
carrier. All traffic that is received or forwarded through interchange 
at a point on the branch, including ferry operations, shall be 
considered as originating or terminating on the branch. The revenues of 
all other bridge or overhead traffic that will not be retained by the 
carrier shall be attributed to the branch on the ratio of miles moved on 
the branch to miles moved on the system, provided, however, that the 
parties may agree on a mutually acceptable usage charge for bridge 
traffic in lieu of the mileage apportionment.
    (b) Account 104--Switching; Account 105--Water transfers; Account 
106--Demurrage; Account 110--Incidental; Account 121--Joint Facility-
Credit; Account 122--Joint Facility-Debt; Account 506--Revenues from 
Properties Used in Other Than Carrier Operations; Account 510--
Miscellaneous Rent Income; Account 519--Miscellaneous Income. The 
revenues assigned under these accounts shall be the actual revenues 
accruing to the railroad that are directly attributable to the branch.
    (c) Chart for revenue accounts.

Sec. 1152.32  Calculation of avoidable costs.

    This section defines: Which cost elements are eligible for inclusion 
in the calculation of avoidable costs; the conditions under which 
certain cost elements become eligible for inclusion; and the basis of 
apportioning those cost elements which are not assigned to the branch on 
an actual expense basis. The avoidable costs of providing freight 
service on a branch shall be the total of the costs assigned to the 
branch in accordance with this section. The avoidable costs of providing 
freight service on a branch shall be just and reasonable, and shall not 
exceed those necessary for an honest and efficient operation. Those 
expenses apportioned under this section shall be derived from the latest 
Form R-1 Annual Report for Class I railroads filed with the Board prior 
to the conclusion of the subsidy year, and company records for all non-
Class I railroads, and assigned to the branch according to the 
procedures set forth in Sec. 1152.33 of these regulations. When the term 
``Actual'' is specified as the basis for assigning an expense, it shall 
mean that the only

costs which can be assigned to the account are those costs which are 
incurred solely as a result of the continuation of rail freight service 
on the branch. The accounts in the following charts, which list only the 
``freight-only'' account numbers, shall include the portion of common 
expenses that have been apportioned to freight service.

    (e) Deadheading, taxi, and hotel costs. The costs assigned under 
this subsection shall be the actual costs incurred as a result of 
providing service to the branch line for deadheading, taxi, and hotel 
costs. The amounts included under this subsection shall not be included 
under other subsections of these regulations.
    (f) Overhead movement costs. The costs assigned under this 
subsection shall be the actual costs incurred in moving over any other 
rail line solely to reach and provide service to the branch. The amounts 
shown under this subsection shall not be included under other 
subsections of these regulations.
    (g) Freight car costs. For Class I railroads, the on-segment costs 
for time-mileage freight cars shall be calculated on the basis of the 
carrier's average cost per day and per mile. Those freight cars that are 
rented on a straight mileage basis are to be costed on the carrier's 
average cost per mile for each type of car rented on this basis. No 
costs are to be included in the calculation for private line (shipper 
owned) or other cars for which the railroad does not make payments. The 
cost per day and per mile shall be calculated separately for each type 
of car specified in Ex Parte No. 334, Car Service Compensation--Basic 
Per Diem Charges, 362 I.C.C. 884 (1980). The freight car costs shall be 
separated between ``return on value-freight cars'' and ``freight car 
costs other than return on freight cars''. The costs assigned to a line 
under this subsection are to be derived from the accounts listed below.

time-related costs and mileage-related costs on the basis of 50 percent 
time and 50 percent mileage for repairs, and 60 percent time and 40 
percent mileage for depreciation. Freight car costs shall not include 
depreciation as determined in Account No. 62-22-00. Freight car 
depreciation shall be calculated in the manner set forth in paragraph 
(g)(3)(i) of this section. The system total receipts and payments for 
the hire of time-mileage cars, and the basic data used in the 
development of the car-day and car-mile factors, shall be taken from the 
carrier's latest Form R-1 and company records. The specific steps to 
complete the calculation are as follows:
    (1) The total system car days by car type shall be calculated by:
    (i) Averaging the carrier's freight car ownership at the beginning 
and end of the year (Form R-1, schedule 710, columns (b) and (k);
    (ii) Multiplying the average by the standard active number of car 
days (346) as developed in ICC Docket No. 31358;
    (iii) Subtracting car days on foreign lines (source: Company 
records); and
    (iv) Adding the foreign car days on home line (source: Company 
records). This procedure shall be followed for each car type specified 
in Ex Parte No. 334, supra.
    (2) The total railroad car miles shall be calculated by adding the 
loaded car miles for the railroad owned and leased cars (R-1, Schedule 
755) to empty car miles for the railroad owned or leased cars (R-1, 
Schedule 755). The total car miles, loaded and empty, shall be 
calculated for each car type specified in Ex Parte No. 334, supra.
    (3) The cost per car day shall be calculated for each type of time-
mileage car by adding 50 percent of total freight car repair costs for 
each type (Form R-1, schedule 415, column (b)), and 60 percent of the 
depreciation shall be developed as follows:
    (i) The current value for each type of car shall be calculated by 
first arriving at the current cost per car using the most recent 
purchase of this type by the railroad indexed to the midpoint of the 
year or a price quote from the manufacturer. This unit price shall be 
applied to the average number of this type of car owned by the carrier 
during the year. The current value developed for each car type is then 
multiplied by

[[Page 242]]

the composite depreciation rate for that type of car as shown in the 
latest annual report filed with the Board or company records.
    (ii) Add 100 percent of the return on investment. Return on 
investment shall be determined by multiplying the current value of each 
type of car, developed in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section, by 1 
minus the ratio of accumulated depreciation to the total original cost 
investment. This will determine the net current value for each type of 
car. The net current value for each type of car shall then be multiplied 
by the nominal rate of return calculated in Sec. 1152.34(d) to obtain 
nominal return on investment for each type of car. The total return on 
investment shall then be calculated by deducting the projected holding 
gain (loss) for the forecast and/or subsidy year from the nominal return 
on investment for each type of car. In any instance where the holding 
gain is not specifically determined for freight cars, the Gross Domestic 
Product deflator calculated by the U.S. Department of Commerce shall be 
used. The total return on investment for each type of car shall then be 
divided by total car-days for each car-type developed in paragraph 
(g)(1) of this section.
    (iii) To the amounts for repairs and depreciation, add the time 
portion of the railroad's payment for hire of time-mileage freight cars 
(Form R-1, schedule 414, column (g)), and subtract the time portion of 
the railroad's receipts for hire of time mileage freight cars (Form R-1, 
schedule 414, column (d)). The total of these costs is divided by the 
total car days for each type developed in paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section.
    (4) The cost per mile shall be calculated for each type of time-
mileage car as follows. First, add:
    (i) 50 percent of the total freight train car repair cost for each 
car type (Form R-1, schedule 415, column (b));
    (ii) 40 percent of the total depreciation costs for each car type 
developed in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section; and
    (iii) The mileage portion of the carrier's payments for the hire of 
time-mileage freight cars (Form R-1, schedule 414, column (f)).


Second, subtract the mileage portion of the carrier's receipts for hire 
of time-mileage freight cars (Form R-1, schedule 414, column (c)). 
Finally, divide the result by the total car-miles for each car-type 
developed in paragraph (g)(2) of this section.
    (5) The costs per car day and per car mile developed in paragraphs 
(g) (3) and (4) of this section shall be applied to the total car days 
and total car miles for each car type accumulated on the line segment 
for all traffic originated and/or terminated on the segment plus those 
freight cars that bridge the line segment which are attributed to time-
mileage freight train cars. The on-segment costs for freight cars rented 
on a straight mileage basis shall be the railroad's total payments for 
mileage cars (Form R-1, schedule 414, column (e)) for each car type 
divided by the total miles on which the charges were based.
    (6) For Class II and III railroads, the on-segment costs for time-
mileage and straight mileage freight cars shall be calculated in the 
same manner prescribed for Class I railroads, using the latest data 
available.
    (h) Return on investment--locomotive (line). The return on 
investment shall be calculated for each type of classification of 
locomotive that is actually used to provide service to the line segment. 
The return for the locomotive(s) used shall be calculated in accordance 
with the following procedure:
    (1) The current replacement cost for each type of locomotive used to 
serve the line segment shall be based on the most recent purchase of 
that particular type and size locomotive by the carrier, indexed to the 
midpoint of the forecast and/or subsidy year, or on an amount quoted by 
the manufacturer. The amount must be substantiated. This unit cost shall 
be multiplied by 1 minus the ratio of total accumulated depreciation to 
original total cost of that type of equipment owned by applicant-
carrier, as shown by company records.
    (2) The current nominal cost of capital shall be used in the 
calculation of return on investment for locomotives and shall be 
calculated as provided in Sec. 1152.34(d).

[[Page 243]]

    (3) The return on investment for each category or type of locomotive 
shall be the nominal return less the holding gain (loss). The nominal 
return is calculated by multiplying the replacement cost determined in 
paragraph (h)(1) of this section by the nominal rate of return 
determined in paragraph (h)(2) of this section. The holding gain (loss) 
shall be the gain (loss) projected to occur during the forecast and/or 
subsidy year. In any instance where the holding gain is not specifically 
determined for locomotives, the Gross Domestic Product deflator 
calculated by the U.S. Department of Commerce shall be used.
    (4) The return on investment for each type of locomotive shall be 
assigned to the line segment on a ratio of the locomotive unit hours on 
the segment to average locomotive unit hours per unit for each type of 
locomotive in the system. This ratio will be developed as follows:
    (i) The carrier shall keep and maintain records of the number of 
hours that each type of locomotive incurred in serving the segment 
during the subsidy period.
    (ii) The railroad shall develop the system average locomotive unit 
hours per unit for each of the following types of locomotives; yard 
diesel; yard-other; road diesel; and road-other.
    (iii) The ratio applied to the return on investment is calculated by 
dividing the hours that each type or class of locomotive is used to 
serve the segment, as developed in paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section, 
by the system average locomotive unit hours per unit for the applicable 
type developed in paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section.
    (5) The cost assigned to the segment for each type of locomotive 
shall be calculated by multiplying the annual return on investment 
developed in paragraph (h)(3) of this section by the ratio(s) developed 
in paragraph (h)(4) of this section.
    (i) Revenue taxes. The amount of revenue taxes shall be computed 
based on the amounts directly paid in those states that subject the 
railroad to a revenue tax.
    (j) Property taxes (Line). (1) The assigned costs under this 
subsection shall be the net systemwide property tax savings resulting 
from the abandonment, calculated as set out below, if the applicant-
carrier intends subsequently to sell or otherwise dispose of the 
abandoned properties. If the applicant-carrier expresses an intent to 
dispose of the properties, it will be presumed that the properties will 
ultimately be sold or otherwise disposed of after abandonment. 
Protestants may rebut this presumption by showing that it would be 
financially beneficial to retain ownership of the property for 
investment purposes.
    (2) In states where a true ad valorem tax is levied on real property 
(such as track, land, buildings, and other facilities), applicant must 
affirm that the ad valorem method applies and must substantiate the 
amount of property taxes levied against the property on the line 
segment.
    (3) In states where the ad valorem method is not employed, applicant 
must describe the applicable property tax methodology if it is claiming 
the local property tax as an avoidable cost of operations. Additionally, 
it must substantiate with evidence and computations the actual statewide 
tax savings attributable to the abandonment.
    (4) Any property tax properly substantiated under paragraphs (f)(2) 
or (3) of this section shall be presumed to represent systemwide savings 
to the carrier. Protestants may rebut this presumption by presenting 
evidence:
    (i) That property taxes in those states where the carrier operates 
that are not involved in the abandonment will increase significantly 
because of reassessments attributable to the abandonment; or
    (ii) That a significantly higher property tax will be levied against 
a retained portion of the abandoned property. If applicant does not 
refute protestant's evidence, it may claim avoidable property taxes only 
if, and to the extent, it proves systemwide property tax savings.
    (5) In states where real property taxes are assessed and levied 
against the owner of the property but the tax on rolling stock is 
assessed to the railroad operating the service on the basis of a formula 
of a statewide valuation of

[[Page 244]]

property, the tax on rolling stock attributable to each line segment 
shall be determined as follows:
    (i) Using ratio of the cost of equipment (as used in the formula) to 
the total of all property costs (as used in formula);
    (ii) Apply that ratio to the total state assessment to determine the 
portion of the assessment attributable to rolling stock;
    (iii) Allocate the rolling stock assessment thus determined to each 
line segment on the basis of car and locomotive unit miles on the 
segment to total car and locomotive unit miles in the state; and
    (iv) Apply the appropriate tax rate or rates to the allocated 
assessment thus determined.
    (k) Administrative costs. The costs assigned under this account 
shall be the actual costs directly attributable to the administration of 
the subsidy program or at the option of the carrier, one percent of the 
total annual revenues attributed to the branch shall be allowable to 
cover all costs of administering the subsidy program. Either method may 
be used, but not both.
    (l) Casualty reserve account. The costs assigned under this account 
shall be any payments mutually agreed to by the person offering the 
subsidy and the railroad for the purpose of holding the subsidizer 
harmless from any liability under those accounts that are used to record 
any costs incurred by the railroad as a result of an accident.
    (m) Rehabilitation. (1) For abandonment purposes the applicant 
carrier shall project the amounts necessary to permit efficient 
operations over the line segment. The carrier shall indicate the level 
of FRA class safety standard to be attained with the amount of 
expenditure. See 49 CFR part 213. Applicant, in making its projection of 
rehabilitation costs, shall give consideration to:
    (i) The cost to attain the lowest operationally feasible track 
level;
    (ii) The cost to attain the rehabilitation level resulting in the 
lowest operating and rehabilitation expenditures; or
    (iii) The cost to attain the rehabilitation level resulting in the 
lowest loss, or highest profit, from operations.
    (2) For subsidy purposes rehabilitation costs shall not be included 
unless:
    (i) The track fails to meet minimum Federal Railroad Administrative 
class 1 safety standards (49 CFR part 213), in which case the railroad 
will furnish, with the abandonment application, a detailed estimate of 
the costs to rehabilitate the track to the minimum level; or
    (ii) The potential subsidizer requests a level of service which 
requires expenditures for rehabilitation.
    (n) Off-branch costs. The off-branch costs developed in this section 
shall be separated between ``off-branch costs other than return on 
freight cars'' and ``return on value-freight cars''. The off-branch 
costs shall be developed in the following manner:
    (1) Terminal costs, line-haul costs, interchange costs, and modified 
terminal costs shall be considered as the off-branch avoidable costs of 
providing service over the remainder of the railroad's system. These 
costs shall be computed by applying the variable unit costs to the 
service units attributed to the branch line's traffic for the time 
periods specified in Sec. 1152.22(d) of this part.
    (2) The procedure for determining the off-branch costs shall be 
based upon the URCS cost formula. This formula shall be applied to the 
latest Annual Report Form R-1 filed by the railroad, with two 
exceptions. First, the amount used in the formula for freight car 
depreciation shall be calculated using the procedure discussed in 
paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section applied to the average total car 
fleet of the railroad. Second, the return on investment in freight cars 
shall be computed using the procedure set forth in paragraph (g)(3)(ii) 
of this section. In addition, the application of URCS shall include the 
use of the nominal cost of capital for all return on investment 
determinations.
    (3) The Class I Procedure: A Class I railroad shall calculate its 
off-branch costs using the Class I procedure as set forth below in this 
paragraph.
    (i) The unit costs developed by applying URCS in the manner 
specified in paragraph (n)(2) of this section shall be applied to the 
service characteristics of

[[Page 245]]

each movement of traffic that is attributed to the branch line. This 
application shall result in the total off-branch cost associated with 
this traffic for normal terminal handlings, line-haul mileage, and 
interchange events.
    (ii) The modified terminal cost per carload shall be calculated 
separately for each type of freight car and applied to each car that is 
attributed to the branch line. The modified terminal cost shall consist 
of clerical costs, two days of freight car cost, and an inter-intra 
train switching cost (locomotive engine minute cost only). The clerical 
cost and inter-intra train switching cost shall be calculated from unit 
costs developed within the individual URCS application.
    (A) The unit costs for the clerical cost per carload calculation are 
located in URCS Worktable E1, Part 1: Line 106, columns 1, 2, and 3; 
line 107, column 1; line 108, column 1; line 109, column 1; and line 
110, column 1.
    (B) The inter-intra train switching cost shall be calculated by 
multiplying the total switch engine minute cost from URCS Worktable E1, 
Part 1, line 111, columns 1, 2, and 3 by the total minutes specified in 
the next sentence. The total minutes specified in this sentence shall 
equal the sum of:
    (1) The minutes per switch event from Worktable E2, Part 1, line 
118, column 29; and
    (2) The product of the minutes per switch event from Worktable E2, 
Part 1, line 118, column 29 and the ratio of loaded to total car miles 
for the particular type of freight car being costed.
    (C) The freight car cost shall be the car ownership costs per car 
day for 2 days developed in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
paragraph (g)(3) of this section for the type of freight car being 
costed.
    (iii) For a Class I railroad, the total costs calculated using the 
procedures set forth in paragraphs (n)(3)(i) and (n)(3)(ii) of this 
section shall constitute the off-branch costs attributable to the branch 
line's traffic.
    (4) A Class II or Class III railroad shall calculate its off-branch 
costs using any one of three different procedures. The Class I 
Procedure: A Class II or Class III railroad may calculate its off-branch 
costs using the Class I procedure set forth in paragraph (n)(3) of this 
section, if the necessary data are available from the railroad's own 
records. If the data necessary to complete the Class I procedure set 
forth in paragraph (n)(3) of this section are not available from the 
railroad's own records, the Class II or Class III railroad shall 
calculate its off-branch costs using either one of the following 
procedures based on the latest regional URCS data and the railroad's own 
records. The Class II/III Simplified Costing Procedure: A Class II or 
Class III railroad may calculate its off-branch costs using the Class I 
procedure set forth in paragraph (n)(3) of this section, with regional 
URCS data of the Class I railroads used in lieu of individual URCS data 
of the Class II or Class III railroad. Costs developed through the use 
of the Class II/III simplified costing procedure shall enjoy a 
rebuttable presumption of correctness. The Class II/III Standard Costing 
Procedure: A Class II or Class III railroad may calculate its off-branch 
costs using the Class II/III standard costing procedure set forth in 
paragraphs (n)(4)(i) through (n)(4)(xiv) of this section. Costs 
developed through the use of the Class II/III standard costing procedure 
shall be given preference over costs developed through the use of the 
Class II/III simplified costing procedure. The Class II/III standard 
costing procedure is set forth in paragraphs (n)(4)(i) through 
(n)(4)(xiv) of this section.
    (i) The Class II or Class III railroad shall first determine which 
URCS regional application will be used based on its geographical 
location. The railroad's total estimated system variable expenses are 
calculated by multiplying its total operating expenses by the ratio of 
variable expenses to total expenses; this ratio is located in Worktable 
D8, Part 6, line 615, column 1 of the URCS printout for the appropriate 
region. If a railroad has passenger and freight service, the freight 
portion of the total estimated system variable expenses shall be 
calculated by multiplying the total estimated system variable expenses, 
calculated as above, by the ratio of freight related operating expenses 
to total railway operating expenses.

[[Page 246]]

    (ii) The total number of revenue carload terminal handlings, as 
determined from the railroad's records, shall be calculated as the sum 
of:
    (A) Originated and terminated (local) revenue carloads multiplied by 
2; plus
    (B) Interchanged and either originated or terminated (interline) 
revenue carloads.
    (iii) The total number of revenue carload interchange handlings, as 
determined from the railroad's records, shall be calculated as the sum 
of:
    (A) Bridge (interchange to interchange) revenue carloads multiplied 
by 2; plus
    (B) Revenue carloads that are interchanged and either originated or 
terminated (interline).
    (iv) The system average shipment weight per car, as determined from 
the railroad's records, shall be calculated by dividing:
    (A) Ton-miles-revenue freight by
    (B) Loaded freight car miles.
    (v) The system average loaded car miles per car, as determined from 
the railroad's records, shall be calculated by dividing:
    (A) Revenue ton-miles by
    (B) Revenue tons.
    (vi) The railroad shall complete a URCS Phase III ``Movement Costing 
Program'' based on the application of URCS data for the appropriate 
region. The following data shall be inputs to the Phase III program 
application.
    (A) The carrier code, either ``REG 4'' or ``REG 7'', shall 
correspond to the appropriate region.
    (B) The type of shipment shall be designated as ``OD'' in order for 
the movement to be costed as an interline movement.
    (C) The distance shall be the system average loaded car miles per 
car as developed in paragraph (n)(4)(v) of this section.
    (D) The type of freight car shall be identified as a Box, General 
Service Equipped, which has an input user code of ``3''. If all of the 
traffic on the branch line is transported in a single type of car, and 
it is not a Box, General Service Equipped, the code for that type of car 
may be substituted.
    (E) The number of freight cars shall be ``1''.
    (F) The car ownership factor shall be designated as ``R'' for 
railroad owned cars unless all of the branch line traffic is moved in 
privately owned cars, in which case the code ``P'' for privately owned 
cars would be the input.
    (G) The program requires a loss and damage input. The code ``48'', 
representing the average of all commodities, shall be used.
    (H) The input for shipment weight shall be the system average 
shipment weight per car developed in paragraph (n)(4)(iv) of this 
section.
    (I) The input for type of movement shall be ``1'', representing an 
individual car movement.
    (vii) The ratios employed to separate the total estimated system 
variable expenses, as determined in paragraph (n)(4)(i) of this section, 
among terminal, interchange, and line-haul operations shall be based on 
the procedures outlined in this paragraph (n)(4)(vii). This separation 
shall reflect the variable costs resulting from the application of the 
URCS Phase III program based on the input factors specified in paragraph 
(n)(4)(vi) of this section. The ratios shall be calculated in the 
following manner:
    (A) The terminal expenses calculated by the application of the Phase 
III program shall consist of the following:
    (1) ``Carload and Clerical Costs'' shall be calculated as the sum of 
lines 256, 258, 260, 262, 264, 266, and 268.
    (2) Switching expenses based on ``Total SEM-Industry'' shall be 
calculated by multiplying:
    (i) The sum of lines 315, 317, and 319, by
    (ii) Line 311.
    (3) Car mile yard cost ``CM(Y)-Industry'' shall be calculated by 
multiplying:
    (i) The sum of lines 426, 428, and 430, by
    (ii) Line 422.
    (4) Car day yard cost ``CD(Y)-Industry'' and ``CD(Y)-L&UL'' shall be 
calculated by multiplying:
    (i) The sum of lines 452, 454, and 456, by
    (ii) The sum of lines 446 and 450.
    (5) The expenses for accessorial services for railroad owned cars 
shall be calculated as the sum of:

[[Page 247]]

    (i) The product of line 422 and the sum of lines 464, 466, and 468; 
plus
    (ii) The product of the sum of lines 446 and 450 and the sum of 
lines 476, 478, and 480.
    (B) The interchange expenses calculated by the application of the 
Phase III program shall consist of the following:
    (1) Switching expenses based on ``Total SEM-Interchange'' shall be 
calculated by multiplying
    (i) The sum of lines 315, 317, and 319, by
    (ii) Line 312.
    (2) Car mile cost in interchange ``CM(Y)-Interchange'' shall be 
calculated by multiplying:
    (i) The sum of lines 426, 428, and 430, by
    (ii) Line 423.
    (3) Car day cost in interchange ``CD(Y)-Interchange (L&E)'' shall be 
calculated by multiplying:
    (i) The sum of lines 452, 454, and 456, by
    (ii) Line 447.
    (4) The expenses for accessorial services for railroad owned cars 
shall be calculated as the sum of:
    (i) The product of line 423 and the sum of lines 464, 466, and 468; 
plus.
    (ii) The product of line 447 and the sum of lines 476, 478, and 480.
    (C) The line-haul expenses resulting from the application of the 
Phase III program shall be calculated by subtracting the sum of:
    (1) The terminal expenses as determined in paragraph (n)(4)(vii)(A) 
of this section, and
    (2) The interchange expenses as determined in paragraph 
(n)(4)(vii)(B) of this section, from
    (3) The total variable cost excluding loss and damage as calculated 
in the Phase III program at line 696.
    (D) The ratio for terminal expenses shall be calculated by dividing 
the terminal expenses as determined in paragraph (n)(4)(vii)(A) of this 
section by the total variable cost excluding loss and damage as 
calculated in the Phase III program at line 696.
    (E) The ratio for interchange expenses shall be calculated by 
dividing the interchange expenses as determined in paragraph 
(n)(4)(vii)(B) of this section by the total variable cost excluding loss 
and damage as calculated in the Phase III program at line 696.
    (F) The ratio for line-haul expenses shall be calculated by dividing 
the line-haul expenses as determined in paragraph (n)(4)(vii)(C) of this 
section by the total variable cost excluding loss and damage as 
calculated in the Phase III program at line 696.
    (viii) The railroad's total estimated system variable expenses shall 
be separated as follows:
    (A) The total terminal variable expenses shall be calculated by 
multiplying the total estimated system variable expenses as determined 
in paragraph (n)(4)(i) of this section by the ratio for terminal 
expenses as determined in paragraph (n)(4)(vii)(D) of this section.
    (B) The total interchange variable expenses shall be calculated by 
multiplying the total estimated system variable expenses as determined 
in paragraph (n)(4)(i) of this section by the ratio for interchange 
expenses as determined in paragraph (n)(4)(vii)(E) of this section.
    (C) The total line-haul variable expenses shall be calculated by 
multiplying the total estimated system variable expenses as determined 
in paragraph (n)(4)(i) of this section by the ratio for line-haul 
expenses as determined in paragraph (n)(4)(vii)(F) of this section.
    (ix) The railroad's unit costs shall be determined for terminal, 
interchange, and line-haul operations as follows:
    (A) The terminal cost per carload shall be calculated by dividing 
the total terminal variable expenses as determined in paragraph 
(n)(4)(viii)(A) of this section by the total number of revenue carload 
terminal handlings as determined in paragraph (n)(4)(ii) of this 
section.
    (B) The interchange cost per carload shall be calculated by dividing 
the total interchange variable expenses as determined in paragraph 
(n)(4)(viii)(B) of this section by the total number of revenue carload 
interchange handlings as determined in paragraph (n)(4)(iii) of this 
section.
    (C) The line-haul cost per car mile shall be calculated by dividing 
the total line-haul variable expenses as determined in paragraph 
(n)(4)(viii)(C) of this section by the total system freight

[[Page 248]]

car miles, loaded and empty, as determined from the railroad's records.
    (x) The modified terminal cost per carload is a composite of costs 
developed in the Phase III program and costs determined in accordance 
with paragraph (g) of this section and this paragraph. The modified 
terminal cost per carload shall be calculated for each type of car as 
follows:
    (A) The station clerical cost per carload shall be developed in the 
following manner:
    (1) The station clerical expense ratio shall be calculated by 
dividing the total clerical cost (the sum of lines 256, 258, 260, 262, 
264, 266, and 268) by the terminal expenses as determined in paragraph 
(n)(4)(vii)(A) of this section.
    (2) The station clerical cost per carload shall be calculated by 
multiplying the terminal cost per carload as determined in paragraph 
(n)(4)(ix)(A) of this section by the station clerical expense ratio.
    (B) The interchange switching cost per carload shall be developed in 
the following manner:
    (1) The total interchange switching expense shall be calculated by 
multiplying the sum of lines 315, 317, and 319 by line 312.
    (2) The interchange switching ratio shall be calculated by dividing 
the total interchange switching expense by the interchange expenses as 
determined in paragraph (n)(4)(vii)(B) of this section.
    (3) The interchange switching cost per carload shall be calculated 
by multiplying the interchange cost per carload as determined in 
paragraph (n)(4)(ix)(B) of this section by the interchange switching 
ratio.
    (C) The freight car cost element shall be the freight car cost per 
car day for 2 days as developed for each car type in paragraph (g)(3) of 
this section.
    (D) The modified terminal cost per carload shall be the total of the 
costs developed in paragraphs (n)(4)(x)(A), (n)(4)(x)(B), and 
(n)(4)(x)(C) of this section.
    (xi) The terminal costs shall be calculated by multiplying the 
terminal cost per carload as determined in paragraph (n)(4)(ix)(A) of 
this section by the number of carloads that both:
    (A) Originated or terminated on the branch, and
    (B) Are local to the railroad serving the branch.
    (xii) The interchange costs shall be calculated by multiplying the 
interchange cost per carload as determined in paragraph (n)(4)(ix)(B) of 
this section by the number of carloads that both:
    (A) Originated or terminated on the branch; and
    (B) Are received in or forwarded through interchange with other 
railroads.
    (xiii) The line-haul costs shall be calculated by multiplying the 
line-haul cost per car mile as determined in paragraph (n)(4)(ix)(C) of 
this section by the total loaded and empty car miles generated on the 
railroad's system off the branch by cars that originated or terminated 
on the branch.
    (xiv) The modified terminal costs shall be calculated by multiplying 
the modified terminal cost per carload as determined in paragraph 
(n)(4)(x)(D) of this section by the number of carloads that originated 
or terminated on the branch.
    (o) Locomotive depreciation. The depreciation cost for locomotives 
used on the line shall be calculated using the following procedure:
    (1) The current replacement cost for each type of locomotive used to 
serve the line will be based on the most recent purchase of that 
particular type and size locomotive by the carrier indexed to the 
midpoint of the year or on an amount quoted by the manufacturer.
    (2) The depreciation rate that will be applied to the replacement 
cost shall be the carrier's component rate for each type of locomotive 
as reported in the latest Annual Report Form R-1 submitted to the Board 
or from the company records. Carriers using depreciation rates based on 
company records must explain why composite rates are inappropriate; 
provide a detailed explanation of the methodology used to compute the 
alternate depreciation rate; and demonstrate that these rates have been 
used consistently.

[[Page 249]]

    (3) The annual depreciation cost for each type of locomotive shall 
be calculated by multiplying the replacement cost(s) developed in 
paragraph (o)(1) of this section by the rate from paragraph (o)(2) of 
this section.
    (4) The depreciation expense for each type of locomotive shall be 
assigned to the line on the ratio of the hours incurred serving the line 
to the average system locomotive unit hours in service by each of the 
following categories of locomotives: yard-diesel; yard-other; road-
diesel; and road-other. The ratio for each type of locomotive used to 
serve the line shall be the same as that developed in paragraph (h)(4) 
of this section.
    (5) The depreciation shall be calculated by multiplying the annual 
depreciation expense for each type of locomotive developed in paragraph 
(o)(3) of this section by the ratio(s) developed in paragraph (o)(4) of 
this section.
    (p) Opportunity costs. Applicant-carrier may, at its discretion, 
present evidence of its opportunity costs, if the assets engaged in the 
line proposed to be abandoned could be used more profitably in some 
other capacity.
    Opportunity costs may be calculated in accordance with the 
methodology established in Sec. 1152.34 of this part, or by using any 
other reasonable, fully explained method. Opportunity costs are not 
included as costs on Exhibit 1 described at Sec. 1152.36. These costs 
should be submitted as a separate exhibit to the application.
    (q) Labor costs. (1) The salaries, wages and fringe benefits of 
personnel exclusively assigned to the line segment shall be deemed 
attributable costs of the segment. The salaries, wages, and fringe 
benefits of personnel not exclusively assigned to the line segment shall 
be deemed attributable costs of the segment to the extent they are shown 
to be apportionable to the segment to be abandoned.
    (2) These costs shall be deemed attributable notwithstanding any 
obligation of applicant to provide employee protection for employees 
after the abandonment.

Sec. 1152.33  Apportionment rules for the assignment of expenses to on-branch costs.

    The accounts specified under Sec. 1152.32 (a), (b), (c), and (d) as 
having an assignment basis other than ``Actual'' shall be apportioned 
according to the rules contained in this section.
    (a) Maintenance of way and structures--(1) Roadway machines. All 
accounts designated XX-13-36 shall be assigned to the branch on the 
basis of the average repair costs, for each type of machine, included in 
the daily rental fees charged by the operating railroad or as published 
by the General Manager's Association of Chicago (GMA), based on the 
actual number of days each type of machine is used on the branch.
    (2) Small tools and supplies. All accounts designated XX-13-37 shall 
be assigned to the branch as follows:
    (i) The costs of supplies, consumed in the operation of roadway 
machines, shall be assigned to the branch on the basis of the average 
costs of supplies per day, included in the daily rental fees charged by 
the operating railroad or as published by the GMA, multiplied by the 
actual number of days that the machine is used on the branch;
    (ii) The costs of small tools shall be assigned to the branch on the 
basis of the ratio that the branch amounts in Accounts 11-11-10 through 
11-11-17 and 11-11-48, plus 11-12-10 through 11-12-17 and 11-12-48, bear 
to the railroad's system total for the same accounts.
    (3) Fringe benefits. Fringe benefits shall be assigned to the branch 
separated between running, switching and other, on the ratio that the 
total branch salary and wages bear to the total system salaries and 
wages for each activity as follows:
    (i) Fringe benefits--Running, Account 12-11-00, total of all 11-11-
XX accounts branch to system;
    (ii) Fringe benefits--Switching, Account 12-12-00, total of all 11-
12-XX accounts branch to system; and
    (iii) Fringe benefits--Other, Account 12-13-00, total of all 11-13-
XX accounts branch to system.
    (b) Maintenance of equipment--(1) Locomotive repairs and 
maintenance. All accounts designated XX-21-41 shall be

[[Page 250]]

separated between yard and road with a further separation between diesel 
and other (electric). The costs for these accounts for yard locomotives 
shall be assigned to the branch separately for diesel and electric 
locomotives on the basis of the ratio of branch diesel and electric yard 
locomotive unit-hours to the total system diesel and electric yard 
locomotive unit-hours. The costs for these accounts for road locomotives 
shall be assigned to the branch separately for diesel and electric 
locomotives on the basis of the ratio of branch diesel and electric 
locomotive gross ton-miles in road service to the total system diesel 
and electric locomotive gross ton-miles in road service. The costs 
assigned under these accounts for specialized equipment devoted 
exclusively to branch line service shall be theactual costs for the 
specific equipment used.
    (2) Locomotive depreciation. Locomotive depreciation shall be 
calculated and assigned in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
Sec. 1152.32(o).
    (3) Fringe Benefits. Fringe benefits for locomotives and other 
equipment shall be assigned to the branch on the ratio that the total 
branch salary and wages bear to the system total salaries and wages for 
each type of equipment as follows:
    (i) Locomotives--Account 12-21-00, total of all 11-21-XX accounts 
branch to system.
    (ii) Other Equipment--Account 12-23-00, total of all 11-23-XX 
accounts branch to system.
    (iii) Fringe benefits for freight cars shall be calculated by first 
estimating the total in Account 11-22-42, Freight car repairs--salaries 
and wages, that is included in the total on branch costs for freight 
cars as determined from the car-day and car-mile cost calculations in 
Sec. 1152.32(g) of these regulations. To this amount is added the branch 
totals in the balance of all 11-22-XX accounts. The ratio of this total 
branch account to the system total for all 11-22-XX accounts is applied 
to Account 12-22-00, Fringe Benefits--Freight Cars.
    (c) Transportation--(1) Train operations--(i) Engine Crews-
Materials. Account 21-31-56; Train Crews-Materials, Account 21-31-57; 
Train Inspection and Lubrication-Salaries and Wages, Account 11-31-62; 
and Train Inspection and Lubrication-Materials, Account 21-31-62. If the 
branch is served by a local/way or through train, the costs in these 
accounts shall be assigned to the branch on the weighted ratio of the 
loaded freight train cars on the branch to the total system loaded 
freight train cars, and the loaded and empty car-miles on the branch to 
the total system loaded and empty car-miles. This shall be calculated as 
follows:
    (A) To determine the car-mile portion of these accounts:
    (1) Multiply the total amounts in these accounts (from the R-1 
Annual Report, Schedule 410) by 69 percent, which is the ratio of train-
mile and running expenses;
    (2) Divide the amount in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A)(1) of this section 
by the total system loaded and empty car-miles; and
    (3) Multiply the car-mile unit cost factor from paragraph 
(c)(1)(i)(A)(2) of this section by the on-branch car-miles (loaded and 
empty).
    (B) To determine the carload portion of these accounts:
    (1) Multiply the total amounts in these accounts by 31 percent, 
which is the ratio of terminal expenses;
    (2) Divide the amount in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B)(1) of this section 
by the total system carloads; and
    (3) Multiply the carload unit cost factor from paragraph 
(c)(1)(i)(B)(2) of this section by the on-branch carloads.
    (C) To determine the total costs assignable to the branch for these 
accounts, add the amounts developed in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(A)(3) and 
(c)(1)(i)(B)(3) of this section.
    (ii) All accounts designated xx-31-67 shall be assigned to the 
branch in accordance with the following procedure. The dollar amounts 
used in the determination of locomotive fuel costs shall be based on 
data contained in the most recent publication issued by the General 
Managers Association (GMA) relating to the rental of locomotives. The 
total number of locomotive unit hours incurred by the locomotive(s) 
shall then be categorized according to the applicable GMA horsepower 
classification group. The fuel cost is derived

[[Page 251]]

from the Repairs and Supplies Expenses element of the locomotive rental 
rates published by the GMA. The fuel cost per locomotive unit hour shall 
be determined for each GMA horsepower classification group by 
multiplying the latest GMA fuel cost percentage by the Repairs and 
Supplies Expense per hour included in each group. The fuel cost update 
ratio is determined by using the indices for fuel from the Association 
of American Railroad's (AAR's) Railroad Cost Recovery Index (RCR). The 
indices shall be taken from the district to which the railroad is 
assigned by the Board. The index for the current period is divided by 
the index of the period representative of the GMA publication to develop 
the fuel update ratio. The fuel cost per locomotive unit hour developed 
for each GMA horsepower group shall be multiplied by the fuel update 
ratio to determine the fuel cost per locomotive hour for each horsepower 
group. The updated fuel cost per locomotive unit hour for each 
applicable GMA group shall be multiplied by the number of locomotive 
unit hours incurred in serving the branch by locomotives of that GMA 
horsepower classification group. The total cost developed under this 
procedure for each horsepower classification shall be the locomotive 
fuel cost assignable to the branch line.
    (iii) Electric power purchased or produced for motive power--All 
accounts designated XX-31-68 shall be assigned to the branch on the 
ratio of road electric locomotive unit hours on the branch to the total 
system road electric locomotive unit hours.
    (iv) Servicing locomotives--All accounts designated XX-31-69 shall 
be assigned to the branch on the ratio of road locomotive unit miles on 
the branch to the total system road locomotive unit miles.
    (2) Yard operations--(i) Switch Crews--Materials, Account 21-32-64, 
and Servicing Locomotives, all accounts designated XX-32-69. The costs 
for these accounts shall be assigned to the branch on the ratio of yard 
locomotive unit hours on the branch to the system total yard locomotive 
unit hours.
    (ii) Locomotive fuel--All accounts designated XX-32-67 shall be 
assigned to the branch on the ratio of yard diesel locomotive unit hours 
on the branch to the total system yard diesel locomotive unit hours.
    (iii) Electric power purchased or produced for motive power--All 
accounts designated XX-32-68 shall be assigned to the branch on the 
ratio of yard electric locomotive unit hours on the branch to the total 
system yard electric locomotive unit hours.
    (3) Administrative support operations--(i) Loss and damage claims 
processing--All accounts designated XX-35-78 shall be assigned to the 
branch on the ratio of the number of claims processed for loss or damage 
occurring on the branch to the total number of claims processed by the 
railroad.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (4) Transportation fringe benefits. Fringe benefits shall be 
assigned to the branch separated between train operations, yard 
operations, train and yard operations common, specialized service 
operations, and administrative support operations. The costs for each 
activity shall be assigned to the branch on the ratio that the total 
branch salary and wages bear to the total system salary and wages for 
each activity shown below.
    (i) Train Operations, Account 12-31-00, total of all 11-31-XX 
accounts branch to system.
    (ii) Yard Operations, Account 12-32-00, total of all 11-32-XX 
accounts branch to system.
    (iii) Train and Yard Operations Common, Account 12-33-00, total of 
all 11-33-XX accounts branch to system.
    (iv) Specialized Service Operations, Account 12-34-00, total of all 
11-34-XX accounts branch to system.
    (v) Administrative Support, Account 12-35-00, total of all 11-35-XX 
accounts branch to system.
    (d) General administrative. (1) Fringe Benefits, Account 12-61-00, 
shall be assigned to the branch on the ratio that the total branch 
salary and wages in all 11-61-XX accounts bear to the system total 
salary and wages in all 11-61-XX accounts.
    (2) [Reserved]

Sec. 1152.34  Return on investment.

    Return on investment for road property shall be computed according 
to the procedures set forth in this section.

[[Page 252]]

    (a) [Reserved]
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Return on investment--road properties. Return on investment--
road properties shall be computed according to the following procedures:
    (1) The investment base to which the nominal return element shall 
apply shall be the sum of:
    (i) The allowable working capital computed at 15 days on-branch cash 
avoidable costs (on branch avoidable costs less depreciation).
    (ii) The amount of current income tax benefits resulting from 
abandonment of the line which would have been applicable to the period 
of the subsidy agreement. (Conversely, if the railroad would incur an 
income tax liability from abandonment, the liability should be deducted 
from the investment base.) This information is to be furnished by the 
railroad and subject to audit by the person offering the subsidy.
    (iii) The net liquidation value for the highest and best use for 
non-rail purposes of the rail properties on the line to be subsidized 
which are used and required for performance of the services requested by 
the persons offering the subsidy. This value shall be determined by 
computing the current appraised market value of such properties for 
other than rail transportation purposes, less all costs of dismantling 
and disposition of improvements necessary to make the remaining 
properties available for their highest and best use and complying with 
applicable zoning, land use, and environmental regulations. If 
rehabilitation has been performed along the line during a subsidy year 
and rehabilitation expenses have been paid by the subsidizer under 49 
CFR 1152.32(m)(2), the investment base shall exclude the increment to 
the net liquidation value of the line caused by the rehabilitation 
project. For these purposes:
    (A) In calculating the net liquidation values for the Forecast Year, 
no asset on the line shall be excluded from the determination of net 
liquidation value because it contributes negatively to that value, i.e., 
the removal costs exceed the market value after removal. All such assets 
shall be included in the net liquidation value determination if the 
carrier is required by law to remove them or if the carrier intends to 
remove them, even if it is not required to do so. The parties shall 
fully support and explain the exclusion for net liquidation purposes of 
all assets having a negative salvage value.
    (1) In calculating the net liquidation value of railroad properties 
for the purpose of determining the operating subsidy under an offer of 
financial assistance, any asset with a negative salvage value shall be 
included at a value of zero (0).
    (2) Determination of the net liquidation value of rail properties 
for the purpose of purchasing the rail properties under an offer of 
financial assistance shall include any asset with a negative salvage 
value at a value of zero (0).
    (B) All adjustments to the appraised fair market value of right-of-
way land, including a downward adjustment to reflect an imputed real 
estate Board or selling expense, shall be fully supported and explained.
    (C) Parties shall fully support and explain their use of unadjusted 
across-the-fence (ATF) values as a surrogate for the value of railroad 
right-of-way land, given that the physical and economic characteristics 
(grading and elevation) usually are different from those of surrounding 
parcels. All adjustments to ATF values to arrive at the right-of-way 
values shall also be supported and explained.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (d) Reasonable return. A rail carrier shall furnish to the Board, 
and to any financially responsible person considering making an offer of 
a rail service continuation payment, a substantiated statement showing 
its current nominal cost of capital. The railroad's nominal cost of 
capital shall be the current before tax cost of capital, weighted to the 
capital structure, and adjusted for the effects of the combined 
statutory Federal and state income tax rates. This rate of return 
expressed as a percent, shall be calculated as follows:
    (1) The railroad shall determine its permanent capital structure 
ratio for debt and equity capital such that the two numbers total 100 
percent. This capital structure will be the actual capital structure of 
the railroad. If this calculation is not possible or also not

[[Page 253]]

representative because the railroad is part of a conglomerate, the debt-
equity ratio from the Board's latest Determination of Adequate Railroad 
Revenues will be used. However, if the debt-equity ratio for the 
railroad industry is used then the industry average equity and debt rate 
from the Board's latest revenue adequacy finding must also be used in 
paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section.
    (2) The current nominal cost of debt shall be determined by taking 
the average of all debt instruments (including bonds, equipment trust 
certificates, financial lease arrangements, et cetera) issued by the 
carrier in the most recent 12-month period. The debt cost calculated by 
this procedure is a before-tax rate and is not adjusted for inflation or 
income taxes.
    (3) The current nominal after tax cost of equity shall be an amount 
equal to that which a prudent investor would expect to earn through 
investment in the market place. The current after tax nominal cost of 
equity is divided by 1 minus the combined statutory Federal and state 
income tax rates. This will develop the nominal cost of equity on a 
before tax basis.
    (4) The current nominal before-tax cost of debt is multiplied by the 
current percentage of debt to total capital to obtain a weighted before-
tax nominal cost of current debt.
    (5) The current nominal before-tax cost of equity is multiplied by 
the current percentage of equity to total capital to obtain a weighted 
nominal before-tax cost of current equity.
    (6) The results of paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section are 
added together to determine the current nominal cost of capital.
    (e) Holding gain (loss)-road properties. The railroad shall 
determine the holding gain (loss) that is projected to occur during the 
forecast and/or subsidy year. In any instance where the holding gain is 
not specifically determined for road properties, the Gross Domestic 
Product deflator calculated by the U.S. Department of Commerce shall be 
used.

<R04>
   Subpart F--Exempt Abandonments and Discontinuances of Service and 
                             Trackage Rights


<R05>
Sec. 1152.50  Exempt abandonments and discontinuances of service and trackage rights.

    (a)(1) A proposed abandonment or discontinuance of service or 
trackage rights over a railroad line is exempt from the provisions of 49 
U.S.C. 10903 if the criteria in this section are satisfied.
    (2) Whenever the Board determines a proposed abandonment to be 
exempt from the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 10903, whether under this 
section or on the basis of the merits of an individual petition, the 
provisions of Secs. 1152.27, 1152.28, and 1152.29 as they relate to 
exemption proceedings shall be applicable.
    (b) An abandonment or discontinuance of service or trackage rights 
is exempt if the carrier certifies that no local traffic has moved over 
the line for at least 2 years and any overhead traffic on the line can 
be rerouted over other lines and that no formal complaint filed by a 
user of rail service on the line (or a state or local government entity 
acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the 
line either is pending with the Board or any U.S. District Court or has 
been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period. The 
complaint must allege (if pending), or prove (if decided) that the 
carrier has imposed an illegal embargo or other unlawful impediment to 
service.
    (c) The Board has found:
    (1) That its prior review and approval of these abandonments and 
discontinuances is not necessary to carry out the rail transportation 
policy of 49 U.S.C. 10101; and
    (2) That these transactions are of limited scope and continued 
regulation is unnecessary to protect shippers from abuse of market 
power. 49 U.S.C. 10502. A notice must be filed to use this class 
exemption. The procedures are set out in Sec. 1152.50(d). This class 
exemption does not relieve a carrier of its statutory obligation to 
protect the interests of employees. 49 U.S.C. 10502(g) and 10903(b)(2). 
This also does not preclude a carrier from seeking an exemption of a 
specific abandonment or discontinuance that does not fall within this 
class.
    (d) Notice of exemption. (1) At least 10 days prior to filing a 
notice of exemption with the Board, the railroad seeking the exemption 
must notify in writing:
    (i) The Public Service Commission (or equivalent agency) in the 
state(s) where the line will be abandoned or the service or trackage 
rights discontinued;

[[Page 256]]

    (ii) Department of Defense (Military Traffic Management Command, 
Transportation Engineering Agency, Railroads for National Defense 
Program);
    (iii) The National Park Service, Recreation Resources Assistance 
Division; and
    (iv) The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Chief of the Forest 
Service.
    The notice shall name the railroad, describe the line involved, 
including United States Postal Service ZIP Codes, indicate that the 
exemption procedure is being used, and include the approximate date that 
the notice of exemption will be filed with the Board. The notice shall 
include the following statement ``Based on information in our 
possession, the line (does) (does not) contain federally granted rights-
of-way. Any documentation in the railroad's possession will be made 
available promptly to those requesting it.''
    (2) The railroad must file a verified notice using its appropriate 
abandonment docket number and subnumber (followed by the letter ``X'') 
with the Board at least 50 days before the abandonment or discontinuance 
is to be consummated. The notice shall include the proposed consummation 
date, the certification required in Sec. 1152.50(b), the information 
required in Secs. 1152.22(a) (1) through (4), (7) and (8), and (e)(4), 
the level of labor protection, and a certificate that the notice 
requirements of Secs. 1152.50(d)(1) and 1105.11 have been complied with.
    (3) The Board, through the Director of the Office of Proceedings, 
shall publish a notice in the Federal Register within 20 days after the 
filing of the notice of exemption. The notice shall include a statement 
to alert the public that following any abandonment of rail service and 
salvage of the line, the line may be suitable for other public use, 
including interim trail use. Petitions to stay the effective date of the 
notice on other than environmental or historic preservation grounds must 
be filed within 10 days of the publication. Petitions to stay the 
effective date of the notice on environmental or historic preservation 
grounds may be filed at any time but must be filed sufficiently in 
advance of the effective date in order to allow the Board to consider 
and act on the petition before the notice becomes effective. Petitions 
for reconsideration, comments regarding environmental, energy and 
historic preservation matters, and requests for public use conditions 
under 49 U.S.C. 10905 and 49 CFR 1152.28(a)(2) must be filed within 20 
days after publication. Requests for a trail use condition under 16 
U.S.C. 1247(d) and 49 CFR 1152.29 must be filed within 10 days after 
publication. The exemption will be effective 30 days after publication, 
unless stayed. If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading 
information, the use of the exemption is void ab initio and the Board 
shall summarily reject the exemption notice.
    (4) In out-of-service rail line exemption proceedings under 49 CFR 
1152.50, the Board, on its own motion, will stay the effective date of 
individual notices of exemption when an informed decision on pending 
environmental and historic preservation issues cannot be made prior to 
the date that the exemption authority would otherwise become effective.
    (5) A notice or decision to all parties will be issued if use of the 
exemption is made subject to environmental, energy, historic 
preservation, public use and/or interim trail use and rail banking 
conditions.
    (6) To address whether the standard labor protective conditions set 
forth in Oregon Short Line R. Co.--Abandonment--Goshen, 360 I.C.C. 91 
(1979), adequately protect affected employees, a petition for partial 
revocation of the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10502(d) must be filed.
    (e) Consummation notice. As provided in Sec. 1152.29(e)(2), rail 
carriers that receive authority to abandon a line under Sec. 1152.50 
must file with the Board a notice that abandonment has been consummated.

Discontinuances of Service or Trackage Rights Filed Under the 49 U.S.C. 
                        10502 Exemption Procedure


<R05>
Sec. 1152.60  Special rules.

    (a) This section contains special rules applicable to any proceeding 
instituted under the 49 U.S.C. 10502 exemption procedure for either the 
abandonment of a rail line or the discontinuance of service or trackage 
rights over a rail line. General rules applicable to any proceeding 
filed under the 49 U.S.C. 10502 exemption procedure may be found at 49 
CFR part 1121, but the rules in part 1152 control in case of any 
conflict with the general exemption rules. In the case of petitions for 
exemption for abandonment, notice of the filing of the petition will be 
published by the Board, through the Director of the Office of 
Proceedings, in the Federal Register 20 days after the petition is 
filed. There will be no further Federal Register publication later if 
and when a petition is granted.
    (b) Any petition filed under the 49 U.S.C. 10502 exemption procedure 
for either the abandonment of a rail line or the discontinuance of 
service or trackage rights over a rail line must be accompanied by a map 
that meets the requirements of Sec. 1152.22(a)(4) of this part.
    (c) A petitioner for an abandonment exemption shall submit, with its 
petition, a draft Federal Register notice of its petition according to 
the form prescribed below:

    Draft Federal Register Notice. The petitioner shall submit a draft 
notice of its petition to be published by the Board within 20 days of 
the petition's filing with the Board. The petitioner must submit a copy 
of the draft notice as data contained on a computer diskette compatible 
with the Board's current word processing capabilities. The draft notice 
shall be in the form set forth below:

extending from railroad milepost near (station name) to (the end of line 
or rail milepost) near (station name), which traverses through ______ 
(ZIP Codes) United States Postal Service ZIP Codes, a distance of ______ 
miles, in [County(ies), State(s)]. The line for which the abandonment 
(or discontinuance) exemption request was filed includes the stations of 
(list all stations on the line in order of milepost number, indicating 
milepost location).
    The line (does) (does not) contain federally granted rights-of-way. 
Any documentation in the railroad's possession will be made available 
promptly to those requesting it.
    The interest of railroad employees will be protected by (specify the 
appropriate conditions).
    Any offer of financial assistance will be due no later than 10 days 
after service of a decision granting the petition for exemption.
    All interested persons should be aware that following abandonment of 
rail service and salvage of the line, the line may be suitable for other 
public use, including interim trail use.
    Any request for a public use condition and any request for trail 
use/rail banking will be due no later than 20 days after notice of the 
filing of the petition for exemption is published in the Federal 
Register.
    Persons seeking further information concerning abandonment 
procedures may contact the Surface Transportation Board or refer to the 
full abandonment or discontinuance regulations at 49 CFR part 1152. 
Questions concerning environmental issues may be directed to the Board's 
Section of Environmental Analysis.
    An environmental assessment (EA) (or environmental impact statement 
(EIS), if necessary) prepared by the Section of Environmental Analysis 
will be served upon all parties of record and upon any agencies or other 
persons who commented during its preparation. Any other persons who 
would like to obtain a copy of the EA (or EIS) may contact the Section 
of Environmental Analysis. EAs in these abandonment proceedings normally 
will be made available within 60 days of the filing of the petition. The 
deadline for submission of comments on the EA will generally be within 
30 days of its service.

    (d) A petitioner for an abandonment exemption must serve a copy of 
the petition on the persons receiving notices of exemption under 
Sec. 1152.50(d). The petition must include the following statement: 
``Based on information in our possession, the line (does) (does not) 
contain federally granted right-of-way.

[[Page 258]]

Any documentation in petitioner's possession will be made available 
promptly to those requesting it.''
    (e) As Provided in Sec. 1152.29(e)(2), rail carriers that receive 
authority to abandon a line by individual exemption under 49 U.S.C. 
10502 must file with the Board a notice that abandonment has been 
consummated.

<R05>
Sec. 1155.1  Purpose of the standards.

    (a) The 3R Act established a method of preserving rail service that 
would otherwise be discontinued as a result of the restructuring process 
developed by the final system plan. Section 304(c)(2) of the 3R Act, as 
amended, provides that no rail service or properties may be discontinued 
or abandoned if a financially responsible person or government entity 
offers a subsidy which: (1) Covers the difference between the carrier's 
revenues attributable to such rail properties and the carrier's 
avoidable costs of providing rail service on such properties, together 
with a reasonable management fee, and (2) includes a reasonable return 
on the value of such properties. Further, the person offering the 
subsidy shall designate the operator of the continued rail service.
    (b) RSPO was directed to develop and publish standards to determine 
``revenues attributable to the rail properties,'' the ``avoidable costs 
of providing service,'' a ``reasonable return on the value,'' and a 
``reasonable management fee'' as those phrases are used in section 304 
of the 3R Act as amended. These standards (49 CFR part 1155), developed 
by RSPO and referred to as the ``Regional Subsidy Standards,'' are 
applicable only for subsidized freight operations over those rail 
properties of the railroads in reorganization which were not conveyed to 
ConRail. (Methods governing the calculation of subsidies for rail 
properties of other railroads as well as those properties conveyed to 
ConRail are covered by a separate set of standards (49 CFR part 1152) 
and are referred to as the ``National Subsidy Standards.'')
    (c) These standards intend that parties to a subsidy agreement 
utilize arms-length negotiation to the fullest extent possible in 
establishing and executing a subsidy operating agreement. The standards 
presented here develop the methodologies for:
    (1) Calculating a subsidy estimate to be used as a basis for a 
subsidy offer under section 304(c)(2) of the 3R Act, as amended,
    (2) Determining the actual revenues and costs of a subsidized 
operation during the subsidy year, and
    (3) Establishing a return on the value of the properties used in 
continuing the rail service.

Parties may agree in arms-length negotiations to provisions which modify 
these standards, subject to review of such modifications by RSPO. RSPO 
would not expect to disapprove variations from the standards which are 
the product of arms-length negotiations and which are shown to be 
reasonable in the light of pertinent facts and circumstances. When an 
agreement has been reached, a copy shall be filed promptly with RSPO for 
its review.
    (d) In brief, the standards describe the method for establishing a 
subsidy estimate, the basis for paying this estimate during the subsidy 
year, the

[[Page 259]]

method of calculating the actual subsidy during the subsidy period, and 
the provisions for adjusting for the difference between the estimated 
subsidy and the actual subsidy at the end of the subsidy period.
    (e) For further information regarding these standards, persons may 
contact RSPO's Cost Evaluation Branch at 202-254-7552.

    Base year means, for initial subsidy estimates, the year employed by 
the U.S. Railway Association in developing the final system plan (1973). 
For subsequent subsidy estimates, the base year is the year immediately 
preceding the year for which the subsidy estimate is being calculated.

    Rail Form A means the STB's formula for use in determining rail 
freight service costs, statement 1F1-73.
    Railroad means a railroad company, or the trustee or trustees of a 
railroad company, that gives a notice in writing of intent to 
discontinue service under section 304(a) of the 3R act, and, as the 
context requires, ``railroad'' may mean either the owner of rail 
properties over which subsidized service is or may be performed, or the 
operator of that service, or both.
    RSPO means the Rail Services Planning Office established by section 
205 of the 3R Act.

means that all accounts containing the remaining four digits are to be 
used in the procedure being described. Example: ``11-21-XX'' refers to 
all salary and wage accounts for locomotives because ``11'' designates 
salaries and wages and ``21'' designates locomotives. Thus, ``11-21-XX'' 
includes all of the following accounts: 11-21-01, 11-21-40, 11-21-48, 
11-21-39, and 11-21-99. Similarly, ``XX-31-67'' means all accounts

<R05>
Sec. 1155.3  Procedure for calculating a subsidy estimate.

    (a) Discontinuance notice and subsidy offer procedures--(1) Notice 
of discontinuance. A railroad giving notice of intent to discontinue 
service on a branch shall provide an ``Estimate of Subsidy Payment'' and 
shall distribute copies

[[Page 260]]

of this estimate to the Director of RSPO, the Governor and railroad 
regulatory Board of each State within which the branch is located, and 
any other person upon request. The format of the ``Estimate of Subsidy 
Payment'' is prescribed in appendix I. The subsidy estimate shall be the 
difference between the revenues attributable to the rail properties and 
the avoidable costs of providing service on such rail properties, 
together with a reasonable management fee, plus a reasonable return on 
the value of the properties. Beginning with the week in which it gives 
notice of intent to discontinue service on the branch, pursuant to 
section 304(a)(1)(B) of the 3R Act, the railroad shall publish a copy of 
that notice of intent in a newspaper or newspapers of general 
circulation in the area encompassing the branch at least once a week for 
three consecutive weeks. Each railroad shall include in the required 
notices a statement of the address of the railroad's office within the 
State or States where interested persons may examine, during regular 
working hours, the materials and information upon which the subsidy 
estimate calculations were made. If the railroad so requests, 
examination of documents which disclose information concerning the 
nature, kind, quantity, destination, consignee, or routing of traffic 
may be restricted to the representative of the person offering a subsidy 
and then only if that representative agrees to keep that information 
confidential. A notice of intent to discontinue service, according to 
section 304(a)(1)(B) of the 3R Act, is not considered complete or given 
until the railroad has fulfilled these requirements.
    (2) Subsidy offer. Persons wishing to subsidize rail service 
proposed for discontinuance shall:
    (i) Communicate in writing with the railroad selected as the 
designated operator for the continuation of such service, offering to 
pay such operator the estimated subsidy amount, and
    (ii) Communicate in writing with the trustee(s) or owner(s) of the 
railroad which owns the branch line, offering to pay a reasonable return 
on the value of the properties.

Upon the offer of a subsidy from a financially responsible person, 
discontinuance of the rail service or abandonment of the rail properties 
for which the subsidy is being offered is prohibited, pursuant to 
section 304(c)(2)(A) of the 3R Act. The parties are free to negotiate 
operating levels and reasonable variations from the standards, but when 
impasse occurs in the negotiations, the standards established here can 
be invoked.

Because USRA was not required to utilize the standards promulgated by 
RSPO as criteria for inclusion of branch lines in the final system plan, 
it is possible that a branch line could be excluded from the final 
system plan and yet generate revenues which exceed the costs as 
calculated under these standards. Therefore, RSPO has established the 
amount that a potential subsidizer must offer under section 304(c)(2)(A) 
as the amount computed by the subsidy estimate formula or $1.00, 
whichever is the greater.
    (3) Use of prior subsidy standards. Even though these standards 
become effective January 1, 1978, parties to existing subsidy agreements 
may agree to continue to use the standards in effect prior to January 1, 
1978, for the remainder of the current subsidy year.
    (4) Basis of estimated subsidy. The estimated subsidy for the 
subsidy year immediately following conveyance in the reorganization 
process (ConRail start-up date) shall be calculated according to an 
interim formula based on data from 1973, which was the base year 
employed by USRA in developing the final system plan. This interim 
formula, using 1973 data, is to be employed only for the calculation of 
initial subsidy agreements; once a subsidy agreement is in place, 
subsequent years' estimates shall be based on data drawn from the 
preceding subsidy year. Estimates for revenues, on-branch avoidable 
costs, off-branch costs, a reasonable management fee, and a return on 
value shall be calculated according to the procedures in Secs. 1155.3(b) 
through 1155.3(f) inclusive. The subsidy estimate procedure relies in 
many instances on the same formulas that are used to calculate the 
actual subsidy amount; the basic difference between the estimated and 
actual subsidy calculations is that

[[Page 261]]

the actual subsidy amount is calculated using data reflecting the 
experience of the subsidy year, while the estimate is based on 
anticipated operational results.
    (b) Estimated revenues. Using base year data, estimated revenues 
shall include all sources of revenue and income prescribed as revenues 
and income attributable to the rail properties in the calculation of the 
actual subsidy, see Sec. 1155.6.
    (c) Estimated on-branch costs. On-branch cost estimates shall be 
separated and calculated as follows:
    (1) Routine maintenance of way and structures. These expenses shall 
be estimated at $1,000 per year per mile of track on the branch for 
which the railroad is responsible for maintenance, unless the parties 
agree to a higher level.
    (2) Rehabilitation. Rehabilitation costs shall not be included 
unless: (i) The track involved does not meet minimum FRA class I safety 
standards (49 CFR part 213), in which case, the railroad shall furnish a 
detailed estimate of the costs to rehabilitate the track to FRA class I 
level with the notice of intent and provision to cover such costs shall 
be included in the subsidy agreements; or (ii) The potential subsidizer 
requests a level of service which requires expenditures for 
rehabilitation and makes such a request within 10 days after the date of 
notice of intent is filed, in which case the railroad shall furnish an 
estimate of the costs involved within 20 days after the date of that 
request. All such requests and estimates shall refer to specific 
projects for rehabilitation.
    (3) Maintenance of equipment excluding freight cars. Estimates for 
maintenance of equipment shall be developed by applying base year data 
to the formula for calculating the actual maintenance of equipment 
expense, see Sec. 1155.7(b). Unless the parties agree to a different 
base, the resulting average unit costs shall be applied to the branch 
base year service units to arrive at the estimate.
    (4) Transportation. Transportation costs shall be estimated based on 
system average costs. The number of trips per year shall be based on the 
frequency of service performed at the time the notice is filed unless 
the parties agree to a different level. Labor costs for train crews 
shall be based on system average costs for each type of crew applied to 
the hours of service on the branch. The crew costs shall be classified 
into three major categories: Yard, local/way, and through. The straight 
time average costs per hour for each yard, local/way, or through train 
crew member shall be calculated for class I railroads by using the 
railroad's Employees, Service, and Compensation Report (Form B) for the 
base year. The calculation is made by adding together the straight time 
compensation and the constructive allowances, and dividing this total by 
the straight time hours actually worked. This process would be repeated 
for each yard, local/way, and through train class of employee. For class 
II railroads, the straight time average cost per hour for each yard, 
local/way, or through train crew member shall be calculated in the same 
manner, using the railroad's payroll records for the base year. After 
the hourly rate is determined for each member, the cost per crew hour 
shall be calculated based on the exact size and consist of the crew 
currently serving the branch. The crew cost per hour is multiplied by 
the estimated hours that will be incurred in serving the branch during 
the subsidy period. The estimated direct crew costs must be increased to 
cover fringe benefits using the procedure specified in Sec. 1155.7(c). 
The railroad shall also furnish estimates of costs for the remaining 
transportation accounts using Sec. 1155.7(c) as a guide to their 
inclusion and basis of calculation.
    (5) General administrative expenses. In exceptional circumstances, 
the railroad may be allowed to include general administrative expenses. 
Such expenses are allowable only if the size of the railroad's operation 
(measured in total mileage, gross revenues, gross ton-miles, or car-
miles) is increased by more than 25 percent as a result of operating the 
subsidized service, or the individual line being operated under a 
subsidy agreement generates $10 million or more in gross revenues per 
annum. If the railroad foresees this increase, then estimates may be 
calculated for the accounts included under

[[Page 262]]

general administrative costs in Sec. 1155.7(d).
    (6) Deadheading, taxi, and hotel costs. Estimates for these costs 
shall be determined from base year data reflecting deadheading, taxi, 
and hotel costs incurred as a result of providing service to the branch 
line. The amounts under this section shall not be included under the 
wage accounts for yard conductors and brakemen, yard enginemen, or 
trainmen.
    (7) Overhead movement costs. Estimates for these costs shall be 
determined from base year data reflecting overhead movement costs 
incurred as a result of providing service to the branch. The amounts 
shown shall be limited to transportation, equipment, and freight cars. 
The amounts shown under this section shall not be included under other 
sections of these standards.
    (8) Freight car costs. Freight cars costs shall be estimated by a 
method consistent with the detailed procedures specified in 
Sec. 1155.7(g).
    (9) Taxes. Estimates for property taxes shall be based on the base 
year actual tax assessment, adjusted for tax rate changes; revenue taxes 
shall be based on the estimated revenue level.
    (10) Administrative fee. The estimated administrative fee shall be 
one percent of the revenues estimated under Sec. 1155.3(b).
    (11) Casualty reserve account. Estimates for this item shall be any 
payments mutually agreed to by the person offering the subsidy and the 
railroad for the purpose of holding the subsidizer harmless from any 
liability. Such cost may include a reasonable fee to cover the cost of 
administering the fund.
    (12) Termination costs. Estimates for these costs shall be 
determined according to a projection of costs reasonably and necessarily 
incurred should service to the subsidized branch be terminated. These 
costs shall not include any costs which the railroad would have incurred 
had the branch not been operated under the subsidy program. The 15 
percent ceiling discussed in Sec. 1155.5 is not applicable to these 
costs unless they are included in the estimated subsidy amount.
    (d) Estimated off-branch costs. A ratio of off-branch costs to 
revenues for the base year shall be used to derive the estimate of off-
branch costs for the subsidy year. Base year off-branch costs shall be 
calculated using the procedure established in Sec. 1155.7(n). If data 
identifying actual carloads by car type are not available, car type 
shall be based upon the railroad's best estimate. The resulting ratio of 
base year off-branch costs to revenues shall then be applied to the 
revenues estimated under Sec. 1155.3(b) to develop the estimated off-
branch costs for the subsidy year.
    (e) Estimated management fee. The estimated management fee shall be 
four and one-half percent of the revenues estimated under 
Sec. 1155.3(b). If the railroad and the person offering the subsidy 
agree to an additional fee designed as an incentive to maximize 
revenues, minimize expenses, promote efficient service, or otherwise 
achieve public interest objectives, the railroad shall be paid such fee 
as determined in accordance with an agreement to that effect.
    (f) Estimated return on value. The railroad shall appraise the value 
of the property using the procedures described in Sec. 1155.9(a). If the 
value is challenged, an appraisal of the property by a qualified and 
certified appraiser(s) shall be offered by the potential subsidizer. If 
the parties cannot agree on a valuation through negotiation, an average 
of the two appraisals shall be used as the estimated valuation. The rate 
of return to be applied to the value of the properties shall be 
determined in accordance with Sec. 1155.9(b).


<R05>
Sec. 1155.4  Interim payments, financial reports, and interpretations.

    (a) Interim Subsidy Payments. The person offering a subsidy shall 
offer to pay, in return for the continuation of rail service, an amount 
computed on the basis of the interim formula described in Sec. 1155.3. 
The interim payment may be adjusted, by agreement of the parties, to 
take into account factors, such as rate increases and changes in traffic 
levels, which would make the

[[Page 263]]

sole use of base year data an inappropriate means of estimating the 
payment for the subsidy year or to conform to amendments to these 
standards made subsequent to the original agreement. Interest shall be 
applied to any deferred payment, calculated at the same rate as the rate 
of return on value specified in Sec. 1155.9(b), for the period of time 
such payment is outstanding. The amount estimated for the management fee 
and for the difference between the revenues attributable and the 
avoidable costs shall be paid to the railroad operating the branch line. 
The amount estimated for the return on value shall be paid directly to 
the trustee(s) or owner(s) of the property, unless the parties agree 
that such payment shall be made by the railroad in behalf of the 
subsidizer.
    (b) Financial Status Reports. The railroad must establish a system 
for collecting costs and other required data at the branch level, and 
must, within thirty days after the end of each quarter of the subsidy 
year, file with the person offering the subsidy a ``Financial Status 
Report'' which shall include the information prescribed in the method 
for calculating the actual subsidy as specified in Secs. 1155.6, 1155.7, 
and 1155.9. The format of the ``Financial Status Report'' is prescribed 
in Appendix II. Significant deviations from the original estimates must 
be explained. In all reports, the actual data reflecting the year to 
date shall show a projection to the end of the subsidy year for each 
item, except that off-branch costs shall be estimated during the subsidy 
year by applying the ratio developed in accordance with Sec. 1155.3(d) 
to the revenues.

Unless the parties agree otherwise, the last Financial Status Report 
filed during the first ten months of the subsidy year shall be the basis 
for developing the estimated subsidy payment for the subsequent year's 
agreement. The Financial Status Reports should be considered detailed 
progress reports monitoring the actual costs and revenues involved for 
operating rail service on the branch throughout the subsidy year; the 
Financial Status Reports are not to be considered as ``progress 
billings'' for subsidy services performed.
    (c) Interpretations of the Standards. Parties desiring an 
interpretation of the standards should file a written petition with OTA 
citing the section involved and setting forth their position and 
rationale. If the request arises from a dispute with other parties, the 
petitioner shall identify those parties and serve each of them with a 
copy of the petition. Parties desiring to file a reply must do so within 
10 days of their receipt of the petition. OTA will issue an 
interpretation, unless it concludes that the matter raised requires 
amendment of the standards, in which case OTA will institute a 
rulemaking proceeding. The address of OTA is:

Sec. 1155.5  Year-end adjustment.

    (a) On the basis of the railroad's year-end Final Status Report and 
the net impact of inflation developed in Secs. 1155.7(n)(5) and 
1155.8(e), the subsidy payment shall be adjusted to reconcile any 
differences between the subsidy payments actually made based on the 
estimated subsidy and the actual subsidy calculated from data reflecting 
the actual revenues and costs experienced in the operation of the branch 
during the subsidy year.
    (b) Where an adjustment results in an increase in the estimated 
subsidy payment, the amount of such increase in excess of 15 percent of 
the estimated subsidy shall be treated as a carryover advoidable cost in 
the subsequent subsidy year. This provision shall apply unless:
    (1) The railroad notifies the subsidizer in one of the Financial 
Status Reports issued during the first ten months of the subsidy year 
that the estimate will be exceeded by more than 15 percent, or
    (2) The increase results from an expense approved in advance by the 
person offering the subsidy.
    (c) Should the year-end adjustment reflect an overpayment by the 
person offering the subsidy, the amount of

[[Page 264]]

overpayment shall be reimbursed by the railroad.

Sec. 1155.6  Revenue and income attributable to branch lines.

    The revenue attributable to the rail properties is the total of the 
revenues assigned to the branch in accordance with this section, plus 
any subsidy payments that would cease upon discontinuance of service on 
the branch, for the subsidy year. The revenues assigned shall be derived 
from the following accounts:
    (a) Account 101-Freight. The revenues assigned under this account 
shall be the actual revenues, including transit revenues, accruing to 
the railroad, derived from waybills and other source documents, for all 
traffic that:
    (1) Originates or terminates on the branch;
    (2) Originates or terminates on the branch and is handled off the 
branch on the system but not on another carrier; and
    (3) Originates or terminates on the branch and is handled on another 
carrier.
    All traffic that is received or forwarded through interchange at a 
point on the branch, including ferry operations, shall be considered as 
originating or terminating on the branch. The revenues of all other 
bridge or overhead traffic shall be attributed to the branch on the 
ratio of miles moved on the branch to miles moved on the system, 
provided, however, that the parties may agree on a mutually acceptable 
usage charge for bridge traffic in lieu of the mileage apportionment.
    (b) Account 104--Switching; Account 105--Water transfers; Account 
106--Demurrage; Account 110--Incidental: Account 121--Joint Facility-
Credit; Account 122--Joint Facility-Debit; Account 506--Revenues from 
Properties Used in Other Than Carrier Operations; Account 510--
Miscellaneous Rent Income; Account 519--Miscellaneous Income. The 
revenues assigned under these accounts shall be the actual revenues 
accruing to the railroad that are directly attributable to the branch.

Sec. 1155.7  Calculation of avoidable costs and management fee.

    (a) This section defines:
    (1) Which cost elements are eligible for inclusion in the 
calculation of avoidable costs;
    (2) The conditions under which certain cost elements become eligible 
for inclusion; and
    (3) The basis of apportioning those cost elements which are not 
assigned to the branch on an actual expense basis.
    (b) The avoidable costs of providing freight service on a branch 
shall be the total of the just and reasonable charges assigned to the 
branch in accordance with this section. Those expenses apportioned under 
this section shall be derived from the latest Form R-1 or R-2 or R-3 of 
the railroad filed with the STB prior to the conclusion of the subsidy 
year, and assigned to the branch according to the procedures set forth 
in Sec. 1155.8 of these regulations.
    (c) When the term ``actual'' is specified as the basis for assigning 
an expense, it shall mean that the only costs which can be assigned to 
the account are those costs which are incurred solely as a result of the 
continuation of rail freight service on the branch.
    (d) The accounts in the following charts, which list only the 
``freight-only'' account numbers, shall include the portion of common 
expenses that

[[Page 265]]

have been apportioned to freight service.

Salaries and wages--freight cars--repairs and maintenance; Account 21-
22-42--Materials--freight cars--repairs and maintenance; Account 39-22-
42--Repairs billed by others (Debit)--freight cars--repairs and 
maintenance; Account 40-22-42--Repairs billed to others (Credit)--
freight cars--repairs and maintenance; Account 41-22-42--Other purchased 
services--freight cars--repairs and maintenance; Account 61-22-42--Other 
expenses--freight cars--repairs and maintenance; Account 31-22-00--Lease 
rentals (Debit) freight cars; Account 32-22-00--Lease Rentals (Credit)--
freight cars; Account 35-22-00--Other rents (Debit)--freight cars; 
Account 36-22-00--Other rents (Credit--freight cars; and Account 62-22-
00--Depreciation--freight cars; and the return on investment in freight 
cars. The system total of the repair and maintenance accounts, all 
accounts designated XX-XX-42, and depreciation shall be divided into 
time related costs and mileage related costs on the basis of the present 
Rail Form A apportionment factors (i.e., 50 percent time and 50 percent 
mileage for repairs, and 60 percent time and 40 percent mileage for 
depreciation). Return on investment shall be treated as a 100 percent 
time-related cost. The system total receipts and payments for the hire 
of time mileage cars and the basic data used in the development of the 
car-day and car-mile factors shall be taken from the railroad's latest 
Form R-1 and company records. The specific steps to complete the 
calculations are as follows:
    (1) The total system car days by car type shall be calculated by 
averaging

[[Page 278]]

the railroad's freight car ownership at the beginning and ending of the 
year (R-1, schedule 710, columns (b) and (k)), multiplying the average 
by the standard active number of car days (346) as developed in ICC 
Docket Number 31358; subtracting car days on foreign lines (source: 
Company records) and adding the foreign car days on home line (source: 
Company records). This procedure shall be completed for each car type 
specified in Ex Parte 334.
    (2) The total railroad car miles shall be calculated by adding the 
loaded car miles for railroad owned and leased cars (Form OSA, column 
(d), items 5-010 through 5-027), to the empty car miles for railroad 
owned and leased cars (Form OSA, column (d), items 5-110 through 5-127). 
The total car miles, loaded and empty shall be calculated for each car 
type specified in Ex Parte 334.
    (3) The cost per car-day shall be calculated for each type of time-
mileage car by adding 50 percent of the total freight car repair costs 
for each car type (R-1, schedule 415, column (b)); 60 percent of the 
depreciation costs for each car type (R-1, schedule 415, column (c)); 
100 percent of return on investment, which is calculated by obtaining 
the net depreciated investment for each car type and multiplying it by 
the cost of capital ratio developed for use in Form 2 of the unrevised 
Rail Form A of the railroad; the time portion of the railroad's payments 
for hire of time-mileage freight cars (R-1, schedule 366, columns (h) 
and (i)); subtracting the time portion of the railroad's receipts for 
hire of time-mileage freight cars (R-1, schedule 366, columns (d) and 
(e)); and dividing the result by the total car days for each car type 
developed in paragraph (1).
    (4) The cost per mile shall be calculated for each type of time-
mileage car by adding 50 percent of the total freight train car repair 
cost for each car type (R-1, schedule 415, column (b)); 40 percent of 
the total depreciation costs for each car type (R-1, schedule 415, 
column (c)); the mileage portion of the railroad's payments for the hire 
of time-mileage freight cars (R-1, schedule 366, column (g)); 
subtracting the mileage portion of the railroad's receipts for hire of 
time-mileage of freight cars (R-1, schedule 366, column (c)); and 
dividing the result by the total car miles for each car type developed 
in paragraph (2).
    (5) The costs per car-day and per car-mile developed in paragraphs 
(3) and (4) of this section shall be applied to the total car-days and 
total car miles for each car type accumulated on the branch for all 
traffic originated and/or terminated on the branch and all bridge 
traffic handled by the branch during the subsidy period which are 
attributed to time-mileage freight-train cars. The car-day and car-mile 
factors shall be furnished by the railroads.
    (6) The on-branch costs for freight cars rented on a straight 
mileage basis shall be the railroad's total payments for mileage cars 
(R-1, schedule 366, column (f)), for each car type; divided by the total 
miles on which the charges were based.
    (7) For Class II railroads, the on-branch costs for time-mileage and 
straight mileage freight cars shall be calculated in the same manner 
prescribed for Class I railroads, using the latest data available.
    (h) Revenue taxes. The amount of revenue taxes shall be computed 
based on the amounts directly paid in those States that subject the 
railroad to a revenue tax.
    (i) Property taxes. (1) The amount of property taxes shall be the 
amount levied against the property on the branch, in those States where 
a true ad valorem tax is levied, based on the value of certain kinds of 
railroad property, such as track, land, buildings, and other facilities.
    (2) In States where property taxes are assessed on the basis of a 
formula of a statewide valuation of property and the branch or branches 
are included in the valuation of the railroad operating the service, the 
tax on each branch shall be based on the distribution of the assessment 
by the State to that branch and the application of the appropriate tax 
rate or rates.
    (3) In States where the real property taxes are assessed and levied 
against the owner of the property but the rolling stock is assessed to 
the railroad operating the service on the basis of a formula of a 
statewide valuation of

[[Page 279]]

property, the tax on rolling stock attributable to each branch shall be 
determined as follows:
    (i) Find the percent which the cost of equipment as used in the 
formula is to the total of all property cost as used in the formula;
    (ii) Apply that percentage to the total State assessment to 
determine the portion of the assessment attributable to rolling stock;
    (iii) Allocate the rolling stock assessment thus determined to each 
branch on the basis of car and locomotive unit miles on the branch to 
total car and locomotive unit miles in the State;
    (iv) Apply appropriate tax rate or rates to the allocated assessment 
thus determined.
    (j) Administrative fee. A carrier shall be entitled to receive an 
administrative fee only if the carrier is not entitled to include 
General Administrative Expenses, Sec. 1155.7(d), as an avoidable cost. 
The administrative fee shall be calculated as one percent of the total 
revenues attributed to the branch under Sec. 1155.6 and shall be allowed 
as an avoidable cost to the railroad to cover all costs of administering 
the subsidy program.
    (k) Deferred subsidy payment. If the subsidy estimate or adjustment 
is paid in deferred payments, the railroad shall be compensated for the 
use of its working capital by applying the interest rate established in 
Sec. 1155.9(b) to the deferred payment for the period of time such 
payment is outstanding.
    (l) Casualty reserve account. The costs assigned under this account 
shall be any payment mutually agreed to by the person offering the 
subsidy and the railroad for the purpose of holding the subsidizer 
harmless from any liability under those accounts that are used to record 
any costs incurred by the railroad as a result of personal injury or 
property damage.
    (m) Termination Costs. The costs assigned under this subsection 
shall be the actual costs reasonably and necessarily incurred as a 
result of terminating service to the subsidized branch. These costs 
shall not include any costs which the railroad would have incurred had 
the branch not been operated under the subsidy program. The 15 percent 
ceiling contained in Sec. 1155.5 is not applicable to those costs unless 
such costs were included in the estimated subsidy payment.
    (n) Off-Branch Costs. Until the STB revises the Rail Form A cost 
procedure to facilitate the incorporation of the new USOA as well as 
review and if necessary change the theories contained within the present 
formula the procedure for determining the off-branch costs will use the 
existing Rail Form A formula applied to the latest Annual Report, Form 
R-1, that has been filed by the railroad using the prior unrevised 
accounting system. The development of the off-branch costs shall be as 
follows:
    (1) Terminal costs, line-haul car costs, and interchange costs shall 
be considered as the off-branch avoidable costs of providing service 
over the remainder of the railroad's system. These costs shall be 
computed by applying variable unit costs to the service units attributed 
to the branch traffic during the subsidy period.
    (2) The following through-train, single-line, variable unit costs 
shall be developed by a Class I railroad by applying Rail Form A to data 
contained in its latest Form R-1 filed with the Board:
    (i) Normal Rail Form A carload terminal cost per carload by car 
type.
    (ii) Modified Rail Form A carload terminal cost per carload by car 
type (i.e., (a) substitute an intertrain switching cost separated 
between mileage and other than mileage cars, in place of a roadtrain to 
industry switching cost; (b) substitute modified car ownership costs per 
car-day for two days developed in accordance with Sec. 1155.7(g), above, 
for the standard Rail Form A car ownership cost).
    (iii) Rail Form A per hundredweight terminal cost.
    (iv) Rail Form A cost per car-mile by car type.
    (v) Rail Form A cost per ton-mile.
    (vi) Rail Form A cost per car interchanged, separated between 
mileage and other than mileage cars.

These costs shall be applied by Class I railroads in accordance with the 
procedure set forth below in Sec. 1155.7(n)(3).
    (3) Calculations by car type: (i) The sum of all terminal costs 
incurred off the branch line shall be calculated by

[[Page 280]]

multiplying the modified terminal cost per carload by car type, 
paragraph (n)(2)(ii) above, by the total number of carloads originated 
or terminated on the branch line during the subsidy year. To this amount 
add the normal terminal cost per carload by car type, paragraph 
(n)(2)(i) above, times the number of carloads which originated or 
terminated on the branch that are local to the railroad serving the 
branch.
    (ii) The sum of the hundredweight terminal costs incurred off the 
branch line shall be calculated by multiplying the hundredweight of 
freight originated or terminated on the branch that are local to the 
railroad serving the branch.
    (iii) The sum of the line-haul car-mile costs incurred off the 
branch line shall be calculated by multiplying the car-mile cost by car 
type, paragraph (n)(2)(iv) above, by the loaded car-miles generated off 
the branch line by cars originated or terminated on the branch during 
the subsidy year. Where overhead movements to and from the branch have 
been included in the on-branch cost calculation under other sections of 
Sec. 1155.7, the related loaded car-miles shall be excluded from this 
calculation.
    (iv) The sum of the line-haul ton-mile costs shall be determined by 
multiplying the ton-mile cost, paragraph (n)(2)(v) above, by the total 
ton-miles of revenue freight incurred by the railroad on its lines, 
other than the branch lines, for revenue freight originated or 
terminated on the branch during the subsidy year.
    (v) The interchange cost shall be calculated by multiplying the cost 
per car interchanged, paragraph (n)(2)(vi) above, by the number of 
carloads of traffic interchanged at a point off the branch line and 
originated or terminated on the branch.
    (4) Class II and Class III line-haul railroads shall calculate off-
branch costs as follows (based on: The carrier's latest Form R-2 or R-3 
filed with the STB; the STB's latest Rail Carload Cost Scales; and the 
carrier's own records):
    (i) A carrier that has only freight operations shall calculate the 
estimated system variable expenses by multiplying the total operating 
expenses by .78, the three-year composite variability ratio for all 
Class I railroads. If a carrier has passenger and freight service, the 
freight portion of the total estimated system variable expenses shall be 
calculated by multiplying the total estimated system variable expenses, 
calculated as above, by the ratio of freight related operating expenses 
to total railway operating expenses [freight related operating expenses 
divided by total railway operating expenses].
    (ii) The total number of revenue carload terminal handlings shall be 
determined from company records [originating and terminating (local) 
revenue carloads multiplied by 2, plus originating or terminating and 
interchange (interline) revenue carloads].
    (iii) The total number of revenue carload interchange handlings 
shall be determined from company records [bridge (interchange to 
interchange) revenue carloads multiplied by 2, plus revenue carloads 
that are originated or terminated and interchanged (interline)].
    (iv) The average load per car shall be determined from company 
records [ton-miles-revenue freight, divided by loaded freight car-
miles].
    (v) The ratios employed to separate the estimated system variable 
expenses between interchange, terminal and line-haul operations are 
calculated as follows:
    (A) Theoretical interchange expenses are calculated by multiplying 
the number of revenue carload interchange handlings, paragraph 
(n)(4)(iii) of this section, by the interchange variable cost per 
carload for other than box, unequipped, refrigerator, tank and TOFC cars 
(STB Rail Carload Cost Scales, Table 12, Line 6 or 14, appropriate 
region, multiplied by 100).
    (B) Theoretical terminal carload expenses are calculated by 
multiplying the number of revenue carload terminal handlings, paragraph 
(n)(4)(ii) of this section, by the average train variable terminal cost 
per carload for box-general service, equipped (one half of the terminal 
cost per carload STB Rail Carload Scales, Table 3, appropriate region, 
line 2, col. (6)).
    (C) Theoretical terminal lading expenses are calculated by 
multiplying

[[Page 281]]

the total terminal tons [terminal carload handlings, paragraph 
(n)(4)(ii) of this section, multiplied by average load per car, 
paragraph (n)(4)(iv) of this section] by the average train variable 
terminal cost per ton for box-general service, equipped [one half of the 
terminal cwt. cost, STB Rail Carload Cost Scales, Table 3, appropriate 
region, line 2 col. (7), multiplied by 20].
    (D) Theoretical line-haul car expenses are calculated by multiplying 
the carrier's loaded car-miles by the average train variable cost per 
car-mile excluding interchange, for box-general service, equipped [STB 
Rail Carload Cost Scales, Table 3, appropriate region, Line 2, col. (4) 
minus Appendix B, appropriate region, Line 2, col. (4)].
    (E) Theoretical line-haul lading expenses are calculated by 
multiplying the carrier's total ton-miles of revenue freight by the 
average train variable ton-mile cost for a box-general service, equipped 
[wt-mile cost STB Rail Carload Cost Scales, Table 3, appropriate region, 
Line 2, col. (5), multiplied by 20].
    (F) Theoretical station clerical expenses are calculated by 
multiplying total revenue carload terminal handlings, paragraph 
(n)(4)(ii) of this section, by the variable station clerical cost per 
carload [one half of the station clerical cost per carload, STB Rail 
Carload Cost Scales, Table 18, appropriate region, Line (2) multiplied 
by 100].
    (G) Total theoretical system variable expenses are calculated by 
adding paragraph (n)(4)(v)(A) plus (n)(4)(v)(B) plus (n)(4)(v)(C) plus 
(n)(4)(v)(D) plus (n)(4)(v)(E) of this section.
    (H) The ratio for interchange variable expenses is calculated by 
dividing total theoretical interchange variable expenses, paragraph 
(n)(4)(v)(A) of this section, by the total theoretical system variable 
expenses, paragraph (n)(4)(v)(G) of this section.
    (I) The ratio for terminal variable expenses is calculated by 
dividing the total theoretical terminal variable expenses, paragraph 
(n)(4)(v)(B) plus (n)(4)(v)(C) of this section, by the total theoretical 
system variable expenses, paragraph (n)(4)(v)(G) of this section.
    (J) The ratio for line-haul variable expenses is calculated by 
dividing total theoretical line-haul variable expenses, paragraph 
(n)(4)(v)(D) plus (n)(4)(v)(E) of this section, divided by the total 
theoretical system variable expenses, paragraph (n)(4)(v)(G) of this 
section.
    (K) The ratio for station clerical variable expenses is calculated 
by dividing total theoretical station clerical variable expenses, 
paragraph (n)(4)(v)(F) above, by the total theoretical system variable 
expenses, paragraph (n)(4)(v)(G) above.

(n)(4)(v)(K) of this section.
    (vii) The carrier's unit costs shall be determined as follows:
    (A) The interchange cost per carload shall be calculated by dividing 
the total interchange variable expense, paragraph (n)(4)(vi)(A) above by 
the total number of interchange handlings, paragraph (n)(4)(iii) of this 
section.
    (B) The terminal cost per carload shall be calculated the total 
terminal variable expenses, paragraph (n)(4)(vi)(B) above, by the total

[[Page 282]]

the station clerical cost per carload total station clerical variable 
expense, paragraph (n)(4)(vi)(D) of this section, divided by the total 
number of terminal handlings, paragraph (n)(4)(ii) of this section].
    (viii) The interchange costs shall be calculated by multiplying the 
interchange cost per carload, paragraph (n)(4)(vii)(A) above, by the 
number of carloads of traffic interchanged with other railroads.
    (ix) The terminal costs shall be calculated by multiplying the 
modified terminal cost per carload, paragraph (n)(4)(vii)(D) of this 
section, times the number of carloads which originated or terminated on 
the branch during the subsidy year. To this amount add the normal 
terminal cost per carload, paragraph (n)(4)(vii)(B) of this section, 
times the number of carloads which originated or terminated on the 
branch that are local to the railroad serving the branch.
    (x) The line-haul costs shall be calculated by multiplying the line-
haul cost per car-mile, paragraph (n)(4)(vii)(C) of this section, by the 
loaded car-miles generated off the branch by cars originated or 
terminated on the branch during the subsidy year.
    (5) The railroad shall be entitled to recover the impact of 
inflation on off-branch costs that occur during the period between the 
calendar year which is used for developing subsidy year unit costs and 
the 12 month period covered by the subsidy agreement. Calendar year used 
in this section shall mean the January 1 to December 31 period used to 
develop unit costs that are applied to the subsidy year operations. The

    (A) Employee Compensation Update Ratio. (1) The calendar year 
average straight-time compensation per hour is determined by: Adding the 
total straight-time compensation for transportation employees to the 
total straight-time compensation for train and engine employees; divided 
by the total straight-time service hours for

[[Page 283]]

transportation employees plus the total straight-time service hours for 
train and engine employees, [STB Annual Report of Employees, Service and 
Compensation, Forms A and B];
    (2) The subsidy year average straight-time compensation per hour is 
determined by: Adding the total straight-time compensation for 
transportation employees to the total straight-time compensation for 
train and engine employees, for the twelve months of the subsidy year;

maximum annual tax per employee for Railroad Unemployment Insurance, 
[Bureau of the Actuary, U.S. Railroad Retirement Board]; divided by 
2080, the average annual number of working hours per year. The quotient 
is added to the hourly rate for supplemental annuities, [National 
Railway Labor Conference];
    (2) The subsidy year employer contribution rate per hour is 
determined by: Multiplying the employer's monthly rate for Railroad 
Retirement and Railroad Unemployment Insurance by the maximum monthly 
individual employee's wage base, respectively, for the twelve months of 
the subsidy year, [Bureau of the Actuary, U.S. Railroad Retirement 
Board]; and dividing by 2080, the average annual number of working hours 
per year. The quotient is added to the hourly rate for supplemental 
annuities, [National Railway Labor Conference];

welfare costs is the sum of the twelve monthly average costs per 
employee developed in this subsection.
    (2) Subsidy year Health and Welfare costs are determined by dividing 
total monthly costs for each month, company records, by total employees, 
middle of the month count, [STB Monthly Report of Employees, Service, 
and Compensation, Forms A and B]. The total subsidy year health and 
welfare costs is the sum of the twelve monthly average costs per 
employee developed in this subsection.
    (3) The Health and Welfare Costs Update Ratio is determined by:

    (E) Fuel Cost Update Ratio. (1) The calendar year average fuel cost 
per gallon is determined by: Dividing the cost of Fuel, Diesel Oil, 
schedule 750, col. (b), by the number of gallons, Diesel Oil, consumed 
in freight, passenger and yard switching service, schedule 750, col. 
(b);
    (2) The subsidy year average fuel cost per gallon is determined by: 
Dividing the cost of fuel, diesel oil, company records, for the subsidy 
year, by the number of gallons, diesel oil consumed in freight, 
passenger and yard switching operations, company records, for the 
subsidy year.
    (3) The Fuel Cost Update Ratio is determined by: Dividing the 
subsidy year fuel cost per gallon, paragraph (n)(5)(ii)(E)(2) by the

Dividing the cost of electric kilowatt hours [company records], by the 
kilowatt hours consumed by freight, passenger, and yard switching 
operations [company records];
    (3) The Electric Power Cost Ratio is determined by: Dividing the 
subsidy year cost per kilowatt hour, paragraph (n)(5)(ii)(F)(2) by the

Sec. 1155.8  Apportionment rules for the assignment of expenses to on-branch costs.

    The accounts specified under Sec. 1155.7(a), (b), (c), and (d) as 
having an assignment basis other than ``Actual'' shall be apportioned 
according to the rules contained in this section.
    (a) Maintenance of way and structures--(1) Roadway machines. All 
accounts designated XX-13-36 shall be assigned to the branch on the 
basis of the average repair cost, for each type of machine, included in 
the daily rental fees charged by the operating railroad or as published 
by the General Manager's Association of Chicago (GMA), based on the 
actual number of days each type of machine is used on the branch.
    (2) Small tools and supplies. All accounts designated XX-13-37 shall 
be assigned to the branch as follows: (i) The costs of supplies, 
consumed in the operation of roadway machines, shall be assigned to the 
branch on the basis of the average costs of supplies per day, included 
in the daily rental fees charged by the operating railroad or as 
published by the GMA, multiplied by the

[[Page 286]]

actual number of days that the machine is used on the branch; (ii) the 
costs of small tools shall be assigned to the branch on the basis of the 
ratio that the branch amounts in Accounts 11-11-10 through 11-11-17 and 
11-11-48 plus 11-12-10 through 11-12-17 and 11-12-48 bear to the 
railroad's system total for the same accounts.
    (3) Fringe benefits. Fringe benefits shall be assigned to the branch 
separated between running, switching and other, on the ratio that the 
total branch salaries and wages bear to the total system salaries and 
wages for each activity as follows:
    (i) Fringe Benefits--Running, Account 12-11-00, total of all 11-11-
XX accounts branch to system;
    (ii) Fringe Benefits--Switching, Account 12-12-00, total of all 11-
12-XX accounts branch to system; and
    (iii) Fringe Benefits--Other, Account 12-13-00, total of all 11-13-
XX accounts branch to system.
    (b) Maintenance of equipment--(1) Locomotive repairs and 
maintenance. All accounts designated XX-21-41 shall be separated between 
yard and road with a further separation between diesel and other 
(electric). The costs for these accounts for yard locomotives shall be 
assigned to the branch separately for diesel and electric locomotives on 
the basis of the ratio of branch diesel and electric yard locomotive 
unit-hours to the total system diesel and electric yard locomotive unit-
hours. The costs for these accounts for road locomotives shall be 
assigned to the branch separately for diesel and electric locomotives on 
the basis of the ratio of branch diesel and electric locomotive gross 
ton-miles in road service to the total system diesel and electric 
locomotive gross ton-miles in road service. The costs assigned under 
these accounts for specialized equipment devoted exclusively to branch 
line service shall be the actual costs for the specific equipment used.
    (2) Locomotive Depreciation--Account 61-22-00, shall be separated 
between yard and road with a further separation between diesel and other 
(electric). The cost shall be assigned to the branch on the ratio of 
locomotive unit hours on the branch to the total locomotive unit hours 
on the system for the particular type of locomotive used to serve the 
branch The cost assigned under this account for specialized equipment 
devoted exclusively to branch line service shall be the actual cost for 
the specific equipment used.
    (3) Fringe benefits. Fringe benefits for locomotives and other 
equipment shall be assigned to the branch on the ratio that the total 
branch salaries and wages bear to the system total salaries and wages 
for each type of equipment as follows:
    (i) Locomotives--Account 12-21-00, total of all 11-21-XX accounts 
branch to system.
    (ii) Other Equipment--Account 12-23-00, total of all 11-23-XX 
accounts branch to system.
    (iii) Fringe benefits for freight cars shall be calculated by first 
estimating the total in Account 11-22-42, Freight car repairs--salaries 
and wages, that is included in the total on branch costs for freight 
cars as determined from the car day and car mile cost calculations, in 
Sec. 1155.77(g) of these regulations.

To this amount is added the branch totals in the balance of all 11-22-XX 
accounts. The ratio of this total branch amount to the system total for 
all 11-22-XX accounts is applied to Account 12-22-00, Fringe Benefits--
Freight Cars.
    (c) Transportation--(1) Train operations--(i) Engine Crews-
Materials, Account 21-31-56; Train Crews-Materials, Account 21-31-57; 
Train Inspection and Lubrication-Salaries and Wages, Account 11-31-62; 
and Train Inspection and Lubrication-Materials, Account 21-31-62. If the 
branch is served by a local/way or through train, the costs in these 
accounts shall be assigned to the branch on the weighted ratio of the 
loaded freight train cars on the branch to the total system loaded 
freight train cars, and the loaded and empty car-miles on the branch to 
the total system loaded and empty car-miles. This shall be calculated as 
follows:
    (A) To determine the car-mile portion of these accounts,
    (1) Multiply the total amounts in these accounts (from the R-1 
Annual Report, Schedule 410) by 69 percent (the ratio of train-mile and 
running expenses from Rail Form A),
    (2) Divide the amount in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A)(1) of this section 
by the

[[Page 287]]

total system loaded and empty car-miles, and
    (3) Multiply the car-mile unit cost factor from paragraph 
(c)(1)(i)(A)(2) of this section by the on-branch car-miles (loaded and 
empty).
    (B) To determine the carload portion of these accounts,
    (1) Multiply the total amounts in these accounts by 31 percent (the 
ratio of terminal expenses from Rail Form A),
    (2) Divide the amount in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B)(1) of this section 
by the total system carloads, and
    (3) Multiply the carload unit cost factor from paragraph 
(c)(1)(i)(B)(2) of this section by the onbranch carloads.
    (C) To determine the total costs assignable to the branch for these 
accounts, add the amounts developed in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(A)(3) and 
(c)(1)(i)(B)(3) of this section.
    (ii) Locomotive fuel. All accounts designated XX-31-67 shall be 
assigned to the branch line in accordance with the following procedure. 
The dollar amounts used in the determination of locomotive fuel costs 
shall be based on data contained in the most recent publication issued 
by the General Managers Association (GMA) relating to the rental of 
locomotives. The total number of locomotive unit hours incurred by the 
locomotive(s) shall then be categorized according to the applicable GMA 
horsepower classification group. The fuel cost is derived from the 
Repairs and Supplies Expenses element of the locomotive rental rates 
published by the GMA. The fuel cost per locomotive unit hour shall be 
determined for each GMA horsepower classification group by multiplying 
the latest GMA fuel cost percentage by the Repairs and Supplies Expense 
per hour included in each group. The fuel cost per locomotive unit hour 
for each applicable GMA group shall be multiplied by the number of 
locomotive unit hours incurred in serving the branch by locomotives of 
that GMA horsepower classification group. The total cost developed under 
this procedure for each horsepower classification shall be the 
locomotive fuel cost assignable to the branch line.
    (iii) Electric power purchased or produced for motive power. All 
accounts designated XX-31-68 shall be assigned to the branch on the 
ratio of road electric locomotive unit hours on the branch to the total 
system road electric locomotive unit hours.
    (iv) Servicing locomotives. All accounts designated XX-31-69 shall 
be assigned to the branch on the ratio of road locomotive unit miles on 
the branch to the total system road locomotive unit miles.
    (2) Yard operations--(i) Switch Crews--Materials, Account 21-32-64, 
and Servicing Locomotives, all accounts designated XX-32-69. The costs 
for these accounts shall be assigned to the branch on the ratio of yard 
locomotive unit hours on the branch to the system total yard locomotive 
unit hours.
    (ii) Locomotive fuel. All accounts designated XX-32-67 shall be 
assigned to the branch on the ratio of yard diesel locomotive unit hours 
on the branch to the total system yard diesel locomotive unit hours.
    (iii) Electric power purchased or produced for motive power. All 
accounts designated XX-32-68 shall be assigned to the branch on the 
ratio of yard electric locomotive unit hours on the branch to the total 
system yard electric locomotive unit hours.
    (3) Administrative support operations--(i) Loss and damage claims 
processing. All accounts designated XX-35-78 shall be assigned to the 
branch on the ratio of the number of claims processed for loss or damage 
occurring on the branch to the total number of claims processed by the 
railroad.
    (4) Transportation fringe benefits. Fringe benefits shall be 
assigned to the branch separated between train operations, yard 
operations, train and yard operations common, specialized service 
operations, and administrative support operations. The costs for each 
activity shall be assigned to the branch on the ratio that the total 
branch salaries and wages bear to the total system salaries and wages 
for each activity shown below.
    (i) Train operations, account 12-31-00, total of all 11-31-XX 
accounts branch to system.
    (ii) Yard operations, account 12-32-00, total of all 11-32-XX

accounts branch to system.
    (d) General administrative. (1) Fringe benefits, account 12-61-00, 
shall be assigned to the branch on the ratio that the total branch 
salaries and wages in all 11-61-XX accounts bear to the system total 
salaries and wages in all 11-61-XX accounts.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (e) The railroad shall be entitled to recover the impact of 
inflation on on-branch costs that occur during the period between the 
calendar year which is used for developing subsidy year unit costs and 
the 12 month period covered by the subsidy agreement. Calendar year used 
in this section shall mean the January 1, to December 31, period used to 
develop unit costs that are applied to the subsidy year operations.
    (1) The updating procedures described in paragraphs (e)(1)(A), 
(e)(1)(B) and (e)(1)(C), of this section, shall be applied to the 
applicable categories of total on-branch costs as provided in 
Sec. 1155.8(b) and (c). The on-branch updated costs shall be calculated 
as follows:
    (A) The increase in fuel costs shall be determined by multiplying 
the on-branch costs for Locomotive Fuel-Materials, [account 21-31-67 
plus account 21-32-67] by the Fuel Cost Update Ratio, [Section 
1155.7(n)(5)(ii)(E)(3), minus one].
    (B) The increase in the Electric Power Costs shall be determined by: 
Multiplying the on-branch costs for Electric Power Purchased or 
Produced-Materials, and Purchased Services [accounts, 21-31-68, 21-32-
68, 41-31-68 and 41-32-68] by the Electric Power Cost Update Ratio, 
[Section 1155.7(n)(5)(ii)(F)(3), minus one].
    (C) The increase in materials and supplies cost shall be determined 
by multiplying the on-branch materials and supplies costs, [the sum of 
accounts: Engine Crews-Materials (21-31-56); plus Train Crews-Materials 
(21-31-57); plus Train Inspection and Lubrication-Materials (21-31-62); 
plus Locomotive Repairs and Maintenance-Materials (21-21-41); plus 
Servicing Locomotive-Materials--(21-31-69); plus Switch Crews-Materials 
(21-32-64); plus Yard Operations: Servicing of Locomotives-Material (21-
32-69)] by the Materials and Supplies costs Update Ratio, [Section 
1155.7(n)(5)(ii)(G)(3), minus one].
    (2) The railroad shall recalculate on-branch car-day and car-mile 
costs as described in Sec. 1155.7(g) to reflect inflation occurring in 
Materials-Freight Cars-Repairs and Maintenance Account (21-22-42) for 
the period between the calendar year used for developing subsidy year 
unit costs and the 12-month period covered by the subsidy agreement.
    (A) The increase in freight car repairs and maintenance costs shall 
be determined by multiplying the on-branch costs for these materials 
[Account 21-22-42--Materials-Freight Cars-Repairs and Maintenance] by 
the Materials and Supplies Cost Update Ratio [section 
1155.7(n)(5)(ii)(G)(3)].
    (B) The amount in paragraph (e)(1)(A) is substituted for Account 21-
22-42--Freight Train Car-Repair and Maintenance calculated in 
Sec. 1155.7(g). Then, the total freight train car costs per car-day and 
car-mile are recalculated. The recalculated car-day and car-mile costs 
are then applied to the appropriate service units incurred during the 
subsidy year, using the procedure described in Sec. 1155.7(g).
    (C) The railroad shall calculate the net increase in freight train 
car costs by subtracting the on-branch freight train car costs, as 
provided in Sec. 1155.7(G), from the adjusted amount described in 
paragraph (e)(2)(B).
    (3) The net inflationary impact developed for a on-branch costs 
described in paragraphs (e)(1)(A), (e)(1)(B), (e)(1)(C) and (e)(2)(C) 
shall be included in the railroad's year-end Financial Status Report as 
provided in Sec. 1155.5(a).

Sec. 1155.9  Return on the value of rail properties.

    (a) Valuation of rail properties. The value of the rail properties 
on a branch shall be determined in accordance with the following:
    (1) Only the following properties on a branch may be considered:
    (i) Those that are used and useful to provide the rail services 
requested by the person offering a subsidy.
    (ii) In the absence of a request for specific services by that 
person, those properties that are used and useful to provide the rail 
service performed on the branch at the time the final system plan became 
effective, or if no service was being performed at that time, the 
services that were last performed on the branch.
    (2) The value of the properties shall be their net liquidation value 
for their highest and best use, consistent with applicable zoning and 
land use regulations, determined by computing their current market value 
for other than rail transportation purposes, less all costs of 
dismantling, and disposition of improvements necessary to make the 
remaining property available for its highest and best use.
    (3) If the railroad and person offering a subsidy cannot, within a 
period of time that either of them considers reasonable after the 
beginning of negotiations for the payment of the subsidy, agree on the 
properties that are used and useful or the net liquidation value, or 
both, the one that considers that a reasonable period of time has 
elapsed may notify the other of its intention to have the matter 
arbitrated. Each of the parties shall then appoint a representative and 
the representatives shall select an arbitrator or arbitrators mutually 
acceptable to them. The decision of the arbitrator or arbitrators shall 
be final.
    (4) If either party fails to appoint a representative within five 
days after receiving notice from the other party of its representative, 
or if the appointed representatives fail, within five days after the 
last one of them is appointed, to agree upon a mutually acceptable 
arbitrator or arbitrators, either party may submit the matter for 
arbitration to the American Arbitration Association pursuant to its 
commercial arbitration rules, and the decision of its arbitrator or 
arbitrators shall be final.
    (5) In considering the value of properties under this section, the 
arbitrator or arbitrators shall consider, among other factors, any bona 
fide offer for the properties, or a part thereof, recent sales of 
adjoining or similar properties, any available appraisals, by a 
reputable appraiser, of the properties, or a part thereof.
    (6) If the person offering a subsidy is a public body, each meeting 
of an arbitrator or arbitrators with the parties for the purpose of 
receiving information or evidence or to hear arguments or views shall be 
open to the public. Any interested member of the public may file written 
views, argument, or information with the arbitrator or arbitrators at 
any time within three days after the closing of the sessions that are 
open to the public.
    (b) Reasonable return on the value of the properties. The reasonable 
return on the value of rail properties, as determined under 
Sec. 1155.9(a) shall be the interest rate that is equal to the publicly 
quoted yield, to maturity or earliest call date, on the first business 
day of the month in which the subsidy agreement is entered into, for 
U.S. Treasury bonds or notes maturing or having an earliest call date 
approximately coterminous with the end of the subsidy period. United 
States Treasury bonds, redeemable at par before call or maturity for the 
sole purpose of applying the proceeds to payment of Federal estate 
taxes, and Treasury notes Series EA or EO shall be excluded from 
consideration for this purpose.

Sec. 1177.1  Definitions and classifications of documents.

    (a) A ``primary document'' is a mortgage (excluding those under the 
Ship Mortgage Act of 1920, as amended--46 U.S.C. et seq.), lease, 
equipment trust agreement, conditional sales agreement, assignment of a 
lease or leases which have not previously been filed, or other 
instrument evidencing the mortgage, lease, conditional sale, or bailment 
of one or more vessels operated subject to Surface Transportation Board 
jurisdiction, railroad cars, locomotives, or other rolling stock for a 
use related to interstate commerce.

[[Page 291]]

    (b) A ``secondary document'' is any assignment of rights or 
interest, supplement, or amendment to any primary or other secondary 
document. These include releases, discharges, or satisfactions, either 
total or partial.


<R05>
Sec. 1177.2  To whom documents should be submitted for recordation.

    Documents to be recorded shall be submitted in person or by mail 
addressed to the Secretary, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC 
20423. All documents submitted by mail should clearly state ``Documents 
for Recordation'' on the envelope.


<R05>

    (b) Be accompanied by at least one fully executed and acknowledged 
or verified counterpart, or if no counterpart has been executed and 
acknowledged by the parties, one certified true copy. A certified true 
copy of an original document is a complete and identical copy in all 
respects to the original attached with:
    (1) A certificate executed by a notary public, stating that he or 
she has compared the copy with the original and has found the copy to be 
complete and identical in all respects to the original document; or
    (2) A certification of the filer stating that he or she has compared 
the copy with the original and found the copy to be complete and 
identical in all respects to the original document and that he or she 
declares under penalty

[[Page 292]]

of perjury (``under the laws of the United States of America'' if 
executed outside the United States) that the foregoing is true and 
correct; or
    (3) There may be attached to the copy, affidavits, wherein the 
affidavit states that he or she has compared the copy with the original 
document and found the copy to be complete and identical in all respects 
to the original documents.
    (c) Be accompanied by the fee set forth in 49 CFR 1002.2(f)(84). 
However, assignments which are executed prior to the filing of the 
primary document and which are submitted concurrently will be treated 
along with the primary document as one for fee purposes and will be 
assessed only one fee. A lease and agreement (Philadelphia Plan) shall 
be similarly treated.
    (d) Be accompanied by a letter of transmittal requesting the 
recording of the document. For a sample of a letter, see Sec. 1177.4 
Documents submitted concurrently under the same recordation number may 
be included in a single transmittal letter. Otherwise, each document 
must have its own letter of transmittal. The letter should be addressed 
to the Secretary and include the following information:
    (1) Type of Agreement. (equipment trust, mortgage, assignment, 
etc.).
    (2) Whether document is a primary document or a secondary document 
(see Sec. 1177.1). If the document is a secondary document, it must 
contain the recordation number of the primary document to which it is 
connected, unless it is being filed concurrently with a primary document 
to which a recordation number has not yet been assigned.
    (3) A request for cross-indexing. If the document is an assignment, 
parties may request the listing of the assignment in the index under the 
name(s) of parties with continuing interest not involved in this 
particular assignment.
    (4) A description of the equipment covered in the document--(i) For 
railway equipment--The type of equipment; whether locomotives, cars, or 
other rolling stock; with any A.A.R. mechanical designation; the number 
of each type; any identifying marks such as the name or initials of the 
lessee, mortgagee, or vendee, and the road or serial number, or if more 
than one for each type of equipment, the first and last inclusive 
numbers.
    (ii) For water carrier equipment--Whether tow boats, barges or other 
vessels; type of equipment; description as contained in the United 
States Coast Guard certificate of enrollment; number of each type of 
equipment; and any identifying marks such as the name or initial of the 
lessee, mortgagee, or vendee.
    (5) Parties to the agreement, as follows:
    (i) Conditional sale-vendor, purchaser, guarantor.
    (ii) Mortgage--mortgagor, mortgagee, guarantor.
    (iii) Equipment Trust--vendor, trustee, lessor, lessee, guarantor of 
lease.
    (iv) Lease--lessee, lessor, guarantor.
    (v) Bailment--bailor, bailee, guarantor.
    (vi) Other transactions--principal debtor, trustee, guarantor, and 
other parties.
    (6) Parties to whom original document should be returned.
    (7) The amount of the enclosed fee.
    (8) A short summary (1 or 2 sentences) of the type of document and a 
very brief description of the equipment and identifying numbers. This 
summary will be entered into the index as an aid to researching the 
encumbrances to title. (For a sample of a summary, see Sec. 1177.4).
    (9) The letter must be signed by an executive officer of one of the 
parties having knowledge of the matters described in the letter, or 
their attorney or representative in fact.

    Note: If the document is a mortgage or deed of trust which contains 
a ``hereafter acquired'' or similar clause, the following statement may 
be included in the letter of transmittal in lieu of the equipment 
description above:

    ``Included in the property covered by the aforesaid mortgage (or 
deed of trust) are (here identify generally the equipment such as 
``barges, tow boats, or other vessels, railroad cars, locomotives and 
other rolling stock'') intended for use related to interstate commerce, 
or interests therein, owned by (name of mortgagor) at the date of said 
mortgage or thereafter acquired by it or its successors as owners of the 
water carriers or the lines of railway covered by the mortgage.''


[[Page 293]]



When such a mortgage or deed of trust is filed, it is not necessary to 
refile the document whenever additional rolling stock is acquired in 
order to perfect the lien of the document upon the addition of vessels 
or rolling stock.

Sec. 1177.5  Administrative procedure.

    (a) At the time of filing of a document with the Board for 
recordation, a consecutive number will be stamped upon the original 
document and upon the copies or the counterparts, with the date and hour 
of the filing. A notation acknowledging that the document has been filed 
pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 11303 will be made. The original document, along 
with the notation, will be returned to the party named in the 
transmittal letter and a copy or counterpart will be retained by the 
Board. For a secondary document, the number assigned will be the 
recordation number of the primary document plus the next available 
letter suffix.
    (b) The Board will maintain an index for public use as required by 
49 U.S.C 11303(b). There will be an index of parties to documents 
recorded at the Board in alphabetical order by the party's name. If 
requested by the letter of transmittal, this index will also be amended 
to reflect an assignment under the name of the party other than the 
assignor or assignee to the document. There will also be an index of 
documents by number, which will list secondary documents referenced to 
the primary ones. The indexes will contain the pertinent information 
furnished by the parties in the transmittal letter.
    (c) The Board cannot judge the validity of documents, nor judge the 
status of encumbrances to property as reflected by documents recorded at 
the Board. The public is welcome to research the records or use an agent 
or

[[Page 294]]

attorney to do so, provided that Board rules concerning handling of the 
documents are respected.
    (d) The public should note that filing documents with the Board is 
discretionary and encumbrances exist which are not on file with the 
Board.

Sec. 1180.0  Scope and purpose.

    These regulations set out the information to be filed and the 
procedures to be followed in control, merger, acquisition, lease, 
trackage rights, and any other consolidation transaction involving more 
than one railroad that is initiated under 49 U.S.C. 11323. Section 
1180.2 separates these transactions into four types: Major, significant, 
minor, and exempt. The informational requirements for these types of 
transactions differ. Before an application is filed, the designation of 
type of transaction may be clarified or certain of the information 
required may be waived upon petition to the Board. This procedure is 
explained in Sec. 1180.4. The required contents of an application are 
set out in Secs. 1180.6 (general information supporting the 
transaction), 1180.7 (competitive and market information), 1180.8 
(operational information) and 1180.9 (financial data). A major 
application must contain the information required in Secs. 1180.6(a), 
1180.6(b), 1180.7, 1180.8(a), and 1180.9. A significant application must 
contain the information required in Secs. 1180.6(a), 1180.6(c), 1180.7, 
and 1180.8(a). A minor application must contain the information required 
in Secs. 1180.6(a) and 1180.8(b). Procedures (including time limits, 
filing requirements, participation requirements, and other matters) are 
contained in Sec. 1180.4. Index I lists all exhibits and indicates the 
type of application for which the exhibit is required. Index II is a 
table of contents of this subpart. All applicants must comply with the 
Board's Rules of General Applicability, 49 CFR parts 1100-1129, unless 
otherwise specified. These regulations may be cited as the Railroad 
Consolidation Procedures.

<R05>
Sec. 1180.1  General policy statement for merger or control of at least two Class I railroads.

    (a) General. The Surface Transportation Board encourages private 
industry initiative that leads to the rationalization of the nation's 
rail facilities and reduction of its excess capacity. One means of 
accomplishing these ends is rail consolidation. However, the Board does 
not favor consolidations through the exercise of managerial and 
financial control if the controlling entity does not assume full 
responsibility for carrying out the controlled carrier's common carrier 
obligation to provide adequate service upon reasonable demand. 
Furthermore, the Board does not favor consolidations that substantially 
reduce the transport alternatives available to shippers unless

[[Page 295]]

there are substantial and demonstrable benefits to the transaction that 
cannot be achieved in a less anticompetitive fashion. Our analysis of 
the competitive impacts of a consolidation is especially critical in 
light of the Congressionally mandated commitment to give railroads 
greater freedom to price without regulatory interference.
    (b) Consolidation criteria. The Board's consideration of the merger 
or control of at least two class I railroads is governed by the criteria 
prescribed in 49 U.S.C. 11324 and by the rail transportation policy set 
forth in 49 U.S.C. 10101.
    (1) Section 11324 directs the Board to approve consolidations which 
are consistent with the public interest. In examining a proposed 
transaction, the Board must consider, at a minimum:
    (i) The effect on the adequacy of transportation to the public;
    (ii) The effect of including, or failing to include, other rail 
carriers in the area involved in the proposed transaction;
    (iii) The total fixed charges that would result;
    (iv) The interest of affected carrier employees; and
    (v) The effect on competition among rail carriers in the affected 
region.
    (2) The Board must also consider the impact of any transaction on 
the quality of the human environment and the conservation of energy 
resources.
    (c) Public interest considerations. In determining whether a 
transaction is in the public interest, the Board performs a balancing 
test. It weighs the potential benefits to applicants and the public 
against the potential harm to the public. The Board will consider 
whether the benefits claimed by applicants could be realized by means 
other than the proposed consolidation that would result in less 
potential harm to the public.
    (1) Potential benefits. Both the consolidated carrier and the public 
can benefit from a consolidation if the result is a financially sound 
competitor better able to provide adequate service on demand. This 
beneficial result can occur if the consolidated carrier is able to 
realize operating efficiencies and increased marketing opportunities. 
Since consolidations can lead to a reduction in redundant facilities and 
thereby to an increase in traffic density on underused lines, operating 
efficiencies may be realized. Furthermore, consolidations are the only 
feasible way for rail carriers to enter many new markets other than by 
contractual arrangement, such as for joint use of rail facilities or 
run-through trains. In some markets where there is sufficient existing 
rail capacity the construction of new rail line is prohibitively 
expensive and does not represent a feasible means of entry into the 
market.
    (2) Potential harm. There are two potential results from 
consolidations which would ill serve the public--reduction of 
competition and harm to essential services. In analyzing these impacts, 
we must consider, but are not limited by, the policies embodied in 
antitrust laws.
    (i) Reduction of competition. If two carriers serving the same 
market consolidate, the result would be the elimination of the 
competition between the two. Even if the consolidating carriers do not 
serve the same market, there may be a lessening of potential competition 
in other markets. While the reduction in the number of competitors 
serving a market is not in itself harmful, a lessening of competition 
resulting from the elimination of a competitor may be contrary to the 
public interest. The Board recognizes that rail carriers face not only 
intramodal competition, but also intermodal competition from motor and 
water carriers. The Board's competitive analysis depends on the relevant 
market(s). In some markets the Board's focus will be on the preservation 
of effective intermodal competition, while in other markets (such as 
long-haul movements of bulk commodities) effective intramodal 
competition may also be important.
    (ii) Harm to essential service. Consolidations often result in 
shifts of market patterns. Sometimes the carrier losing its share of the 
market may not be able to withstand the loss of traffic. In assessing 
the probable impacts, the Board's concern is the preservation of 
essential services, not the survival of particular carriers. A service 
is essential if there is a sufficient public need

[[Page 296]]

for the service and adequate alternative transportation is not 
available.
    (d) Conditions. (1) The Board has broad authority to impose 
conditions on consolidations, including those that might be useful in 
ameliorating potential anticompetitive effects of a consolidation. 
However, the Board recognizes that conditions may lessen the benefits of 
a consolidation to both the carrier and the public. Therefore, the Board 
will not normally impose conditions on a consolidation to protect a 
carrier unless essential services are affected and the condition: (i) Is 
shown to be related to the impact of the consolidation; (ii) is designed 
to enable shippers to receive adequate service; (iii) would not pose 
unreasonable operating or other problems for the consolidated carrier; 
and (iv) would not frustrate the ability of the consolidated carrier to 
obtain the anticipated public benefits. Moreover, the Board believes 
that indemnification is ordinarily not an appropriate remedy in 
consolidation proceedings. Indemnification conditions can be 
anticompetitive by requiring the consolidated carrier to subsidize 
carriers who are no longer able to compete efficiently in the 
marketplace.
    (2) As of July 1, 1982, Conditions previously imposed are revoked 
unless the parties to specific consolidation proceedings demonstrate a 
public interest in continuing the Conditions in those proceedings.
    (e) Inclusion of other carriers. The Board will consider requiring 
inclusion of another carrier as a condition to approval only where there 
is no other reasonable alternative for providing essential services, the 
facilities fit operationally into the new system, and inclusion can be 
accomplished without endangering the operational or financial success of 
the new company.
    (f) Labor protection. The Board is required to provide applicants' 
employees affected by a consolidation with adequate protection. 
Similarly situated employees on the applicants' system should be given 
equal protection. Therefore, absent a negotiated agreement, the Board 
will provide for protection at the level mandated by law (49 U.S.C. 
11326), unless it can be shown that because of unusual circumstances 
more stringent protection is necessary to provide employees with a fair 
and equitable arrangement. The Board will review negotiated agreements 
to assure fair and equitable treatment of affected employees.
    (g) Cumulative impacts and crossover effects. The Board recognizes 
that events can occur during its consideration of a consolidation that 
can have an effect on various of the concerned parties. However, the 
Board is mindful of the need to meet its statutory deadlines and make 
timely administratively final decisions. Therefore, the Board will not 
reopen pending proceedings in order to assess the impact of potential or 
hypothetical combinations or transactions. The proper forum for 
considering cumulative impacts and crossover effects is in a later 
proceeding. In this manner, consideration will be limited to the impacts 
of transactions which have already been approved and are, therefore, 
reasonably certain to occur. Furthermore, the Board will have the 
benefit of its findings from the prior proceeding to identify more 
precisely the impacts of that transaction. Proceedings will remain 
manageable in scope and size, statutory time limits will be met, and all 
parties will be assured of timely, administratively final decisions.
    (h) Public participation. To assure a fully developed record on the 
impacts of a proposed railroad consolidation, the Board encourages 
public participation from Federal, State, and local government 
departments and agencies, affected shippers and carriers, and other 
interested persons.

Sec. 1180.2  Types of transactions.

    Transactions proposed under 49 U.S.C. 11323 involving more than one 
common carrier by railroad are of four types: Major, significant, minor, 
and exempt.
    (a) A major transaction is a control or merger involving two or more 
class I railroads.
    (b) A significant transaction is a transaction not involving the 
control

[[Page 297]]

or merger of two or more class I railroads that is of regional or 
national transportation significance as that phrase is used in 49 U.S.C. 
11325(a)(2) and (c). A transaction not involving the control or merger 
of two or more class I railroads is not significant if a determination 
can be made either:
    (1) That the transaction clearly will not have any anticompetitive 
effects, or
    (2) That any anticompetitive effects of the transaction will clearly 
be outweighed by the transaction's anticipated contribution to the 
public interest in meeting significant transportation needs.
    A transaction not involving the control or merger of two or more 
class I railroads is significant if neither such determination can 
clearly be made.
    (c) A minor transaction is one which involves more than one railroad 
and which is not a major, significant, or exempt transaction.
    (d) A transaction is exempt if it is within one of the seven 
categories described below. The Board has found that its prior review 
and approval of these transactions is not necessary to carry out the 
rail transportation policy of 49 U.S.C. 10101; and is of limited scope 
or unnecessary to protect shippers from market abuse. See 49 U.S.C. 
10502. A notice must be filed to use one of these class exemptions. The 
procedures are set out in Sec. 1180.4(g). These class exemptions do not 
relieve a carrier of its statutory obligation to protect the interests 
of employees. See 49 U.S.C. 10502(g) and 11326. The enumeration of the 
following categories of transactions as exempt does not preclude a 
carrier from seeking an exemption of specific transactions not falling 
into these categories.
    (1) Acquisition of a line of railroad which would not constitute a 
major market extension where the Board has found that the public 
convenience and necessity permit abandonment.
    (2) Acquisition or continuance in control of a nonconnecting carrier 
or one of its lines where (i) the railroads would not connect with each

    (a) Applicant. The parties initiating a transaction. Parties who are 
considered applicants, but for whom the information normally required of 
an applicant need not be submitted, are (1) in minor trackage rights 
applications, the transferor and (2) in responsive applications, a 
primary applicant.
    (b) Applicant carriers. Applicant, all carriers related to the 
applicant, and all other carriers involved in the transaction. This does 
not include carriers who are involved in an existing trackage rights 
agreement with applicants.
    (c) Major market extension. A major market extension is a 
transaction which may significantly increase competition by extending 
service into a new market, expanding service in a currently served 
market when another carrier concurrently contracts its service to that 
market as part of the same transaction, or providing significantly more 
efficient and effective competitive service to a market presently

[[Page 298]]

being served. Criteria which can be used to determine if a railroad is 
proposing to provide a more competitive service to a currently served 
area include: (1) Creating a shorter route; (2) providing enhanced 
service capabilities (speed is not the only factor); (3) entering an 
interchange or market generating more than 5,000 cars per year or 5 
percent of applicant's traffic; (4) filing the application as a 
condition of relief to a pending proceeding; and (5) permitting a 
carrier to become more competitive (extending its length of haul) See.

sequence as the information is requested in these procedures, and shall 
be numbered to correspond to the numbering in the procedures.
    (ii) If any material required in the application would lend itself 
to being placed in an appendix, this should be done. The appendix and 
application shall be tabulated and cross-referenced in an index for ease 
in locating and referring to the information. The appendixes shall be in 
the same sequence as the information required by these procedures. If 
certain information required in the application is not applicable, 
provide an explanation. The application should be bound, and it may be 
bound in more than one volume. If an application is more than one 
volume, the cover of each volume should be in a different color. The 
pages in each volume shall begin with 1, and be sequentially numbered.
    (iii) The Board's Office of the Secretary will provide informal 
opinions and interpretations, which are not binding on the Board,

Board. The decision shall explain specifically why the application was 
incomplete. A revised application may be submitted, incorporating 
portions of the prior application by reference. The resubmission or 
refiling of an application shall be considered a de novo filing for the 
purpose of computation of the time periods, provided that the 
resubmitted application is accepted as complete.
    (8) The application must present a prima facie case. Applicants can 
fail to meet their burden of proof and thus not present a prima facie 
case either by (i) disclosing facts that, even if construed in their 
most favorable light, are insufficient to support a finding that the 
proposal is consistent with the public interest, or by (ii) disclosing 
facts that affirmatively demonstrate that the proposal is not in the 
public interest. See Ex Parte No. 282 (Sub-No. 3A), Railroad 
Consolidation Procedures Expedited Processing, 363 I.C.C. 767 (1980).

    (F) A list of all information sought to be discovered from applicant 
carriers.
    (G) A detailed statement of the issues in major and significant 
transactions reflecting the relevant underlying statutory criteria,

transactions. This will be considered a prefiling notice without which 
the Board will not entertain responsive applications.
    (iv) Party. All persons who file timely written comments shall be a 
party of record if they so indicate in their comments. In this event, no 
petition for leave to intervene need be filed.
    (2) The Secretary of Transportation and Attorney General of the 
United States shall file written comments with the Board within 60 days 
of the date of acceptance of the application in a major transaction. For 
significant and minor transactions these comments are due within 45 days 
of the date of acceptance of the application. These comments shall 
comply with paragraphs (d)(1)(ii) and (d)(1)(iii) of this section as to 
service and contents.
    (3) A second list of protective conditions shall be filed with the 
Board within 75 days of acceptance of the application in a major 
transaction, and within 60 days of acceptance of the application in a 
significant transaction. It shall be concurrently served by first-class 
mail on all parties of record. The second list of protective conditions 
shall modify the first list based upon changing conditions, such as 
protective conditions sought by other parties to the proceeding. Parties 
to the proceeding shall not be permitted to seek any protective 
conditions not contained in the second list of protective conditions. 
This does not preclude refinements in conditions sought, particularly 
when stipulations to conditions are reached.
    (4) Responsive applications.
    (i) All responsive applications in major transactions shall be filed 
90 days, and in significant transactions 60 days, after acceptance of 
the primary application. No responsive applications shall be permitted 
to minor transactions.
    (ii) For filing fee purposes, a responsive application that is an 
inconsistent application will be classified as a major, significant, or 
minor transaction as provided for in Sec. 1180.2(a)-(c). The fee for an 
inconsistent application will be the fee for the type of transaction 
involved. See 49 CFR 1002.2(f)(38)-(41). The fee for any other types of 
responsive applications is the fee for the particular type of proceeding 
set forth in 49 CFR 1002.2(f).

[[Page 302]]

    (iii) Responsive applications shall comply as fully as possible with 
appropriate Board regulations. Extensions of time for filing are not 
permitted. The filing of an incomplete application, coupled with an 
extension of time to complete the application, may be permitted if 
authorized by the Board in advance.
    (iv) Any petitions for waiver, clarification, extension of time, or 
for leave to file an incomplete application, or to rebut the presumption 
of a significant transaction, must be filed in advance of the filing of 
the responsive application (at least 45 days in advance in major 
transactions and 30 days in significant transactions).
    (v) Each responsive application filed and accepted (if required) is 
considered consolidated with the primary application.
    (e) Evidentiary proceeding. (1) The Board may order an oral public 
hearing, a hearing by written submissions, or another kind of 
evidentiary proceeding. The determination will generally be made on the

is pending before us.<SUP>1</SUP> When a reply is permitted, the 
petition shall be served by first-class mail on all parties to the 
pending proceedings, with a reply due within 10 days of service. Replies

    (g) Notice of exemption. (1) To qualify for an exemption under 
Sec. 1180.2(d), a railroad must file a verified notice of the 
transaction with the Board at least one week before the transaction is 
consummated indicating the proposed consummation date. Before a notice

Office of the Secretary.
    (i) The notice shall contain the information required in 
Sec. 1180.6(a)(1)(i)-(iii), (a)(5)-(6), and (a)(7)(ii), and indicate the

carrier and require divestiture.
    (iii) Other exemptions that may be relevant to a proposal under this 
provision are codified at 49 CFR part 1150, subpart D, which governs

[[Page 303]]

    (2)(i) To qualify for an exemption under Sec. 1180.2(d)(7) 
(acquisition or renewal of trackage rights agreements), in addition to 
the notice, the railroad must file a caption summary suitable for 
publication in the Federal Register. The caption summary must be in the 
following form:

                      Surface Transportation Board

                           Notice of Exemption

                           Finance Docket No.

    (1)--Trackage Rights--(2)
    (2) (3) to grant (4) trackage rights to (1) between (5). The 
trackage rights will be effective on (6).
    This notice is filed under Sec. 1180.2(d)(7). Petitions to revoke 
the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10502(d) may be filed at any time. The 
filing of a petition to revoke will not stay the transaction.
    Dated:
    By the Board.
James H. Bayne,
Secretary.

    The following key identifies the information symbolized in the 
summary.
    (1) Name of the tenant railroad.
    (2) Name of the landlord railroad.
    (3) If an agreement has been entered use ``has agreed'', but if an 
agreement has been reached but not entered use ``will agree.''

    (6) State the date the trackage rights agreement is proposed to be 
consummated.

Register within 20 days of the date that it is filed with the Board. The 
filing of a petition to revoke under 49 U.S.C. 10502(d) does not stay 
the effectiveness of an exemption.
    (3) Some transactions may be subject to environmental review 
pursuant to the Board's environmental rules at 49 CFR part 1105.
    (h) Official notice. In connection with any application or request 
for relief under these procedures, the Board may take official notice of 
any or all of the following information. These data will be presumed 
valid unless discredited by any party. A party relying on information to 
be noticed officially shall list the information. Upon request, the 
party shall make the official notice material available. Any party is 
free to challenge the relevance or application of any such data, or the 
weight that should be accorded it.
    (1) Annual STB Form R-1 Reports submitted by rail carriers.
    (2) Quarterly Commodity Statistics submitted by rail carriers.
    (3) STB Monthly Labor Statistics.
    (4) Quarterly Financial Statements of Rail Carriers.

Sec. 1180.7  Market analyses.

    Impact analyses (exhibit 12). In major and significant transactions 
applicants shall submit analyses of the impacts of the proposed 
transaction--both adverse and beneficial--on inter- and intramodal 
competition for freight surface transportation in the regions affected 
by the transaction and on the provision of essential services by 
applicants and other carriers. An impact analysis should include 
underlying data, a study of the implications of that data, and a 
description of the resulting likely effects of the transaction on 
transportation alternatives available to the shipping public. Each 
aspect of the analysis should specifically address significant impacts 
as they relate to the statutory criteria (49 U.S.C. 11324 (b) or (d), 
essential services, and competition). The Board may identify particular 
markets and issues that it believes warrant further study. If 
appropriate, the Board will also indicate the format of such analyses. 
Applicants must address markets and issues identified by the Board, but 
also any others they consider relevant. Specific regulations on impact 
analyses are not provided so that parties will have the greatest leeway 
to develop the best evidence on the impacts of each individual 
transaction. General guidelines follow:
    (a) Applicants shall prepare analyses of the anticipated effects of 
the transaction on traffic patterns, market concentrations, or 
transportation alternatives available to the shipping public.
    (b) Applicants (and any other party submitting such analyses) must 
demonstrate both the relevancy of the market and issues analyzed and the 
validity of the methodology. All underlying assumptions must be clearly 
stated.
    (c) Supporting data may (but need not) include: Current and 
projected traffic flows; data underlying sales forecasts or marketing 
goals; interchange data; market share analysis; diversion studies; and/
or shipper surveys. It is important to note that these types of studies 
are neither limiting nor all inclusive. The parties must provide 
supporting data, but are free to choose the type(s) and format.
    (d) Analyses should reflect the consolidated company's marketing 
plan and existing and potential competitive alternatives (inter- as well 
intramodal). They can address:
    (1) City pairs, interregional movements, movements through a point, 
or other factors;
    (2) A particular commodity, group of commodities, or other commodity 
factor that will be significantly affected by the transaction; or
    (3) Other effects of the transaction (such as on a particular type 
of service offered).

<R05>
Sec. 1182.12  Amendments.

    (a) After notice of an application is published, applicants may not 
amend their proposal unless specifically required to do so by the Board

strictly of legal argument. A copy of the reply statement shall be 
served on protestants.


<R05>
Sec. 1182.14  Withdrawing an application.

20423.''


<R05>
Sec. 1182.16  Certificate of service.

    (a) Where the rules require service of a pleading on another party,

Sec. 1182.18  Statutory findings.

    The following findings are made for applications to consolidate, 
purchase, merge, lease operating rights and properties, or acquire 
control of motor passenger carriers or water carriers under 49 U.S.C. 
11343-11344:

    We find, with the exception of those applications involving 
impediments (e.g., jurisdictional problems, unresolved fitness 
questions, or questions involving possible unlawful control) that each 
applicant has demonstrated, in accordance with the applicable provisions 
of 49 U.S.C. 11321, 11343, 11344, and 11349, and with the Board's rules 
and regulations, that the proposed transaction should be authorized as 
stated. This finding shall not be deemed to exist where the application 
is opposed. Except where specifically noted, this decision is neither a 
major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human 
environment nor a major regulatory action under the Energy Policy and 
Conservation Act of 1975.

<R05>
Sec. 1184.1  Scope and purpose.

    This statement of policy on motor carrier pooling applications 
implements section 20 of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 [Pub. L. No. 96-
296, 94 Stat. 793]. The Act's provisions are now contained at 49 U.S.C. 
11342(b).


<R05>
Sec. 1184.2  Contents of a pooling application.

    A pooling application filed under 49 U.S.C. 11342(b) should include 
the following information:
    (a) An identification of all the carriers who are parties to the 
pooling agreement;
    (b) A general description of the transaction;
    (c) A specific description of the operating authorities sought to be 
pooled;
    (d) The basis to establish that the agreement is a genuine pooling 
arrangement (as opposed to a lease or interline arrangement);
    (e) A description of what applicants consider to be the relevant 
transportation markets affected by the proposed agreement;
    (f) The competitive routing and service alternatives that would 
remain if the agreement is approved, to the best of applicant's 
knowledge;
    (g) If there is a lessening of such alternatives, an estimate of the 
public benefits that will accrue from approval, or new competition that 
will arise, which would offset such lessening;
    (h) A narrative assessment of how the pooling arrangement will 
affect present and future competition in the area, including a 
description of the projected volume of traffic, the revenues, and the 
commodities which will be subject to the pooling agreement;
    (i) Certification that rates set for traffic moving under the 
agreement do not violate the restrictions on collective ratemaking 
contained in 49 U.S.C. Subtitle IV and Board regulations;
    (j) A narrative statement as to the relative transportation 
importance of the pooling agreement as it would affect the public and 
the national transportation system;
    (k) If any known non-pooling carriers authorized to transport the 
subject traffic are not included in the pooling arrangement explain why, 
and explain

[[Page 314]]

whether inclusion would enhance or restrain competition;
    (l) A statement of the energy and environmental effects of the 
agreement, if any; and
    (m) Certification by applicant, or its representatives, that the 
representations made in the application are, to the best of applicant's 
knowledge and belief, true and complete.

As appendices, applicants must submit: (1) A copy of the pooling 
agreement; (2) a copy of the specific operating authority of each 
carrier which is the subject of the pooling agreement; and (3) a caption 
summary (for Federal Register publication) of the pooling transaction 
sought to be approved.

<R05>
Sec. 1184.3  Processing pooling applications.

    After the pooling application is received (not less than 50 days 
before the effective date specified in the pooling agreement), the Board 
will either reject it or determine initially whether the pooling 
agreement is of major transportation importance and whether there is a 
substantial likelihood that the pooling agreement will unduly restrain 
competition. If neither of these two factors is present, the application 
will be granted without further hearing. Where either factor is found to 
exist, the application will be published in the Federal Register using 
the caption summary filed with the application, and a hearing will be 
scheduled (normally to receive written verified statements) to consider 
the issues further. In this second phase of the proceeding, the Board 
will consider whether the pooling agreement would be in the interest of 
better service to the public or of economy of operation and whether it 
will unduly restrain competition.

1185.4  General authority.
1185.5  Common control.

11328.

    Source:  62 FR 2042, Jan. 15, 1997, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1185.1  Definitions and scope of regulations.

    (a) This part addresses the requirement of 49 U.S.C. 11328 
authorization of the Surface Transportation Board (STB) needed for a 
person to hold the position of officer or director of more than one rail 
carrier, except where only Class III carriers are involved. STB 
authorization is not needed for individuals seeking to hold the 
positions of officers or directors only of Class III railroads. 49 
U.S.C. 11328(b).
    (b) When a person is an officer of a Class I railroad and seeks to 
become an officer of another Class I railroad, an application under 49 
U.S.C. 11328(a) (or petition for individual exemption under 49 U.S.C. 
10502) must be filed. All other ``interlocking directorates'' have been 
exempted as a class from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 
11328(a), pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 10502 and former 49 U.S.C. 10505. For 
such interlocking directorates exempted as a class, no filing with the 
STB is necessary to invoke the exemption.
    (c) An interlocking directorate exists whenever an individual holds 
the position of officer or director of one rail carrier and assumes the 
position of officer or director of another rail carrier. This provision 
applies to any person who performs duties, or any of the duties, 
ordinarily performed by a director, president, vice president, 
secretary, treasurer, general counsel, general solicitor, general 
attorney, comptroller, general auditor, general manager, freight traffic 
manager, passenger traffic manager, chief engineer, general 
superintendent, general land and tax agent or chief purchasing agent.
    (d) For purposes of this part, a rail carrier means a person 
providing common carrier railroad transportation for compensation 
(except a street, suburban, or interurban electric railway not operating 
as part of the general system of rail transportation), and a corporation 
organized to provide such transportation.

[[Page 315]]


<R05>
Sec. 1185.2  Contents of application.

    (a) Each application shall state the following:
    (1) The full name, occupation, business address, place of residence, 
and post office address of the applicant.
    (2) A specification of every carrier of which the applicant holds 
stock, bonds, or notes, individually, as trustee, or otherwise; and the 
amount of, and accurate description of, such securities of each carrier 
for which the applicant seeks authority to act. (Whenever it is 
contemplated that the applicant will represent on the board of directors 
of any carrier securities other than those owned by the applicant, the 
application shall describe such securities, state the character of 
representation, the name of the beneficial owner or owners, and the 
general nature of the business conducted by such owner or owners.)
    (3) Each and every position with any carrier:
    (i) Which is held by the applicant at the time of the application; 
and
    (ii) Which the applicant seeks authority to hold, together with the 
date and manner of his or her election or appointment thereto and, if 
the applicant has entered upon the performance of his duties in any such 
position, the nature of the duties so performed and the date when he 
first entered upon their performance. (A decision authorizing a person 
to hold the position of director of a carrier will be construed as 
sufficient to authorize that person to serve also as chairman of its 
board of directors or as a member or chairman of any committee or 
committees of such board; and, therefore, when authority is sought to 
hold the position of director, the applicant need not request authority 
to serve in any of such other capacities.)
    (4) As to each carrier covered by the requested authorization, 
whether it is an operating carrier, a lessor company, or any other 
corporation organized for the purpose of engaging in rail 
transportation. (If any such carrier neither operates nor owns any 
railroad providing transportation that is subject to 49 U.S.C. 10501, 
the application shall include a copy of such carrier's charter or 
certificate or articles of incorporation, with amendments to date or, if 
already filed with the former Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) or 
with the STB, a reference thereto, with any intervening amendments.)
    (5) A full statement of pertinent facts relative to any carrier 
involved which does not make annual reports to the STB.
    (6) Full information as to the relationship--operating, financial, 
competitive, or otherwise--existing between the carriers covered by the 
requested authorization.
    (7) Every corporation--industrial, financial, or miscellaneous--of 
which the applicant is an officer or director, and the general character 
of the business conducted by such corporation.
    (8) The reasons, fully, why the granting of the authority sought 
will not affect adversely either public or private interests.
    (9) Whether or not any other application for authority has been made 
in behalf of the applicant and, if so, the date and docket number 
thereof, by whom made, and the action thereon, if any.
    (b) When application has been made on behalf of any person, a 
subsequent application by that person need not repeat any statement 
contained in the previous application but may incorporate the same by 
appropriate reference.


<R05>
Sec. 1185.3  Procedures.

    The original application or petition shall be signed by the 
individual applicant or petitioner and shall be verified under oath. 
Petitions and applications should comply with the STB's general rules of 
practice set forth at 49 CFR part 1104. Applications or petitions may be 
made by persons on their own behalf.


<R05>
Sec. 1185.4  General authority.

    Any person who holds or seeks specific authority to hold positions 
with a carrier may also request general authority to act as an 
interlocking officer for all affiliated or subsidiary companies or 
properties used or operated by that carrier, either separately or 
jointly, with other carriers. A carrier may apply for general authority 
on behalf of an individual who has already received authority to act as 
an interlocking officer. However, a carrier may not apply for general 
authority for an

[[Page 316]]

individual who holds a position with another railroad which is not an 
affiliate or subsidiary of the carrier or whose properties are not used 
or operated by the carrier, either separately or jointly with other 
carriers.


<R05>
Sec. 1185.5  Common control.

    It shall not be necessary for any person to secure authorization to 
hold the position of officer or director of two or more carriers if such 
carriers are operated under common control or management either:
    (a) Pursuant to approval and authority of the STB granted under 
former 49 U.S.C. 11343-44 or by the STB granted under 49 U.S.C. 11323-
24; or
    (b) Pursuant to an exemption authorized by the STB under former 49 
U.S.C. 10505 or by the STB under 49 U.S.C. 10502; or
    (c) Pursuant to a controlling, controlled, or common control 
relationship which has existed between such carriers since before June 
16, 1933.


<R05>
Sec. 1185.6  Jointly used terminal properties.

    Any person holding the position of officer or director of a carrier 
is relieved from the provisions of this part to the extent that he or 
she may also hold a directorship and any other position to which that 
person may be elected or appointed with a terminal railroad the 
properties of which are operated or used by the carrier jointly with 
other carriers.

11344, and 11349.

    Source:  54 FR 35346, Aug. 25, 1989, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1187.1  Applications governed by these rules.

    These rules govern the handling of applications filed for temporary 
authority to operate motor property carrier, motor passenger carrier, 
and water carrier properties sought to be acquired in separately filed 
applications or petitions for exemption under:
    (a) 49 U.S.C. 11343-11344 (for authority to consolidate, purchase, 
merge, or lease operating rights and properties of, or to acquire 
control of, motor property carriers, motor passenger carriers, and water 
carriers); or
    (b) 49 U.S.C. 10926 (for the transfer of certificates and permits of 
motor property carriers, motor passenger carriers, and water carriers).


<R05>
Sec. 1187.2  Procedure used generally.

    Since the basis for filing applications for temporary authority 
under these rules is to prevent destruction of or injury to motor 
carrier or water carrier properties sought to be acquired under 49 
U.S.C. 11343-11344 or 10926, these rules are designed to permit the 
Board to decide expeditiously temporary authority applications. The 
Board has no obligation to give public notice of applications filed 
under these rules for temporary authority. Cases are decided without 
hearing or other formal proceeding. However, the rules do permit the 
Board, when feasible, to publish notice of temporary authority 
applications, and such applications may be opposed.


<R05>
Sec. 1187.3  Applications.

    (a) Starting the application process. Persons seeking temporary 
authority under this section shall complete application form OP-F-46. 
(See 49 CFR part 1003 and Sec. 1002.2(f)(24) regarding forms and filing 
fees.) An application for temporary authority may only be filed 
concurrently with or after the filing of a related application or 
petition for exemption under 49 U.S.C. 11343-11344 or 10926.
    (b) Information to be submitted by applicants. The application form 
constitutes applicants' entire case and shall contain all of the 
information on which applicants intend to rely.
    (c) Where the application is sent. The original and one copy of the 
application shall be sent to the Office of the Secretary, Surface 
Transportation Board, Washington, DC 20423, along with the application 
fee. In addition,

[[Page 317]]

one copy of the application shall be sent by applicants to each of the 
persons and State officials specified on the application form. When an 
application for temporary authority is filed after the filing and 
publication of notice of the related acquisition transaction (under 49 
U.S.C. 11343-11344 or 10926), applicants also shall serve a copy of the 
temporary authority application on all parties of record in the related 
transaction as of the date of the filing.


<R05>
Sec. 1187.4  Board action.

    (a) Where an application for temporary authority is filed 
concurrently with the related acquisition application or petition for 
exemption, notice of filing of the temporary authority application will 
appear in the published notice of the corresponding permanent 
application or petition.
    (b) The temporary authority application (and protests, if any) will 
be submitted to an appropriate decisional body for disposition as soon 
as possible after filing. These rules do not provide for any specific 
time period for the filing of opposition to concurrently filed temporary 
authority applications. A temporary authority request may be acted upon 
before the publication of the related permanent application or petition 
for exemption.


<R05>
Sec. 1187.5  Protests.

    (a) Who can oppose an application. A protest to an application for 
temporary authority filed under these rules may be filed only by persons 
who oppose or intend to oppose the related permanent application or 
petition for exemption filed under 49 U.S.C. 11343-11344 or 10926.
    (b) Contents of a protest. A protest to an application for temporary 
authority shall be in writing. The protest shall state the protestant's 
interest in the proceeding and the specific grounds on which protestant 
relies in opposing the temporary authority application. The protest also 
shall indicate that a copy has been served on applicants' 
representative(s).
    (c) To whom the protest is sent. The original and one copy of the 
protest shall be sent to the Office of the Secretary, Surface 
Transportation Board, Washington, DC 20423. A copy of the protest shall 
be served on applicants' representative(s).

Sec. 1188.1  Computation of gross operating revenues of carriers involved in unifications.

    In proceedings involving consolidation, merger, or acquisition of 
control of motor carriers under 49 U.S.C. 11343, the aggregate gross 
operating revenues of carriers attributable to transportation from the 
use of their respective operating rights subject to subchapter II of 
chapter 105 of the Act shall be deemed to have exceeded $2 million for 
the period of 12 consecutive months ending not more than six months 
preceding the date of the agreement of the parties covering the 
transaction, within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 11343(d)(1), unless 
otherwise shown, under each of the following circumstances:
    (a) At the end of the preceding calendar year the carriers involved 
in the transaction filed reports with the Board, as required by 49 
U.S.C. 11145, showing annual gross operating revenues from motor carrier 
operations totaling more than $2 million, and none of the carriers has 
sold or otherwise disposed of any portion of its operating rights 
subsequent to the end of the preceding calendar year;
    (b) A carrier involved in the transaction filed a quarterly report 
or reports for subsequent quarters, and a reasonable estimate of its 
annual gross operating revenues and the reported annual gross operating 
revenues of the other carriers involved in the transaction for the 
preceding calendar year aggregates more than $2 million; or

otherwise disposed of any portion of its operating rights or which began 
new operations or extended existing operations subsequent to the end of 
the preceding calendar year; and

<R05>
Sec. 1188.2  Deduction of revenues from sources other than regulated transportation.

    (a) In determining whether a proposed transaction is subject to the 
provisions of 49 U.S.C. 11343, applicant motor carriers and their 
affiliate motor carriers must select the same 12-month period and 
indicate the 12-month period selected, as provided in Sec. 1188.1, and 
must disclose the gross revenues received by each such carrier during 
the critical period selected and the revenues derived from sources other 
than transportation subject to subchapter II of chapter 105 of the Act. 
Such latter revenues may be deducted from the gross revenues for the 
purpose of determining jurisdiction.
    (b) Applicants shall show the amounts which they claim should be 
deducted, the sources from which the revenues were derived, and the 
circumstances under which transportation performed is claimed not to 
have been subject to subchapter II of chapter 105 of the Act, in 
transfer proceedings under 49 CFR part 1181 or in support of a motion 
for dismissal of proceedings under 49 CFR part 1182 or 1186.
    (c) Applicants shall not be required to show that the revenues 
computed under Sec. 1188.1 were dervived from transportation subject to
