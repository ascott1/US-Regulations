                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 1996), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

FR 30502, June 9, 1981]


<R05>
Sec. 1000.10   Availability of statements of policy, interpretations, and other matters not required to be published in the Federal Register.

    (a) The Interstate Commerce Commission, in performing its duties 
under the Interstate Commerce Act, frequently formulates and adopts 
statements of general policy, or interpretations of general 
applicability, and other matters not required to be published in the 
Federal Register in rendering decisions in proceedings involving the 
operating rights, financial structures, or rates and practices of 
brokers, electric railways, express companies, freight forwarders, motor 
carriers, pipelines, private car companies, rail carriers, and water 
carriers. Because such statements of policy and interpretations of 
general applicability are scattered throughout more than 320,000 pages 
in over 400 volumes of Commission reports and because such policies and 
interpretations must be revised or repealed from time to time as 
required by changing technology and economic conditions, it is not 
feasible, and is wholly impractical, to state them separately and 
publish them in the Federal Register. Further, to be fully understood, 
such statements of general policy or interpretations of general 
applicability must be read in context in the Commission's reports where 
they are explained, revised, or repealed in relation to the factual 
situations to which they are applicable.

[[Page 13]]

Notice is hereby given that those portions of the printed reports of 
decisions of the Interstate Commerce Commission which contain statements 
of general policy or interpretations of general applicability are 
digested, arranged topically, and indexed both in the multivolume set 
``Interstate Commerce Acts Annotated'' (supplemented monthly by the 
``Advance Bulletin of Interstate Commerce Acts Annotated'') and in the 
index-digests in the backs of bound volumes of Interstate Commerce 
Commission reports. The multivolume set, ``Interstate Commerce Acts 
Annotated'' and the three series of Interstate Commerce Commission 
reports (i.e., I.C.C., M.C.C. and Val. Rep.) are published and sold by 
the Government Printing Office, and are sent free to Depository 
Libraries (44 U.S.C. 82), which include all State libraries, two 
libraries in each congressional district, the libraries of land grant 
colleges, and other libraries. Copies are also available for public 
examination in the Interstate Commerce Commission Library in Washington, 
DC. The indexes in these publications are maintained in compliance with 
the provision in 5 United States Code 552(a)(2). The ``Advance Bulletin 
of Interstate Commerce Acts Annotated'' and recent reports, which have 
not yet been included in published indexes, are available upon request 
from the Office of the Secretary, Interstate Commerce Commission.
    (b) Because of the large volume of reports, it is the policy of the 
Commission to print for publication in bound volumes only reports of 
those cases decided by the entire Commission or by a division thereof 
and more significant reports of employee boards. With few exceptions, 
reports and orders of employee boards are duplicated (``no print reports 
and orders'') and distributed to the parties and made available to the 
press. From time to time ``no print reports and orders'' are cited as 
precedents in other cases. Therefore, notice is hereby given that 
duplicated ``no print reports and orders'', are indexed by docket number 
and title, and filed by subject matter and are available for public 
inspection in the Section of Reference Services of the Commission in 
Washington, DC. These indexes and files are maintained in compliance 
with the provision in 5 United States Code 552(a)(2). Persons outside 
Washington, DC, can obtain information about, or copies of, such 
duplicated reports by writing to the Secretary of the Commission.

<R05>
Sec. 1001.5  Requests to inspect other records not considered public under 5 U.S.C. 552.

    Requests to inspect records other than those now deemed to be of a 
public nature shall be in writing and addressed to the Freedom of 
Information Officer. The Freedom of Information Officer shall determine 
within 10 days of receipt of a request (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, 
and legal public holidays) whether a requested record will be made 
available. If the Freedom of Information Officer determines that a 
request cannot be honored, he must inform the requesting party in 
writing of this decision and such letter shall contain a detailed 
explanation of why the requested material cannot be made available and 
explain to the requesting party his or her right of appeal. If the 
Freedom of Information Officer rules that such records cannot be made 
available because they are exempt under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 
552(b), an appeal from such ruling may be addressed to the Chairman. The 
Chairman's decision shall be administratively final and state the 
specific exemption(s) contained in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) relied upon for 
denial. Such an appeal must be filed within 30 days of the date of the 
Freedom of Information Officer's letter. The Chairman shall act in 
writing on such appeals within 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, 
and legal public holidays) of receipt of any appeal. In unusual 
circumstances, as set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B), the time limit may 
be extended, by written notice to the person making the particular 
request, setting forth the reasons for such extension, for no more than 
10 working days. If the appeal is denied, the Chairman's order shall 
notify the requesting party of his or her right to judicial review. 
Charges shall be made as provided for in Sec. 1002.1(f) of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 1001.6  Predisclosure notification procedures for confidential commercial information.

    (a) In general. Confidential commercial information provided to the 
Commission shall not be disclosed pursuant to a Freedom of Information 
Act (FOIA) request except in accordance with this section. For such 
purposes, the following definitions apply:
    (1) Confidential commercial information means records provided to 
the government by a submitter that arguably contain material exempt from 
release under Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 
552(b)(4), because disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause 
substantial competitive harm.
    (2) Submitter means any person or entity who provides confidential 
commercial information to the government. The term ``submitter'' 
includes, but is not limited to, corporations, state governments, and 
foreign governments.
    (b) Notice to submitters. The Commission, to the extent permitted by 
law, shall provide a submitter with prompt written notice of receipt of 
a FOIA request encompassing its submissions in accordance with paragraph 
(c) of this section, and except as provided in paragraph (g) of this 
section. This notice shall either describe the exact nature of the 
information requested or provide copies of the records themselves.
    (c) When notice is required. Notice shall be given to a submitter 
whenever:
    (1) The Commission has reason to believe that disclosure of the 
information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial 
competitive harm; or
    (2) The information has been designated, in good faith by the 
submitter, as confidential commercial information at the time of 
submission or a reasonable time thereafter.

Whenever possible, the submitter's claim of confidentiality shall be 
supported by a statement or certification by an officer or authorized 
representative of the company that the information in question is in 
fact confidential commercial information and has not been disclosed to 
the public.
    (d) Opportunity to object to disclosure. (1) Through the notice 
described in paragraph (b) of this section, the Commission shall afford 
a submitter a reasonable period of time in which to provide it with a 
detailed statement of any objection to disclosure. Such statement shall 
specify all grounds for withholding the requested information.
    (2) When notice is given to a submitter under this section, the 
Commission also shall notify the requester that it has been provided.
    (e) Notice of intent to disclose. The Commission shall consider 
carefully submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure 
prior to its determination whether or not to disclose the requested 
information. Whenever the Commission decides to disclose the information 
over a submitter's objection, it shall provide the submitter with 
written notice containing the following:
    (1) A description or copy of the information to be disclosed;
    (2) The reasons why the submitter's disclosure objections were not 
sustained; and
    (3) A specific disclosure date, which shall be a reasonable number 
of days after the notice of intent to disclose has been mailed to the 
submitter.

At the same time that notice of intent to disclose is given to a 
submitter, the Commission shall notify the requester accordingly.
    (f) Notice of lawsuit. (1) Whenever a FOIA requester brings legal 
action seeking to compel disclosure of confidential commercial 
information, the Commission shall promptly notify the submitter.
    (2) Whenever a submitter brings legal action seeking to prevent 
disclosure of confidential commercial information, the Commission shall 
promptly notify the requester.
    (g) Exception to notice requirement. The notice requirements of this 
section shall not apply if:
    (1) The Commission determines that the information requested should 
not be disclosed; or
    (2) The information already has been published or otherwise 
officially made available to the public; or
    (3) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 
U.S.C. 552); or
    (4) Disclosure is required by a Commission rule that:

[[Page 16]]

    (i) Was adopted pursuant to notice and public comment;
    (ii) Specifies narrow classes or records submitted to the Commission 
that are to be released; and
    (iii) Provides in exceptional circumstances for notice when the 
submitter provides written justification, at the time the information is 
submitted or a reasonable time thereafter, that disclosure of the 
information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial 
competitive harm; or
    (5) The information requested is not designated by the submitter as 
exempt from disclosure, when the submitter had an opportunity to do so 
at the time of submission or within a reasonable time thereafter, unless 
the Commission has reason to believe that disclosure of the information 
could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm; or
    (6) The designation made by the submitter in accordance with these 
regulations appears obviously frivolous; in such case, the Commission 
must provide the submitter only with written notice of any 
administrative disclosure determination within a reasonable number of 
days prior to the specified disclosure date.

    Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A) and 553; 31 U.S.C. 9701; and 49 
U.S.C. 721(a).


<R05>
Sec. 1002.1  Fees for records search, review, copying, certification, and related services.

    Certifications and copies of such tariffs, reports and other public 
records and documents on file with the Surface Transportation Board as 
may be practicable to furnish, as well as searches and copying of 
records not considered public under the Freedom of Information Act (5 
U.S.C. 552), will be furnished on the following basis:
    (a) Certificate of the Secretary, $9.00.
    (b) Service involved in examination of tariffs or schedules for 
preparation of certified copies of tariffs or schedules or extracts 
therefrom at the rate of $24.00 per hour.
    (c) Service involved in checking records to be certified to 
determine authenticity, including clerical work etc., incidental 
thereto, at the rate of $16.00 per hour.
    (d) Electrostatic copies of tariffs, reports, and other public 
documents, at the rate of $.80 per letter size or legal size exposure. A 
minimum charge of $5.00 will be made for this service.
    (e) The fee for search and copying services requiring ADP processing 
are as follows:
    (1) A fee of $42.00 per hour for professional staff time will be 
charged when it is required to fulfill a request for ADP data.
    (2) The fee for port minute time for the search will be set at the 
current rate set forth in the Board's contract with its time sharing 
computer contractor. Information on those charges can be obtained from 
the Chief, System Services Branch, Surface Transportation Board, 
Washington, DC 20423.
    (3) Printing shall be charged at the rates of $.10 per page of 
computer generated output with a minimum charge of $.25. A charge of $30 
per reel of magnetic tape will be made if the tape is to be permanently 
retained by the requestor.
    (f) The fees for search, review and copying services for records not 
considered public under the Freedom of Information Act are as follows:
    (1) When records are sought for commercial use, requesters will be 
assessed the full and reasonable direct costs of document search, review 
and duplication. A ``commercial use'' request refers to a request from 
or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that 
furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or 
the person on whose behalf the request is made.
    (2) When records are not sought for commercial use and a request is 
made by an educational or noncommercial scientific institution, 
requesters will be assessed only for the cost of duplication (excluding 
charges for the first 100

[[Page 17]]

pages). The term ``Educational Institution'' refers to a preschool, a 
public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of 
graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher 
education, an institution of professional education, and an institution 
of vocational education, which operates a program of scholarly research. 
The term ``noncommercial scientific institution'' refers to an 
institution that is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis and that is 
operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the 
results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or 
industry. They must show that their request is authorized by and under 
the auspices of a qualifying institution and the records are not sought 
for a commercial use but, instead, are in furtherance of scholarly or 
scientific research.
    (3) Requesters who are representatives of the news media (persons 
actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to 
publish or broadcast news to the public) will be assessed only for the 
cost of duplication (excluding charges for the first 100 pages) if they 
can show that their request is not made for a commercial use. A request 
for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester 
shall not be considered a request for a commercial use.
    (4) All other requesters will be assessed fees which recover the 
full, reasonable direct cost of searching for and duplicating records 
that are responsive to the request (excluding charges for the first 100 
pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time).
    (5) All requesters must reasonably describe the records sought.
    (6) The search and review hourly fees will be based upon employee 
grade levels in order to recoup the full, allowable direct costs 
attributable to their performance of these functions. They are as 
follows:


------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             Grade                                Rate

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    (7) The fee for electrostatic copies shall be $.60 per letter or 
legal size exposure with a minimum charge of $3.00.
    (8) The fee charged for ADP data is set forth in paragraph (e) of 
this section.
    (9) If the cost of collecting any fee would be equal to or greater 
than the fee itself, it will not be assessed.
    (10) A fee may be charged for searches which are not productive and 
for searches for records or those parts of records which subsequently 
are determined to be exempt from disclosure.
    (11) Interest charges will be assessed on any unpaid bill starting 
on the date specified in the bill, at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 
3717 and will accrue from the date of the billing. The Debt Collection 
Act, 5 U.S.C. 5514 (1982), including disclosure to the consumer 
reporting agencies and the use of collection agencies, as prescribed in 
the Board's Debt Collection Regulations in 49 CFR part 1018, will be 
utilized to encourage payment where appropriate.
    (12) If search charges are likely to exceed $25, the requester will 
be notified of the estimated fees unless requester willingness to pay 
whatever fee is assessed has been provided in advance. The 
administrative time limits prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) will not 
begin until after the requester agrees in writing to accept the 
prospective charges.
    (13) An advance payment (before work is commenced or continued on a 
request) may be required if the charges are likely to exceed $250. 
Requesters who have previously failed to pay a fee charged in timely 
fashion (i.e. within 30 days of the date of billing) may be required 
first to pay this amount plus any applicable interest (or demonstrate 
that the fee has been paid) and then make an advance payment of the full 
amount of the estimated fee before the new or pending request is 
processed.

[[Page 18]]

The administrative time limits prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) also 
will not begin until after a requester has complied with this provision.
    (14) Documents shall be furnished without any charge or at a charge 
reduced below the fees set forth above if disclosure of the information 
is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute 
significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of 
the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the 
requester. The following six factors will be employed in determining 
when such fees shall be waived or reduced:
    (i) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requester 
records concerns ``the operations or activities of the government'';
    (ii) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: 
Whether the disclosure is ``likely to contribute'' to an understanding 
of government operations or activities;
    (iii) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the 
general public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of 
the requested information will contribute to ``public understanding'';
    (iv) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: 
Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute ``significantly'' to 
public understanding of government operations or activities;
    (v) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether 
the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the 
requested disclosure; and, if so
    (vi) The primary interest in disclosure: Whether the magnitude of 
the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently 
large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that 
disclosure is ``primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.''

This fee waiver and reduction provision will be implemented in 
accordance with guidelines issued by the U.S. Department of Justice on 
April 2, 1987 and entitled ``New FOIA Fee Waiver Policy Guidance.'' A 
copy of these guidelines may be inspected or obtained from the Surface 
Transportation Board's Freedom of Information Office, Washington, DC 
20423.
    (g) Payment for services described in paragraphs (a) through (f) of 
this section may be made in cash or by postal money order or check 
payable to the order of the Secretary, Surface Transportation Board, 
Washington, D.C., and forwarded to his office.
    (h) Transcript of testimony and of oral argument, or extracts 
therefrom, may be purchased by the public from the Board's official 
reporter. For information regarding the official reporter, contact the 
Secretary, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC 20423.

Sec. 1002.2  Filing fees.

    (a) Manner of payment. (1) Except as specified in this section, all 
filing fees will be payable at the time and place the application, 
petition, notice, tariff, contract summary, or other document is 
tendered for filing. The filing fee for tariffs, including schedules, 
and contracts summaries including supplements (Item 78) may be charged 
to tariff filing fee accounts established by the Board in accordance 
with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (2) Billing account procedure. Form ICC-1032 must be submitted to 
the Board's Budget and Fiscal Office to establish a tariff filing fee 
account or an insurance service fee account.
    (i) Each account will have a specific billing date within each month 
and a billing cycle. The billing date is the date that the bill is 
prepared and printed. The billing cycle is the period between the 
billing date in one month and the billing date in the next month. A bill 
for each account which has activity or an unpaid balance during the 
billing cycle will be sent on the billing date each month. Payment will 
be due 20 days from the billing date. Payments received before the next 
billing

[[Page 19]]

date are applied to the account. Interest will accrue in accordance with 
49 CFR 1018.30.
    (ii) The Debt Collection Act of 1982, including disclosure to the 
consumer reporting agencies and the use of collection agencies, as 
prescribed in the Board's Debt Collection Regulations in 49 CFR part 
1018, will be utilized to encourage payment where appropriate.
    (iii) An account holder who files a petition in bankruptcy or who is 
the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding must provide the following 
information to the Chief, Budget and Fiscal Office, Surface 
Transportation Board, Washington, DC:
    (A) The filing date of the bankruptcy petition;
    (B) The court in which the bankruptcy petition was filed;
    (C) The type of bankruptcy proceeding;
    (D) The name, address, and telephone number of its representative in 
the bankruptcy proceeding; and
    (E) The name, address, and telephone number of the bankruptcy 
trustee, if one has been appointed.
    (3) Fees will be payable to the Surface Transportation Board by a 
check payable in United States currency drawn upon funds deposited in a 
United States or foreign bank or other financial institution, money 
order payable in United States' currency, or credit card (VISA or 
MASTERCARD).
    (b) Any filing, other than a tariff filing, that is not accompanied 
by the appropriate filing fee is deficient except for filings that 
satisfy the deferred payment procedures in paragraph (a) of this 
section. However, the Board may find that a tariff which is submitted 
without the appropriate filing fee is deficient and reject the tariff 
filing, if the filer repeatedly fails to submit the appropriate filing 
fee after the Board has advised the filer of the proper filing fee and 
tariff filing procedures.
    (c) Fees not refundable. Fees will be assessed for every filing in 
the type of proceeding listed in the schedule of fees contained in 
paragraph (f) of this section, subject to the exceptions contained in 
paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section. After the application, petition, 
notice, tariff, contract, or other document has been accepted for filing 
by the Board, the filing fee will not be refunded, regardless of whether 
the application, petition, notice, tariff, contract, or other document 
is granted or approved, denied, rejected before docketing, dismissed, or 
withdrawn. If an individual exemption proceeding becomes a matter of 
general applicability and is handled through the rulemaking process, the 
Board will refund the filing fee.
    (d) Related or consolidated proceedings. (1) Separate fees need not 
be paid for related applications filed by the same applicant which would 
be the subject of one proceeding.
    (2) A separate fee will be assessed for the filing of an application 
for temporary authority to operate a motor carrier of passengers as 
provided for in paragraph (f)(5) of this section regardless of whether 
such application is related to a corresponding transfer proceeding as 
provided for in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
    (3) The Board may reject concurrently filed applications, petitions, 
notices, contracts, or other documents asserted to be related and refund 
the filing fee if, in its judgment, they embrace two or more severable 
matters which should be the subject of separate proceedings.
    (e) Waiver or reduction of filing fees. It is the general policy of 
the Board not to waive or reduce filing fees except as described below:
    (1) Filing fees are waived for an application or other proceeding 
which is filed by a federal government agency, or a state or local 
government entity. For purposes of this section the phrases ``federal 
government agency'' or ``government entity'' do not include a quasi-
governmental corporation or government subsidized transportation 
company.
    (2) In extraordinary situations the Board will accept requests for 
waivers or fee reductions in accordance with the following procedure:
    (i) When to request. At the time that a filing is submitted to the 
Board the applicant may request a waiver or reduction of the fee 
prescribed in this part. Such request should be addressed to the 
Secretary.
    (ii) Basis. The applicant must show the waiver or reduction of the 
fee is in

[[Page 20]]

the best interest of the public, or that payment of the fee would impose 
an undue hardship upon the requestor.
    (iii) Board action. The Secretary will notify the applicant of the 
decision to grant or deny the request for waiver or reduction.
    (f) Schedule of filing fees.

Sec. 1002.3  Updating user fees.

    (a) Update. Each fee established in this part shall be updated in 
accordance with this section at least once a year. However, any fee may 
be updated more than once a year, if the Board finds that an additional 
update is necessary.
    (b) Publication and effective dates. Updated fees shall be published 
in the Federal Register and shall become effective 30 days after 
publication.

[[Page 23]]

    (c) Payment of fees. Any person submitting a filing for which a fee 
is established shall pay the fee in effect at the time of the filing.
    (d) Method of updating fees. Each fee shall be updated by updating 
the cost components comprising the fee. Cost components shall be updated 
as follows:
    (1) Direct labor costs shall be updated by multiplying base level 
direct labor costs by percentage changes in average wages and salaries 
of Board employees. Base level direct labor costs are direct labor costs 
determined by the cost study set forth in Revision of Fees For Services, 
1 I.C.C.2d 60 (1984) or subsequent cost studies. The base period for 
measuring changes shall be April 1984.
    (2) Operations overhead shall be developed each year on the basis of 
current relationships existing on a weighted basis, for indirect labor 
applicable to the first supervisory work centers directly associated 
with user fee activity. Actual updating of operations overhead will be 
accomplished by applying the current percentage factor to updated direct 
labor, including current governmental overhead costs.
    (3)(i) Office general and administrative costs shall be developed 
each year on the basis of current level costs, i.e., dividing actual 
office general and administrative costs for the current fiscal year by 
total office costs for the Offices directly associated with user fee 
activity. Actual updating of office general and administrative costs 
will be accomplished by applying the current percentage factor to 
updated direct labor, including current governmental overhead and 
current operations overhead costs.
    (ii) Board general and administrative costs shall be developed each 
year on the basis of current level costs; i.e., dividing actual Board 
general and administrative costs for the current fiscal year by total 
agency expenses for the current fiscal year. Actual updating of Board 
general and administrative costs will be accomplished by applying the 
current percentage factor to updated direct labor, including current 
governmental overhead, operations overhead and office general and 
administrative costs.
    (4) Publication costs shall be adjusted on the basis of known 
changes in the costs applicable to publication of material in the 
Federal Register.
    (e) Rounding of updated fees. Updated fees shall be rounded in the 
following manner: (1) Fees between $1-$30 will be rounded to the nearest 
$1; (2) fees between $30-$100 will be rounded to the nearest $10; (3) 
fees between $100-$999 will be rounded to the nearest $50; and (4) fees 
above $1,000 will be rounded to the nearest $100. (This rounding 
procedure excludes copying, printing and search fees.)

              Subpart A--Interpretation of Operating Rights


<R05>
Sec. 1004.2  Authority to serve a particular area--construction.

    (a) Service at municipality. A motor carrier of property, motor 
passenger carrier of express, and household goods freight forwarder 
authorized to serve a municipality may serve all points within that 
municipality's commercial zone not beyond the territorial limits, if 
any, fixed in such authority.
    (b) Service at unincorporated community. A motor carrier of 
property, motor passenger carrier of express, and household goods 
freight forwarder, authorized to serve an unincorporated community 
having a post office of the same name, may serve all points in the 
United States not beyond the territorial limits, if any, fixed in such 
authority, as follows:
    (1) All points within 3 miles of the post office in such 
unincorporated community if it has a population of less than 2,500; 
within 4 miles if it has a population of 2,500 but less than 25,000; and 
within 6 miles if it has a population of 25,000 or more;
    (2) At all points in any municipality any part of which is within 
the limits described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and
    (3) At all points in any municipality wholly surrounded, or so 
surrounded except for a water boundary, by any municipality included 
under the terms of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.


<R04>
                Subpart B--Miscellaneous Interpretations


<R05>
Sec. 1004.10  Gifts, donations, and hospitality by carriers.

    It is unlawful for any common carrier engaged in interstate or 
foreign commerce to offer, make, or cause any undue or unreasonable 
preference or advantage to any person. Gifts of services or anything of 
substantial value to particular shippers or their representatives are 
considered violations of the law. Expenditures for such gifts may not 
support requests to increase carrier rates. The Commission shall take 
appropriate enforcement action to redress such unlawful expenditures.


<R04>
                     Subpart C--Routing Regulations


<R05>
Sec. 1004.20  Regular-route motor passenger service.

    (a) A motor common carrier authorized to transport passengers over 
regular routes may serve: (1) All points on its authorized route; (2) 
all municipalities wholly within 1 airline mile of its authorized route; 
(3) all unincorporated areas within 1 airline mile of its authorized 
route; and (4) all military posts, airports, schools, and similar 
establishments that may be entered within 1 airline mile of its 
authorized route, but operations within any part of such establishment 
more than 1 airline mile from such authorized route may not be over a 
public road.
    (b) This section does not apply to those motor passenger common 
carriers authorized to operate within:
    (1) New York, NY;
    (2) Rockland, Westchester, Orange, or Nassau Counties, NY;
    (3) Fairfield County, CT; and
    (4) Passaic, Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Union, Morris, Somerset, 
Middlesex, or Monmouth Counties, NJ.

[54 FR 21956, May 22, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 1004.21  Traversal authority.

    (a) Scope. An irregular-route motor carrier may operate between 
authorized service points over any reasonably

[[Page 25]]

direct or logical route unless expressly prohibited.
    (b) Requirements. Before commencing operations, the carrier must, 
regarding each State traversed:
    (1) Notify the State regulatory body in writing, attaching a copy of 
its operating rights;
    (2) Designate a process agent; and
    (3) Comply with 49 CFR 1043.8.


<R05>
Sec. 1004.22  Tacking.

    Unless expressly prohibited, a motor common carrier of property 
holding separate authorities which have common service points may join, 
or ``tack,'' those authorities at the common point, or ``gateway,'' for 
the purpose of performing through service as follows:
    (a) Regular-route authorities may be tacked with one another;
    (b) Regular-route authority may be tacked with irregular-route 
authority;
    (c) Irregular-route authorities may be tacked with one another if 
the authorities were granted pursuant to applications filed on or before 
November 23, 1973, and the distance between the points at which service 
is provided, when measured through the gateway point, is 300 miles or 
less; and
    (d) Irregular-route authorities may be tacked with one another if 
the authorities involved contain a specific provision granting the right 
to tack.


<R05>
Sec. 1004.23  Elimination of routing restrictions--regular-route carriers.

    (a) Regular-route authorities--construction. All certificates that, 
either singly or in combination, authorize the transportation by a motor 
common carrier of property over:
    (1) A single regular route or;
    (2) Over two or more regular routes that can lawfully be tacked at a 
common service point, shall be construed as authorizing transportation 
between authorized service points over any available route.
    (b) Service at authorized points. A common carrier departing from 
its authorized service routes under paragraph (a) of this section shall 
continue to serve points authorized to be served on or in connection 
with its authorized service routes.
    (c) Intermediate point service. A common carrier conducting 
operations under paragraph (a) of this section may serve points on, and 
within 1 airline mile of, an alternative route it elects to use if all 
the following conditions are met:
    (1) The carrier is authorized to serve all intermediate points 
(without regard to nominal restrictions) on the underlying service 
route;
    (2) The alternative route involves the use of a superhighway (i.e., 
a limited access highway with split-level crossings);
    (3) The alternative superhighway route, including highways 
connecting the superhighway portion of the route with the carrier's 
authorized service route,
    (i) Extends in the same general direction as the carrier's 
authorized service route and
    (ii) Is wholly within 25 airline miles of the carrier's authorized 
service route; and
    (4) Service is provided in the same manner as, and subject to any 
restrictions that apply to, service over the authorized service route.


<R05>
Sec. 1004.24  Elimination of gateways--regular- and irregular-route carriers.

    A motor common carrier of property holding separate grants of 
authority (including regular-route authority), one or more of which 
authorizes transportation over irregular routes, where the authorities 
have a common service point at which they can lawfully be tacked to 
perform through service, may perform such through service over any 
available route.


<R05>
Sec. 1004.25  Redesignated highways.

    Where a highway over which a regular-route motor common carrier of 
property is authorized to operate is assigned a new designation, such as 
a new number, letter, or name, the carrier shall advise the Commission 
by letter, and shall provide information concerning the new and the old 
designation, the points between which the highway is redesignated, and 
each place where the highway is referred to in the carrier's authority. 
The new designation of the highway will be shown

[[Page 26]]

in the carrier's certificate when the Commission has occasion to reissue 
it.


<R05>
Sec. 1004.26  Misrouting, adjustment of claims.

    Carriers should adjust claims for damages resulting from misrouting. 
Where a carrier admits responsibility for billing, forwarding, or 
diverting a shipment over a higher rated route than that directed by the 
shipper or otherwise available, the misrouting carrier should refund the 
difference to the shipper (or reimburse the delivering carrier, as the 
case may be). Where the misrouting carrier alleges justification for 
using the higher rated route, the Commission may, at its discretion and 
upon appropriate petition, determine or express an advisory opinion on 
the lawfulness of such routing. This interpretation must not be used to 
evade or defeat tariff rates or to meet the rate of a competing carrier 
or route, nor to relieve a shipper from responsibility for routing 
instructions. Damages caused by misrouting are not overcharges. 
Therefore, adjustments of claims for misrouting against rail and water 
carriers are governed by 49 U.S.C. 11706 (c)(1) and (d).

<R05>
Sec. 1005.1  Applicability of regulations.

    The regulations set forth in this part shall govern the processing 
of claims for loss, damage, injury, or delay to property transported or 
accepted for transportation, in interstate or foreign commerce, by each 
railroad, express company, motor carrier, water carrier, and freight 
forwarder (hereinafter called carrier), subject to the Interstate 
Commerce Act.

[46 FR 16224, Mar. 11, 1981]


<R05>
Sec. 1005.2   Filing of claims.

    (a) Compliance with regulations. A claim for loss or damage to 
baggage or for loss, damage, injury, or delay to cargo, shall not be 
voluntarily paid by a carrier unless filed, as provided in paragraph (b) 
of this section, with the receiving or delivering carrier, or carrier 
issuing the bill of lading, receipt, ticket, or baggage check, or 
carrier on whose line the alleged loss, damage, injury, or delay 
occurred, within the specified time limits applicable thereto and as 
otherwise may be required by law, the terms of the bill of lading or 
other contract of carriage, and all tariff provisions applicable 
thereto.
    (b) Minimum filing requirements. A written or electronic 
communication (when agreed to by the carrier and shipper or receiver 
involved) from a claimant, filed with a proper carrier within the time 
limits specified in the bill of lading or contract of carriage or 
transportation and: (1) Containing facts sufficient to identify the 
baggage or shipment (or shipments) of property, (2) asserting liability 
for alleged loss, damage, injury, or delay, and (3) making claim for the 
payment of a specified or determinable amount of money, shall be 
considered as sufficient compliance with the provisions for filing 
claims embraced in the bill of lading or other contract of carriage; 
Provided, however, That where claims are electronically handled, 
procedures are established to ensure reasonable carrier access to 
supporting documents.
    (c) Documents not constituting claims. Bad order reports, appraisal 
reports of damage, notations of shortage or damage, or both, on freight 
bills, delivery receipts, or other documents, or inspection reports 
issued by carriers or their

[[Page 27]]

inspection agencies, whether the extent of loss or damage is indicated 
in dollars and cents or otherwise, shall, standing alone, not be 
considered by carriers as sufficient to comply with the minimum claim 
filing requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) Claims filed for uncertain amounts. Whenever a claim is 
presented against a proper carrier for an uncertain amount, such as 
``$100 more or less,'' the carrier against whom such claim is filed 
shall determine the condition of the baggage or shipment involved at the 
time of delivery by it, if it was delivered, and shall ascertain as 
nearly as possible the extent, if any, of the loss or damage for which 
it may be responsible. It shall not, however, voluntarily pay a claim 
under such circumstances unless and until a formal claim in writing for 
a specified or determinable amount of money shall have been filed in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.
    (e) Other claims. If investigation of a claim develops that one or 
more other carriers has been presented with a similar claim on the same 
shipment, the carrier investigating such claim shall communicate with 
each such other carrier and, prior to any agreement entered into between 
or among them as to the proper disposition of such claim or claims, 
shall notify all claimants of the receipt of conflicting or overlapping 
claims and shall require further substantiation, on the part of each 
claimant of his title to the property involved or his right with respect 
to such claim.

[37 FR 4258, Mar. 1, 1972, as amended at 47 FR 12803, Mar. 25, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 1005.3  Acknowledgment of claims.

    (a) Each carrier shall, upon receipt in writing or by electronic 
transmission of a proper claim in the manner and form described in the 
regulations, acknowledge the receipt of such claim in writing or 
electronically to the claimant within 30 days after the date of its 
receipt by the carrier unless the carrier shall have paid or declined 
such claim in writing or electronically within 30 days of the receipt 
thereof. The carrier shall indicate in its acknowledgment to the 
claimant what, if any, additional documentary evidence or other 
pertinent information may be required by it further to process the claim 
as its preliminary examination of the claim, as filed, may have 
revealed.
    (b) The carrier shall at the time each claim is received create a 
separate file and assign thereto a successive claim file number and note 
that number on all documents filed in support of the claim and all 
records and correspondence with respect to the claim, including the 
acknowledgment of receipt. At the time such claim is received the 
carrier shall cause the date of receipt to be recorded on the face of 
the claim document, and the date of receipt shall also appear in the 
carrier's acknowledgment of receipt to the claimant. The carrier shall 
also cause the claim file number to be noted on the shipping order, if 
in its possession, and the delivery receipt, if any, covering such 
shipment, unless the carrier has established an orderly and consistent 
internal procedure for assuring: (1) That all information contained in 
shipping orders, delivery receipts, tally sheets, and all other 
pertinent records made with respect to the transportation of the 
shipment on which claim is made, is available for examination upon 
receipt of a claim; (2) that all such records and documents (or true and 
complete reproductions thereof) are in fact examined in the course of 
the investigation of the claim (and an appropriate record is made that 
such examination has in fact taken place); and (3) that such procedures 
prevent the duplicate or otherwise unlawful payment of claims.

[37 FR 4258, Mar. 1, 1972, as amended at 37 FR 20943, Oct. 10, 1972; 47 
FR 12803, Mar. 25, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 1005.4   Investigation of claims.

    (a) Prompt investigation required. Each claim filed against a 
carrier in the manner prescribed herein shall be promptly and thoroughly 
investigated if investigation has not already been made prior to receipt 
of the claim.
    (b) Supporting documents. When a necessary part of an investigation, 
each claim shall be supported by the original bill of lading, evidence 
of the freight charges, if any, and either the original invoice, a 
photographic copy of the original invoice, or an exact

[[Page 28]]

copy thereof or any extract made therefrom, certified by the claimant to 
be true and correct with respect to the property and value involved in 
the claim; or certification of prices or values, with trade or other 
discounts, allowance, or deductions, of any nature whatsoever and the 
terms thereof, or depreciation reflected thereon; Provided, however, 
That where property involved in a claim has not been invoiced to the 
consignee shown on the bill of lading or where an invoice does not show 
price or value, or where the property involved has been sold, or where 
the property has been transferred at bookkeeping values only, the 
carrier shall, before voluntarily paying a claim, require the claimant 
to establish the destination value in the quantity, shipped, 
transported, or involved; Provided, further, That when supporting 
documents are determined to be a necessary part of an investigation, the 
supporting documents are retained by the carriers for possible 
Commission inspection.
    (c) Verification of Loss. When an asserted claim for loss of an 
entire package or an entire shipment cannot be otherwise authenticated 
upon investigation, the carrier shall obtain from the consignee of the 
shipment involved a certified statement in writing that the property for 
which the claim is filed has not been received from any other source.

[37 FR 4258, Mar. 1, 1972, as amended at 37 FR 23909, Nov. 10, 1972; 47 
FR 12803, Mar. 25, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 1005.5  Disposition of claims.

    (a) Each carrier subject to the Interstate Commerce Act which 
receives a written or electronically transmitted claim for loss or 
damage to baggage or for loss, damage, injury, or delay to property 
transported shall pay, decline, or make a firm compromise settlement 
offer in writing or electronically to the claimant within 120 days after 
receipt of the claim by the carrier; Provided, however, That, if the 
claim cannot be processed and disposed of within 120 days after the 
receipt thereof, the carrier shall at that time and at the expiration of 
each succeeding 60-day period while the claim remains pending, advise 
the claimant in writing or electronically of the status of the claim and 
the reason for the delay in making final disposition thereof and it 
shall retain a copy of such advice to the claimant in its claim file 
thereon.
    (b) When settling a claim for loss or damage, a common carrier by 
motor vehicle of household goods as defined in Sec. 1056.1(b)(1) shall 
use the replacement costs of the lost or damaged item as a base to apply 
a depreciation factor to arrive at the current actual value of the lost 
or damaged item: Provided, That where an item cannot be replaced or no 
suitable replacement is obtainable, the proper measure of damages shall 
be the original costs, augmented by a factor derived from a consumer 
price index, and adjusted downward by a factor depreciation over average 
useful life.

[37 FR 4258, Mar. 1, 1972, as amended at 46 FR 16224, Mar. 11, 1981; 47 
FR 12803, Mar. 25, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 1005.6   Processing of salvage.

    (a) Whenever baggage or material, goods, or other property 
transported by a carrier subject to the provisions herein contained is 
damaged or alleged to be damaged and is, as a consequence thereof, not 
delivered or is rejected or refused upon tender thereof to the owner, 
consignee, or person entitled to receive such property, the carrier, 
after giving due notice, whenever practicable to do so, to the owner and 
other parties that may have an interest therein, and unless advised to 
the contrary after giving such notice, shall undertake to sell or 
dispose of such property directly or by the employment of a competent 
salvage agent. The carrier shall only dispose of the property in a 
manner that will fairly and equally protect the best interests of all 
persons having an interest therein. The carrier shall make an itemized 
record sufficient to identify the property involved so as to be able to 
correlate it to the shipment or transportation involved, and claim, if 
any, filed thereon. The carrier also shall assign to each lot of such 
property a successive lot number and note that lot number on its record 
of shipment and claim, if any claim is filed thereon.

[[Page 29]]

    (b) Whenever disposition of salvage material or goods shall be made 
directly to an agent or employee of a carrier or through a salvage agent 
or company in which the carrier or one or more of its directors, 
officers, or managers has any interest, financial or otherwise, that 
carrier's salvage records shall fully reflect the particulars of each 
such transaction or relationship, or both, as the case may be.
    (c) Upon receipt of a claim on a shipment on which salvage has been 
processed in the manner hereinbefore prescribed, the carrier shall 
record in its claim file thereon the lot number assigned, the amount of 
money recovered, if any, from the disposition of such property, and the 
date of transmittal of such money to the person or persons lawfully 
entitled to receive the same.

[37 FR 4258, Mar. 1972]


<R05>
Sec. 1005.7   Weight as a measure of loss.

    Where weight is used as a measure of loss in rail transit of scrap 
iron and steel and actual tare and gross weights are determined at 
origin and destination, the settlement of claims shall be based upon a 
comparison of net weights at origin and destination.

permit individuals to determine whether information about them is 
contained in Commission files and, if so, to obtain access to that 
information; to establish procedures whereby individuals may have 
inaccurate and incomplete information corrected; and, to restrict access 
by unauthorized persons to that information.

signature, one of which shows the individual's current home or business 
address; and
    (3) Providing such other proof of identity as the Commission deems 
satisfactory in the circumstances of a particular request.
    (b) Nothing in this section shall preclude the Commission from 
requiring additional identification before granting access to the 
records if there is reason to believe that the person making the request 
may not be the individual to whom the record pertains, or where the 
sensitivity of the data may warrant.
    (c) The requirements of this subsection shall not apply if the 
records involved would be available to any person under the Freedom of 
Information Act.


<R05>
Sec. 1007.5   Disclosure of requested information to individuals; fees for copies of records.

    (a) Any individual who has requested access to his or her record or 
to any information pertaining to that individual in the manner 
prescribed in Sec. 1007.3 and has identified himself or herself as 
prescribed in Sec. 1007.4 shall be permitted to review the record and 
have a copy made of all or any portion thereof in a form comprehensible 
to the individual, subject to fees for copying services set forth in 
paragraph (f) of this section. Upon request, persons of the individual's 
own choosing may accompany the individual, provided that the individual 
has furnished a written statement authorizing discussion of his or her 
record in the accompanying person's presence.
    (b) Access will generally be granted in the office of the Commission 
where the records are maintained during normal business hours, but for 
good cause shown the Commission may grant access at another office of 
the Commission or at different times for the convenience of the 
individual making the request. When a request for access is from a 
Commission employee, this request may be granted by forwarding the 
information desired through registered mail, return receipt requested.
    (c) Where a document containing information about an individual also 
contains information not pertaining to him or her, the portion not 
pertaining to the individual shall not be disclosed except to the extent 
the information is available to any person under the Freedom of 
Information Act. If the records sought cannot be provided for review and 
copying in a meaningful form, the Commission shall provide to the 
individual a summary of the information concerning the individual 
contained in the record or records which shall be complete and accurate 
in all material aspects.
    (d) Where the disclosure involves medical records, the Privacy 
Officer may determine that such information will be provided only to a 
physician designated by the individual.
    (e) Requests for copies of documents may be directed to the Privacy 
Officer or to the member of the Commission's staff through whom 
arrangements for access were made.
    (f) Fees for copies of records shall be charged at the rate set 
forth in 49 CFR 1002.1(d). Fees for requests requiring the use of a 
computer shall be charged at the actual cost for machine time. Payment 
should be made by check or money order payable to the Treasury of the 
United States. When it is determined to be in the best interest of the 
public, the Privacy Officer may waive the fee provision.
    (g) Nothing in this subsection or in Sec. 1007.3 shall:
    (1) Require the disclosure of records exempted under Sec. 1007.12 of 
these rules, including the exemption relating to investigative records;
    (2) Allow an individual access to any information compiled in 
reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding or a criminal 
proceeding; or,
    (3) Require the furnishing of information or records which in the 
regular course of business cannot be retrieved by the name or other 
identifier of the individual making the request.

purposes required to be accomplished by statute or by Executive Order of 
the President.
    (b) The Commission will maintain no record describing how any 
individual exercises rights guaranteed by the First Amendment of the 
United States Constitution unless expressly authorized by statute or by 
the individual about whom the record is maintained or unless pertinent 
to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity.
    (c) The Commission will collect information to the greatest extent

Commission in making any determination about any individual with such 
accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably

<R05>
Sec. 1007.8   Amendment of a record.

    (a) Any individual may request amendment of information pertaining 
to him which is contained in a system of records maintained by the 
Commission and which is filed under his name or other individual 
identifier if he believes the information is not accurate, relevant, 
timely or complete. A request for amendment shall be directed to the 
Privacy Officer.
    (b) A request for amendment may be made by mail or in person and 
shall: (1) Be in writing and signed by the person making the request; 
(2) describe the particular record to be amended with sufficient 
specificity to permit the record to be located among those maintained by 
the Commission; and (3) specify the nature of the amendment sought and 
the justification for the requested change. The person making the 
request may be required to provide the information specified in 
Secs. 1007.3 and 1007.4 in order to simplify identification of the 
record and permit verification of the identity of the person making the 
request for amendment.
    (c) Receipt of a request for amendment will be acknowledged in 
writing within ten days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal public 
holidays); except that if the individual is given notice within the ten-
day period that his or her request will or will not be complied with, no 
acknowledgment is required.
    (d) Assistance in preparing a request to amend a record may be 
obtained from the Privacy Officer, Office of the Managing Director, 
Interstate Commerce Commission, Twelfth Street and Constitution Avenue 
NW., Washington, DC 20423.
    (e) Upon receipt of a request for amendment the Privacy Officer or a 
person designated by him shall promptly determine whether the record is 
materially inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, or is irrelevant or not 
timely, as claimed by the individual, and, if so, shall cause the record 
to be amended in accordance with the individual's request.
    (f) If the Privacy Officer or designee grants the request to amend 
the record, the individual shall promptly be advised of the decision and 
of the action taken, and notice shall be given of the correction and its 
substance to each person or agency to whom the record had previously 
been disclosed, as shown on the record of disclosures maintained in 
accordance with Sec. 1007.6(b).
    (g) If the Privacy Officer or designee disagrees in whole or in part 
with a request for amendment of a record, the individual shall promptly 
be notified of the complete or partial denial of his request and the 
reasons for the refusal. The individual shall also be notified of the 
procedures for administrative review by the Chairman of any complete or 
partial denial of a request for amendment, which are set forth in 
Sec. 1007.9.

[[Page 34]]

    (h) If a request is received for amendment of a record prepared by 
another agency which is in the possession or control of the Commission, 
the request for amendment will be forwarded to that agency. If that 
agency determines that the correction should be made, the Commission 
will amend its records accordingly and notify the individual making the 
request for amendment of the change. If the other agency declines to 
make the amendment, the Privacy Officer or designee will independently 
determine whether the amendment will be made to the record in the 
Commission's possession or control, considering any explanation given by 
the other agency for its decision.

petitioner may, if he or she wishes, state such facts and cite such 
legal or other authorities as are considered appropriate.

petition is denied, the petitioner will be notified in writing of the 
reasons for such denial, and the provisions for judicial review of that 
determination which are set forth in section 552a(g) (1)(A) and (2)(A),

the individual has requested, the individual may file with the Privacy 
Officer a concise statement setting forth why he or she disagrees with 
the Chairman's denial of the request. Any subsequent disclosure 
containing information about which a statement of disagreement has been 
filed shall clearly note the portion which is disputed and include a

Sec. 1007.12   Exemptions.

    (a) Investigatory materials compiled for law enforcement purposes 
are exempt from portions of the Privacy Act of 1974 and of these rules 
on the basis and to the extent that individual access to these files 
could impair the effectiveness and orderly conduct of the Commission's 
enforcement program. Provided, however, That if any individual is denied 
any right, privilege, or benefit to which he or she would otherwise be 
entitled by Federal law, or for which he or she would otherwise be 
eligible, as a result of the maintenance of such material, such 
materials shall be provided to the individual; except to the extent that 
the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source 
who furnished information to the Government under an express promise 
that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior 
to the effective date of this section, under an implied promise that the 
identity of the source would be held in confidence.
    (b) Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of 
determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for employment 
with or contracts with the Commission are exempt from portions of the 
Privacy Act of 1974 and of these rules to the extent that it identifies 
a confidential source. This is done in order to encourage persons from 
whom information is sought to provide information to the Commission 
which, absent assurances of confidentiality, they might otherwise be 
unwilling to give. However, if practicable, material identifying a 
confidential source shall be extracted or summarized in a manner which 
protects the source, and the summary or extract shall be provided to the 
requesting individual.
    (c) Complaints and investigatory materials compiled by the 
Commission's Office of Inspector General are exempt from the provisions 
of 5 U.S.C. 552a and the regulations in this part, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552a(j)(2), except subsections (b), (c)(1) and (2), (e)(4)(A) through 
(F), (e)(6), (7), (9), (10), and (11) and (i) to the extent that the 
system of records pertains to the enforcement of criminal laws. 
Complaint and investigatory materials compiled by the Commission's 
Office of Inspector General for law enforcement purposes also are exempt 
from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a and the regulations of this part, 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2).

shall comply with Sec. 1008.5(c) to obtain the additional information 
required.
    (e) A carrier shall accept copies instead of the orginal documents 
required to be submitted in this section where the carrier is furnished

on all documents filed in support of the claim and all records and 
correspondence with respect to the claim, including the written or 
electronic acknowledgment of receipt required under Sec. 1008.7. If 
pertinent to the disposition of the claim, the carrier shall also note

extenuating circumstances. If the carrier declines to pay a claim or 
makes settlement in an amount different from that sought, the carrier 
shall notify the claimant in writing or electronically, of the reason(s) 
for its action, citing tariff authority or other pertinent information 
developed as a result of its investigation.

<R05>
Sec. 1008.9  Disposition of unidentified payments, overcharges, duplicate payments, and overcollections not supported by claims.

days of receipt of the payment and request information which will enable 
it to identify the payment. If the carrier does not receive the 
information requested within 90 days from the date of the notice, the 
carrier may treat the unidentified payment as a payment in fact of 
freight charges owing to it. Following the 90-day period, the regular 
claims procedure under this part shall be applicable.
    (2) Notice shall be in writing and clearly indicate that it is a 
final notice and not a bill. Notice shall include: The check number, 
amount, and date; the payor's name; and any additional basic information 
the carrier is able to provide. The final notice also must inform payor 
that: (i) Applicable regulations allow the carrier to conditionally 
retain the payment as revenue in the absence of a timely response by the 
payor; and (ii) following the 90-day period the regular claims procedure 
shall be applicable.
    (3) Upon a carrier's receipt of information from the payor, the 
carrier shall, within 14 days: (i) Make a complete refund of such funds 
to the payor; or (ii) notify the payor that the information supplied is 
not sufficient to identify the unapplied payment and request additional 
information; or (iii) notify the payor of the carrier's determination 
that such payment was applicable to particular freight charges lawfully 
due the carrier. Where no refund is made by the carrier, the carrier 
shall advise the payor of its right to file a formal claim for refund 
with the carrier in accordance with the regular claims procedure under 
this part.
    (b) When a carrier which participates in a transportation movement, 
but did not collect the transporation charges, finds that an overpayment 
has been made, that carrier shall immediately notify the collecting 
carrier. When the collecting carrier (when single or joint line haul) 
discovers or is notified by such a participating carrier that an 
overcharge, duplicate payment, or overcollection exists for any 
tranportation charge which has not been the subject of a claim, the 
carrier shall create a file as if a claim had been submitted and shall 
record in the file the date it discovered or was notified of the 
overpayment. The carrier that collected the charges shall then refund 
the amount of the overpayment to the person who paid the transportation 
charges or to the person that made duplicate payment within 30 days from 
the date of such discovery or notification.

Sec. 1012.1  General provisions.

    (a) The regulations contained in this part are issued pursuant to 
the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552b(g), added by section 3(a) of the 
Government in the Sunshine Act, Pub. L. 94-409 (Act), and section 17(3) 
of the Interstate Commerce Act. They establish procedures under which 
meetings of the Interstate Commerce Commission (Commission), Divisions 
of the Commission (Division), and standing committees of the Commission 
are held. They apply to oral arguments as well as to deliberative 
conferences. They apply to meetings of the Commission and of Divisions 
and committees of the Commission where the Division or committee is 
empowered to act on the Commission's behalf, but not where a Division or 
committee is meeting only to formulate an internal recommendation to the 
Commission. They include provisions for giving advance public notice of 
meetings, for holding meetings which may lawfully be closed to the 
public, and for issuing minutes and transcripts of meetings.
    (b) The words meeting and conference are used interchangeably in 
this part to mean the deliberations of at least a majority of the 
members of the Commission, a Division, or a committee of the Commission 
where such deliberations determine or result in the joint conduct or 
disposition of official Commission business. They do not include 
meetings held to determine whether some future meeting should be open or 
closed to the public. They do not include the deliberations of members 
of

[[Page 48]]

boards of employees of the Commission.
    (c) These regulations are not intended to govern situations in which 
members of the Commission consider individually and vote by notation 
upon matters which are circulated to them in writing. Copies of the 
votes or statements of position of all Commissioners eligible to 
participate in action taken by notation voting will be made available, 
as soon as possible after the date upon which the action taken is made 
public or any decision or order adopted is served, in a public reading 
room or other easily accessible place within the Commission, or upon 
written request to the Secretary of the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 1012.2  Time and place of meetings.

    (a) Conferences, oral arguments, and other meetings are held at the 
Commission's headquarters building at the northwest corner of 12th 
Street and Constitution Avenue in Washington, DC, unless advance notice 
of an alternative site is given. Room assignments for meetings will be

the Interstate Commerce Commission building and at the Commission's 
Public Information Office (Room 1211).
    (b) Regular Commission conferences are held on the first and third 
Tuesdays of each month, or on the following day if the regular 
conference day is a holiday. Oral arguments before the Commission are 
normally scheduled on the first or third Wednesday of each month. 
Regular Commission conferences and oral arguments before the Commission 
or a Division normally begin at 9:30 a.m. A luncheon recess is taken at 
approximately noon, and other recesses may be called by the presiding 
officer. Times for reconvening following a recess, or on subsequent days 
if a conference or oral argument lasts more than one day, are set by the 
presiding officer at the time the recess is announced.
    (c) Special Commission conferences, Division conferences, oral 
arguments before a Division, and meetings of committees of the 
Commission are scheduled by the Chairman of the Commission or of the 
respective Division or committee.
    (d) If one or more portions of the same meeting are open to the 
public while another portion or other portions are closed, all those 
portions of the meeting which are open to the public are scheduled at 
the beginning of the meeting agenda, and are followed by those portions 
which are closed.


<R05>
Sec. 1012.3  Public notice.

    (a) Unless a majority of the Commission determines that such 
information is exempt from disclosure under the Act, public notice of 
the scheduling of a meeting will be given by posting a notice on the 
bulletin board in the Commission's Public Information Office, by filing 
a copy of the notice with the Secretary of the Commission for posting 
and for service on all parties of record in any proceeding which is the 
subject of the meeting or any other person who has requested notice with 
respect to meetings of the Commission, and by submitting a copy of the 
notice for publication in the Federal Register.
    (b) Public notice of a scheduled meeting will contain:
    (1) The date, time, place, and subject matter of the meeting.
    (2) Whether it is open to the public.
    (3) If the meeting or any portion of the meeting is not open to the 
public, an explanation of the action taken in closing the meeting or

the meeting and their affiliations.
    (4) If a vote is taken on the question whether to close a meeting or 
a portion of a meeting to the public, a statement of the vote or 
position of each Commissioner eligible to participate in that vote. If 
such a vote is taken, public notice of its result will be posted within 
one working day following completion of the voting. If the result of the 
vote is to close the meeting or a portion of the meeting, an explanation 
of that action will be included in the notice to be issued within one 
working day following completion of the voting. The public notice 
otherwise required by this subparagraph may be withheld if the 
Commission finds that such information is exempt from disclosure under 
the Act.

called to consider or determine whether to suspend or investigate a 
tariff or schedule under sections 15(7), 15(8), 215(g), 218(c), 307(g), 
307(i), or 406(e) of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C. 15(7), 
15(8), 316(g), 318(c), 907(g), 907(i), 1006(e)); to consider whether to

or 1005(d)); or to consider or dispose of an application for temporary 
authority under section 210a(a) or 311(a) of the Interstate Commerce Act 
(49 U.S.C. 310a(a) or 911(a)). Such meetings will normally be called on 
less than one week's notice, and public notice will be posted and 
published at the earliest practicable time.
    (e) If a majority of the Commissioners eligible to participate in 
the conduct or disposition of the matter which is the subject of a 
meeting determines, by recorded vote, that Commission business requires 
that a meeting be called on less than one week's notice, the meeting may 
be called on short notice, and public notice will be posted and 
published at the earliest practicable time.
    (f) Changes in the scheduling of a meeting which has been the 
subject of a public notice will also be made the subject of a public 
notice, which will be posted at the earliest practicable time. Changes 
in, or additions to a conference agenda or in the open or closed status 
of a meeting will be made only if a majority of the Commissioners 
eligible to participate in the conduct or disposition of the matter 
which is the subject of the meeting determines, by recorded vote, that 
the Commission's business requires such change and that no earlier 
announcement of the change was possible. In such a case, the public 
notice of the change, will show the vote of each Commissioner on the 
change.


<R05>
Sec. 1012.4  Public participation.

    (a) In the case of Commission or Division conferences or meetings of

adjudication; (iii) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal

the meeting, it may be disposed of as the first order of business at the 
meeting, in which case the decision will be communicated to the 
petitioner orally through the Commission's Public Information Officer or 
other spokesperson.

PART 1013--GUIDELINES FOR THE PROPER USE OF VOTING TRUSTS--Table of Contents

<R05>


Sec.
1013.1  The independence of the trustee of a voting trust.
1013.2  The irrevocability of the trust.
1013.3  Review and reporting requirements for regulated carriers.

    Authority: 49 U.S.C. 10321 and 5 U.S.C. 553.

    Source: 44 FR 59909, Oct. 17, 1979, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1013.1  The independence of the trustee of a voting trust.

    (a) In order to avoid an unlawful control violation, the independent 
voting trust should be established before a controlling block of voting 
securities is purchased.
    (b) In voting the trusteed stock, the trustee should maintain 
complete independence from the creator of the trust (the settlor).
    (c) Neither the trustee, the settlor, nor their respective 
affiliates should have any officers or board members in common or direct 
business arrangements, other than the voting trust, that could be 
construed as creating an indicium of control by the settlor over the 
trustee.
    (d) The trustee should not use the voting power of the trust in any 
way which would create any dependence or intercorporate relationship 
between the settlor and the carrier whose corporate securities 
constitute the corpus of the trust.
    (e) The trustee should be entitled to receive cash dividends 
declared and paid upon the trusteed voting stock

[[Page 52]]

and turn them over to the settlor. Dividends other than cash should be 
received and held by the trustee upon the same terms and conditions as 
the stock which constitutes the corpus of the trust.
    (f) If the trustee becomes disqualified because of a violation of 
the trust agreement or if the trustee resigns, the settlor should 
appoint a successor trustee within 15 days.


<R05>
Sec. 1013.2  The irrevocability of the trust.

    (a) The trust and the nomination of the trustee during the term of 
the trust should be irrevocable.
    (b) The trust should remain in effect until certain events, 
specified in the trust, occur. For example, the trust might remain in 
effect until (1) all the deposited stock is sold to a person not 
affiliated with the settlor or (2) the trustee receives a Commission 
decision authorizing the settlor to acquire control of the carrier or 
authorizing the release of the securities for any reason.
    (c) The settlor should not be able to control the events terminating 
the trust except by filing with this Commission an application to 
control the carrier whose stock is held in trust.
    (d) The trust agreement should contain provisions to ensure that no 
violations of 49 U.S.C. 11343 will result from termination of the trust.


<R05>
Sec. 1013.3  Review and reporting requirements for regulated carriers.

    (a) Any carrier choosing to utilize a voting trust may voluntarily 
submit a copy of the voting trust to the Commission for review. The 
Commission's staff will give an informal, nonbinding opinion as to 
whether the voting trust effectively insulates the settlor from any 
violation of Commission policy against unauthorized acquisition of 
control of a regulated carrier.
    (b) Any person who establishes an independent trust for the receipt 
of the voting stock of carrier must file a copy of the trust, along with 
any auxiliary or modifying documents, with the Commission.
    (c) Any carrier required to file a Schedule 13D with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (17 CFR 240.13d-1) which reports the purchase of 
5 percent or more of the registered securities of another I.C.C. 
regulated carrier (or the listed shares of a company controlling 10 
percent or more of the stock of an I.C.C. regulated carrier), must 
simultaneously file a copy of that schedule with this Commission, along 
with any supplements to that schedule.
    (d) Failure to comply with the reporting requirements in paragraphs 
(b) or (c) of this section will result in denial of the application in 
which acquisition of control, through the acquisition of the voting 
stock of another carrier, is sought, unless the applicant shows, by 
clear and convincing evidence, and the Commission finds, that the 
failure to comply was unintentional and that denial of the application 
will substantially and adversely affect the public interest and the 
national transportation policy.

level of achievement as that provided to others;
    (iv) Provide different or separate aid, benefits, or services to

effective as those provided to others;
    (v) Deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to 
participate as a member of planning or advisory boards; or
    (vi) Otherwise limit a qualified handicapped person in the enjoyment

separate or different, despite the existence of permissibly separate or 
different programs or activities.

part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted programs or 
activities.

[[Page 56]]

Secs. 1014.141--1014.148  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1014.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 1014.150, no qualified 
handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1014.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does 
not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;
    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant historic features of an historic property; or
    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 1014.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that 
handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or 
activity.
    (b) Methods--(1) General. The agency may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and 
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any 
other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not 
required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other 
methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The 
agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet 
accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any 
regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for 
meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority 
to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified 
handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 1014.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall 
give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped 
persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is 
not required because of Sec. 1014.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative 
methods of achieving program accessibility include--
    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through 
portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by

[[Page 57]]

October 21, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are 
undertaken, such changes shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any 
event as expeditiously as possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987, a transition plan setting 
forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall 
provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped 
persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped 
persons;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 1014.151  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the 
Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 
CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this 
section.
Secs. 1014.152--1014.159  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1014.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
handicapped person.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and adminstrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 1014.160 would 
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or 
his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for 
use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, 
and must be accompanied by a written statement of

[[Page 58]]

the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to 
comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, 
to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits 
and services of the program or activity.
Secs. 1014.161--1014.169  [Reserved]


<R05>

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this 
section applies to all allegations of discrimination on the basis of 
handicap in programs or activities conducted by the agency.
    (b) The agency shall process complaints alleging violations of 
section 504 with respect to employment according to the procedures 
established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR 
part 1613 pursuant to section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29

    (c) The Equal Opportunity Officer shall be responsible for 
coordinating implementation of this section. Complaints may be sent to 
Director, Office of Human Relations, Interstate Commerce Commission, 
Room 3147, Washington, DC 20423.
    (d) The agency shall accept and investigate all complete complaints 
for which it has jurisdiction. All complete complaints must be filed 
within 180 days of the alleged act of discrimination. The agency may 
extend this time period for good cause.
    (e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have 
jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make 
reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate government 
entity.
    (f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation 
Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a 
building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), or section 502 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 792), is not readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.
    (g) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which 
it has jurisdiction, the agency shall notify the complainant of the 
results of the investigation in a letter containing--
    (1) Findings of fact and conclusions of law;
    (2) A description of a remedy for each violation found; and
    (3) A notice of the right to appeal.
    (h) Appeals of the findings of fact and conclusions of law or 
remedies must be filed by the complainant within 90 days of receipt from 
the agency of the letter required by Sec. 1014.170(g). The agency may 
extend this time for good cause.
    (i) Timely appeals shall be accepted and processed by the head of 
the agency.
    (j) The head of the agency shall notify the complainant of the 
results of the appeal within 60 days of the receipt of the request. If 
the head of the agency determines that additional information is needed 
from the complainant, he or she shall have 60 days from the date of 
receipt of the additional information to make his or her determination 
on the appeal.
    (k) The time limits cited in paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section 
may be extended with the permission of the Assistant Attorney General.
    (l) The agency may delegate its authority for conducting complaint 
investigations to other Federal agencies, except that the authority for

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 1016.101  Purpose of these rules.

    The Equal Access to Justice Act (5 U.S.C. 504) (called the ``Act'' 
in this part), provides for the award of attorney fees and other 
expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain 
administrative proceedings (called ``adversary adjudications'') before 
the Interstate Commerce Commission. An eligible party may receive an 
award when it prevails over the Commission or another agency of the 
United States participating in the Commission proceeding, unless the 
Commission's position in the proceeding, or that of the other agency, 
was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award 
unjust. The rules in this part describe the parties eligible for awards 
and the proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for 
awards, and the procedures and standards that the Commission will use to 
make them.


<R05>
Sec. 1016.102  When the Act applies.

    The Act applies to any adversary adjudication pending before the 
Commission after October 1, 1981. This includes proceedings begun before 
October 1, 1981, if final Commission action has not been taken before 
that date, regardless of when they were initiated or when final 
Commission action occurs. These rules incorporate the changes made in 
Pub. L. No. 99-80, 99 Stat. 183, which applies generally to cases 
instituted after October 1, 1984. If awards are sought for cases pending 
on October 1, 1981 or filed between that date and September 30, 1984, 
the prior statutory provisions (to the extent they differ from the 
existing ones, and our implementing rules) apply.

[54 FR 26379, June 23, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 1016.103  Proceedings covered.

    (a) The Act applies to adversary adjudications conducted by the 
Commission under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of this or any other 
agency of the United States, or any component of an agency, is presented 
by an attorney or other representative (hereinafter ``agency counsel'') 
who enters an appearance and participates in the proceeding. Proceedings 
for the purpose of establishing or fixing a rate are not covered by the 
Act. Proceedings to grant or renew licenses are also excluded, but 
proceedings to modify, suspend, or revoke licenses are covered if they 
are otherwise ``adversary adjudications.'' Generally, the types of 
Commission proceedings covered by the Act include, but are not limited 
to, investigation proceedings instituted under 49 U.S.C. 11701 and 49 
U.S.C. 10925 and disciplinary proceedings conducted pursuant to 49 CFR 
1100.11.
    (b) The Commission may also designate a proceeding not listed in 
paragraph (a) of this section as an adversary adjudication for purposes 
of the Act by so stating in an order initiating the proceeding, 
designating the matter for hearing or at any other time during the 
proceeding. The Commission's failure to designate a proceeding as an 
adversary adjudication shall not preclude the filing of an application 
by a party who believes the proceeding is covered by the Act; whether 
the proceeding is covered will then be an issue for resolution in 
proceedings on the application.
    (c) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the Act and 
matters specifically excluded from coverage,

[[Page 60]]

any award made will include only fees and expenses related to covered 
issues.


<R05>
Sec. 1016.104  Decisionmaking authority.

    Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission in a particular 
proceeding, each application for an award under this part shall be 
assigned for decision to the official or decisionmaking body that 
entered the decision in the adversary adjudication. That official or 
decisionmaking body is referred to in this part as the ``adjudicative 
officer.''

[46 FR 61660, Dec. 18, 1981, as amended at 54 FR 26379, June 23, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 1016.105  Eligibility of applicants.

    (a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses 
under the Act, the applicant must be a party to the adversary 
adjudication for which it seeks an award, it must have stood in an 
adversary relationship to the position taken by agency counsel, and it 
must have prevailed on one or more of the issues raised by agency 
counsel. The term ``party''is defined in 5 U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(B). The 
applicant must show that it meets all conditions of eligibility set out 
in this subpart and in Subpart B.
    (b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:
    (1) An individual whose net worth did not exceed $2 million at the 
time the adversary adjudication was initiated;
    (2) Any owner of an unincorporated business, or any partnership, 
corporation, association, unit of local government, or organization 
whose net worth does not exceed $7 million and which had no more than 
500 employees at the time the adversary adjudication was initiated;
    (3) Any organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) exempt from taxation under 
section 501(a) of such Code, or a cooperative association as defined in 
section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)), 
may be a party regardless of the net worth of such organization or 
cooperative association.
    (c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of 
employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the 
proceeding was initiated.
    (d) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly 
perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the 
applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included 
on a proportional basis. Independent contractors under lease to motor 
carriers are not employees of the carriers under these rules. Also, 
agents for motor common carriers of household goods are not employees of 
their respective principal carriers.
    (e) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all 
of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any 
individual, corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly 
controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of 
the applicant or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant 
directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares 
or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this 
part, unless the adjudicative officer determines that such treatment 
would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in light of the 
actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the 
adjudicative officer may determine that financial relationships of the 
applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute 
special circumstances that would make an award unjust.
    (f) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on 
behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible 
is not itself eligible for an award.

[46 FR 61660, Dec. 18, 1981, as amended at 54 FR 26379, June 23, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 1016.106  Standards for awards.

    (a) A prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and 
expenses incurred in connection with a proceeding, or in a significant 
and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, unless the position 
of the agency over which the applicant has prevailed was substantially 
justified. Whether or not the position of the agency was substantially 
justified shall be determined on the basis of the administrative record 
made in the adversary adjudication for which fees and other expenses are

[[Page 61]]

sought. The burden of proof that an award should not be made to an 
eligible prevailing applicant is on the agency counsel, which may avoid 
an award by showing that its position was reasonable in law and fact.
    (b) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly 
or unreasonably protracted the proceeding or if special circumstances 
make the award sought unjust.

[46 FR 61660, Dec. 18, 1981, as amended at 54 FR 26379, June 23, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 1016.107  Allowable fees and expenses.

    (a) Awards will be based on rates customarily charged by persons 
engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents and expert 
witnesses, even if the services were made available without charge or at 
a reduced rate to the applicant.
    (b) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under these rules 
may exceed $75.00 per hour, unless a higher fee is justified. 5 U.S.C. 
504(b)(1)(A). However, an award may also include the reasonable expenses 
of the attorney, agent, or witness as a separate item, if the attorney, 
agent, or witness ordinarily charges clients separately for such 
expenses.
    (c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an 
attorney, agent or expert witness, the adjudicative officer shall 
consider the following:
    (1) If the attorney, agent or witness is in private practice, his or 
her customary fee for similar services, or, if an employee of the 
applicant, the fully allocated cost of the services;
    (2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in 
which the attorney, agent, or witness ordinarily performs services;
    (3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;
    (4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or 
complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and
    (5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services 
provided.
    (d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, 
test, project or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be 
awarded, to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed 
the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter 
was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.

[46 FR 61660, Dec. 18, 1981, as amended at 54 FR 26379, June 23, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 1016.109  Awards against other agencies.

    If an applicant is entitled to an award because it prevails over 
another agency of the United States that participates in a proceeding 
before this agency and takes a position that is not substantially 
justified, the award or an appropriate portion of the award shall be 
made against that agency.


<R04>
             Subpart B--Information Required From Applicants


<R05>
Sec. 1016.201  Contents of application.

    (a) An application for an award of fees and expenses under the Act 
shall identify the applicant and the proceeding for which an award is 
sought. The application shall show that the applicant has prevailed and 
identify the position of the Commission or other agencies in the 
proceeding that the applicant alleges was not substantially justified. 
Unless the applicant is an individual, the application shall also state 
the number of employees of the applicant and describe briefly the type 
and purpose of its organization or business.
    (b) The application shall also include a statement that the 
applicant's net worth does not exceed $2 million (if an individual) or 
$7 million (for all other applicants, including their affiliates). 
However, an applicant may omit this statement if:
    (1) It attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service 
that it qualifies as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of 
the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) exempt from taxation 
under section 501(a) of such Code; or
    (2) It states that it is a cooperative association as defined in 
section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)).
    (c) The application shall state the amount of fees and expenses for 
which an award is sought.

[[Page 62]]

    (d) The application may also include any other matters that the 
applicant wishes the Commission to consider in determining whether and 
in what amount an award should be made.
    (e) The application shall be signed by the applicant or an 
authorized officer or attorney of the applicant. It shall also contain 
or be accompanied by a written verification under oath or under penalty 
of perjury that the information provided in the application is true and 
correct.

[46 FR 61660, Dec. 18, 1981, as amended at 54 FR 26380, June 23, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 1016.202  Net worth exhibit.

    (a) Each applicant must provide with its application a detailed 
exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as 
defined in Sec. 1016.105(f) of this part) when the proceeding was 
initiated. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant 
that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' 
assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the 
applicant qualifies under the standards in this part. The adjudicative 
officer may require an applicant to file additional information to 
determine its eligibility for an award.
    (b) Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public 
record of the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public 
disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes 
that there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may file 
a motion to withhold the information from public disclosure. The burden 
is on the moving party to justify the confidentiality of the 
information.

<R05>
Sec. 1016.203  Documentation of fees and expenses.

    The application shall be accompanied by full documentation of the 
fees and expenses, including the cost of any study, analysis, 
engineering report, test, project or similar matter, for which an award 
is sought. A separate itemized statement shall be submitted for each 
professional firm or individual whose services are covered by the 
application, showing the hours spent in connection with the proceeding 
by each individual, a description of the specific services performed, 
the rate at which each fee has been computed, any expenses for which 
reimbursement is sought, the total amount claimed, and the total amount 
paid or payable by the applicant or by another person or entity for the 
services provided. The adjudicative officer may require the applicant to 
provide vouchers, receipts, or other substantiation for any expenses 
claimed.

<R05>
Sec. 1016.301  When an application may be filed.

    (a) An application may be filed whenever the applicant has prevailed 
in the proceeding or in a significant and discrete substantive portion 
of the proceeding, but in no case later than 30 days after an 
administratively final disposition of the proceeding.
    (b) If review or reconsideration is sought or taken of a decision as 
to which an applicant believes it has prevailed, proceedings for the 
award of fees shall be stayed pending final disposition of the 
underlying controversy.
    (c) For purposes of this rule, see the Commission's rules governing 
appellate procedures at Secs. 1115.2 and 1115.3 to determine when a 
decision becomes administratively final.

<R05>
Sec. 1016.302  Filing and service of documents.

    Any application for an award or other pleading or document related 
to an application shall be filed and served on all parties to the 
proceeding in the same manner as other pleadings in the proceeding,

representing the agency against which an award is sought may file an 
answer to the application. Unless agency counsel requests

[[Page 63]]

an extension of time for filing or files a statement of intent to 
negotiate under paragraph (b) of this section, failure to file an answer 
within the 30-day period may be treated as a consent to the award 
requested.
    (b) If agency counsel and the applicant believe that the issues in 
the fee application can be settled, they may jointly file a statement of 
their intent to negotiate a settlement. The filing of this statement 
shall extend the time for filing an answer for an additional 30 days, 
and further extensions may be granted as justified.
    (c) The answer shall explain in detail any objections to the award 
requested and identify the facts relied on in support of agency 
counsel's position. If the answer is based on any alleged facts not 
already in the record of the proceeding, agency counsel shall include 
with the answer either supporting affidavits or a request for further 
proceedings under Sec. 1016.307.

[46 FR 61660, Dec. 18, 1981, as amended at 54 FR 26380, June 23, 1989]

either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under 
Sec. 1016.307.


<R05>
Sec. 1016.305  Comments by other parties.

    Any party to a proceeding other than the applicant and agency

served or on an answer within 15 days after it is served. A commenting 
party may not broaden the issues.

<R05>
Sec. 1016.306  Settlement.

    The applicant and agency counsel may agree on a proposed settlement 
of the award before final action on the application, either in 
connection with a settlement of the underlying proceeding, or after the 
underlying proceeding has been concluded. If a prevailing party and 
agency counsel agree on a proposed settlement of an award before an 
application has been filed, the application shall be filed with the 
proposed settlement.


<R05>
Sec. 1016.307  Further proceedings.

    (a) Ordinarily, the determination of an award will be made on the 
basis of the written record. However, on request of either the applicant 
or agency counsel or on his or her own initiative, the adjudicative 
officer may order further proceedings when necessary.
    (b) A request that the adjudicative officer order further 
proceedings under this section shall specifically identify the 
information sought or the disputed issues and shall explain why the 
additional proceedings are necessary to resolve the issues.

Sec. 1016.308  Decision.

    The adjudicative officer shall issue a decision on the application 
within 50 days after completion of proceedings on the application. The 
decision shall include written findings and conclusions on the 
applicant's eligibility and status as a prevailing party, and an 
explanation of the reasons for any difference between the amount 
requested and the amount awarded. The decision shall also include, if at 
issue, findings on whether the Commission's or other agency's position 
was substantially justified, whether the applicant unduly protracted the 
proceedings, or whether special circumstances make an award unjust. If 
the applicant has sought an award against more than one agency, the 
decision shall allocate responsibility for payment of any award made 
among the agencies, and shall explain the reasons for the allocation 
made.

<R05>
Sec. 1016.309  Agency review.

    In the event the adjudicative officer is not the entire Commission, 
the applicant or agency counsel may seek review of the initial decision 
on the fee application, or the Commission may review the decision on its 
own initiative, in accordance with Sec. 1115.2. If no

Commission the applicant shall make its submission to the Secretary, 
Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. The Commission 
will pay the amount awarded to the applicant within 60 days of the 
applicant's submission unless the judicial review of the award or of the 
underlying decision of the adversary adjudication has been sought by the 
applicant or any other party to the proceeding.

<R05>
Sec. 1017.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) These regulations set forth guidelines for implementing the Debt 
Collection Act of 1982 at the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). The 
purpose of the Act is to give agencies the ability to more aggressively 
pursue debts owed the Federal Government and to increase the efficiency 
of governmentwide efforts to collect debts owed the United States. The 
authority for these regulations is found in the Debt Collection Act of 
1982 (Pub. L. 97-365 and 4 CFR 101.1 et seq.), Collection by Offset From 
Indebted Government Employees (5 CFR 550.1101 et seq.), Federal Claims 
Collection Standards (4 CFR 101.1 et seq.), and Administrative Offset 
(31 U.S.C. 3716).
    (b) These regulations provide procedures for administrative offset 
of a Federal employee's salary without his/her consent to satisfy 
certain debts owed to the Federal Government. The regulations covered in 
this part apply to all current and former Federal employees who owe 
debts to the Commission and to current Commission employees who owe 
debts to other Federal agencies. The regulations set forth herein do not 
apply when the employee consents to recovery from his/her current pay 
account.
    (c) These regulations do not apply to debts or claims arising under:
    (1) The Social Security Act;
    (2) The Internal Revenue Code of 1954;
    (3) The tariff laws of the United States; or
    (4) Any case where a collection of a debt by salary offset is 
explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute.
    (d) These regulations also do not preclude the compromise, 
suspension, or termination of collection action, where appropriate, 
under the standards implementing the Federal Claims Collection Act (31 
U.S.C. 3711 et seq., 4 CFR 101.1 et seq.). These regulations do not 
preclude an employee's requesting a waiver of a salary overpayment 
(i.e., alleged indebtedness) under 5 U.S.C.

[[Page 65]]

5584, 10 U.S.C. 2774, or 32 U.S.C. 716, or in any way questioning the 
amount or validity of a debt by submitting a claim to the General 
Accounting Office (GAO), or requesting a waiver under statutory 
provisions pertaining to the particular debt.
    (e) The Commission's regulations governing debt collection for 
entities and individuals who are not current or former government 
employees are contained in 49 CFR part 1018.

charges, including a statement that such charges will be assessed unless 
excused in accordance with 4 CFR 101.1 et seq.;

    (5) The opportunity to enter into a written agreement with the 
agency to establish a schedule for the voluntary repayment of the debt;

    (7) The method and time period for petitioning for a hearing;
    (8) A statement that the timely filing of a petition for a hearing 
(on or before the 15th day following receipt of the written notice) will 
stay the commencement of collection proceedings, together with 
instructions on how and where to file a petition;
    (9) A statement that a final decision on the hearing will be issued 
not later than 60 days after the filing of the petition requesting the 
hearing unless the former employee requests, and the

[[Page 67]]

hearing official grants, a delay in the proceedings;
    (10) A statement that knowingly false or frivolous statements, 
representations, or evidence may subject the former employee to 
appropriate criminal penalties (i.e., for false certification, etc.);
    (11) A statement of other rights and remedies available to the 
former employee under statutes or regulations governing the program for 
which the collection is being made; and

Sec. 1017.5  Hearing procedures.

    (a) Upon the Administrative Law Judge's determination of an 
employee's compliance with Sec. 1017.4(b)(8) or Sec. 1017.4(c)(7) of 
this part, whichever is applicable, he/she shall set the time, date, and 
location for the hearing, paying due consideration to convenience to the 
employee.
    (b) All significant matters discussed at the hearing shall be 
documented, although a verbatim transcript of the hearing shall not be 
made.
    (c) The Administrative Law Judge may exclude any evidence he/she 
deems irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious.
    (d) Any party to a hearing under these regulations is entitled to 
present his or her case or defense by oral or documentary evidence, and 
to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true 
disclosure of the facts.
    (e) The Commission has the initial burden of proof as to the 
existence and amount of the debt.
    (f) The employee requesting the hearing shall bear the ultimate 
burden of proof.
    (g) The evidence presented by the employee must prove that no debt 
exists or cast sufficient doubt that reasonable minds could differ as to 
the existence or amount of the debt.
    (h) Where the employee files a petition for a hearing contesting the 
offset schedule imposed by the Commission, the Administrative Law Judge 
shall take into consideration all relevant factors as to the employee's 
financial situation in determining whether said offset schedule should 
be altered.
    (i) Any party to a hearing under these regulations is entitled to be 
accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel, as well as to appear 
in person or by or with counsel.
    (j) The Administrative Law Judge shall issue a final written 
decision at the earliest practicable date, but not later than 60 days 
after the filing of the petition requesting the hearing, as stated in 
Sec. 1017.4(b)(10) or Sec. 1017.4(c)(9) of this part, whichever is 
applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 1017.6  Result if employee fails to meet deadlines.

    An employee will not be granted a hearing and will have his/her 
disposable pay offset in accordance with the Commission's offset 
schedule if the employee:
    (a) Fails to file a petition for a hearing in conformity with the 
requirements of Sec. 1017.4(b)(8) or Sec. 1017.4(c)(9) of this part, 
whichever is applicable. However, failure to file within the requisite 
time period set out in Sec. 1017.4(b)(8) or Sec. 1017.4(c)(9) of this 
part whichever is applicable, will not result in denial of a hearing or 
in immediate offset, if the Administrative Law Judge excuses the late 
filing if the employee can show that the delay was because of 
circumstances beyond his/her control or because of failure to receive 
notice of the filing deadline.
    (b) Is scheduled to appear and fails to appear at the hearing 
without good cause.


<R05>
Sec. 1017.7  Written decision following hearing.

    (a) Written decisions provided after a request for a hearing will 
include:
    (1) A statement of the facts presented to support the nature and 
origin of the alleged debt;
    (2) The Administrative Law Judge's analysis, findings, and 
conclusions, in light of the hearing, concerning the employee's or the 
Commission's grounds;
    (3) The amount and validity of the alleged debt; and

[[Page 68]]

    (4) The repayment schedule (including percentage), if applicable.
    (b) The Administrative Law Judge's decision does not preclude an 
employee from requesting a waiver of a salary payment under 5 U.S.C. 
5584, 10 U.S.C. 2774, or 32 U.S.C. 716, or in any way questioning the 
amount or validity of a debt by submitting a subsequent claim to GAO in 
accordance with procedures prescribed by GAO.


<R05>
Sec. 1017.8  Exception to entitlement to notice, hearing, written responses and final decisions.

    The Commission shall except from the provisions of Sec. 1017.4 
through Sec. 1017.7 any adjustment to pay arising out of an employee's 
election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits 
program, requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the amount to be 
recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less.


<R05>
Sec. 1017.9  Coordinating offset with another Federal agency.

    (a) The Commission as creditor agency. When the Chief, Budget and 
Fiscal Office, determines that an employee of another Federal agency 
owes a delinquent debt to the Commission, he/she shall:
    (1) Arrange for a hearing upon proper petitioning by the employee;
    (2) Certify in writing to the other Federal agency that the employee 
owes the debt, the amount and basis of the debt, the date on which 
payment is due, the date the Government's right to collect the debt 
accrued, that the Commission's regulations for administrative offset 
have been approved by the Office of Personnel Management, and that the 
provisions of 4 CFR 102.3(f) have been fully complied with;
    (3) If collection must be made in installments, advise the paying 
agency of the amount or percentage of disposable pay to be collected in 
each installment;
    (4) Advise the paying agency of any action taken under 5 U.S.C. 
5514(a);
    (5) If the employee is in the process of separating, the Commission 
must submit its debt claim to the paying agency as provided in this 
part. The paying agency must certify any amounts already collected, 
notify the employee, and send a copy of the certification and notice of 
the employee's separation to the creditor agency--if the paying agency 
is aware that the employee is entitled to money from the Civil Service 
Retirement and Disability Fund, it must certify to the Office of 
Personnel Management (OPM) that:
    (i) The debtor owes the U.S. a debt, including the amount of that 
debt;
    (ii) The Commission has complied with the applicable statutes, 
regulations, and procedures of OPM; and
    (iii) The Commission has complied with the requirements of 4 CFR 
102.3, including any hearing or review; and
    (6) If the employee has already separated and all payments due from 
the paying agency have been paid, the Chief, Budget and Fiscal Office, 
may request from OPM, unless otherwise prohibited, that money payable to 
the employee from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or 
other similar funds be collected by administrative offset and provide 
the certification described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
    (b) The Commission as paying agency. (1) Upon receipt of a properly 
certified debt claim from another agency, deductions will be scheduled 
to begin at the next established pay interval. The employee must receive 
written notice that the Commission has received a certified debt claim 
from the creditor agency, the amount of the debt, the date 
administrative offset will begin, and the amount of the deduction(s). 
The Commission shall not review the merits of the creditor agency's 
determination of the validity or the amount of the certified claim.
    (2) When the Commission receives an incomplete debt from another 
(creditor) agency, the Commission must return the debt claim with a 
notice that procedures under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR 1108 must be 
provided and a properly certified debt claim received before action will 
be taken to collect from the employee's current pay account.
    (3) If the employee transfers to another agency after the creditor 
agency has submitted its debt claim to the Commission and before the 
debt is fully collected, the Commission must certify the total amount 
collected to the creditor agency, along with notice of the

[[Page 69]]

transfer, and furnish a copy of same to the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 1017.10  Procedures for administrative offset.

    (a) Debts will be collected in one lump sum where possible. If the 
employee is financially unable to pay in one lump sum, collection shall 
be made in installments.
    (b) Debts shall be collected by deduction at officially established 
pay intervals from an employee's current pay account, unless alternative 
arrangements for repayment are made.
    (c) Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater 
than the anticipated period of employment. The size of installment 
deductions must bear a reasonable relationship to the size of the debt 
and the employee's ability to pay. The deduction for the pay intervals 
for any period shall not exceed 15 percent of disposable pay, unless the 
employee has agreed in writing to a deduction of a greater amount.
    (d) Unliquidated debts may be offset against any financial payment 
due to a separated employee (including, but not limited to, final salary 
payment or lump-sum payment for leave).


<R05>
Sec. 1017.11  Refunds.

    (a) The Commission shall promptly refund any amounts deducted to 
satisfy debts owed to it when the debt is waived, found not owed to the 
Commission, or when directed by an administrative or judicial order.
    (b) A creditor agency will promptly return any amounts deducted by 
the Commission to satisfy debts owed to a creditor agency when the debt 
is waived, found not owed, or when directed by an administrative or 
judicial order.
    (c) Unless required by law, refunds under this subsection shall not 
bear interest.


<R05>
Sec. 1017.12  Statute of limitations.

    If a debt has been outstanding for more than 10 years after the 
agency's right to collect the debt first accrued, the agency may not 
collect by salary offset unless facts material to the Government's right 
to collect were not known and could not reasonably have been known by 
the official or officials who were charged with the responsibility for 
discovery and collection of such debts.


<R05>
Sec. 1017.13  Nonwaiver of rights.

    An employee's involuntary payment of all or any part of a debt 
collected under these regulations will not be construed as a waiver of 
any rights that employee may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514 or any other 
provision of law.


<R05>
Sec. 1017.14  Interest, penalties, and administrative costs.

    (a) The rate of interest assessed shall be the rate of the current 
value of funds to the U.S. Treasury (i.e., the Treasury tax and loan 
account rate), as prescribed and published by the Secretary of the 
Treasury in the Federal Register and the Treasury Financial Manual 
Bulletins. A higher rate of interest can be assessed if the Commission 
can reasonably determine that a higher rate is necessary to protect the 
interests of the United States. The rate of interest, as initially 
assessed, shall remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness, 
except where a debtor has defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks 
to enter into a new agreement. The Commission may set a new interest 
rate which reflects the current value of funds to the Treasury at the 
time the new agreement is executed. The Commission shall waive the 
collection of interest on the debt or any portion of the debt which is 
paid within 30 days after the date on which interest began to accrue.
    (b) The Commission shall assess a penalty charge not to exceed 6 
percent a year on any portion of a debt that is delinquent as defined in 
4 CFR 101.2(b) for more than 90 days. This charge need not be calculated 
until the 91st day of delinquency, but shall accrue from the date that 
the debt became delinquent.
    (c) The Commission shall assess against a debtor charges to cover 
administrative costs incurred as a result of a delinquent debt--that is, 
the additional costs incurred in processing and handling the debt 
because it became delinquent as defined in 4 CFR 101.2(b).
    (d) When a debt is paid in partial or installment payments, amounts 
received by the agency shall be applied

[[Page 70]]

first to outstanding penalty and administrative cost charges, second to 
accrued interest, and third to outstanding principal.

<R04>
                   Subpart A--Application and Coverage


<R05>
Sec. 1018.1  Application.

    (a) This part applies to claims for the payment of debts owed to the 
United States Government in the form of money or property and unless a 
different procedure is specified in a statute, regulation, or a 
contractual agreement with the Commission, prescribes procedures by 
which the Commission:
    (1) Collects, compromises, suspends, and terminates collection 
actions for claims;
    (2) Determines and collects interest and other charges on these 
claims; and
    (3) Refers unpaid claims to the General Accounting Office (GAO) and 
the Department of Justice (DOJ) for litigation.
    (b) The following are examples of the kinds of debts to which 
special statutory and administrative procedures apply:
    (1) A claim against an employee for erroneous payment of pay and 
allowances subject to waiver under 5 U.S.C. 5584 and other claims 
against employees which are handled under 49 CFR part 1017.
    (2) A claim involving the payment of civil penalties or forfeitures 
which may

[[Page 71]]

arise under provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act or legislation 
supplemental thereto. Those claims are handled under procedures set 
forth in 49 CFR part 1021.
    (3) A claim involved in a case pending before any Federal Contract 
Appeals Board or Grant Appeals Board. However, nothing in this part 
prevents negotiation and settlement of a claim pending before a Board.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.2  Definitions.

    (a) Administrative offset means withholding money payable by the 
United States to, or held by the Government for, a person to satisfy a 
debt the person owes the Government.
    (b) Claim and debt are used synonymously and interchangeably for 
purposes of this part. These terms refer to an amount of money or 
property which has been determined by an appropriate agency official to 
be owed to the United States by any person, organization, or entity 
except another Federal agency.
    (c) Delinquent. A debt is considered delinquent if it has not been 
paid by the date specified in the initial written demand for payment or 
applicable contractual agreement with the Commission, unless other 
satisfactory payment arrangements have been made by that date. If the 
debtor fails to satisfy an obligation under a payment agreement with the 
Commission after other payment arrangements have been made, the debt 
becomes a delinquent debt.
    (d) Payment in full means payment of the total debt due the United 
States, including any interest, penalty, and administrative costs of 
collection assessed against the debtor.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.3  Communications.

    Unless otherwise specified, all communications concerning the 
regulations in this part should be addressed to Chief, Budget and Fiscal 
Office, Interstate Commerce Commission, room 1330, Washington, DC 20423.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.4  Claims that are covered.

    (a) These procedures generally apply to any claim for payment of a 
debt which:
    (1) Results from activities of the Commission including fees imposed 
under 49 CFR part 1002; or
    (2) Is referred to the Commission for collection.
    (b) These procedures do not apply to:
    (1) A claim based on a civil monetary penalty for violation of a 
requirement of the Interstate Commerce Act or an order or regulation of 
the Commission unless 49 CFR part 1021 provides otherwise;
    (2) A claim as to which there is an indication of fraud, the 
presentation of a false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of the 
debtor, or any other party having an interest in the claim;
    (3) A claim between Federal agencies; and
    (4) A claim once it becomes subject to salary offset which is 
governed by 5 U.S.C. 5514.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.5  Monetary limitation on Commission authority.

    The Commission's authority to compromise a claim or to terminate or 
suspend collection action on a claim covered by these procedures is 
limited by 31 U.S.C. 3711(a) to claims that:
    (a) Have not been referred to another Federal agency, including the 
GAO, for further collection action; and
    (b) Do not exceed $100,000, exclusive of interest, penalties, and 
administrative costs (the monetary limitation).


<R05>
Sec. 1018.6  Omissions not a defense.

    (a) The failure of the Commission to include in this part any 
provision of the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 4 CFR parts 101 
through 105, does not prevent the Commission from applying these 
provisions.
    (b) A debtor may not use the failure of the Commission to comply 
with any provision of this part or the Federal Claims Collection 
Standards as a defense to the debt.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.7  Conversion claims.

    These procedures are directed primarily to the recovery of money on 
behalf of the Government. The Commission may demand:
    (a) The return of specific property; or
    (b) Either the return of property or the payment of its value.

[[Page 72]]


<R05>
Sec. 1018.8  Subdivision of claims.

    The Commission shall consider a debtor's liability arising from a 
particular transaction or contract as a single claim in determining 
whether the claim is less than the monetary limitation for the purpose 
of compromising or suspending or terminating collection action. A claim 
may not be subdivided to avoid the monetary limitation established by 31 
U.S.C. 3711(a)(2) and Sec. 1018.5 of this part.


<R04>
             Subpart B--Administrative Collection of Claims


<R05>
Sec. 1018.20  Written demand for payment.

    (a) The Commission shall make appropriate written demand upon the 
debtor for payment of money in terms which specify:
    (1) The basis for the indebtedness and the right of the debtor to 
request review within the Commission;
    (2) The amount claimed;
    (3) The date by which payment is to be made, which normally should 
not be more than 30 days from the date that the initial demand letter 
statement was mailed, unless otherwise specified by contractual 
agreement, established by Federal statute or regulation, or agreed to 
under a payment agreement;
    (4) The applicable standards for assessing interest, penalties, and 
administrative costs (4 CFR 102.13 and 49 CFR 1018.30); and
    (5) The applicable policy for reporting the delinquent debt to 
consumer reporting agencies.
    (b) The Commission normally shall send three progressively stronger 
written demands at not more than 30-day intervals, unless circumstances 
indicate that alternative remedies better protect the Government's 
interest, that the debtor has explicitly refused to pay, or that sending 
a further demand is futile. Depending upon the circumstances of the 
particular case, the second and third demands may:
    (1) Offer or seek to confer with the debtor;
    (2) State the amount of the interest and penalties that will be 
added on a daily basis, as well as the administrative costs that will be 
added to the debt until the debt is paid; and
    (3) State that the authorized collection procedures include any 
procedure authorized in this part including:
    (i) Contacts with the debtor's employer when the debtor is employed 
by the Federal Government or is a member of the military establishment 
or the Coast Guard;
    (ii) Possible referral of the debt to a private agency for 
collection;
    (iii) Possible reporting of the delinquent debt to consumer 
reporting agencies in accordance with the guidelines and standards 
contained in 4 CFR 102.5 and the Commission's procedures set forth in 
Sec. 1018.23 of this part;
    (iv) The suspension or revocation of a license or other remedy under 
Sec. 1018.25 of this part;
    (v) Installment payments possibly requiring security; and
    (vi) The right to refer claims to GAO or DOJ for litigation.
    (c) The failure to state in a letter of demand a matter described in 
Sec. 1018.20 is not a defense for a debtor and does not prevent the 
Commission from proceeding with respect to that matter.

[58 FR 7749, Feb. 9, 1993; 58 FR 11099, Feb. 23, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 1018.21  Telephone inquiries and investigations.

    (a) If a debtor has not responded to one or more written demands, 
the Commission shall make reasonable efforts by telephone to determine 
the debtor's intentions. If the debtor cannot be reached by telephone at 
the debtor's place of employment, the Commission may telephone the 
debtor at his or her residence between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m.
    (b) The Commission may undertake an investigation to locate a 
debtor, if the whereabouts of a debtor is a problem, or if a debtor 
cannot be contacted by telephone. The Commission may also send a 
representative to a debtor's place of employment if the debtor cannot be 
contacted by phone or the debtor does not respond to written demands by 
the Commission for payment of claims.
    (c) The Commission under 15 U.S.C. 1681(f) may obtain consumer 
credit information from private firms, including name, address, former 
address, place of employment, and former place of employment of a 
debtor.

[[Page 73]]


<R05>
Sec. 1018.22  Personal interviews.

    (a) The Commission may seek an interview with the debtor at the 
offices of the Commission when:
    (1) A matter involved in the claim needs clarification;
    (2) Information is needed concerning the debtor's circumstances; or
    (3) An agreement of payment might be negotiated.
    (b) The Commission shall grant an interview with a debtor upon the 
debtor's request. The Commission will not reimburse a debtor's interview 
expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.23  Use of consumer reporting agencies.

    (a) In addition to assessing interest, penalties, and administrative 
costs under Sec. 1018.30 of this part, the Commission may report a debt 
that has been delinquent for 90 days to a consumer reporting agency, if 
all the conditions of this paragraph are met.
    (1) The debtor has not:
    (i) Paid or agreed to pay the debt under a written payment plan that 
has been signed by the debtor and agreed to by the Commission; or
    (ii) Filed for review of the debt under Sec. 1018.23(a)(2)(iv) of 
this section.
    (2) The Commission has included a notification in the third written 
demand (see Sec. 1018.20(b)) to the debtor stating:
    (i) That the account has been reviewed and payment of the debt is 
delinquent;
    (ii) That, within not less than 60 days after the date of 
notification, the Commission intends to disclose to a consumer reporting 
agency that the individual is responsible for the debt;
    (iii) The specific information to be disclosed to the consumer 
reporting agency; and
    (iv) That the debtor has the right to a complete explanation of the 
debt (if that has not already been given), to dispute information on 
Commission records about the debt, and to request reconsideration of the 
debt by administrative appeal or review of the debt.
    (3) The Commission has sent at least one written demand by either 
registered or certified mail with the notification described in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (4) The Commission has reconsidered its initial decision on the debt 
when the debtor has requested a review under Sec. 1018.23(a)(2)(iv).
    (5) The Commission has taken reasonable action to locate a debtor 
for whom the Commission does not have a current address to send the 
notifications provided for in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (b) If there is a substantial change in the condition or amount of 
the debt, the Commission shall:
    (1) Promptly disclose that fact(s) to each consumer reporting agency 
to which the original disclosure was made;
    (2) Promptly verify or correct information about the debt, on 
request of a consumer reporting agency for verification of any or all 
information so disclosed by the Commission; and
    (3) Obtain satisfactory assurances from each consumer reporting 
agency that they are complying with all applicable Federal, state, and 
local laws relating to its use of consumer credit information.
    (c) The information the Commission discloses to the consumer 
reporting agency is limited to:
    (1) Information necessary to establish the identity of the 
individual debtor, including name, address, and taxpayer identification 
number;
    (2) The amount, status, and history of the debt; and
    (3) The Commission activity under which the claim arose.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.24  Contact with the debtor's employing agency.

    If a debtor is employed by the Federal government or is a member of 
the military establishment or the Coast Guard, and collection by offset 
cannot be accomplished in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5514, the Commission 
shall contact the employing agency to arrange with the debtor for 
payment of the indebtedness by allotment or otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.25  Sanctions.

    (a) Closure of accounts. If a tariff filing fee or insurance filing 
fee account is past due more than 90 days, the Commission will freeze 
the account until the account is made current. The Commission will 
notify the account holder

[[Page 74]]

that the account has been frozen and that until the account balance 
including any applicable interest, penalties, and administrative costs 
are paid, all future filings, must be accompanied by a certified or 
cashier's check or a money order. The Commission reserves the right to 
refuse to maintain an account which is repeatedly delinquent.
    (b) Suspension or revocation of tariff or insurance filing 
privileges. If the account holder fails to satisfy all claims for tariff 
or insurance filing fees including applicable interest, penalties, and 
the administrative costs of collection of the debt, the Commission may 
suspend or prohibit a tariff or insurance filing fee account holder from 
submitting tariff or insurance filings in its own name or on behalf of 
others.
    (c) Suspension or revocation of certificates, licenses, or permits 
granted by the Commission. The Commission may suspend or revoke any 
certificates, permits, or licenses which the Commission has granted to 
an account holder or other debtor for any inexcusable, prolonged, or 
repeated failure or refusal to pay a delinquent debt.
    (d) Procedures for suspension or revocation of filing privileges or 
certificates, licenses, or permits for failure to pay tariff or 
insurance filing fees. Before suspending or revoking an account holder's 
privilege to submit tariff or insurance filings or suspending or 
revoking any certificate, license, or permit which the Commission has 
granted to any account holder, the Commission shall issue to the account 
holder an order to show cause why the tariff or insurance filing 
privilege or any certificate, license, or permit should not be suspended 
or revoked. The Commission shall allow the debtor no more than 30 days 
to pay the debt in full including applicable interest, penalties, and 
administrative costs of collection of the delinquent debt. The 
Commission may suspend or revoke any certificate, license, permit, 
approval or filing privilege at the end of this period upon a finding of 
willful noncompliance with the Commission's order. If any certificate, 
license, permit, or filing privilege is revoked under this authority of 
this part, a new application with appropriate fees must be made to the 
Commission, and all previous delinquent debts of the debtor to the 
Commission must be paid before the Commission will consider such 
application.
    (e) Other sanctions. The remedies and sanctions available to the 
Commission in this area are not exclusive. The Commission may impose 
other sanctions, where permitted by law for any inexcusable, prolonged, 
or repeated failure of a debtor to pay such claim. In such cases, the 
Commission will provide notice and a hearing, as required by law, to the 
debtor prior to the imposition of any such sanctions.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.26  Disputed debts.

    (a) A debtor who disputes a debt shall explain why the debt is 
incorrect in fact or law within 30 days from the date that the initial 
demand letter was mailed. The debtor may support the explanation by 
submitting affidavits, statements certified under penalty of perjury, 
canceled checks, or other relevant evidence.
    (b) The Commission may extend the interest waiver period as 
described in Sec. 1018.30(j) pending a final determination of the 
existence or amount of the debt.
    (c) The Commission may investigate the facts involved in the dispute 
and if necessary, the Commission may arrange for a conference at which 
the debtor may present evidence and arguments in support of the debtor's 
positions.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.27  Contracting for collection services.

    The Commission may contract for collection services in order to 
recover delinquent debts. However, the Commission retains the authority 
to resolve disputes, compromise claims, suspend or terminate collection 
action, and initiate enforced collection through litigation. When 
appropriate, the Commission shall contract in accordance with 4 CFR 
102.6.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.28  Collection by administrative offset.

    (a) The Commission may administratively undertake collection by 
offset on each claim which is liquidated or certain in amount in 
accordance with the guidelines and the standards contained in 4 CFR 
102.2, 102.3, and 102.4

[[Page 75]]

and 5 U.S.C. 5514, as applicable. The Commission may not initiate 
administrative offset to collect a debt more than 10 years after the 
Government's right to the debt first accrued, unless facts material to 
the Government's right to collect the debt were not known and could not 
reasonably have been known to the Commission.
    (b) Collection by administrative offset of amounts payable from the 
Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, the Federal Employees 
Retirement System, or other similar fund is made pursuant to 4 CFR 102.4 
and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section.
    (c) Salary offset is governed by 5 U.S.C. 5514.
    (d) The following procedures apply when the Commission seeks to 
collect a debt by offset against any payment to be made to a debtor or 
against the assets of a holder of a certificate, permit, license, or 
authorization issued by the Commission.
    (1) Before the offset is made, the Commission shall provide the 
debtor written notice of the nature and amount of the debt and:
    (i) Notice of the Commission's intent to collect the debt by offset;
    (ii) An opportunity to inspect and copy Commission records 
pertaining to the debt;
    (iii) An opportunity to request reconsideration of the debt by the 
Commission, or if provided for by statute, waiver of the debt;
    (iv) An opportunity to enter into a written agreement with the 
Commission to repay or pay the debt, as the case may be;
    (v) An explanation of the debtor's rights under this subpart; and
    (vi) An opportunity for a hearing when required under the provisions 
of 4 CFR 102.3(c).
    (2) If the Commission learns that other agencies of the Government 
are holding funds payable to the debtor, the Commission shall provide 
the other agencies with written certification that the debt is owed to 
the Commission and that the Commission has complied with the provisions 
of 4 CFR 102.3. The Commission shall request that funds which are due 
the debtor and which are necessary to offset the debt to the Commission 
be transferred to the Commission.
    (3) The Commission may accept a repayment or payment agreement, as 
appropriate, in lieu of offset, but will do so only after balancing the 
Government's interest in collecting the debts against fairness to the 
debtor. If the debt is delinquent and the debtor has not disputed its 
existence or amount, the Commission may accept a repayment or payment 
agreement in lieu of offset only if the debtor is able to establish 
under sworn affidavit or statement certified under penalty of perjury 
that offset would result in financial hardship or would result in undue 
financial hardship or would be against equity and good conscience.
    (4) Administrative offset is not authorized with respect to:
    (i) Debts owed by any State or local government;
    (ii) Debts once they become subject to the salary offset provisions 
of 5 U.S.C. 5514; or
    (iii) Any case in which collection of the type of debt involved by 
administrative offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by 
another statute.
    (5) The Commission reserves the right to take any other action in 
respect to offset as is permitted under 4 CFR 102.3.
    (e) The Commission shall make appropriate use of the cooperative 
efforts of other agencies including the Army Holdup List in effecting 
collections by offset. The Army Holdup List is a list of contractors 
indebted to the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.29  Payments.

    (a) Payment in full. The Commission shall make every effort to 
collect a claim in full before it becomes delinquent. The Commission 
shall impose charges for interest, penalties, and administrative costs 
as specified in Sec. 1018.30.
    (b) Payment in installments. If a debtor furnishes satisfactory 
evidence of inability to pay a claim in one lump sum, payment in regular 
installments may be arranged. Evidence may consist of a financial 
statement or a signed statement certified under penalty of perjury to be 
true and correct that application for a loan to enable the debtor to pay

[[Page 76]]

the claim in full was rejected. Except for a claim described at 5 U.S.C. 
5514, all installment payment arrangements must be in writing and 
require the payment of interest and administrative charges.
    (1) Installment note forms including confess-judgement notes may be 
used. The written installment agreement must contain a provision 
accelerating the debt payment in the event the debtor defaults. If the 
debtor's financial statement discloses the ownership of assets which are 
free and clear of liens or security interests, or assets in which the 
debtor owns equity, the debtor may be asked to secure the payment of an 
installment note by executing a Security Agreement and Financial 
Statement transferring to the United States a security interest in the 
assets until the debt is discharged.
    (2) If the debtor owes more than one debt and designates how a 
voluntary installment payment is to be applied among those debts, the 
Commission shall follow that designation. If the debtor does not 
designate the application of the payment, the Commission shall apply the 
payment to the various debts in accordance with the best interest of the 
United States as determined by the facts and circumstances of the 
particular case.
    (c) To whom payment is made. Payment of a debt is made by check, 
money order, or credit card (VISA or MASTERCARD) payable to the 
Interstate Commerce Commission and mailed or delivered to the Budget and 
Fiscal Office, room 1330, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 
20423, unless payment is:
    (1) Made pursuant to arrangements with the GAO or DOJ;
    (2) Ordered by a Court of the United States; or
    (3) Otherwise directed in any other part of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.30  Interest, penalties, and administrative costs.

    (a) The Commission shall assess interest, penalties, and 
administrative costs on debts owed to the United States Government in 
accordance with the guidance provided under the Federal Claims 
Collection Standards, 4 CFR 102.13 unless otherwise directed by statute, 
regulation, or contract.
    (b) Before assessing any charges on delinquent debts, the Commission 
shall mail a written notice to debtor explaining its requirements 
concerning these charges under 4 CFR 102.2 and 102.13.
    (c) Interest begins to accrue from the date on which the initial 
invoice is first mailed to the debtor unless a different date is 
specified on a statute, regulation, or contract.
    (d) The Commission shall assess interest based upon the rate of the 
current value of funds to the United States Treasury (the Treasury tax 
and loan account rate) prescribed by statute, regulation, or contract.
    (e) Interest is computed only on the principal of the debt, and the 
interest rate remains fixed for the duration of the indebtedness, unless 
the debtor defaults on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a 
new agreement.
    (f) The Commission shall assess against a debtor charges to cover 
administrative costs incurred as a result of a delinquent debt. 
Administrative costs may include costs incurred in obtaining a credit 
report or in using a private debt collector, to the extent they are 
attributable to the delinquency.
    (g) The Commission shall assess a penalty charge of six percent a 
year on any portion of a debt that is delinquent for more than 90 days. 
The charge accrues retroactively to the date that the debt became 
delinquent.
    (h) Amounts received by the Commission as partial or installment 
payments are applied first to outstanding penalty and administrative 
cost charges, second to accrued interest, and third to outstanding 
principal.
    (i) The Commission shall waive collection of interest on the debt or 
any portion of the debt which is paid in full within 30 days after the 
date on which interest began to accrue.
    (j) The Commission may waive interest during the periods a debt 
disputed under Sec. 1018.26 is under investigation or review before the 
Commission. This additional waiver is not automatic and must be 
requested before the expiration of the initial 30-day waiver period.

[[Page 77]]

The Commission may grant the additional waiver only when it finds merit 
in the explanation the debtor has submitted under Sec. 1018.26.
    (k) The Commission may waive the collection of interest, penalties, 
and administrative costs if it finds that one or more of the following 
conditions exists:
    (1) The debtor is unable to pay any significant sum toward the debt 
within a reasonable time;
    (2) Collection of interest, penalties, and administrative costs will 
jeopardize collection of the principal of the debt;
    (3) The Commission is unable to enforce collection in full within a 
reasonable time by enforced collection proceedings; or
    (4) Collection would be against equity and good conscience or not in 
the best interest of the United States, including the situation in which 
an administrative offset or installment payment agreement is in effect.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.31  Use of credit reports.

    The Commission may institute a credit investigation of the debtor at 
any time following receipt of knowledge of the debt in order to aid the 
Commission in making appropriate determinations as to:
    (a) The collection and compromise of a debt;
    (b) The collection of interest, penalties, and administrative costs;
    (c) The use of administrative offset;
    (d) The use of other collection methods; and
    (e) The likelihood of collecting the debt.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.32  Bankruptcy claims.

    When the Commission receives information that a debtor has filed a 
petition in bankruptcy or is the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, it 
shall suspend all collection actions against the debtor in accordance 
with 11 U.S.C. 362 and shall furnish information concerning the debt 
owed the United States to the Department of Justice's Nationwide Central 
Intake Facility to permit the filing of a claim.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.33  Use and disclosure of mailing addresses.

    (a) When attempting to locate a debtor in order to collect or 
compromise a debt under this part, the Commission may send a written 
request to the Secretary of the Treasury (or designee) in order to 
obtain a debtor's mailing address from the records of the Internal 
Revenue Service.
    (b) The Commission may disclose a mailing address obtained under 
paragraph (a) of this section to other agents, including collection 
service contractors, in order to facilitate the collection or compromise 
of debts under this part, except that a mailing address may be disclosed 
to a consumer reporting agency only for the limited purpose of obtaining 
a commercial credit report on the particular taxpayer.
    (c) The Commission and its agents, including consumer reporting 
agencies and collection services, must comply with the provisions of 26 
U.S.C. 6103(p)(4) and applicable regulations of the Internal Revenue 
Service.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.34  Additional administrative collection action.

    Nothing contained in this part is intended to preclude any other 
administrative remedy which may be available.


<R04>
                    Subpart C--Compromise of a Claim


<R05>
Sec. 1018.50  When a claim may be compromised.

    The Commission may compromise a claim not in excess of the monetary 
limitation if it has not been referred to GAO or DOJ for litigation. 
Only the Comptroller General of the United States or designee may effect 
the compromise of a claim that arises out of the exceptions made by the 
GAO in that account of an accountable officer, including a claim against 
the payee, prior to its referral by GAO for litigation.

[58 FR 7749, Feb. 9, 1993; 58 FR 11099, Feb. 23, 1993]

[[Page 78]]


<R05>
Sec. 1018.51  Reasons for compromising a claim.

    (a) A claim may be compromised for one or more reasons set forth 
below:
    (1) The full amount cannot be collected because:
    (i) The debtor is unable to pay the full amount within a reasonable 
time; or
    (ii) The debtor refuses to pay the claim in full, and the Government 
is unable to enforce collection in full within a reasonable time; or
    (2) There is a real doubt concerning the Government's ability to 
prove its case in Court for the full amount claimed, either because of 
the legal issues involved or a bona fide dispute as to the facts; or
    (3) The costs of collecting the claim do not justify the enforced 
collection of the full amount. The Commission shall apply this reason 
for compromise in accordance with the guidelines in 4 CFR 103.4.
    (b) The Commission shall determine the debtor's inability to pay, 
the Government's ability to enforce collection, and the amounts which 
are acceptable in compromise in accordance with the Federal Claims 
Collection Standards, 4 CFR part 103.
    (c) Compromises payable in installments are discouraged, but, if 
necessary, must be in the form of a legally enforceable agreement for 
the reinstatement of the prior indebtedness less sums paid thereon. The 
agreement also must provide that in the event of default:
    (1) The entire balance of the debt becomes immediately due and 
payable; and
    (2) The Government has the right to enforce any security agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.52  Restrictions on the compromise of a claim.

    (a) The Commission may not accept a percentage of a debtor's profits 
or stock in a debtor's corporation in compromise of a claim. In 
negotiating a compromise with a business concern, consideration is given 
to requiring a waiver of the tax-loss-carry-forward and tax-loss-carry-
back rights of the debtor.
    (b) If two or more debtors are jointly or severally liable, 
collection action is not withheld against one debtor until the other or 
others pay their share. The amount of a compromise with one debtor is 
not considered a precedent or binding in determining the amount which 
will be required from other debtors jointly and severally liable on the 
claim.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.53  Finality of a compromise.

    An offer of compromise must be in writing and signed by the debtor. 
An offer of compromise which is accepted by the Commission is final and 
conclusive on the debtor and on all officials, agencies and courts of 
the United States, unless obtained by fraud, misrepresentation, the 
presentation of a false claim, or mutual mistake of fact.


<R04>
        Subpart D--Suspension or Termination of Collection Action


<R05>
Sec. 1018.60  When collection action may be suspended or terminated.

    The Commission may suspend or terminate collection action on a claim 
not in excess of the monetary limitation, exclusive of interest, 
penalties, and administrative costs, after deducting the amount of 
partial payments, if any, if it has not been referred to GAO or DOJ for 
litigation.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.61  Reasons for suspending collection action.

    Collection action may be suspended temporarily:
    (a) When the debtor cannot be located after diligent efforts, and 
there is reason to believe that future collection action may be 
sufficiently productive to justify periodic review and action on the 
claim considering the size of the claim and the amount which may be 
realized on it; or
    (b) When the debtor owns no substantial equity in realty and is 
unable to make payments on the Government's claim or effect a compromise 
on it at the time, but the debtor's future prospects justify retention 
of the claim for periodic review and action:
    (1) The applicable statute of limitations has been tolled or started 
anew; or
    (2) Future collection can be effected by offset notwithstanding the 
statute of limitations.

[[Page 79]]


<R05>
Sec. 1018.62  Reasons for terminating collection action.

    Collection action may be terminated:
    (a) When it becomes clear that the Government cannot collect or 
enforce collection of any significant sum from the debtor having due 
regard for the judicial remedies available to the Government, the 
debtor's future financial prospects, and the exemptions available to the 
debtor under State and Federal law;
    (b) When the debtor cannot be located, there is no security 
remaining to be liquidated, the applicable statute of limitations has 
run, and the prospects of collecting by offset, notwithstanding the bar 
of the statute of limitations, are too remote to justify retention of 
the claim; or
    (c) When it is likely that the cost of the collection action will 
exceed the amount recoverable.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.63  Termination of collection action.

    Collection action shall be terminated:
    (a) Whenever it is determined that the claim is legally without 
merit; or
    (b) When it is determined that the evidence necessary to prove the 
claim cannot be produced, or necessary witnesses are unavailable, and 
efforts to induce voluntary payments have been unavailing.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.64  Transfer of a claim.

    The Commission may refer a claim to GAO when there is doubt as to 
whether or not a collection action should be suspended or terminated.


<R04>
                     Subpart E--Referral of a Claim


<R05>
Sec. 1018.70  Prompt referral.

    (a) A claim which requires enforced collection is referred to GAO or 
DOJ for litigation. A referral is made as early as possible consistent 
with aggressive collection action and, in, any event, well within the 
time required to bring a timely suit against the debtor. Ordinarily, 
referrals are made within 1 year of the Commission's final determination 
of the fact and the amount of the debt.
    (b) When the merits of the Commission's claim, the amount owed on 
the claim, or the propriety of acceptance of a proposed compromise, 
suspension, or termination of collection actions is in doubt, the 
Commission shall refer the matter to GAO for resolution and instruction 
prior to proceeding with collection actions and/or referral to DOJ for 
litigation.
    (c) The Commission may refer a claim to GAO or DOJ even though the 
termination of collection activity might otherwise be given 
consideration under Sec. 1018.63 if:
    (1) A significant enforcement policy is involved in reducing a 
statutory penalty or forfeiture to judgment; or
    (2) Recovery of a judgement is a prerequisite to the imposition of 
administrative sanctions, such as suspension or revocation of a license 
or privilege of participating in a Government sponsored program.
    (d) Once a claim has been referred to GAO or DOJ under this subpart, 
the Commission shall refrain from any contact with the debtor and shall 
direct the debtor to GAO or DOJ as appropriate, when questions 
concerning the claim are raised by the debtor. The Commission shall 
immediately advise GAO or DOJ, as appropriate, of any payments by the 
debtor.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.71  Referral of a compromise offer.

    The Commission may refer a debtor's firm written offer of compromise 
which is substantial in amount to GAO or to DOJ if the Commission is 
uncertain whether the offer should be accepted.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.72  Referral to the Department of Justice.

    (a) Claims for which the gross original amount is over $500,000 must 
be referred to the Commercial Litigation Branch, Civil Division, 
Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530. Claims for which the gross 
original amount is $500,000 or less must be referred to the Department 
of Justice's Nationwide Central Intake Facility.
    (b) A claim of less than $600, exclusive of interest, is not 
referred for litigation unless:
    (1) Referral is important to a significant enforcement policy; or

[[Page 80]]

    (2) The debtor has the clear ability to pay the claim, and the 
government can effectively enforce payment.
    (c) A claim on which the Commission holds a judgment is referred to 
DOJ for further action if renewal of the judgment lien or enforced 
collection proceedings are justified under the criteria discussed in 
this part.
    (d) Claims must be referred to the Department of Justice in the 
manner prescribed by 4 CFR 105.2. Care must be taken to preserve all 
files, records, and exhibits on claims referred under paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of this section.


<R04>
              Subpart F--Internal Revenue Service Procedure


<R05>
Sec. 1018.80  Reporting discharged debts to the Internal Revenue Service.

    When the Commission discharges a debt for less than the full value 
of the indebtedness, it will report the outstanding balance discharged, 
not including interest to the Internal Revenue Service, using IRS Form 
1099-G or any other form prescribed by the IRS, when:
    (a) The principal amount of the debt not in dispute is $600 or more;
    (b) The obligation has not been discharged in a bankruptcy 
proceeding; and
    (c) The obligation is no longer collectible either because the time 
limit in the applicable statute for enforcing collection expired during 
the tax year, or because during the tax year a formal compromise 
agreement was reached in which the debtor was legally discharged of all 
or a portion of the obligation.


<R04>
                      Subpart G--Tax Refund Offset


<R05>
Sec. 1018.90  Purpose.

    This subpart establishes procedures for the Commission to refer 
past-due debts to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the offset 
against the income tax refunds of persons owing debts to the Commission. 
It specifies the Commission's procedures and the rights of the debtor 
applicable to claims for the payment of debts owed to the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.91  Applicability and scope.

    (a) These regulations implement 31 U.S.C. 3720A which authorizes the 
IRS to reduce a tax refund by the amount of a past-due legally 
enforceable debt owed to the Government of the United States.
    (b) For purposes of this section, a past-due legally enforceable 
debt referable to the IRS is a debt which is owed to the Government of 
the United States and:
    (1) Except in the case of a judgment debt, has been delinquent for 
at least 3 months but has not been delinquent for more than 10 years at 
the time the offset is made;
    (2) Cannot be currently collected pursuant to the salary offset 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1);
    (3) Is ineligible for administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) 
by reason of 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(2) or cannot be collected by 
administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) by the Commission against 
amounts payable to or on behalf of the debtor by or on behalf of the 
Commission.
    (4) With respect to which the Commission has given the taxpayer at 
least 60 days from the date of notification to present evidence that all 
or part of the debt is not past-due or legally enforceable, has 
considered evidence presented by such taxpayer, and has determined that 
an amount of such debt is past-due and legally enforceable.
    (5) Has been disclosed by the Commission to a consumer reporting 
agency as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3711(f), unless a consumer reporting 
agency would be prohibited from using such information by 15 U.S.C. 
1681c, or unless the amount of the debt does not exceed $100.00;
    (6) With respect to which the Commission has notified or has made a 
reasonable attempt to notify the taxpayer that the debt is past-due and, 
unless repaid within 60 days thereafter, the debt will be referred to 
the IRS for offset against any overpayment of tax;
    (7) Is at least $25.00;
    (8) All other requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720A and the Department of 
the Treasury regulations codified at 26 CFR 301.6402-6T relating to the 
eligibility of a debt for tax return offset have been satisfied.

[[Page 81]]


<R05>
Sec. 1018.92  Administrative charges.

    In accordance with 49 CFR 1018.30, all administrative charges 
incurred in connection with the referral of the debts to the IRS shall 
be assessed on the debt and thus increase the amount of the offset.

Sec. 1018.93  Notice requirement before offset.

    A request for reduction of an IRS tax refund will be made only after 
the Commission makes a determination that an amount is owed and past-due 
and provides the debtor with 60 days written notice. The Commission's 
notice of intention to collect by IRS tax refund offset (Notice of 
intent) will state:
    (a) The amount of the debt;
    (b) That unless the debt is repaid within 60 days from the date of 
the Commission's Notice of Intent, the Commission intends to collect the 
debt by requesting that the IRS reduce any amount payable to the debtor 
as Federal Income tax refunds an amount equal to amount of the debt 
including all accumulated interest and other charges;
    (c) That the debtor has the right to present evidence that all or 
part of the debt is not past-due or legally enforceable; and
    (d) A mailing address for forwarding any written correspondence and 
a contact name and phone number for any questions.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.94  Review within the Commission.

    (a) Notification by Debtor. A debtor who receives a Notice of Intent 
has the right to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not 
past-due or not legally enforceable. To exercise this right, the debtor 
must:
    (1) Send a written request for a review of the evidence to the 
address provided in the notice.
    (2) State in the request the amount disputed and the reasons why the 
debtor believes that the debt is not past-due or is not legally 
enforceable.
    (3) Include in the request any documents which the debtor wishes to 
be considered or state that additional information will be submitted 
within the 60-day period.
    (b) Submission of evidence. The debtor may submit evidence showing 
that all or part of the debt is not past-due or not legally enforceable 
along with the notification required by paragraph (a) of this section. 
Failure to submit the notification and evidence within 60 days will 
result in an automatic referral of the debt to the IRS without further 
action by the Commission.
    (c) Review of the evidence. The Commission will consider all 
available evidence related to the debt. Within 30 days, if feasible, the 
Commission will notify the debtor whether the Commission has sustained, 
amended, or canceled its determination that the debt is past-due and 
legally enforceable.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.95  Commission determination.

    (a) Following review of the evidence, the Commission will issue a 
written decision which will include the supporting rationale for the 
decision.
    (b) If the Commission either sustains or amends its determination, 
it shall notify the debtor of its intent to refer the debt to the IRS 
for offset against the debtor's Federal income tax refund. If the 
Commission cancels its original determination, the debt will not be 
referred to IRS.


<R05>
Sec. 1018.96    Stay of offset.

    If the debtor timely notifies the Commission that the debtor is 
exercising the right described in Sec. 1018.94(a) of this subpart, any 
notice to the IRS will be stayed until the issuance of a written 
decision which sustains or amends its original determination.

    (a) A State is eligible to participate as a registration State and 
to receive fee revenue only if, as of January 1, 1991, it charged or 
collected a fee for a vehicle identification stamp or a number pursuant 
to the provisions of the predecessor to this part.

[[Page 85]]

    (b) An eligible State that intends either to commence or to cease 
participating in the registration program must publish notice of its 
intention by the 1st day of July of the year preceding the registration

<R05>
Sec. 1023.3  Selection of registration State.

    (a) Each motor carrier required to register and pay filing fees must 
select a single participating State as its registration State. The 
carrier must select the State in which it maintains its principal place 
of business, if such State is a participating State. A carrier that 
maintains its principal place of business outside of a participating 
State must select the State in which it will operate the largest number 
of motor vehicles during the next registration year. In the event a 
carrier will operate the same largest number of vehicles in more than 
one State, it must select one of those States.
    (b) A carrier may not change its registration State unless it 
changes its principal place of business or its registration State ceases 
participating in the program, in which case the carrier must select a 
registration State for the next registration year under the standards of 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) A carrier must give notice of its selection to the State 
commission of its selected registration State, and, the State commission 
of its prior registration State, within 30 days after it has made its 
selection. If a carrier changes its principal place of business during 
the annual registration period specified in Sec. 1023.4(b)(2), the 
carrier may continue to use its prior registration State, if any, for 
the next registration year.
    (d) A carrier must give notice of its selection to its insurer or 
insurers as soon as practicable after it has made its selection.


<R05>

regard to a carrier operating under temporary authority, only a motor 
carrier holding a certificate or permit issued by the Commission under 
49 U.S.C. 10922 or 10923 shall be required to register under these 
standards.
    (b) A motor carrier operating in interstate or foreign commerce in 
one or more participating States under a certificate or permit issued by 
the Commission shall be required to register annually with a single 
registration State, and such registration shall be deemed to satisfy the 
registration requirements of all participating States.
    (1) The registration year will be the calendar year.
    (2) A carrier must file its annual registration application between 
the 1st day of August and the 30th day of November of the year preceding 
the registration year. A carrier that intends to commence operating 
during the current registration year may register at any time, but it 
must do so before it commences operating.
    (3) The registration application must be in the form appended to 
this part and must contain the information and be accompanied by the 
fees specified in paragraph (c) of this section. There will be no 
prorating of fees to account for partial year operations.
    (4) A carrier that has changed its registration State since its last 
filing must identify the registration State with which it previously 
filed.
    (c) A motor carrier must file, or cause to be filed, the following 
with its registration State:
    (1) Copies of its certificates and/or permits. A carrier must 
supplement its filing by submitting copies of any new operating 
authorities as they are issued. Once a carrier has submitted copies of 
its authorities, it may thereafter satisfy the filing requirement by 
certifying that the copies are on file. A carrier may, with the 
permission of its registration State, submit a summary of its operating 
authorities in lieu of copies. A carrier granted emergency temporary 
authority or temporary authority having a duration of 120 days or less 
is not required to file evidence of such authority, but it must 
otherwise comply with the requirements of this section;
    (2) A copy of its proof of public liability security submitted to 
and accepted by the Commission under 49 CFR part 1043 or a copy of an 
order of the Commission approving a public liability

[[Page 86]]

self-insurance application or other public liability security or 
agreement under the provisions of that part. A carrier must supplement 
its filings as necessary to ensure that current information is on file. 
Once a carrier has submitted, or caused to be submitted, a copy of its 
proof or order of the Commission, it may thereafter satisfy the filing 
requirement by certifying that it has done so and that its security, 
self-insurance, or agreement remains in effect;
    (3) A copy of its designation of an agent or agents for service of 
process submitted to and accepted by the Commission under 49 CFR part 
1044. A carrier must supplement its filings as necessary to ensure that 
current information is on file. Once a carrier has submitted a copy of 
its designation, it may thereafter satisfy the filing requirement by 
certifying that its designation is on file; and
    (4) A fee for the filing of proof of insurance. In support of such 
fee, the carrier must submit the following information:
    (i) The number of motor vehicles it intends to operate in each 
participating State during the next registration year;
    (ii) The per vehicle fee each pertinent participating State charges, 
which fee must equal the fee, not to exceed $10, that such State 
collected or charged as of November 15, 1991;
    (iii) The total fee due each participating State; and
    (iv) The total of all fees specified in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of 
this section.
    (d) Consistent with its obligations under paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, a carrier must cause to be timely filed with its registration 
State copies of any notices of cancellation or of any replacement 
certificates of insurance, surety bonds, or other security filed with 
the Commission under 49 CFR part 1043.
    (e) A carrier must make such supplemental filings at any time during 
the registration year as may be necessary to specify additional vehicles 
and/or States of operation and to pay additional fees.
    (f) A motor carrier must submit to its insurer or insurers a copy of 
the supporting information, including any supplemental information, 
filed with its registration State under paragraphs (c)(4) and (e) of 
this section.
    (g) The charging or collection of any fee that is not in accordance 
with the fee system established above is deemed a burden on interstate 
commerce. This includes fees for the registration or filing of evidence 
of insurance whether assessed directly upon the carrier or indirectly 
upon the insurance provider or other party who seeks reimbursement from 
the carrier.
    (h) To the extent any State registration requirement imposes 
obligations in excess of those specified in this part, the requirement 
is an unreasonable burden on transportation within the Commission's 
jurisdiction under 49 U.S.C. 10521(a).


<R05>
Sec. 1023.5  Registration receipts.

    (a) On compliance by a motor carrier with the annual or supplemental

necessary to comply with the provisions of paragraph (e) of this 
section. However, it may not alter a receipt or a copy of a receipt.

[[Page 87]]

copy(ies) of its receipt(s), indicating that it has filed the required 
proof of insurance and paid the required fees.

Sec.
1033.1  Car hire rates.
1033.2  Car service orders.

    Authority: 5 U.S.C. 553; 49 U.S.C. 10321, 10326, 11121, and 11122.


<R05>
Sec. 1033.1  Car hire rates.

    (a) Definitions applicable to this section:
    (1) Car. A freight car bearing railroad reporting marks, other than 
an excluded boxcar as defined in Sec. 1039.14(c)(2) of this chapter 
whenever it is owned or leased by any class III carrier and bears a 
class III carrier's reporting marks.
    (2) Car hire. Compensation to be paid by a user to an owner for use 
of a car. Such compensation may include, but need not be limited to, 
hourly and mileage rates.
    (3) Fixed rate car. Any car placed in service or rebuilt prior to 
January 1, 1993 or for which there was a written and binding contract to 
purchase, build, or rebuild prior to July 1, 1992, regardless of whether 
such car bore railroad reporting marks prior to January 1, 1993, 
provided, however, that until December 31, 1993, all cars shall be 
deemed to be fixed rate cars.
    (4) Market rate car. Any car that is not a fixed rate car.
    (5) Owner. A rail carrier entitled to receive car hire on cars 
bearing its reporting marks.
    (6) Prescribed rates. The hourly and mileage rates in effect on 
December 31, 1990, as published in Association of American Railroads 
Circular No. OT-10 found in the information section of tariff ICC RER 
6411-U known as the Official Railway Equipment Register. This 
information can be obtained at the Association of American Railroads or 
the Commission. Prescribed rates will be enhanced to reflect OT-37 
surcharges and Rule 88 rebuilds for work undertaken and completed during 
1991 and 1992, and for rebuilding work for which there was a written and 
binding contract prior to July 1, 1992.
    (7) User. A rail carrier in possession of a car of which it is not 
the owner.
    (b) Fixed rate cars. Car hire for fixed rate cars shall be 
determined as follows:

[[Page 90]]

    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, for a 
10-year period beginning January 1, 1993, the prescribed rates shall 
continue to apply to fixed rate cars without regard to the aging of such 
cars subsequent to December 31, 1990. Prescribed car hire rates shall 
not be increased for any additions and betterments performed on such 
cars after December 31, 1990. Any OT-37 surcharge to prescribed rates 
for work performed prior to January 1, 1993 shall expire upon the 
earlier of:
    (i) The car becoming a market rate car; or
    (ii) The expiration date provided in Association of American 
Railroads Circular No. OT-37.
    (2) Upon termination of the 10-year period specified in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, all fixed rate cars shall be deemed to be market 
rate cars and shall be governed by paragraph (c) of this section.
    (3) (i) During each calendar year beginning January 1, 1994, a rail 
carrier may voluntarily elect to designate up to 10% of the cars in its 
fleet as of January 1, 1993 to be treated as market rate cars for the 
purposes of this section. The 10% limitation shall apply each calendar 
year and shall be noncumulative. Cars designated to be treated as market 
rate cars shall be governed by paragraph (c) of this section. Such 
election shall be effective only in accordance with the following 
provisions:
    (A) An election shall be irrevocable and binding as to the rail 
carrier making the election and all users and subsequent owners if:
    (1) The rail carrier making the election has legal title to the car; 
or
    (2) The rail carrier making the election does not have legal title 
to the car but obtains written consent for such election from the party 
holding legal title; or
    (3) The transaction pursuant to which the party holding legal title 
to the car has furnished the car to the rail carrier making the election 
was entered into after January 1, 1991.
    (B) An election shall be irrevocable and binding only for the term 
of the transaction pursuant to which the car was furnished to the rail 
carrier making the election as to that rail carrier and all users and 
subsequent owners if:
    (1) That rail carrier does not have legal title to the car and does 
not obtain written consent or such election from the party holding legal 
title;
    (2) The transaction was entered into prior to January 1, 1991; and
    (3) The transaction does not provide that the compensation to be 
paid to the party furnishing the car is to be based in whole or in part 
directly on the car hire earnings of the car; provided, however, that if 
the rail carrier making the election subsequently obtains legal title to 
the car, such election shall then be irrevocable and binding as to the 
rail carrier and all users and subsequent owners.
    (C) The party holding legal title to the car may revoke an election 
subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section 
only:
    (1) At the time the transaction pursuant to which the car was 
furnished to the rail carrier making the election is first extended or 
renewed after January 1, 1991; or
    (2) If such transaction is not extended or renewed, at the time such 
transaction terminates.

If such election is so revoked, a rail carrier may make a new election 
only with the written consent of the party holding legal title to the 
car, and such election shall be irrevocable and binding as to the rail 
carrier making the election and all users and subsequent owners.
    (ii) Nothing in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section shall be 
construed to limit the rights of parties to any transaction to provide 
for the consent of any party to an election made pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(3)(i) of this section.
    (c) Market rate cars. (1) Market rate cars shall not be subject to 
prescribed rates or to the provisions of 49 CFR 1039.14(c)(1) (i) and 
(ii) and (c)(4).
    (2) (i) The Commission shall not prescribe car hire for market rate 
cars.
    (ii) The Code of Car Hire Rules referenced in the Association of 
American Railroads Car Service and Car Hire Agreement provides that 
owners and users party to that agreement shall resolve car hire disputes 
thereunder. The Commission may review allegations of

[[Page 91]]

abuse of the car hire dispute resolution process established under those 
rules.
    (iii) Car hire disputes involving an owner or user not a party to 
that agreement may be resolved by the Commission.
    (d) Car hire agreements. Rail carriers are authorized to negotiate 
and enter into agreements governing car hire.
    (e) Effective date. This part shall take effect on January 1, 1994.

1983 but not carried in the Code of Federal Regulations, see the List of 
CFR Sections Affected in the Finding Aids section of this volume.


<R05>
Sec. 1034.1  Temporary authority.

    (a) Authority. Any railroad subject to regulation under 49 U.S.C. 
10501 may reasonably divert or reroute traffic to other carriers, if it 
is unable due to circumstances beyond its control promptly to transport 
traffic over a portion of its lines. Traffic necessarily diverted under 
this authority shall be rerouted to preserve as much as possible the 
participation and revenues of other carriers provided in the original 
routing. This authority may be exercised for no more than 30 days 
following the day on which the rerouting begins. If a carrier needs more 
than 30 days before its disability or the disability of a receiving 
carrier is cured, it may automatically extend its rerouting for 
additional 30-day periods. To extend the period, it must submit a 
written or telegraphic notice to the Association of American Railroads 
and the Commission's Railroad Service Board explaining why the rerouting 
is necessary, when it began, when the disability occurred, why an 
extension is necessary, the specific lines disabled, the rerouting to be 
continued, which shippers are affected, and any other important facts.
    (b) Concurrence by carriers. A railroad rerouting traffic must 
receive the concurrence of other railroads to which the traffic will be 
diverted or rerouted, before the rerouting or diversion begins. A 
rerouting carrier must also confirm the inability of a disabled 
receiving carrier to handle the traffic before rerouting that traffic. 
If the receiving carrier is no longer disabled, it must accept the 
traffic according to the routing originally designated.
    (c) Notice by rerouting carrier. A rerouting carrier must notify the 
Commission's Railroad Service Board, the Association of American 
Railroads, Car Service Division, as agent of all railroads subscribing 
to car service and car hire agreements, and the American Short Line 
Railroad Association before the rerouting or diversion begins. The 
originating carrier must notify each shipper at the time each shipment 
is rerouted or diverted and furnish to each shipper the rerouting, 
except when the disability requiring the rerouting occurs after the 
movement has begun. When a rerouting carrier submits to the Commission a 
notice and explanation for an extension of the rerouting period, it must 
immediately also submit a copy of that notice and explanation to the 
AAR, the ASLRA and all shippers that have been affected or that the 
carrier believes will be affected or that request a copy.
    (d) Notice by AAR. The AAR shall notify all carriers affected by 
rerouting or by an extension of a rerouting period, in a manner similar 
to that used for embargoes.
    (e) Applicable rates. The rates applicable on shipments rerouted or 
diverted will be the rates applicable over the route originally 
designated at the time the shipments are tendered.
    (f) Divisions. The carriers involved in the rerouting or diversion 
shall proceed even though no contracts, agreements, or arrangements 
exist between them at the time concerning the divisions of

[[Page 92]]

the rates applicable to the traffic. Divisions shall be, during the time 
the rerouting is in effect, those voluntarily agreed upon by the 
carriers.

Sec. 1035.1  Requirement for certain forms of bills of lading.

    (a) All common carriers, except express companies, engaged in the 
transportation of property other than livestock and wild animals, by 
rail or by water subject to the Interstate Commerce Act are required to 
use straight bills of lading as prescribed in Appendix A and B to this 
part, or order bills of lading as prescribed in Appendix A and B to this 
Part, except that order bills of lading shall:
    (1) Be entitled ``Uniform Order Bill of Lading'' and be designated 
as ``Negotiable'' on the front (appendix A to this part);
    (2) Indicate consignment ``to the order of * * * '' on the front 
(appendix A to this part); and
    (3) Provide for endorsement on the back portion (appendix B to this 
part).
    (b) All such bills of lading:
    (1) May be either documented on paper or issued electronically;
    (2) May be a copy, reprographic or otherwise, of a printed bill of 
lading, free from erasure and interlineation;
    (3) May vary in the arrangement and spacing of the printed matter on 
the face of the form.


<R05>
Sec. 1035.2  Modification of front of uniform bill of lading.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of Sec. 1035.1(a), with respect 
to the information called for, the front portion only (appendix A to 
this part) of a bill of lading may deviate from the language prescribed 
in this part so long as the deviation conforms with approved national 
standards for the electronic data interchange or other commercial 
requirements for bill of lading information; provided that no such 
deviation in the language shall affect the obligations of any shipper to 
provide information absent the consent of such shipper nor shall such 
deviation be deemed to alter any rights or obligations conferred by 
statute or regulation on either carriers or shippers with respect to the 
preparation or issuance of bills of lading.

                         Appendix B to Part 1035

                      Contract Terms and Conditions

    Sec. 1. (a) The carrier or party in possession of any of the 
property herein described shall be liable as at common law for any loss 
thereof or damage thereto, except as hereinafter provided.
    (b) No carrier or party in possession of all or any of the property 
herein described shall be liable for any loss thereof or damage thereto 
or delay caused by the act of God, the public enemy, the authority of 
law, or

[[Page 94]]

the act or default of the shipper or owner, or for natural shrinkage. 
The carrier's liability shall be that of warehouseman, only, for loss, 
damage, or delay caused by fire occurring after the expiration of the 
free time allowed by tariffs lawfully on file (such free time to be 
computed as therein provided) after notice of the arrival of the 
property at destination or at the port of export (if intended for 
export) has been duly sent or given, and after placement of the property 
for delivery at destination, or tender of delivery of the property to 
the party entitled to receive it, has been made. Except in case of 
negligence of the carrier or party in possession (and the burden to 
prove freedom from such negligence shall be on the carrier or party in 
possession), the carrier or party in possession shall not be liable for 
loss, damage, or delay occurring while the property is stopped and held 
in transit upon the request of the shipper, owner, or party entitled to 
make such request, or resulting from a defect or vice in the property, 
or for country damage to cotton, or from riots or strikes.
    (c) In case of quarantine the property may be discharged at risk and 
expense of owners into quarantine depot or elsewhere, as required by 
quarantine regulations or authorities, or for the carrier's dispatch at 
nearest available point in carrier's judgment, and in any such case 
carrier's responsibility shall cease when property is so discharged, or 
property may be returned by carrier at owner's expense to shipping 
point, earning freight both ways. Quarantine expenses of whatever nature 
or kind upon or in respect to property shall be borne by the owners of 
the property or be a lien thereon. The carrier shall not be liable for 
loss or damage occasioned by fumigation or disinfection or other acts 
required or done by quarantine regulations or authorities even though 
the same may have been done by carrier's officers, agents, or employees, 
nor for detention, loss, or damage of any kind occasioned by quarantine 
or the enforcement thereof. No carrier shall be liable, except in case 
of negligence, for any mistake or inaccuracy in any information 
furnished by the carrier, its agents, or officers, as to quarantine laws 
or regulations. The shipper shall hold the carriers harmless from any 
expense they may incur, or damages they may be required to pay, by 
reason of the introduction of the property covered by this contract into 
any place against the quarantine laws or regulations in effect at such 
place.
    Sec. 2. (a) No carrier is bound to transport said property by any 
particular train or vessel, or in time for any particular market or 
otherwise than with reasonable dispatch. Every carrier shall have the 
right in case of physical necessity to forward said property by any 
carrier or route between the point of shipment and the point of 
destination. In all cases not prohibited by law, where a lower value 
than actual value has been represented in writing by the shipper or has 
been agreed upon in writing as the released value of the property as 
determined by the classification or tariffs upon which the rate is 
based, such lower value plus freight charges if paid shall be the 
maximum amount to be recovered, whether or not such loss or damage 
occurs from negligence.
    (b) As a condition precedent to recovery, claims must be filed in 
writing with the receiving or delivering carrier, or carrier issuing 
this bill of lading, or carrier on whose line the loss, damage, injury 
or delay occurred, within nine months after delivery of the property 
(or, in case of export traffic, within nine months after delivery at 
port of export) or, in case of failure to make delivery, then within 
nine months after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed; and suits 
shall be instituted against any carrier only within two years and one 
day from the day when notice in writing is given by the carrier to the 
claimant that the carrier has disallowed the claim or any part or parts 
thereof specified in the notice. Where claims are not filed or suits are 
not instituted thereon in accordance with the foregoing provisions, no 
carrier hereunder shall be liable, and such claims will not be paid.
    (c) Any carrier or party liable on account of loss of or damage to 
any of said property shall have the full benefit of any insurance that 
may have been effected upon or on account of said property, so far as 
this shall not avoid the policies or contracts of insurance: Provided, 
That the carrier reimburse the claimant for the premium paid thereon.
    Sec. 3. Except where such service is required as the result of 
carrier's negligence, all property shall be subject to necessary 
cooperage and baling at owner's cost. Each carrier over whose route 
cotton or cotton linters is to be transported hereunder shall have the 
privilege, at its own cost and risk, of compressing the same for greater 
convenience in handling or forwarding, and shall not be held responsible 
for deviation or unavoidable delays in procuring such compression. Grain 
in bulk consigned to a point where there is a railroad, public or 
licensed elevator, may (unless otherwise expressly noted herein, and 
then if it is not promptly unloaded) be there delivered and placed with 
other grain of the same kind and grade without respect to ownership (and 
prompt notice thereof shall be given to the consignor), and if so 
delivered shall be subject to a lien for elevator charges in addition to 
all other charges hereunder.
    4. (a) Property not removed by the party entitled to receive it 
within the free time allowed by tariffs, lawfully on file (such free 
time to be computed as therein provided), after notice of the arrival of 
the property at

[[Page 95]]

destination or at the port of export (if intended for export) has been 
duly sent or given, and after placement of the property for delivery at 
destination has been made, may be kept in vessel, car, depot, warehouse 
or place of delivery of the carrier, subject to the tariff charge for 
storage and to carrier's responsibility as warehouseman, only, or at the 
option of the carrier, may be removed to and stored in a public or 
licensed warehouse at the place of delivery or other available place, at 
the cost of the owner, and there held without liability on the part of 
the carrier, and subject to a lien for all freight and other lawful 
charges, including a reasonable charge for storage.
    (b) Where nonperishable property which has been transported to 
destination hereunder is refused by consignee or the party entitled to 
receive it, or said consignee or party entitled to receive it fails to 
receive it within 15 days after notice of arrival shall have been duly 
sent or given, the carrier may sell the same at public auction to the 
highest bidder, at such place as may be designated by the carrier: 
Provided, That the carrier shall have first mailed, sent, or given to 
the consignor notice that the property has been refused or remains 
unclaimed, as the case may be, and that it will be subject to sale under 
the terms of the bill of lading if disposition be not arranged for, and 
shall have published notice containing a description of the property, 
the name of the party to whom consigned, or, if shipped order notify, 
the name of the party to be notified, and the time and place of sale, 
once a week for two successive weeks, in a newspaper of general 
circulation at the place of sale or nearest place where such newspaper 
is published: Provided, That 30 days shall have elapsed before 
publication of notice of sale after said notice that the property was 
refused or remains unclaimed was mailed, sent, or given.
    (c) Where perishable property which has been transported hereunder 
to destination is refused by consignee or party entitled to receive it, 
or said consignee or party entitled to receive it shall fail to receive 
it promptly, the carrier, may, in its discretion, to prevent 
deterioration or further deterioration, sell the same to the best 
advantage at private or public sale: Provided, That if time serves for 
notification to the consignor or owner of the refusal of the property or 
the failure to receive it, and request for disposition of the property, 
such notification shall be given, in such manner as the exercise of due 
diligence requires, before the property is sold.
    (d) Where the procedure provided for in the two paragraphs last 
preceding is not possible, it is agreed that nothing contained in said 
paragraphs shall be construed to abridge the right of the carrier at its 
option to sell the property under such circumstances and in such manner 
as may be authorized by law.
    (e) The proceeds of any sale made under this section shall be 
applied by the carrier to the payment of freight, demurrage, storage, 
and any other lawful charges and the expense of notice, advertisement, 
sale, and other necessary expense and of caring for and maintaining the 
property, if proper care of the same requires special expense, and 
should there be a balance it shall be paid to the owner of the property 
sold hereunder.
    (f) Property destined to or taken from a station, wharf, or landing 
at which there is no regularly appointed freight agent shall be entirely 
at risk of owner after unloaded from cars or vessels or until loaded 
into cars or vessels, and except in case of carrier's negligence, when 
received from or delivered to such stations, wharves, or landings shall 
be at owner's risk until the cars are attached to and after they are 
detached from locomotive or train or until loaded into and after 
unloaded from vessels.
    Sec. 5. No carrier hereunder will carry or be liable in any way for 
any documents, specie, or for any articles of extraordinary value not 
specifically rated in the published classifications or tariffs unless a 
special agreement to do so and a stipulated value of the articles are 
indorsed hereon.
    Sec. 6. Every party, whether principal or agent, shipping explosives 
or dangerous goods, without previous full written disclosure to the 
carrier of their nature, shall be liable for and indemnify the carrier 
against all loss or damage cased by such goods, and such goods may be 
warehoused at owner's risk and expense or destroyed without 
compensation.
    Sec. 7. The owner or consignee shall pay the freight and average, if 
any, and all other lawful charges accruing on said property; but, except 
in those instances where it may lawfully be authorized to do so, no 
carrier by railroad shall deliver or relinquish possession at 
destination of the property covered by this bill of lading until all 
tariff rates and charges thereon have been paid. The consignor shall be 
liable for the freight and all other lawful charges, except that if the 
consignor stipulates, by signature, in the space provided for that 
purpose on the face of this bill of lading that the carrier shall not 
make delivery without requiring payment of such charges and the carrier, 
contrary to such stipulation, shall make delivery without requiring such 
payment, the consignor (except as hereinafter provided) shall not be 
liable for such charges. Provided, that, where the carrier has been 
instructed by the shipper or consignor to deliver said property to a 
consignee other than the shipper or consignor, such consignee shall not 
be legally liable for transportation charges in respect of the 
transportation of said property (beyond those billed against him at the 
time of delivery for which he is otherwise liable) which may be found to 
be due after the property

[[Page 96]]

has been delivered to him, if the consignee (a) is an agent only and has 
no beneficial title in said property, and (b) prior to delivery of said 
property has notified the delivering carrier in writing of the fact of 
such agency and absence of beneficial title, and, in the case of a 
shipment reconsigned or diverted to a point other than that specified in 
the original bill of lading, has also notified the delivering carrier in 
writing of the name and address of the beneficial owner of said 
property; and, in such cases the shipper or consignor, or, in the case 
of a shipment so reconsigned or diverted, the beneficial owner, shall be 
liable for such additional charges. If the consignee has given to the 
carrier erroneous information as to who the beneficial owner is, such 
consignee shall himself be liable for such additional charges. On 
shipments reconsigned or diverted by an agent who has furnished the 
carrier in the reconsignment or diversion order with a notice of agency 
and the proper name and address of the beneficial owner, and where such 
shipments are refused or abandoned at ultimate destination, the said 
beneficial owner shall be liable for all legally applicable charges in 
connection therewith. If the reconsignor or diverter has given to the 
carrier erroneous information as to who the beneficial owner is, such 
reconsignor or diverter shall himself be liable for all such charges.
    If a shipper or consignor of a shipment of property (other than a 
prepaid shipment) is also the consignee named in the bill of lading and, 
prior to the time of delivery, notifies, in writing, a delivering 
carrier by railroad (a) to deliver such property at destination to 
another party, (b) that such party is the beneficial owner of such 
property, and (c) that delivery is to be made to such party only upon 
payment of all transportation charges in respect of the transportation 
of such property, and delivery is made by the carrier to such party 
without such payment, such shipper or consignor shall not be liable (as 
shipper, consignor, consignee, or otherwise) for such transportation 
charges but the party to whom delivery is so made shall in any event be 
liable for transportation charges billed against the property at the 
time of such delivery, and also for any additional charges which may be 
found to be due after delivery of the property, except that if such 
party prior to such delivery has notified in writing the delivering 
carrier that he is not the beneficial owner of the property, and has 
given in writing to such delivering carrier the name and address of such 
beneficial owner, such party shall not be liable for any additional 
charges which may be found to be due after delivery of the property; but 
if the party to whom delivery is made has given to the carrier erroneous 
information as to the beneficial owner, such party shall nevertheless be 
liable for such additional charges. If the shipper or consignor has 
given to the delivering carrier erroneous information as to who the 
beneficial owner is, such shipper or consignor shall himself be liable 
for such transportation charges, notwithstanding the foregoing 
provisions of this paragraph and irrespective of any provisions to the 
contrary in the bill of lading or in the contract of transportation 
under which the shipment was made. The term ``delivering carrier'' means 
the line-haul carrier making ultimate delivery.
    Nothing herein shall limit the right of the carrier to require at 
time of shipment the prepayment or guarantee of the charges. If upon 
inspection it is ascertained that the articles shipped are not those 
described in this bill of lading, the freight charges must be paid upon 
the articles actually shipped.
    Where delivery is made by a common carrier by water the foregoing 
provisions of this section shall apply, except as may be inconsistent 
with part III of the Interstate Commerce Act.
    Sec. 8. If this bill of lading is issued on the order of the 
shipper, or his agent, in exchange or in substitution for another bill 
of lading, the shipper's signature to the prior bill of lading as to the 
statement of value or otherwise, or election of common law or bill of 
lading liability, in or in connection with such prior bill of lading, 
shall be considered a part of this bill of lading as fully as if the 
same were written or made in or in connection with this bill of lading.
    Sec. 9. (a) If all or any part of said property is carried by water 
over any part of said route, and loss, damage or injury to said property 
occurs while the same is in the custody of a carrier by water the 
liability of such carrier shall be determined by the bill of lading of 
the carrier by water (this bill of lading being such bill of lading if 
the property is transported by such water carrier thereunder) and by and 
under the laws and regulations applicable to transportation by water. 
Such water carriage shall be performed subject to all the terms and 
provisions of, and all the exemptions from liability contained in the 
Act of Congress of the United States, approved on February 13, 1893, and 
entitled ``An act relating to the navigation of vessels, etc.'' and of 
other statutes of the United States according carriers by water the 
protection of limited liability as well as the following subdivisions of 
this section: and to the conditions contained in this bill of lading not 
inconsistent with this section, when this bill of lading becomes the 
bill of lading of the carrier by water.
    (b) No such carrier by water shall be liable for any loss or damage 
resulting from any fire happening to or on board the vessel, or from 
explosion, bursting of boilers or breakage of shafts, unless caused by 
the design or neglect of such carrier.
    (c) If the owner shall have exercised due diligence in making the 
vessel in all respects

[[Page 97]]

seaworthy and properly manned, equipped and supplied, no such carrier 
shall be liable for any loss or damage resulting from the perils of the 
lakes, seas, or other waters, or from latent defects in hull, machinery, 
or appurtenances whether existing prior to, at the time of, or after 
sailing, or from collision, stranding, or other accidents of navigation, 
or from prolongation of the voyage. And, when for any reason it is 
necessary, any vessel carrying any or all of the property herein 
described shall be at liberty to call at any port or ports, in or out of 
the customary route, to tow and be towed, to transfer, trans-ship, or 
lighter, to load and discharge goods at any time, to assist vessels in 
distress, to deviate for the purpose of saving life or property, and for 
docking and repairs. Except in case of negligence such carrier shall not 
be responsible for any loss or damage to property if it be necessary or 
is usual to carry the same upon deck.
    (d) General Average shall be payable according to the York-Antwerp 
Rules of 1924, sections 1 to 15, inclusive, and sections 17 to 22, 
inclusive, and as to matters not covered thereby according to the laws 
and usages of the Port of New York. If the owners shall have exercised 
due diligence to make the vessel in all respects seaworthy and properly 
manned, equipped and supplied, it is hereby agreed that in case of 
danger, damage or disaster resulting from faults or errors in 
navigation, or in the management of the vessel, or from any latent or 
other defects in the vessel, her machinery or appurtenance, or from 
unseaworthiness, whether existing at the time of shipment or at the 
beginning of the voyage (provided the latent or other defects or the 
unseaworthiness was not discoverable by the exercise of due diligence), 
the shippers, consignees and/or owners of the cargo shall nevertheless 
pay salvage and any special charges incurred in respect of the cargo, 
and shall contribute with the shipowner in general average to the 
payment of any sacrifices, losses or expenses of a general average 
nature that may be made or incurred for the common benefit or to relieve 
the adventure from any common peril.
    (e) If the property is being carried under a tariff which provides 
that any carrier or carriers party thereto shall be liable for loss from 
perils of the sea, then as to such carrier or carriers the provisions of 
this section shall be modified in accordance with the tariff provisions, 
which shall be regarded as incorporated into the conditions of this bill 
of lading.
    (f) The term ``water carriage'' in this section shall not be 
construed as including lighterage in or across rivers, harbors, or 
lakes, when performed by or on behalf of rail carriers.
    Sec. 10. Any alteration, addition, or erasure in this bill of lading 
which shall be made without the special notation hereon of the agent of 
the carrier issuing this bill of lading, shall be without effect, and 
this bill of lading shall be enforceable according to its original 
tenor.

1037.1  Weights and weighing.

1037.3  Claims.

    Authority: 49 U.S.C. 10321.

    Source: 40 FR 49342, Oct. 22, 1975, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1037.1   Weights and weighing.

    (a) How determined--Accuracy of the weights used in determining the 
quantity of grain and grain products received for transportation by 
carriers and delivered by them to consignees being of primary and 
fundamental importance, the use of estimated weights based upon the 
cubical contents of the load and the test weight per bushel of the grain 
and grain products, or otherwise, will not be accepted. All shipments 
shall be carefully weighed by competent weighers upon scales that are 
known to be accurate within the limits of tolerance stated in scale 
specifications.
    (b) Inspection of scales--Before weighing grain and grain products 
to and from cars, the scale and all other facilities to be used must be 
thoroughly inspected to ascertain whether they are in proper working 
condition, necessary adjustments or repairs, if any required, must be 
made, and an accurate and complete record thereof shall be entered at 
the time of inspection.
    (c) Shipping weights--Where the shipper weighs the grain or grain 
products for shipment and a claim for loss

[[Page 98]]

and damage is subsequently filed on that shipment, the shipper shall 
furnish the carrier with whom the claim is filed certificates of weight 
showing car initials and number; the kind of grain or grain products; 
the total scale weight; the type and house number of the scale used; the 
number of drafts and weight of each draft; the date and time of 
weighing; whether the weight is official, board-of-trade, grain-
exchange, State, or other supervised weight; and the number of grain 
doors used. This information should be furnished at the time the claim 
is filed.
    (d) Destination weights--Where the consignee weighs a shipment of 
grain or grain products and a claim for loss and damage is subsequently 
filed on the shipment, the consignee shall furnish the carrier with whom 
the claim is filed certificates of weight showing the car initials and 
number; the kind of grain or grain products; the total scale weight; the 
type and house number of the scale used; the number of drafts and weight 
of each draft, and the date and time of weighing; and whether the weight 
is official, board-of-trade, grain-exchange, State, or other supervised 
weight. This information should be furnished at the time the claim is 
filed.
    (e) A difference in weights at origin and destination, both of which 
are based on supervised scales, establishes prima facie that the loss 
occurred in transit and that the railroad is liable. When a difference 
in weights is based in part on an unsupervised weight, which 
nevertheless, was accepted by the railroad as the basis for assessing 
freight charges, such unsupervised weight in combination with a 
supervised weight establishes prima facie that the loss occurred in 
transit and the railroad is liable. When a difference in weights is 
based in part on an unsupervised weight, with the above exception, a 
prima facie case of railroad liability for loss in transit has not been 
established. Such difference in weights is a factor, however, to be 
considered in connection with other evidence that a clear-record car 
arrived at destination with seals intact and unbroken or that the 
shipper made a written complaint that any car placed for loading was 
defective, in response to which the railroad filed a written report 
after investigation of the complaint. See paragraph (c) of Sec. 1037.3.


<R05>
Sec. 1037.2   Cars.

    A car is not in suitable condition for the transportation of bulk 
grain and grain products when it is defective. The rules prescribed in 
this part 1037 apply on shipments transported solely in railroad-owned 
and railroad-leased cars.

[57 FR 54334, Nov. 18, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 1037.3   Claims.

    (a) In computing the amount of the loss for which the carrier will 
pay there will be deducted from the gross amount of the ascertained 
actual loss one-fourth of 1 percent of the established loading weight to 
cover invisible loss and waste; provided, however, that where grain and 
grain products heat in transit and investigation shows that the 
invisible loss resulting therefrom exceeded one-fourth of 1 percent of 
such other amount as may hereafter be fixed in the manner above stated, 
and that the carrier is not otherwise liable for said loss, then the 
ascertained actual amount of the invisible loss due to heating of the 
grain and grain products will be deducted.
    (b) Where investigation discloses a defect in equipment, seal or 
seal record, or a transfer in transit by the carrier of a carload of 
bulk grain or grain products upon which the unloading weight is less 
than the loading weight and the shipper furnishes duly attested 
certificates showing the correctness of the claimed weight, and 
investigation fails to show that the discrepancy is due to defective 
scales or other shipper facilities, or to inaccurate weighing or other 
error at point of origin or destination, or to fraud, then the resulting 
claim will be adjusted subject to the deductions authorized in the 
immediately preceding paragraph (a) of this Sec. 1037.3; provided, 
however, that the clear record of either the carrier's or shippers' 
facilities shall not be interpreted as affecting or changing the burden 
of proof now lawfully resting upon either party. Therefore, movement in 
a clear-record car is not conclusive evidence of the fact that the car 
is not defective. It must be considered along with other evidence to

    (c) In case of a disputed claim, the records of both the carrier and 
the claimant affecting the shipment involved shall be available to both 
parties. These records shall include a written complaint, if any, filed 
by the shipper with the railroad at the time the car was placed for 
loading that the car was defective, and the written report of an 
investigation of the complaint, filed by the railroad with the shipper, 
if made.

commodities previously exempt, and any transportation service regarding 
which the Commission has made a finding of market dominance. However, 
this exemption shall not be construed as affecting in any way the 
existing regulations, agreements, prescriptions, conditions, allowances 
or levels of compensation

[[Page 101]]

regarding the use of equipment, whether shipper or railroad owned or 
leased, including car hire, per diem and mileage allowances, and also 
including exemption from the anti-trust laws necessary to negotiate car 
service regulations or mandatory interchange of equipment or to maintain 
and execute such agreements. Nor shall this exemption be construed to 
affect existing Class III railroad ``protections'' in the case of 
boxcars.
    (b) Conditions. Carriers must continue to comply with Commission 
accounting and reporting requirements. All railroad tariffs pertaining 
to the transportation of these miscellaneous commodities will no longer 
apply. This exemption shall remain in effect, unless modified or revoked 
by a subsequent order of this Commission.

<R05>
Sec. 1039.12  Long and short haul transportation exemption.

    (a) All rates and charges for rail transportation are exempt from 
the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 10726 to the extent that:
    (1) Commission approval or consideration before the effective date 
of these rates and charges is not required; and
    (2) Section 10707 will not apply to rates to the extent that they 
are challenged on the basis of alleged violations of section 10726.
    (b) This exemption does not extend to review by the Commission upon 
the filing of a formal complaint alleging a violation of section 10726. 
Commission review will, however, be subject to the following conditions:
    (1) A showing that a rate violates section 10726 will not create a 
presumption that the higher rate is unreasonably high, and
    (2) A finding by the Commission that a rate or charge violates the 
provisions of section 10726 will not, absent a specific showing of 
damages, afford a basis for an award of reparations.

    See Part 1090.

[52 FR 23660, June 24, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 1039.14  Boxcar transportation exemptions and rules.

    (a) The Rail transportation of all commodities in boxcars is exempt 
from the provisions of 49 U.S.C. subtitle IV except as otherwise 
provided in this section.
    (b) The Commission retains jurisdiction in the following areas:
    (1) Car hire and car service.
    (2) Mandatory interchange of equipment.
    (3) Reciprocal switching or joint use of terminal facilities.
    (4) Car supply.
    (5) Freight car pooling agreements.
    (6) Freight rates applicable to boxcar traffic originating or 
terminating at an industry facility served physically by a Class III 
rail carrier, to the extent provided in paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(5) of 
this section.
    (c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, 
carriers are authorized to take the following actions with respect to 
boxcar equipment use:
    (i) Assess charges for empty movement of cars where movements are 
made at the request of the car owner, the Association of American 
Railroads, or the Commission. The empty mileage charge is subject to a 
maximum of 35 cents per mile, as adjusted for inflation or deflation 
using the rail cost adjustment factors published periodically by the 
Commission in Ex Parte No. 290 (Sub-No. 2), Railroad Cost Recovery 
Procedures. In applying those factors, the figure of 35 cents will be 
treated as having been in effect on October 1, 1982.
    (ii) Store empty cars and reclaim car hire payments beginning at the 
expiration of a 72-hour grace period after the car is made empty.

[[Page 102]]

    (iii) Negotiate bilateral agreements governing car hire rates, empty 
movements, and storage.
    (2) The authorization in paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (ii) of this 
section will not apply to excluded carriers, as defined in paragraph 
(c)(2)(i) of this section, nor will it apply to any boxcar which, on 
December 30, 1983, was owned or leased by a carrier which then would 
have qualified as an excluded carrier and which bears the reporting 
marks of an excluded carrier.
    (i) An ``excluded carrier'' is a Class III carrier or a Class II 
carrier not affiliated with one or more Class I carriers. To be 
affiliated, the Class II carrier must be more than 50 percent owned by 
one or more Class I carriers.
    (ii) The boxcar exclusion of paragraph (c)(2) of this section will 
apply:
    (A) To an excluded boxcar whenever it is owned or leased by any 
Class III carrier and bears a Class III carrier's reporting marks; and
    (B) To an excluded boxcar owned or leased by an excluded Class II 
carrier beginning on October 16, 1986, and ending on October 31, 1990, 
so long as such boxcar has not been otherwise owned or leased by another 
carrier during this period.
    (iii) The exclusion will not apply during any period in which an 
excluded boxcar is leased or assigned to a Class I or affiliated Class 
II carrier. If an excluded Class II carrier becomes a Class III carrier 
within the period under Sec. 1039.14(c)(2)(ii)(B), that carrier will 
thereafter, for purposes of this rule, be treated as if it had been a 
Class III carrier on December 10, 1983.
    (iv) Nothing in paragraph (c)(2) of this section will affect the 
right of any carrier to negotiate bilateral agreements governing car 
hire rates and rules.
    (3) The hourly and mileage car hire rates in effect on January 1, 
1985, as published in AAR Traffic Circular No. OT-10, for any boxcar 
excluded under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, will remain in effect 
without regard to the aging of such car subsequent to January 1, 1986, 
and any modification to the existing car hire formula will not apply to 
such cars. With respect to an excluded boxcar owned or leased by an 
excluded Class II carrier, those car hire rates shall remain in effect 
through October 31, 1990. Any improvements subsequent to January 1, 
1985, to the excluded boxcars capitalized under OT-37 criteria or under 
rebuilt criteria will be subject to the same formula applicable to OT-37 
or rebuilt cars under Ex Parte No. 334 or any other railroad car hire 
proceeding, including any efficiency ratio, if adopted. Any improvements 
or repairs subsequent to December 31, 1990, to the excluded boxcars 
performed under OT-37 criteria or under rebuilt criteria or any other 
criteria shall not result in any increases, additions, or surcharges in 
the car hire rates for such cars.
    (4) No freight rate made effective after April 1, 1985, that applies 
to traffic moving by boxcar and originating or terminating at an 
industry facility served physically by a Class III rail carrier may 
discriminate while these rules are in effect on the basis of:
    (i) The ownership of the boxcar used or the reporting marks any such 
boxcar bears;
    (ii) The car hire rate applicable to the boxcar used; or
    (iii) Any car hire discounts, in the form of reclaims or otherwise, 
available to any carriers with respect to the boxcar used.

Except as prohibited above, carriers may use car ownership or car marks 
for identification purposes when establishing rates.
    (5) The provisions of 49 U.S.C. 10705 and 10705a applicable to joint 
rates and through routes will be effective as to rates and routes 
applicable to boxcar traffic originating or terminating at an industry 
facility served physically by a Class III rail carrier.
    (6) The following carriers are not regarded as Class III or 
unaffiliated Class II carriers for the purpose of this section:

Central New York Railroad Corporation
Cooperstown and Charlotte Valley Railway Corporation
Fonda, Johnstown & Gloversville Railroad Corporation
Lackawaxen and Stourbridge Railroad Corporation
New York, Susquehanna & Western Railway Corporation
Rahway Valley Railroad Company
Staten Island Railway Corporation.


[[Page 103]]


    (d) Carriers must continue to comply with Commission accounting and 
reporting requirements. Railroad tariffs pertaining to the exempted 
transportation of commodities in boxcars will no longer apply. This 
exemption shall remain in effect, unless modified or revoked by a

and reasonably determines that such payments, services or commitments 
would not be eligible for inclusion in rail contracts under 49 U.S.C.

prior to the filing of the rate or contract.
    (e) When any person files with the Commission a petition to revoke 
the exemption granted by this section as to any specific transaction, 
the rail carrier shall have the burden of showing that, with respect to 
such transaction, all requirements of paragraph (a) of this section were 
met, and the carrier reasonably expected, before undertaking such 
payments, services or commitments, that such payments, services or 
commitments would result, within a reasonable time, in a contribution to 
the carrier's going concern value.
    (f) This exemption shall remain in effect unless modified or revoked 
by a subsequent order of this Commission.

shippers or motor carriers if the broker fails to carry out its 
contracts, agreements, or arrangements for the supplying of 
transportation by authorized motor carriers.

as herein provided.
    (i) Cancellation notice. The surety bond and the trust fund 
agreement may be cancelled as only upon 30 days' written notice to the 
Commission, on prescribed Form BMC 36, by the principal or surety for 
the surety bond, and on prescribed Form BMC 85, by the trustor/broker or 
trustee for the trust fund agreement. The notice period commences upon 
the actual receipt of the notice at the Commission's Washington, DC 
office.
    (ii) Termination by replacement. Broker surety bonds or trust fund 
agreements which have been accepted by the Commission under these rules 
may be replaced by other surety bonds or trust fund agreements, and the 
liability of the retiring surety or trustee under such surety bond or 
trust fund agreements shall be considered as having terminated as of the 
effective date

[[Page 108]]

of the replacement surety bond or trust fund agreement. However, such 
termination shall not affect the liability of the surety or the trustee 
hereunder for the payment of any damages arising as the result of 
contracts, agreements or arrangements made by the broker for the 
supplying of transportation prior to the date such termination becomes 
effective.
    (3) Filing and copies. Broker surety bonds and trust fund agreements 
must be filed with the Commission in duplicate.

Sec. 1043.5  Qualifications as a self-insurer and other securities or agreements.

    (a) As a self-insurer. The Commission will consider and will 
approve, subject to appropriate and reasonable conditions, the 
application of a motor carrier to qualify as a self-insurer, if the 
carrier furnishes a true and accurate statement of its financial 
condition and other evidence that establishes to the satisfaction of the 
Commission the ability of the motor carrier to satisfy its obligation 
for bodily injury liability, property damage liability, or cargo 
liability. Application Guidelines: In addition to filing Form B.M.C. 40, 
applicants for authority to self-insure against bodily injury and 
property damage claims should submit evidence that will allow the 
Commission to determine:
    (1) The adequacy of the tangible net worth of the motor carrier in 
relation to the size of operations and the extent of its request for 
self-insurance authority. Applicant should demonstrate that it will 
maintain a net worth that will ensure that it will be able to meet its 
statutory obligations to the public to indemnify all claimants in the 
event of loss.
    (2) The existence of a sound self-insurance program. Applicant 
should demonstrate that it has established, and will maintain, an 
insurance program that will protect the public against all claims to the 
same extent as the minimum security limits applicable to applicant under 
Sec. 1043.2 of this part. Such a program may include, but not be limited 
to, one or more of the following: Irrevocable letters of credit; 
irrevocable trust funds; reserves; sinking funds; third-party financial 
guarantees, parent company or affiliate sureties; excess insurance 
coverage; or other similar arrangements.
    (3) The existence of an adequate safety program. Applicant must 
submit evidence of a current ``satisfactory'' safety rating by the 
United States Department of Transportation. Non-rated carriers need only 
certify that they have not been rated. Applications by carriers with a 
less than satisfactory rating will be summarily denied. Any self-
insurance authority granted by the Commission will automatically expire 
30 days after a carrier receives a less than satisfactory rating from 
DOT.
    (4) Additional information. Applicant must submit such additional 
information to support its application as the Commission may require.
    (b) Other securities or agreements. The Commission also will 
consider applications for approval of other securities or agreements and 
will approve any such application if satisfied that the security or 
agreement offered will afford the security for protection of the public 
contemplated by 49 U.S.C. 10927.

<R05>
Sec. 1043.6  Bonds and certificates of insurance.

    (a) Public liability. Each Form BMC 82 surety bond filed with the 
Commission must be for the full limits of liability required under 
Sec. 1043.2(b)(1). Form MCS-82 surety bonds and other forms of similar 
import prescribed by the Department of Transportation, may be aggregated 
to comply with the minimum security limits required under 
Sec. 1043.2(b)(1) or Sec. 1043.2(b)(2). Each Form BMC 91 certificate of 
insurance filed with the Commission will always represent the full 
security minimum limits required for the particular carrier, while it 
remains in force, under Sec. 1043.2(b)(1) or Sec. 1043.2(b)(2), 
whichever is applicable. Any previously executed Form BMC 91 filed 
before the current revision which is left on file with the Commission 
after the effective date of this regulation, and not canceled within 30 
days of that date will be deemed to certify the same coverage limits as 
would the filing of a revised Form BMC

[[Page 109]]

91. Each Form BMC 91X certificate of insurance filed with the Commission 
will represent the full security limits under Sec. 1043.2(b)(1) or 
Sec. 1043.2(b)(2) or the specific security limits of coverage as 
indicated on the face of the form. If the filing reflects aggregation, 
the certificate must show clearly whether the insurance is primary or, 
if excess coverage, the amount of underlying coverage as well as amount 
of the maximum limits of coverage.* Each Form BMC 91MX certificate of 
insurance filed with the Commission will represent the security limits 
of coverage as indicated on the face of the form. The Form BMC 91MX must 
show clearly whether the insurance is primary or, if excess coverage, 
the amount of underlying coverage as well as amount of the maximum 
limits of coverage.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    *Note: Aggregation to meet the requirement of Sec. 1043.2(b)(1) will 
not be allowed until the completion of our rulemaking in Ex Parte No. 
MC-5 (Sub-No. 2), Motor Carrier and Freight Forwarder Insurance 
Procedures and Minimum Amounts of Liability.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Cargo Liability. Each form B.M.C. 83 surety bond filed with the 
Commission must be for the full limits of liability required under 
Sec. 1043.2(c). Each Form B.M.C. 34 certificate of insurance filed with 
the Commission will represent the full security limits under 
Sec. 1043.2(c) or the specific security limits of coverage as indicated 
on the face of the form. If the filing reflects aggregation, the 
certificate must show clearly whether the insurance is primary or, if 
excess coverage, the amount of underlying coverage as well as amount of 
the maximum limits of coverage.
    (c) Each policy of insurance in connection with the certificate of 
insurance which is filed with the Commission, shall be amended by 
attachment of the appropriate endorsement prescribed by the Commission 
or the Department of Transportation and the certificate of insurance 
filed must accurately reflect that endorsement.

<R05>
Sec. 1043.7  Forms and procedures.

    (a) Forms for endorsements, certificates of insurance and others. 
(1) In form prescribed. Endorsements for policies of insurance and 
surety bonds, certificates of insurance, applications to qualify as a 
self-insurer, or for approval of other securities or agreements, and 
notices of cancellation must be in the form prescribed and approved by 
the Commission.
    (2) Aggregation of Insurance.** When insurance is provided by more 
than one insurer in order to aggregate security limits for carriers 
operating only freight vehicles under 10,000 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight 
Rating, as defined in Sec. 1043.2(b)(1), a separate Form BMC 90, with 
the specific amounts of underlying and limits of coverage shown thereon 
or appended thereto, and Form BMC 91X certificate is required of each 
insurer.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    **Note: See Note for Rule 1043.6. Also, it should be noted that DOT 
is considering prescribing adaptations of the Form MCS 90 endorsement 
and the Form MCS 82 surety bond for use by passenger carriers and Rules 
Secs. 1043.6 and 1043.7 have been written sufficiently broad to provide 
for this contingency when new forms are prescribed by that Agency.

For aggregation of insurance for all other carriers to cover security 
limits under Sec. 1043.2 (b)(1) or (b)(2), a separate Department of 
Transportation prescribed form endorsement and Form BMC 91X certificate 
is required of each insurer. When insurance is provided by more than one 
insurer to aggregate coverage for security limits under Sec. 1043.2(c) a 
separate Form BMC 32 endorsement and Form BMC 34 certificate of 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
insurance is required for each insurer.

For aggregation of insurance for foreign motor private carriers of 
nonhazardous commodities to cover security limits under 
Sec. 1043.2(b)(4), a separate Form BMC 90 with the specific amounts of 
underlying and limits of coverage shown thereon or appended thereto, or 
Department of Transportation prescribed form endorsement, and Form BMC 
91MX certificate is required for each insurer.

    (3) Use of Certificates and Endorsements in BMC Series. Form BMC 91 
certificates of insurance will be filed with the Commission for the full 
security limits under Sec. 1043.2 (b)(1) or (b)(2).


[[Page 110]]


Form BMC 91X certificate of insurance will be filed to represent full 
coverage or any level of aggregation for the security limits under 
Sec. 1043.2 (b)(1) or (b)(2).

Form BMC 90 endorsement will be used with each filing of Form BMC 91 or 
Form 91X certificate with the Commission which certifies to coverage not 
governed by the requirements of the Department of Transportation. Form 
BMC 32 endorsement and Form BMC 34 certificate of insurance and Form BMC 
83 surety bonds are used for the limits of cargo liability under 
Sec. 1043.2(c).

Form BMC 91MX certificate of insurance will be filed to represent any 
level of aggregation for the security limits under Sec. 1043.2(b)(4).

    (4) Use of Endorsements in MCS Series. When Security limits 
certified under Sec. 1043.2 (b)(1) or (b)(2) involves coverage also 
required by the Department of Transportation a Form MCS endorsement 
prescribed by the Department of Transportation such as, and including, 
the Form MCS 90 endorsement is required.
    (5) Surety bonds. When surety bonds are used rather than 
certificates of insurance, Form BMC 82 is required for the security 
limits under Sec. 1043.2(b)(1) not subject to regulation by the 
Department of Transportation, and Form MCS 82, or any form of similar 
import prescribed by the Department of Transportation, is used for the 
security limits subject also to minimum coverage requirements of the 
Department of Transportation.
    (6) Surety bonds and certificates in effect continuously. Surety 
bonds and certificates of insurance shall specify that coverage 
thereunder will remain in effect continuously until terminated as herein 
provided, except: (1) When filed expressly to fill prior gaps or lapses 
in coverage or to cover grants of emergency temporary authority of 
unusually short duration and the filing clearly so indicates, or (2) in 
special or unusual circumstances, when special permission is obtained 
for filing certificates of insurance or surety bonds on terms meeting 
other particular needs of the situation.
    (b) Filing and copies. Certificates of insurance, surety bonds, and 
notices of cancellation must be filed with the Commission in triplicate.
    (c) Name of insured. Certificates of insurance and surety bonds 
shall be issued in the full and correct name of the individual, 
partnership, corporation or other person to whom the certificate, 
permit, or license is, or is to be, issued. In the case of a 
partnership, all partners shall be named.
    (d) Cancellation notice. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this 
section, surety bonds, certificates of insurance and other securities or 
agreements shall not be cancelled or withdrawn until 30 days after 
written notice has been submitted to the Commission at its offices in 
Washington, DC, on the prescribed form (Form BMC-35, Notice of 
Cancellation Motor Carrier Policies of Insurance under 49 U.S.C. 10927, 
and BMC-36, Notice of Cancellation Motor Carrier and Broker Surety 
Bonds, as appropriate) by the insurance company, surety or sureties, 
motor carrier, broker or other party thereto, as the case may be, which 
period of thirty (30) days shall commence to run from the date such 
notice on the prescribed form is actually received by the Commission.
    (e) Termination by replacement. Certificates of insurance or surety 
bonds which have been accepted by the Commission under these rules may 
be replaced by other certificates of insurance, surety bonds or other 
security, and the liability of the retiring insurer or surety under such 
certificates of insurance or surety bonds shall be considered as having 
terminated as of the effective date of the replacement certificate of 
insurance, surety bond or other security, provided the said replacement 
certificate, bond or other security is acceptable to the Commission 
under the rules and regulations in this part.

this chapter.

    A certificate of insurance or surety bond will not be accepted by 
the Commission unless issued by an insurance or surety company that is 
authorized (licensed or admitted) to issue bonds or underlying insurance 
policies:
    (a) In each state in which the motor carrier is authorized by the 
Commission to operate, or
    (b) In the state in which the motor carrier has its principal place 
of business or domicile, and will designate in writing upon request by 
the Commission, a person upon whom process, issued by or under the 
authority of a court of competent jurisdiction, may be served in any 
proceeding at law or equity brought in any state in which the carrier 
operates, or
    (c) In any state, and is eligible as an excess or surplus lines

Sec. 1043.9  Refusal to accept, or revocation by the Commission of surety bonds, etc.

    The Commission may, at any time, refuse to accept or may revoke its 
acceptance of any surety bond, certificate of insurance, qualifications 
as a self-insurer, or other securities or agreements if, in its judgment 
such security does not comply with these sections or for any reason 
fails to provide satisfactory or adequate protection for the public. 
Revocation of acceptance of any certificate of insurance, surety bond or 
other security shall not relieve the motor carrier from compliance with 
Sec. 1043.1(d).

Sec. 1043.10  Fiduciaries.

    (a) Definitions. The terms ``insured'' and ``principal'' as used in 
a certificate of insurance, surety bond, and notice of cancellation, 
filed by or for a motor carrier, include the motor carrier and its 
fiduciary as of the moment of succession. The term ``fiduciary'' means 
any person authorized by law to collect and preserve property of 
incapacitated, financially disabled, bankrupt, or deceased holders of 
operating rights, and assignees of such holders.
    (b) Insurance coverage in behalf of fiduciaries to apply 
concurrently. The coverage furnished under the provisions of this 
section on behalf of fiduciaries shall not apply subsequent to the 
effective date of other insurance, or other security, filed with and 
approved by the Commission in behalf of such fiduciaries. After the 
coverage provided in this section shall have been in effect thirty (30) 
days, it may be cancelled or withdrawn within the succeeding period of 
thirty (30) days by the insurer, the insured, the surety, or the 
principal upon ten (10) days' notice in writing to the Commission at its 
office in Washington, DC, which period of ten (10) days shall commence 
to run from the date such notice is actually received by the Commission. 
After such coverage has been in effect for a total of sixty (60) days, 
it may be cancelled or withdrawn only in accordance with Sec. 1043.7.

Sec. 1043.11  Operations in foreign commerce.

    No motor carrier may operate in the United States in the course of 
transportation between places in a foreign country or between a place in 
one foreign country and a place in another foreign country unless and 
until there shall have been filed with and accepted by the Commission a 
certificate of insurance, surety bond, proof of qualifications as a 
self-insurer, or other securities or agreements in the amount prescribed 
in Sec. 1043.2(b), conditioned to pay any final judgment recovered 
against such motor carrier for bodily injuries to or the death of any 
person resulting from the negligent operation, maintenance, or use of 
motor vehicles in transportation between places in a foreign country or 
between a place in one foreign country and a place in another foreign 
country, insofar as such transportation takes place in the United 
States, or for loss of or damage to property of others. The security for 
the protection of the public required by

this section shall be maintained in effect at all times and shall be 
subject to the provisions of Secs. 1043.5, 1043.6, 1043.7, 1043.8, 
1043.9 and 1043.10. The requirements of Sec. 1043.8(a) shall be 
satisfied if the insurance or surety company, in addition to having been 
approved by this Commission, is legally authorized to issue policies or 
surety bonds in at least one of the States in the United States, or one 
of the Provinces in Canada, and has filed with this Commission the name 
and address of a person upon whom legal process may be served in each 
State in or through which the motor carrier operates. Such designation 
may from time to time be changed by like designation similarly filed, 
but shall be maintained during the effectiveness of any certificate of 
insurance or surety bond issued by the company, and thereafter with 
respect to any claims arising during the effectiveness of such 
certificate or bond. The term ``motor carrier'' as used in this section 
shall not include private carriers or carriers operating under the 
partial exemption from regulation in 49 U.S.C. 10523 and 10526.

[32 FR 20034, Dec. 20, 1967]


<R05>
Sec. 1045.2  Definitions.

    (a) Broker means a person who, for compensation, arranges, or offers 
to arrange, the transportation of property by an authorized motor 
carrier. Motor carriers, or persons who are employees or bona fide 
agents of carriers, are not brokers within the meaning of this section 
when they arrange or offer to arrange the transportation of shipments 
which they are authorized to transport and which they have accepted and 
legally bound themselves to transport.
    (b) Bona fide agents are persons who are part of the normal 
organization of a motor carrier and perform duties under the carrier's 
directions pursuant to a preexisting agreement which provides for a 
continuing relationship, precluding the exercise of discretion on the 
part of the agent in allocating traffic between the carrier and others.
    (c) Brokerage or brokerage service is the arranging of 
transportation or the physical movement of a motor vehicle or of 
property. It can be performed on behalf of a motor carrier, consignor, 
or consignee.
    (d) Non-brokerage service is all other service performed by a broker 
on behalf of a motor carrier, consignor, or consignee.


<R05>
Sec. 1045.3  Records to be kept by brokers.

    (a) A broker shall keep a record of each transaction. The record 
shall show:
    (1) The name and address of the consignor;
    (2) The name, address, and lead MC-number of the originating motor 
carrier;
    (3) The bill of lading or freight bill number;
    (4) The amount of compensation received by the broker for the 
brokerage service performed and the name of the payer;
    (5) A description of any non-brokerage service performed in 
connection with each shipment or other activity, the amount of 
compensation received for the service, and the name of the payer; and
    (6) The amount of any freight charges collected by the broker and 
the date of payment to the carrier.

For purposes of this subsection, brokers may keep master lists of 
consignors and the address and lead docket number of the carrier, rather 
than repeating this information for each transaction.
    (b) Brokers shall keep the records required by this section for a 
period of three years.
    (c) Each party to a brokered transaction has the right to review the 
record of the transaction required to be kept by these rules.


<R05>
Sec. 1045.7  Misrepresentation.

    (a) A broker shall not perform or offer to perform any brokerage 
service (including advertising), in any name other than that in which 
its license is issued.
    (b) A broker shall not, directly or indirectly, represent its 
operations to be that of a carrier. Any advertising shall show the 
broker status of the operation.


<R05>
Sec. 1045.9  Rebating and compensation.

    (a) A broker shall not charge or receive compensation from a motor 
carrier for brokerage service where:
    (1) The broker owns or has a material beneficial interest in the 
shipment or
    (2) The broker is able to exercise control over the shipment because 
the

[[Page 115]]

broker owns the shipper, the shipper owns the broker, or there is common 
ownership of the two.
    (b) A broker shall not give or offer to give anything of value to 
any shipper, consignor or consignee (or their officers or employees) 
except inexpensive advertising items given for promotional purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 1045.10  Duties and obligations of brokers.

    Where the broker acts on behalf of a person bound by law or a 
Commission regulation as to the transmittal of bills or payments, the 
broker must also abide by the law or regulations which apply to that 
person.

[45 FR 68943, Oct. 17, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 1045.13  Accounting.

    Each broker who engages in any other business shall maintain 
accounts so that the revenues and expenses relating to the brokerage 
portion of its business are segregated from its other activities. 
Expenses that are common shall be allocated on an equitable basis; 
however, the broker must be prepared to explain the basis for the 
allocation.

Sec. 1047.10   Interstate operations by motor common carriers within a single State.

    Every common carrier by motor vehicle who proposes to engage in any 
operations in interstate or foreign commerce under the provisions of 
section 206(a)(6) of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended October 15, 
1962, shall, prior to commencing such operations,

Act and the Commission's requirements and rules and regulations 
thereunder pertaining to the filing of proper evidence of security for 
the protection of the public, to the filing and posting of appropriate

Registration by transfer, shall, in order to obtain a Certificate of 
Registration covering such operations, file with the Interstate Commerce

     Transportation and Notice Thereof by Agricultural Cooperative 
                              Associations


<R05>
Sec. 1047.20  Definitions.

    As used in the regulations in this part, the following terms shall 
have the meaning shown:
    (a) Cooperative association. The term ``cooperative association'' 
means an association which conforms to the following definition in the 
Agricultural Marketing Act, approved June 15, 1929, as amended (12 
U.S.C. 1141j):

    As used in this Act, the term cooperative association means any 
association in which farmers act together in processing, preparing for 
market, handling, and/or marketing the farm products of persons so 
engaged, and also means any association in which farmers act together in 
purchasing, testing, grading, processing, distributing, and/or 
furnishing farm supplies and/or farm business services. Provided, 
however, That such associations are operated for the mutual benefit of 
the members thereof as such producers or purchasers and conform to one 
or both of the following requirements:
    First. That no member of the association is allowed more than one 
vote because of the amount of stock or membership capital he may own 
therein; and
    Second. That the association does not pay dividends on stock or 
membership capital in excess of 8 per centum per annum.
    And in any case to the following:
    Third. That the association shall not deal in farm products, farm 
supplies and farm business services with or for nonmembers in an amount 
greater in value than the total amount of such business transacted by it 
with or for members. All business transacted by any cooperative 
association for or on behalf of the United States or any agency or 
instrumentality thereof shall be disregarded in determining the volume 
of member and nonmember business transacted by such association.

Associations which do not conform to such definition are not eligible to 
operate under the partial exemption of 49 U.S.C. 10526(a)(5).
    (b) Federation of cooperative associations. The term ``federation of 
cooperative associations'' means a federation composed of either two or 
more cooperative associations, or one or more farmers, which federation 
possesses no greater powers or purposes than a cooperative association 
as defined in paragraph (a) of this section. Federations of cooperative 
associations which do not conform to such definition are not eligible to 
operate under the partial exemption of 49 U.S.C. 10526(a)(5).
    (c) Member. The term ``member'' means any farmer or cooperative 
association which has consented to be, has been accepted as, and is a 
member in good standing in accordance with the constitution, bylaws, or 
rules of the cooperative association or federation of cooperative 
associations.
    (d) Farmer. The term ``farmer'' means any individual, partnership, 
corporation, or other business entity to the extent engaged in farming 
operations either as a producer of agricultural commodities or as a farm 
owner.
    (e) Interstate transportation. The term ``interstate 
transportation'' means transportation by motor vehicle in interstate or 
foreign commerce subject to the Commission's jurisdiction as set forth 
in 49 U.S.C. 10521.
    (f) Member transportation. The term ``member transportation'' means 
transportation performed by a cooperative

[[Page 117]]

association or federation of cooperative associations for itself or for 
its members, but does not include transportation performed in 
furtherance of the nonfarm business of such members.
    (g) Nonmember transportation. The term ``nonmember transportation'' 
means transportation performed by a cooperative association or 
federation of cooperative associations other than member transportation 
as defined in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (h) Fiscal year. The term ``fiscal year'' means the annual 
accounting period adopted by the cooperative association or federation 
of cooperative associations for Federal income tax reporting purposes.

<R05>
Sec. 1047.21  Computation of tonnage allowable in nonfarm-non-member transportation.

    Interstate transportation performed by a cooperative association or 
federation of cooperative associations for nonmembers who are not 
farmers, cooperative associations, or federations of associations or the 
United States Government for compensation, (except transportation 
otherwise exempt under subchapter II, chapter 105, subtitle IV of title 
49 of the United States Code) shall be limited to that which is 
incidental to its primary transportation operation and necessary for its 
effective performance. It shall in no event exceed 25 percent of its 
total interstate transportation services in any fiscal year, measured in 
terms of tonnage. A cooperative association or federation of cooperative 
associations may transport its own property, its members' property, 
property of other farmers and the property of other cooperatives or 
federations in accordance with existing law, except where the provisions 
of Sec. 1047.22 may be applicable to the limit on member/nonmember 
transportation.
    (a) The phrase ``incidental to its primary transportation operation 
and necessary for its effective performance'' means that the interstate 
transportation of the cooperative association or federation of 
cooperation association for nonmembers as described above is performed 
with the same trucks or tractors employed in a prior or subsequent trip 
in the primary transportation operation of the cooperative association 
or federation, that it is not economically feasible to operate the 
trucks or tractors empty on return trips (outbound trips in cases where 
the primary transportation operation is inbound to the association or 
federation), and that the additional income obtained from such 
transportation is necessary to make the primary transportation operation 
financially practicable. Transportation for nonmembers as described 
above performed by a cooperative or federation through the use of trucks 
or tractors trip-leased for one-way movements with the cooperative 
association or federation acting as leasee, is not incidental and 
necessary;
    (b) The base tonnage to which the 25-percent limitation is applied 
is all tonnage of all kinds transported by the cooperative association 
or federation of cooperative associations in interstate or foreign 
commerce, whether for itself, its members or nonmembers, for or on 
behalf of the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof, 
and that performed within the exemption provided by 49 U.S.C. 
10526(a)(5).

<R05>
Sec. 1047.22  Nonmember transportation limitation and record keeping.

 Partial Exemption for Motor Transportation of Passengers Incidental to 
                       Transportation by Aircraft


<R05>
Sec. 1047.45   Motor transportation of passengers incidental to transportation by aircraft.

    (a) Passengers having an immediately prior or subsequent movement by 
air. The transportation of passengers by motor vehicle is transportation 
incidental to transportation by aircraft provided (1) that it is 
confined to the transportation of passengers who have had or will have 
an immediately prior or immediately subsequent movement by air and (2) 
that the zone within which motor transportation is incidental to 
transportation by aircraft, except as it may be individually determined 
as provided in section (c) herein, shall not exceed in size the area 
encompassed by a 25-mile radius of the boundary of the airport at which 
the passengers arrive or depart and by the boundaries of the commercial 
zones (as defined by the Commission) of any municipalities any part of 
whose commercial zones falls within the 25-mile radius of the pertinent 
airport.
    (b) Substituted motor-for-air transportation due to emergency 
conditions. Transportation of passengers by motor vehicle is 
transportation incidental to transportation by aircraft if it 
constitutes substituted motor-for-air service performed at the expense 
of the air carrier in emergency situations arising from the inability of 
the air carrier to perform air transportation due to adverse weather 
conditions, equipment failure, or other causes beyond the control of the 
air carrier.
    (c) Individual determination of exempt zones. Upon its own motion or 
upon petition filed by any interested person, the Interstate Commerce 
Commission may in an appropriate proceeding, determine whether the area 
within which the transportation by motor vehicle of passengers having an 
immediately prior or subsequent movement by air must be performed, in 
order to come within the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, 
should be individually determined with respect to any particular airport 
or city served by an airport, and whether there should be established 
therefor appropriate boundaries differing in extent from this defined in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (d) Exempt zones and operations--(1) Dulles and Baltimore-Washington 
International Airports. The transportation by motor vehicle, in 
interstate or foreign commerce, of passengers, having an immediately 
prior or subsequent movement by air, between Dulles International 
Airport, near Chantilly, Va., and Baltimore-Washington International 
Airport, near Baltimore, Md., is partially exempt from regulation under 
section 203(b)(7a) of the Interstate Commerce Act.
    (2) Savannah, Ga., Airport. The transportation by motor vehicle, in 
interstate or foreign commerce, of passengers, having an immediately 
prior or subsequent movement by air, between Savannah, Ga., Airport and 
all points on Hilton Head Island, SC, is partially exempt from 
regulation under section 203(b)(7a) of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 
U.S.C. 303).
    (3) Chicago O'Hare International Airport (Chicago, Ill.). The 
transportation by motor vehicle, in interstate or foreign commerce, of

the carrier has made separate and individual transportation 
arrangements.
    (b) Service provided under incidental charter rights may not be 
operated between the same points or over the same route so frequently as 
to constitute a regular-route service.

Transit District (as defined in the Washington Metropolitan Area 
Transportation Regulation Compact, Pub. L. No. 86-794, 74 Stat. 1031

authorized by these regulations, but is subject to the jurisdiction and 
regulations of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation 
Commission.
    (d) A private or public recipient of governmental assistance (within 
the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 10922(c)(1)(F)) may provide service under 
incidental charter rights only for special or chartered parties 
originating in the area in which the private or public recipient

specific qualifying certificate that confers its incidental charter 
rights.

meeting the definition of a certified scale as provided in 
Sec. 1056.1(b)(4).
    (1) Weighing procedure. Except as otherwise provided herein the 
weight of each shipment shall be obtained by determining the difference 
between the tare weight of the vehicle on which the shipment is to be 
loaded prior to the loading and the gross weight of the same vehicle 
after the shipment is loaded; or, the gross weight of the vehicle with 
the shipment loaded and the tare weight of the same vehicle after the 
shipment is unloaded.
    (2) At the time of both weighings the vehicle shall have installed 
or loaded all pads, dollies, handtrucks, ramps and other equipment 
required in the transportation of such shipments. Neither the driver nor 
any other persons shall be on the vehicle at the time of either 
weighing.
    (3) The fuel tanks on the vehicle shall be full at the time of each 
weighing or, in the alternative, no fuel may be added between the two 
weighings when the tare weighing is the first weighing performed.
    (4) The trailer of a tractor-trailer vehicle combination may be 
detached from the tractor and the trailer weighed separately at each 
weighing providing the length of the scale platform is adequate to 
accommodate and support the entire trailer at one time.
    (5) Shipments weighing 1,000 pounds or less may be weighed on a 
certified platform or warehouse scale prior to loading for 
transportation or subsequent to unloading.
    (6) The net weight of shipments transported in containers shall be 
the difference between the tare weight of the container, including all 
pads, blocking and bracing used or to be used in the transportation of 
the shipment and the gross weight of the container with the shipment 
loaded therein.
    (7) The shipper or any other person responsible for the payment of 
the freight charges shall have the right to observe all weighings of the 
shipment. The carrier must advise the shipper or any other person 
entitled to observe the weighings of the time and specific location 
where each weighing will be performed and must give that person a 
reasonable opportunity to be present to observe the weighings. Waiver by 
a shipper of the right to observe any weighing or reweighing is 
permitted and does not affect any rights of the shipper under these 
regulations or otherwise.
    (b) Weight tickets. The carrier shall obtain a separate weight 
ticket for each weighing required under this section except when both 
weighings are performed on the same scale, one weight ticket may be used 
to record both weighings. Every weight ticket must be signed by the 
person performing the weighing and must contain the following minimum 
information:
    (1) The complete name and location of the scale.
    (2) The date of each weighing.
    (3) Identification of the weight entries thereon as being the tare, 
gross and/or net weights.

to collect any shipment charges dependent on the weight transported must 
be accompanied by true copies of all weight tickets obtained in the 
determination of the shipment weight.
    (c) Reweighing of shipments. Before the actual commencement of the 
unloading of a shipment weighed at origin and after the shipper is 
informed of the billing weight and total charges, the shipper may 
request a reweigh. The charges shall be based on the reweigh weight.


<R05>
Sec. 1056.8  Reasonable dispatch.

    (a) Unless accepted for transportation on the basis of guaranteed 
pickup and delivery dates:
    (1) Reasonable dispatch required. Each motor common carrier 
accepting shipments of household goods as defined in Sec. 1056.1(b)(1) 
for transportation for the account of individual shippers shall cause 
such shipments to be transported with reasonable dispatch as defined in 
Sec. 1056.1(b)(2).

    (2) Notification of delay in providing service with reasonable 
dispatch. Whenever a carrier is unable to perform either or both the 
pickup and delivery of a shipment on the dates or during the periods of 
time specified in the order for service, the carrier shall notify the 
shipper by telephone, telegram or in person, at the carrier's expense, 
of the delay. Such notification shall be given as soon as it becomes 
apparent to the carrier that it will be unable to provide the service in 
compliance with the terms of the order for service.
    (3) Carrier notification of delay. At the time of notification of 
delay the carrier shall advise the shipper of the dates or periods of 
time that pickup and/or delivery can be made, which considers the needs 
of the shipper. If the notification of delay occurs prior to the pickup 
of the shipment, the amendment shall be in writing as required by 
Sec. 1056.5(b). If the notification of delay occurs subsequent to the 
pickup of the shipment, the carrier representative notifying the shipper 
of the delay shall prepare a written record of the date, time and manner 
of notification and the amended date or period of time for delivery by 
the carrier which record shall be retained by the carrier as part of its 
file on the shipment and a true copy thereof shall be furnished, by 
first class mail or in person, to the shipper.
    (b) Tendering for delivery. Except upon the request or concurrence 
of the shipper, a shipment being transported for an individual shipper 
shall not be tendered for delivery prior to the agreed delivery date or 
period of time specified on the bill of lading: Provided, That whenever 
a carrier is able to tender such a shipment for final delivery more than 
24 hours prior to such specified date or the first day of such specified 
period of time, and the shipper has not requested or concurred in such 
early delivery, the carrier may, at its option, place the shipment in 
storage for its own account and at its own expense in a warehouse 
located in proximity to the destination of the shipment. Whenever a 
carrier shall exercise such option it shall immediately notify the 
shipper of the name and address of the warehouse in which the shipment 
has been placed, and shall make and keep a record of such notification 
as a part of its record of shipment. The carrier's responsibility for 
the shipment under the terms and conditions of the bill of lading and 
its responsibility for the charges for redelivery, handling and storage 
thereof shall continue until final delivery: Provided, that the 
carrier's responsibility under the bill of lading shall not extend 
beyond the agreed delivery date or the first day of the period within 
which delivery was to have been accomplished as specified in the bill of 
lading.

Sec. 1056.9  Notification of charges.

    (a) Whenever an individual shipper of a shipment being transported 
on a collect on delivery basis specifically requests notification of the 
actual weight or volume and charges on a shipment, and supplies the 
carrier with an address or telephone number at which the communication 
will be received, the carrier shall comply with such request upon 
determining the actual weight and charges. Such notification shall be 
made by telephone, telegram, or in person.
    (b) Whenever a shipper requests notification of the weight or volume 
and charges on a shipment as provided in paragraph (a), the notification 
must be received by the shipper, at least one full 24-hour day, 
excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, prior to any tender of 
the shipment for delivery. The 24-hour notification requirement shall 
not apply on a shipment to be backweighed or on a shipment which, with 
the agreement of the shipper, is to be picked up and delivered within a 
time period encompassing two consecutive week days, or on a shipment on 
which the charges have been estimated and the maximum amount required to 
be paid at time of delivery is 110 percent of the estimated charges.


<R05>
Sec. 1056.10  Signed receipt for shipment-release prohibited.

<R05>
Sec. 1056.11  Selling of insurance to shippers.

    (a) When a shipment is released for transportation at a value not 
exceeding 60 cents per pound per article, and the shipper does not 
declare a valuation of $1.25 or more per pound and pay or agree to pay 
the carrier for assuming liability for the shipment equal to the 
declared value, any common carrier of household goods as defined in 
Sec. 1056.1(b)(1), or any employee, agent, or representative thereof, 
may sell, or offer to sell or procure for any shipper, any kind of 
insurance, under any type of policy, covering loss or damage in excess 
of the specified carrier liability to a shipment or shipments of 
household goods to be transported in interstate or foreign commerce by 
such carrier; Provided, that the shipper is issued a policy or other 
appropriate evidence of the insurance purchased, and a copy thereof be 
furnished to the shipper at the time the insurance is sold or procured. 
Carrier issued policies shall be written in plain English and shall 
clearly specify the nature and extent of coverage. Failure to issue a 
policy or other appropriate evidence of insurance purchased shall 
subject the carrier to full liability for any claims to recover for loss 
or damage attributed to the carrier.
    (b) Any carrier offering or selling or procuring insurance as 
provided in paragraph (a) of this section shall provide in its tariff 
for the provision of such service. The tariff shall also provide for the 
base transportation charge to include assumption by the carrier for full 
liability for the value of the shipment in the event a policy or other 
appropriate evidence of the insurance purchased by the shipper is not 
issued to the shipper at the time of purchase.


<R05>
Sec. 1056.12  Liability of carriers.

    (a) Liability restricted. Except as provided in Sec. 1056.11(a), 
common carriers by motor vehicle of household goods as defined in 
Sec. 1056.1(b)(1) shall not assume any liability in excess of that for 
which they are legally liable under their lawful bills of lading and 
published tariffs.
    (b) Limitations of liability. A common carrier by motor vehicle of 
household goods shall be liable for loss of or damage to any articles 
caused by it while being transported or while being held for storage-in-
transit, including incidental pickup or delivery, and including 
liability for loss or damage to any article or appliance resulting from 
the servicing of such article or appliance by a third person engaged by 
the carrier to perform such service, to the extent provided in the 
outstanding released rates order; except that the carrier may exempt its 
liability in the following instances:
    (1) No liability need be assumed for perishable articles included in 
the shipment without the knowledge of the carrier; and a carrier 
accepting for shipment perishable articles may impose reasonable 
conditions necessary to insure the safe transportation of such 
commodities.
    (2) When a shipment is released to a value greater than sixty cents 
(60 cents) per pound, per article, liability for loss or damage may be 
limited to $100 per pound, per article (based upon the actual article 
weight), for any article included in the shipment that exceeds $100 per 
pound, per article in value, unless the shipper specifically notifies 
the carrier in writing that an identified article or articles with a 
value greater than $100 per pound will be included in the shipment. In 
such case, the shipper will be entitled to full recovery up to the 
declared value of the article or articles, not to exceed the declared 
value of the entire shipment.
    (c) Storage-in-transit. A common carrier by motor vehicle of 
household goods holding goods for storage-in-transit (S.I.T.) shall, no 
less than 10 days prior to the expiration of either the specified period 
of time during which the goods are to be held in such storage or the 
maximum period of time provided in the carrier's tariff for storage-in-
transit, notify the shipper in writing (1) of the date of conversion to 
permanent storage, (2) of the existence of a nine-month period 
subsequent to the date of conversion to permanent storage during which 
shipper may file claims against the carrier for loss and/or damage which 
occurred to the goods in transit or during the S.I.T. period,

[[Page 140]]

and, (3) of the fact that on the date of conversion, the liability of 
the carrier shall terminate and the property shall be subject to the 
rules, regulations, and charges of the warehouseman. Notification shall 
be by certified mail, return receipt requested. A common carrier by 
motor vehicle of household goods holding goods for storage-in-transit 
for a period of time less than 10 days shall, no less than one day prior 
to the expiration of the specified time during which the goods are to be 
held in such storage, give notification to the shipper of the 
information specified in paragraph (d) (1), (2), and (3) and maintain a 
record thereof as part of its record of the shipment. Failure or refusal 
of a carrier to notify the shipper in accordance with the foregoing 
shall automatically effect a continuance of carrier liability pursuant 
to the applicable tariff provisions with respect to S.I.T., until the 
end of the day following the date upon which notice is given.

shipment a written record of all complaints and inquiries received from 
a shipper by any means of communication.

    (1) Prime agents are defined as all agents who are permitted or 
required under the terms of any agreement or arrangement with a

of the principal carrier, including the selling of or arranging for any 
transportation service, and who perform such services on other than an

    (2) Military agents are defined as all agents who are permitted or 
required under the terms of any agreement or arrangement with a 
principal carrier to provide origin and/or destination services only on

Sec. 1056.15  Collection of freight charges on household goods shipments involving loss or destruction in transit.

    (a) No motor common carrier of household goods in interstate or 
foreign commerce shall collect, or shall require a shipper thereof to 
pay, any published freight charges (including any charges for 
accessorial or terminal services) when that shipment is totally lost or 
destroyed in transit. The provisions of this subsection shall apply only 
to the transportation of household goods as defined in Sec. 1056.1(b)(1) 
of these rules. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subsection, 
a carrier shall collect, and the shipper shall be required to pay, any 
specific valuation charge that may be due. This subsection shall not be 
applicable to the extent that any such loss or destruction is due to the 
act or omission of the shipper.

[[Page 141]]

    (b) In the event that any portion, but less than all, of a shipment 
of household goods is lost or destroyed in transit, a motor common 
carrier of household goods in interstate or foreign commerce shall, at 
the time it disposes of claims for loss, damage, or injury to the 
articles in the shipment as provided in part 1005 of this chapter, 
refund that portion of its published freight charges (including any 
charges for accessorial or terminal services) corresponding to that 
portion of the shipment which is lost or destroyed in transit. To 
calculate the charges applicable to the shipment as delivered, the 
carrier shall multiply the percentage corresponding to the portion of 
the shipment delivered by the total charges (including accessorial and 
terminal charges) applicable to the shipment tendered by the shipper. If 
the charges computed in the manner set forth above exceed the charges 
otherwise applicable to the shipment as delivered, the lesser of those 
charges shall apply. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply only 
to the transportation of household goods as defined in Sec. 1056.1(b)(1) 
of these rules. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this paragraph, 
a carrier shall collect, and the shipper shall be required to pay, that 
proportion of any charges for accessorial or terminal services rendered 
which corresponds to the proportion of the shipment not lost or 
destroyed in transit and any specific valuation charge that may be due. 
The provisions of this paragraph shall not be applicable to the extent 
that any such loss or destruction is due to the act or omission of the 
shipper. Carriers shall determine, at their own expense, the proportion 
of the shipment not lost or destroyed in transit.
    (c) The rights provided by this section are in addition to, and not 
in lieu of, any other rights which the shipper may have with respect to 
a shipment of household goods which is lost or destroyed, or partially 
lost or destroyed, in transit, whether or not that shipper has exercised 
the rights provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

Sec. 1056.16  Collection of freight charges on shipments transported on more than one vehicle.

    (a) Whenever a collect on delivery shipment of household goods, as 
defined in Sec. 1056.1(b)(1), is transported on more than one vehicle 
the carrier delivering such split or divided shipment shall observe the 
requirements of paragraphs (a)(1), (2) or (3) of this section in the 
collection of the charges.
    (1) At the option of the carrier, the collection of the charges 
attributable to the transportation of the portion of the shipment 
transported on each vehicle may be deferred until all portions of the 
shipment are delivered; or,
    (2) Providing that the charges for the entire shipment have been 
determined, the carrier may collect at the time of delivery of any 
portion of the shipment that percentage of the charges represented by 
the portion of the shipment tendered for delivery; or,
    (3) In the event that the charges due the carrier for the 
transportation of the entire shipment cannot reasonably be determined at 
the time any portion of the shipment is tendered for delivery, the 
carrier shall determine and collect the charges for the portion of the 
shipment being delivered. The total charges assessed by the carrier for 
the transportation of the separate portions of the shipment shall not 
exceed the charges due for the entire shipment.
    (b) In the event of the loss or destruction of any part of a 
shipment being transported on more than one vehicle, the collection of 
charges as provided in paragraph (a) of this section shall also be in 
conformity with the requirements of Sec. 1056.15.

                      Instructions for Preparation

                          General Instructions

    1. Data for completion of Form OCE-101 may be obtained by random 
sampling providing that in every instance, the universe sampled is all 
shipments delivered under your common carrier authority (excluding 
Government, Freight forwarder, and Interline traffic) during the report 
year or all claims arising out of the transportation of those shipments 
that were received or settled, as appropriate, during the report year.
    2. When random sampling is used, the minimum sample size in every 
instance shall be 400 shipments or claims, as appropriate, in replicates 
of 100 shipments or claims each. All samples must conform to standard 
deviation with a 95% confidence level.
    3. Carriers submitting Form OCE-101 shall retain and make available 
for review by an authorized Commission employee all working papers, 
notes, and other files relating to the preparation of each report for a 
period of not less than 24 months following the date of filing such a 
report.
    4. The data in Form OCE-101 must be verified by a sworn statement 
signed by an official of the company.

                          Specific Instructions

                                 Part A

Line 1: Only report those 1st proviso C.O.D. shipments moved under your 
common carrier authority after excluding all Government, Freight 
forwarder and Interline traffic.
Line 2: Report all other 1st proviso shipments, including those moving 
under contract carriage provisions and all Government, Freight forwarder 
and Interline traffic.
Line 3: Sum lines 1 and 2. The total should agree with total 1st proviso 
shipments reported in your ICC Annual Report, Schedule 600, Line 7, 
Column d, if you are required to file that report.

                                 Part B

    It is not necessary to complete Part B if the total of C.O.D. 
shipments reported on Part A, Line 1, did not equal or exceed 100 
shipments. If completion of Part B is not required, sign the 
Certification and return the form to the Interstate Commerce Commission.

Line 4: Report only those C.O.D. shipments where the order for service 
was signed after the receipt of a written binding estimate. Include in 
this computation all so-called hybrid estimates (e.g., Guaranteed Price 
and Price Protection options).
Line 5: Report the total number of C.O.D. shipments where the order for 
service was signed after the receipt of a written non-binding estimate. 
In the case of non-binding estimates, the actual charges are determined 
after the shipment has been picked up and weighed.
Line 6: Report only those C.O.D. shipments where there was no 
requirement for the preparation of a binding or non-binding written 
estimate by the carrier. As with non-binding estimates, the charges here 
are determined after the shipment has been picked up and weighed.
Line 7: Sum of Lines 4, 5, and 6. The number of shipments reported on 
Line 7 should be the same as those reported in Part A, Line 1.

                 Computation of Percentages or Averages

    You must determine the number of shipments falling into each of the 
categories described in Lines 8 and 9, respectively, and divide these 
shipments by the number of shipments reported on Lines 4 and 5, 
respectively.

[[Page 144]]

    You must determine the number of shipments falling into each of the 
categories described in Lines 10 through 16 and divide these shipments 
by the number of shipments reported on Line 7. (Exception: Line 13 is an 
average, not a percentage.)

Line 8: Compute the percentage of those shipments delivered where the 
final charges exceeded the written estimate initially provided to the 
shipper because of changes agreed to by the carrier and shipper in 
commodities transported and services provided.
Line 9: Compute the percentage of those shipments delivered under a non-
binding written estimate where the final charges exceeded the written 
estimate provided to the shipper by 10% or more. The 10% figure is used 
because every C.O.D. shipper is required to have available 110% of the 
estimate at the time of delivery.
Line 10: Compute the percentage of those shipments where the actual 
pickup date occurred after the last date for pickup promised on the 
order for service or bill of lading.
Line 11: Compute the percentage of those shipments where the actual 
delivery date occurred after the last date for delivery promised on the 
order for service or bill of lading.
Line 12: Compute the percentage of those shipments where there was a 
claim filed within 60 days of the actual date of delivery to the 
residence. Only count those claims where the dollar value of the amount 
claimed by the shipper exceeded $200 and resulted from property damaged 
or lost. This excludes claims for late pickups and deliveries which are 
reported on line 13.
Line 13: Compute the percentage of those shipments where there was a 
claim filed within 60 days of the actual date of delivery to the 
residence. Only count those claims where the dollar value of the amount 
claimed by the shipper exceeded $200 and resulted from a late pickup or 
delivery. Late pickups and deliveries are defined in Instructions 10 and 
11.
Line 14: Enter the average number of days required to pay, decline, or 
make a firm compromise offer of settlement of all claims exceeding $200 
during the report year. For the purpose of this report, a claim shall be 
considered to be a ``claim filed'' if it meets the criteria set forth in 
Lines 11 and 12, and shall be considered as paid, declined, or 
compromised on the date on which a written offer is mailed or delivered

<R05>
Sec. 1057.11  General leasing requirements.

    Other than through the interchange of equipment as set forth in 
Sec. 1057.31, and under the exemptions set forth in subpart C of these 
regulations, the authorized carrier may perform authorized 
transportation in equipment it does not own only under the following 
conditions:
    (a) Lease. There shall be a written lease granting the use of the 
equipment and meeting the requirements contained in Sec. 1057.12.
    (b) Receipts for equipment. Receipts, specifically identifying the 
equipment to be leased and stating the date and

[[Page 146]]

time of day possession is transferred, shall be given as follows:
    (1) When possession of the equipment is taken by the authorized 
carrier, it shall give the owner of the equipment a receipt. The receipt 
identified in this section may be transmitted by mail, telegraph, or 
other similar means of communication.
    (2) When possession of the equipment by the authorized carrier ends, 
a receipt shall be given in accordance with the terms of the lease 
agreement if the lease agreement requires a receipt.
    (3) Authorized representatives of the carrier and the owner may take 
possession of leased equipment and give and receive the receipts 
required under this subsection.
    (c) Identification of equipment. The authorized carrier acquiring 
the use of equipment under this section shall identify the equipment as 
being in its service as follows:
    (1) During the period of the lease, the carrier shall identify the 
equipment in accordance with the Commission's requirements in part 1058 
of this chapter (Identification of Vehicles).
    (2) Unless a copy of the lease is carried on the equipment, the 
authorized carrier shall keep a statement with the equipment during the 
period of the lease certifying that the equipment is being operated by 
it. The statement shall also specify the name of the owner, the date and 
length of the lease, any restrictions in the lease relative to the 
commodities to be transported, and the address at which the original 
lease is kept by the authorized carrier. This statement shall be 
prepared by the authorized carrier or its authorized representative.
    (d) Records of equipment. The authorized carrier using equipment 
leased under this section shall keep records of the equipment as 
follows:
    (1) The authorized carrier shall prepare and keep documents covering

equipment, the point of origin, the time and date of departure, and the 
point of final destination. Also, the authorized carrier shall carry 
papers with the leased equipment during its operation containing this 
information and identifying the lading and clearly indicating that the 
transportation is under its responsibility. These papers shall be 
preserved by the authorized carrier as part of its transportation 
records. Leases which contain the information required by the provisions 
in this paragraph may be used and retained instead of such documents or 
papers. As to lease agreements negotiated under a master lease, this 
provision is complied with by having a copy of a master lease in the 
unit of equipment in question and where the balance of documentation 
called for by this paragraph is included in the freight documents 
prepared for the specific movement.
    (2) [Reserved]

[44 FR 4681, Jan. 23, 1979, as amended at 49 FR 47269, Dec. 3, 1984; 49

<R05>
Sec. 1057.12  Written lease requirements.

    Except as provided in the exemptions set forth in subpart C of this 
part, the written lease required under Sec. 1057.11(a) shall contain the 
following provisions. The required lease provisions shall be adhered to 
and performed by the authorized carrier.
    (a) Parties. The lease shall be made between the authorized carrier 
and the owner of the equipment. The lease shall be signed by these 
parties or by their authorized representatives.
    (b) Duration to be specific. The lease shall specify the time and 
date or the circumstances on which the lease begins and ends. These 
times or circumstances shall coincide with the times for the giving of 
receipts required by Sec. 1057.11(b).
    (c) Exclusive possession and responsibilities. (1) The lease shall 
provide that the authorized carrier lessee shall have exclusive 
possession, control, and use of the equipment for the duration of the 
lease. The lease shall further provide that the authorized carrier 
lessee shall assume complete responsibility for the operation of the 
equipment for the duration of the lease.
    (2) Provision may be made in the lease for considering the 
authorized carrier lessee as the owner of the equipment for the purpose 
of subleasing it under these regulations to other authorized carriers 
during the lease.

[[Page 147]]

    (3) When an authorized carrier of household goods leases equipment 
for the transportation of household goods, as defined by the Commission, 
the parties may provide in the lease that the provisions required by 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section apply only during the time the 
equipment is operated by or for the authorized carrier lessee.
    (4) Nothing in the provisions required by paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section is intended to affect whether the lessor or driver provided by 
the lessor is an independent contractor or an employee of the authorized 
carrier lessee. An independent contractor relationship may exist when a 
carrier lessee complies with 49 U.S.C. 11107 and attendant 
administrative requirements.
    (d) Compensation to be specified. The amount to be paid by the 
authorized carrier for equipment and driver's services shall be clearly 
stated on the face of the lease or in an addendum which is attached to 
the lease. Such lease or addendum shall be delivered to the lessor prior 
to the commencement of any trip in the service of the authorized 
carrier. An authorized representative of the lessor may accept these 
documents. The amount to be paid may be expressed as a percentage of 
gross revenue, a flat rate per mile, a variable rate depending on the 
direction traveled or the type of commodity transported, or by any other 
method of compensation mutually agreed upon by the parties to the lease. 
The compensation stated on the lease or in the attached addendum may 
apply to equipment and driver's services either separately or as a 
combined amount.
    (e) Items specified in lease. The lease shall clearly specify which 
party is responsible for removing identification devices from the 
equipment upon the termination of the lease and when and how these 
devices, other than those painted directly on the equipment, will be 
returned to the carrier. The lease shall clearly specify the manner in 
which a receipt will be given to the authorized carrier by the equipment 
owner when the latter retakes possession of the equipment upon 
termination of the lease agreement, if a receipt is required at all by 
the lease. The lease shall clearly specify the responsibility of each 
party with respect to the cost of fuel, fuel taxes, empty mileage, 
permits of all types, tolls, ferries, detention and accessorial 
services, base plates and licenses, and any unused portions of such 
items. The lease shall clearly specify who is responsible for loading 
and unloading the property onto and from the motor vehicle, and the 
compensation, if any, to be paid for this service. Except when the 
violation results from the acts or omissions of the lessor, the 
authorized carrier lessee shall assume the risks and costs of fines for 
overweight and oversize trailers when the trailers are pre-loaded, 
sealed, or the load is containerized, or when the trailer or lading is 
otherwise outside of the lessor's control, and for improperly permitted 
overdimension and overweight loads and shall reimburse the lessor for 
any fines paid by the lessor. If the authorized carrier is authorized to 
receive a refund or a credit for base plates purchased by the lessor 
from, and issued in the name of, the authorized carrier, or if the base 
plates are authorized to be sold by the authorized carrier to another 
lessor the authorized carrier shall refund to the initial lessor on 
whose behalf the base plate was first obtained a prorated share of the 
amount received.
    (f) Payment period. The lease shall specify that payment to the 
lessor shall be made within 15 days after submission of the necessary 
delivery documents and other paperwork concerning a trip in the service 
of the authorized carrier. The paperwork required before the lessor can 
receive payment is limited to log books required by the Department of 
Transportation and those documents necessary for the authorized carrier 
to secure payment from the shipper. In addition, the lease may provide 
that, upon termination of the lease agreement, as a condition precedent 
to payment, the lessor shall remove all identification devices of the 
authorized carrier and, except in the case of identification painted 
directly on equipment, return them to the carrier. If the identification 
device has been lost or stolen, a letter certifying its removal will 
satisfy this requirement. Until this requirement is complied with, the 
carrier may withhold final payment. The authorized carrier

[[Page 148]]

may require the submission of additional documents by the lessor but not 
as a prerequisite to payment. Payment to the lessor shall not be made 
contingent upon submission of a bill of lading to which no exceptions 
have been taken. The authorized carrier shall not set time limits for 
the submission by the lessor of required delivery documents and other 
paperwork.
    (g) Copies of freight bill or other form of freight documentation. 
When a lessor's revenue is based on a percentage of the gross revenue 
for a shipment, the lease must specify that the authorized carrier will 
give the lessor, before or at the time of settlement, a copy of the 
rated freight bill or a computer-generated document containing the same 
information, or, in the case of contract carriers, any other form of 
documentation actually used for a shipment containing the same 
information that would appear on a rated freight bill. When a computer-
generated document is provided, the lease will permit lessor to view, 
during normal business hours, a copy of any actual document underlying 
the computer-generated document. Regardless of the method of 
compensation, the lease must permit lessor to examine copies of the 
carrier's tariff or, in the case of contract carriers, other documents 
from which rates and charges are computed, provided that where rates and 
charges are computed from a contract of a contract carrier, only those 
portions of the contract containing the same information that would 
appear on a rated freight bill need be disclosed. The authorized carrier 
may delete the names of shippers and consignees shown on the freight 
bill or other form of documentation.
    (h) Charge-back items. The lease shall clearly specify all items 
that may be initially paid for by the authorized carrier, but ultimately 
deducted from the lessor's compensation at the time of payment or 
settlement, together with a recitation as to how the amount of each item 
is to be computed. The lessor shall be afforded copies of those 
documents which are necessary to determine the validity of the charge.
    (i) Products, equipment, or services from authorized carrier. The 
lease shall specify that the lessor is not required to purchase or rent 
any products, equipment, or services from the authorized carrier as a 
condition of entering into the lease arrangement. The lease shall 
specify the terms of any agreement in which the lessor is a party to an 
equipment purchase or rental contract which gives the authorized carrier 
the right to make deductions from the lessor's compensation for purchase 
or rental payments.
    (j) Insurance. (1) The lease shall clearly specify the legal 
obligation of the authorized carrier to maintain insurance coverage for 
the protection of the public pursuant to Commission regulations under 49 
U.S.C. 10927. The lease shall further specify who is responsible for 
providing any other insurance coverage for the operation of the leased 
equipment, such as bobtail insurance. If the authorized carrier will 
make a charge back to the lessor for any of this insurance, the lease 
shall specify the amount which will be charged-back to the lessor.
    (2) If the lessor purchases any insurance coverage for the operation 
of the leased equipment from or through the authorized carrier, the 
lease shall specify that the authorized carrier will provide the lessor 
with a copy of each policy upon the request of the lessor. Also, where 
the lessor purchases such insurance in this manner, the lease shall 
specify that the authorized carrier will provide the lessor with a 
certificate of insurance for each such policy. Each certificate of 
insurance shall include the name of the insurer, the policy number, the 
effective dates of the policy, the amounts and types of coverage, the 
cost to the lessor for each type of coverage, and the deductible amount 
for each type of coverage for which the lessor may be liable.
    (3) The lease shall clearly specify the conditions under which 
deductions for cargo or property damage may be made from the lessor's 
settlements. The lease shall further specify that the authorized carrier 
must provide the lessor with a written explanation and itemization of 
any deductions for cargo or property damage made from any compensation 
of money owed to the lessor. The written explanation and itemization 
must be delivered to the lessor before any deductions are made.

[[Page 149]]

    (k) Escrow funds. If escrow funds are required, the lease shall 
specify:
    (1) The amount of any escrow fund or performance bond required to be 
paid by the lessor to the authorized carrier or to a third party.
    (2) The specific items to which the escrow fund can be applied.
    (3) That while the escrow fund is under the control of the 
authorized carrier, the authorized carrier shall provide an accounting 
to the lessor of any transactions involving such fund. The carrier shall 
perform this accounting in one of the following ways:
    (i) By clearly indicating in individual settlement sheets the amount 
and description of any deduction or addition made to the escrow fund; or
    (ii) By providing a separate accounting to the lessor of any 
transactions involving the escrow fund. This separate accounting shall 
be done on a monthly basis.
    (4) The right of the lessor to demand to have an accounting for 
transactions involving the escrow fund at any time.
    (5) That while the escrow fund is under the control of the carrier, 
the carrier shall pay interest on the escrow fund on at least a 
quarterly basis. For purposes of calculating the balance of the escrow 
fund on which interest must be paid, the carrier may deduct a sum equal 
to the average advance made to the individual lessor during the period 
of time for which interest is paid. The interest rate shall be 
established on the date the interest period begins and shall be at least 
equal to the average yield or equivalent coupon issue yield on 91-day, 
13-week Treasury bills as established in the weekly auction by the 
Department of Treasury.
    (6) The conditions the lessor must fulfill in order to have the 
escrow fund returned. At the time of the return of the escrow fund, the 
authorized carrier may deduct monies for those obligations incurred by 
the lessor which have been previously specified in the lease, and shall 
provide a final accounting to the lessor of all such final deductions 
made to the escrow fund. The lease shall further specify that in no 
event shall the escrow fund be returned later than 45 days from the date 
of termination.
    (l) Copies of the lease. An original and two copies of each lease 
shall be signed by the parties. The authorized carrier shall keep the 
original and shall place a copy of the lease on the equipment during the 
period of the lease unless a statement as provided for in 
Sec. 1057.11(c)(2) is carried on the equipment instead. The owner of the 
equipment shall keep the other copy of the lease.
    (m) This paragraph applies to owners who are not agents but whose 
equipment is used by an agent of an authorized carrier in providing 
transportation on behalf of that authorized carrier. In this situation, 
the authorized carrier is obligated to ensure that these owners receive 
all the rights and benefits due an owner under the leasing regulations, 
especially those set forth in paragraphs (d)-(k) of this section. This 
is true regardless of whether the lease for the equipment is directly 
between the authorized carrier and its agent rather than directly 
between the authorized carrier and each of these owners. The lease 
between an authorized carrier and its agent shall specify this 
obligation.

possible, any passenger inconvenience it causes by disrupting travel 
plans.
    (d) Seating and reservations. A carrier shall provide sufficient

burden on a carrier, it may petition the Commission either to treat it 
as though it were conducting a commuter service or to waive the rule. 
The request for relief must be justified by appropriate verified 
statements.
    (b) Notice to the public. The carrier shall display conspicuously, 
for at least 30 days, in each facility and on each bus affected, a

to a highway truck, trailer, or semitrailer and designed to be 
transported by more than one mode of transportation, or
    (5) Any of the foregoing types of equipment when empty and being 
transported incidental to its previous

[[Page 163]]

or subsequent use in TOFC/COFC service.
    (b) Highway TOFC/COFC service means the highway transportation, in 
interstate or foreign commerce, of any of the types of equipment listed

Sec. 1090.2  Exemption of rail and highway TOFC/COFC service.

    Except as provided in 49 U.S.C. 10505 (e) and (g), 109229(1), and 
10530, rail TOFC/COFC service and highway TOFC/COFC service provided by 
a rail carrier either itself or jointly with a motor carrier as part of 
a continuous intermodal freight movement is exempt from the requirements 
of 49 U.S.C. subtitle IV, regardless of the type, affiliation, or 
ownership of the carrier performing the highway portion of the service. 
Motor carrier TOFC/COFC pickup and delivery services arranged

and performed immediately before or after a TOFC/COFC movement provided 
by a rail carrier are similarly exempt. Tariffs heretofore applicable to 
any transportation service exempted by this section shall no longer 
apply to such service. The exemption does not apply to a motor carrier 
service in which a rail carrier participates only as the motor carrier's 
agent (Plan I TOFC/COFC), nor does the exemption operate to relieve any 
carrier of any obligation it would otherwise have, absent the exemption, 
with respect to providing contractual terms for liability and claims.

preformance of all or any portion of their authorized service.
    (b) Motor and water common carriers may use rail TOFC/COFC service 
only if their tariff publications give notice that such service may be 
used at their option, but that the right is reserved to the user of 
their services to direct that in any particular instance TOFC/COFC 
service not be used.
    (c) Motor and water contract carriers may use rail TOFC/COFC service 
only if their transportation contracts and tariffs (for water carriers) 
make appropriate provisions therefor.
    (d) Tariffs of motor and water common or water contract carriers 
providing for the use of rail TOFC/COFC service shall set forth the 
points between which TOFC/COFC service may be used.

                     Subpart A--General Information


<R05>
Sec. 1103.1  Register of practitioners.

    The Commission maintains a register containing the names of all non-
attorneys entitled to practice before it. The register is maintained 
according to the individual non-attorney practitioner's name and not by 
corporate or firm name. Corporations and firms are not admitted or 
recognized as practitioners before the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.2  Attorneys-at-law--qualifications and requirements to practice before the Commission.

    Any person who is a member in good standing of the bar of the 
highest court of any State, Commonwealth, possession, territory, or the 
District of Columbia may represent persons before the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.3  Persons not attorneys-at-law--qualifications and requirements for practice before the Commission.

    (a) In general. Any citizen or resident of the United States, not an 
attorney-at-law, who files an application for admission to practice, 
accompanied by the payment of the fee prescribed by rule or order of the 
Commission, and who successfully completes the practitioners' 
examination, and shows that applicant possesses the necessary legal and 
technical qualifications to enable applicant to render valuable service 
before the Commission and that applicant is competent to advise and 
assist in the presentation of matters before the Commission, may be 
permitted to practice before the Commission.
    (b) Qualifications standards. A non-attorney applicant for admission 
to practice must meet one of the following requirements:
    (1) An applicant must have completed 2 years (60 semester hours or 
90 quarter hours) of post secondary education and must possess technical 
knowledge, training or experience in the field of transportation which 
is regarded by the Commission as the equivalent of 2 additional years of 
college education;
    (2) An applicant must have worked in the field of transportation for 
at least 10 years;
    (3) An applicant must have received a bachelor's degree with at 
least 12 semester hours or 18 quarter hours in transportation or 
business; or
    (4) An applicant must have received a bachelor's degree and worked 
in the field of transportation for at least one year. An applicant's 
statement of college education must be supported by a transcript of 
records attached to the original application. Transcripts from any 
college accredited by the U.S. Department of Education will be accepted 
without question. With all other institutions, the burden of proof is on 
the

[[Page 169]]

applicant to establish that the formal education satisfies the standards 
set forth above. The qualifications standards are intended as general 
guidelines. Individual situations that vary from the standards will 
continue to be evaluated on their own merits.
    (c)(1) Application for admission. An application filed pursuant to 
this rule under oath for admission to practice shall be submitted 
between January and May 1 of the year in which the examination is to be 
taken. The application is to be completed in full on the form provided 
by the Commission, and shall be addressed to the Secretary, Interstate 
Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423, to the attention of the room 
number indicated on the form.
    (2) Certification: All applicants must complete the following 
certification:

    I, __________ (Name) __________, certify under penalty of perjury 
under the laws of the United States, that I have not been convicted, 
after September 1, 1989, of any Federal or State offense involving the 
distribution or possession of a controlled substance, or that if I have 
been so convicted, I am not ineligible to receive Federal Benefits, 
either by court order or operation of law, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 853a.

    (d) Application fee. Each application filed pursuant to this rule 
must be accompanied by the non-refundable fee in the amount set forth in 
49 CFR 1002.2(f)(100). Payment must be made either by check or money 
order payable to the Interstate Commerce Commission. Cash payment will 
not be accepted.
    (e) Additional certification. (1) When an application meets the 
required standards, a copy will be referred to the Association of 
Interstate Commerce Commission Practitioners for a report to the 
Commission as to the reputation and character of the applicant. Inquiry 
also will be made by the Commission of the sponsors as to their 
knowledge of the applicant's legal and technical qualifications as 
contemplated by the Commission's Rules of Practice. If the Commission is 
satisfied as to the applicant's qualifications, reputation and 
character, then applicant will be considered eligible to take the 
examination.
    (2) The Commission may require an applicant's sponsors to provide a 
detailed statement of the nature and extent of their knowledge of 
applicant's qualifications. Upon consideration of this material, if the 
Commission is not satisfied as to the adequacy of applicant's 
qualifications, the applicant will be notified by registered mail. 
Applicant may then request a hearing to prove his qualifications. If 
applicant makes such a request, the Commission will allow a hearing. In 
the absence of a request for a hearing within 20 days after receipt of 
the notice, the application will be considered withdrawn.
    (f) Scope of examination. If applicant meets the educational and 
experience standards, and is found to be of good character, the 
applicant will be permitted to take the examination. The examination 
tests the applicant's experience and knowledge of the principal 
regulations, laws, and economic principles in the field of 
transportation as well as knowledge of the Commission's Rules of 
Practice and Canons of Ethics.
    (g) Time and place of examination. The examination will be conducted 
once a year on the second Tuesday in July. Notice of the time and place 
to appear for the examination will be mailed to qualifying applicants 
approximately 30 days prior to the date of the examination.
    (h) Location of examination. Examinations will ordinarily be 
conducted in selected cities where Commission offices are located. A 
listing of the available sites will be attached to the application form. 
Applicants may select their preferred examination site. If a group of 
prospective applicants (three applicants or more) wishes to take the 
examination at a location not listed, a letter stating the preferred 
test site should be included with the application. The Commission will 
make every effort to administer the test at the requested location.
    (i) Cancellation of examination. If the Commission determines that 
there is an insufficient number of applicants to warrant conducting the 
examination, the Commission will cancel the examination for that year. 
Notice of the cancellation will be mailed to applicants on or before 
June 15 and the application fee will be refunded. The

[[Page 170]]

Commission will conduct the examination the next year following the 
cancellation of the examination.
    (j) Examination results. Results will be released within 90 days 
after the examination. Individual results will be forwarded to the 
applicants at least 1 week before being publicly released. To protect 
the privacy of those taking the examination, individual grades will not 
be released over the telephone to anyone. Requests for grades may, 
however, be submitted in writing to the Office of the Secretary to the 
attention of the address stated in the application form.
    (k) Failure to appear for examination. Applicants who have failed to 
appear for, or postponed taking an examination, a total of three times 
without showing good cause will have any subsequently filed application 
returned.
    (l) Failing or postponing the examination. Applicants who fail the 
examination may reapply by submitting a request in writing with an 
additional filing fee in the amount set forth in 49 CFR 1002.2(f)(100). 
Applicants who postpone taking the examination three times without 
showing good cause will have their applications returned.
    (m) The filing fee in the amount set forth in 49 CFR 1002.2(f)(100) 
is not refundable.
    (n) Any application resubmitted to the Commission after being 
returned must be accompanied by a filing fee in the amount set forth in 
49 CFR 1002.2(f)(100).
    (o) Content and grading of examination. The Employee Board on 
Education and Practice is responsible, under the general supervision of 
the Vice-Chairman, for the examination of non-attorney applicants, for 
the preparation of examination questions, and for grading examinations. 
The Board consists of two attorneys and one non-attorney appointed by 
the Chairman with the approval of the Commission. Under the supervision 
of this Board, a seven-member Committee of Examiners will grade the 
examination questions. The members of this Committee must have at least 
2 years experience with the Commission and are appointed for a 2 year 
term by the Chairman, with the approval of the Commission. Members may 
be reappointed and, to the extent possible, no more than three members 
of the Committee will be replaced at one time.
    (p) Applicant's oath. No applicant shall be admitted to practice 
before the Commission until applicant shall subscribe to an oath or 
affirmation that applicant will conduct practice uprightly and according 
to the law, as a practitioner before the Commission, and that applicant 
will support the Constitution of the United States and laws of the 
United States and will conform to the rules and regulations of the 
Commission.

<R05>
Sec. 1103.4  Initial appearances.

    Practitioners shall file a declaration that they are authorized to 
represent the particular party on whose behalf they appear at the time 
of making an initial appearance, in all proceedings. This requirement 
can be met by:
    (a) Entering the practitioner's name as the representative of an 
applicant in the appropriate space on an application form;
    (b) Signing any complaint, petition, protest, reply or other 
pleading with a designation following the practitioner's signature that 
he is the representative of a party;
    (c) Entering an appearance at any hearing on the form provided; or
    (d) Filing a letter with the Secretary of the Commission stating 
that practitioner is authorized to represent a party. The party 
represented, their address, and the docket number of the proceeding must 
also be identified at the time of the initial appearance.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.5  Discipline.

    (a) A member of the Commission's bar may be subject to suspension, 
disbarment, or other disciplinary action if it is shown that the 
practitoner:
    (1) Has been suspended or disbarred from practice in any court of 
record;
    (2) Violated any of the Commission's rules including the Canons of 
Ethics set out in Secs. 1103.10 through 1103.35; or
    (3) Engaged in conduct unbecoming a member of the bar of the 
Commission.
    (b) The practitioner will be afforded an opportunity to show why he 
should

[[Page 171]]

not be suspended, disbarred, or otherwise disciplined. Upon the 
practitioner's timely response to the show cause order after any 
requested hearing, or upon failure to make a timely response to the show 
cause order, the Commission shall issue an appropriate decision.


<R04>
                       Subpart B--Canons of Ethics


<R05>
Sec. 1103.10  Introduction.

    The following canons of ethics are adopted as a general guide for 
those admitted to practice before the Interstate Commerce Commission. 
The practitioners before the Commission include (a) lawyers, who have 
been regularly admitted to practice law and (b) others who have 
fulfilled the requirements set forth in Sec. 1103.3. The former are 
bound by a broad code of ethics and unwritten rules of professional 
conduct which apply to every activity of a lawyer. The canons do not 
release the lawyer from any of the duties or principles of professional 
conduct by which lawyers are bound. They apply similarly to all 
practitioners before the Commission, but do not negate the applicability 
of other ethical codes. The canons are organized under three headings, 
The Practitioner's Duties and Responsibilities to the Commission, The 
Practitioner's Duties and Responsibilities to the Client, The 
Practitioner's Duties and Responsibilities to Other Litigants, Witnesses 
and the Public.

  The Practitioner's Duties and Responsibilities Toward the Commission


<R05>
Sec. 1103.11  Standards of ethical conduct in courts of the United States to be observed.

    These canons further the purpose of the Commission's Rules of 
Practice which direct all persons appearing in proceedings before it to 
conform, as nearly as possible, to the standards of ethical conduct 
required of practice before the courts of the United States. Such 
standards are taken as the basis for these specifications and are 
modified as the nature of the practice before the Commission requires.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.12  The practitioner's duty to and attitude toward the Commission.

    (a) It is the duty of the practitioner to maintain a respectful 
attitude toward the Commission and for the importance of the functions 
it administers. In many respects the Commission functions as a Court, 
and practitioners should regard themselves as officers of that Court and 
uphold its honor and dignity.
    (b) It is the right and duty of the practitioner to submit 
grievances about a member or employee of the Commission to the proper 
authorities when proper grounds for complaint exists. In such cases, 
charges should be encouraged and the person making them should be 
protected.
    (c) It is the duty of the practitioner to be punctual in attendance, 
and to be concise and direct in the trial and disposition of causes.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.13  Attempts to exert political or personal influence on the Commission are prohibited.

    (a) It is unethical for a practitioner to attempt to influence the 
judgment of the Commission by threats of political or personal reprisal.
    (b) Marked attention and unusual hospitality on the part of a 
practitioner to a Commissioner, administrative law judge, or other 
representative of the Commission, which is unwarranted by the personal 
relationship of the parties, is subject to misconstruction of motive and 
should be avoided.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.14  Private communications with the Commission are prohibited.

    To the extent that the Commission acts in a quasi-judicial capacity, 
it is improper for litigants, directly or through any counsel or 
representative, to communicate privately with a Commissioner, 
administrative law judge, or other representative of the Commission 
about a pending case, or to argue privately the merits thereof in the 
absence of the adversaries or without notice to them. Practitioners at 
all times shall scrupulously refrain from going beyond ex parte 
representations which are clearly proper in view of the administrative 
work of the Commission in

[[Page 172]]

their communication with the Commission and its staff.

     The Practitioner's Duties and Responsibilities Toward a Client


<R05>
Sec. 1103.15  The practitioner's duty to clients, generally.

    The practitioner shall be respectful of the law and its official 
ministers, and shall not be involved in corruption of public officials 
or deception of the public. In giving improper service or advice, the 
practitioner invites and deserves stern condemnation. The practitioner 
shall observe and advise all clients to observe the statutory law to the 
best of his knowledge or as interpreted by competent adjudication. The 
practitioner owes a general duty to practice candor toward his client 
with respect to all aspects to his service to the client.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.16  Adverse influences and conflicting interests.

    (a) At the time of the retainer, the practitioner shall disclose to 
the client all circumstances of his relations to the parties, and any 
interest in or connection with the case.
    (b) It is unethical for a practitioner to represent conflicting 
interests, except by express consent of all concerned given after a full 
disclosure of the facts. Within the meaning of this section, a 
practitioner represents conflicting interest, when on behalf of one 
client, it is his duty to contend for that which duty to another client 
requires him to oppose.
    (c) The obligation to represent the client with undivided fidelity 
and not to divulge secrets or confidence forbids also the subsequent 
acceptance of retainers or employment from others in matters adversely 
affecting any interest of the client with respect to which confidence 
has been reposed.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.17  Joint association of practitioners and conflicts of opinion.

    (a) A client's offer of the assistance of an additional practitioner 
should not be regarded as evidence of lack of confidence, but the matter 
should be left to the determination of the client. A practitioner shall 
decline association as colleague if it is objectionable to the 
practitioner first retained, but if the client should relieve the 
practitioner first retained, another may come into the case.
    (b) When practitioners jointly associated in a case cannot agree as 
to any matter vital to the interest of the client the conflict of 
opinion should be frankly stated to the client for final determination. 
The client's decision should be accepted by them unless the nature of 
the difference makes it impracticable for the practitioner whose 
judgment has been overruled to cooperate effectively. In that event, it 
is the practitioner's duty to ask the client to relieve him of his 
obligation.
    (c) It is the right of any practitioner to give proper advice to 
those seeking relief against an unfaithful or neglectful practitioner. 
The practitioner against whom the complaint is made should be notified 
of such action.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.18  Withdrawal from employment.

    The right of a practitioner to withdraw from employment, once begun, 
arises only from good cause. The desire or consent of the client is not 
always sufficient cause for withdrawal. The practitioner shall not 
abandon the unfinished task to the detriment of the client except for 
reasons of honor, or the client's persistence over the practitioner's 
remonstrance in presenting frivolous defenses, or the client's 
deliberate disregard of an obligation as to fees or expenses. In these 
cases, the practitioner may be warranted in withdrawing after due notice 
to the client with time allowed for the employment of another 
practitioner. Other reasons for withdrawal might include instances in 
which a practitioner discovers that his client has no cause and the 
client is determined to continue the cause, or the practitioner's own 
inability to conduct a case effectively. Upon withdrawing from a case, 
the practitioner shall refund any part of a retainer which clearly has 
not been earned.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.19  Advising upon the merits of a client's cause.

    A practitioner shall try to obtain full knowledge of his client's 
cause before advising thereon. The practitioner

[[Page 173]]

shall give a candid opinion of the merits and probable result of 
bringing the case or of any related pending or contemplated litigation. 
The practitioner shall beware of bold and confident assurances to 
clients, especially where employment may depend upon such assurances. 
Whenever a fair settlement can be reached, the client shall be advised 
to avoid or to end litigation.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.20  Practitioner's fees and related practices.

    (a) Establishing fees. In establishing fees, a practitioner shall 
avoid charges which overestimate the value of his advice and services. A 
client's ability to pay cannot justify a charge in excess of the value 
of the service although a client's poverty may require a lesser charge 
or even no charge at all. Publicly quoted fees should be adhered to when 
actual charges are made. Practitioners are bound to charge no more than 
the quoted rates for 30 days following the date of their quotations 
unless a different period of time for the effectiveness of such rates is 
clearly specified when quoted, or unless permission to charge a higher 
rate is obtained from the Vice Chairman of the Commission.
    (b) Compensation, commissions and rebates. A practitioner shall 
accept no compensation, commissions, rebates or other advantages from 
the parties in a proceeding other than his client without the knowledge 
and consent of his client after full disclosure.
    (c) Contingent fees. Contingent fees should be only those sanctioned 
by law. In no case, except a charity case, should fees be entirely 
contingent upon success.
    (d) Division of fees. Fees for services should be divided only with 
another member of the bar of practitioners and should be based upon a 
division of service or responsibility. It is unethical for a 
practitioner to retain laymen to solicit his employment in pending or 
prospective cases, and to reward them by a share of the fees. Such a 
practice cannot be too severely condemned.
    (e) Suing clients for fees. Controversies with clients concerning 
compensation are to be entered into only insofar as they are compatible 
with self-respect and with the right to receive reasonable compensation 
for services. Lawsuits against clients should be resorted to only to 
prevent injustice, imposition or fraud.
    (f) Acquiring interest in litigation. The practitioner shall not 
purchase or otherwise acquire any pecuniary interest in the subject 
matter of litigation which the practitioner is conducting.
    (g) Expenses. A practitioner may not properly agree with a client 
that the practitioner shall pay or bear the expenses of litigation. He 
may in good faith advance expenses as a matter of convenience but must 
do so subject to reimbursement by the client. A practitioner shall bill 
and collect from a client, and thereafter retain only such payments and 
reimbursements for expenses as have actually been incurred in behalf of 
the client.
    (h) Witnesses' compensation. Compensation of a witness is not to be 
made contigent on the success of a case in which the witness is called.
    (i) Dealing with trust property. Money of the client or other trust 
property coming into the possession of the practitioner should be 
reported promptly, and, except with the client's knowledge and consent, 
should not be commingled with the practitioner's private property or be 
put to the practitioner's private use.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.21  How far a practitioner may go in supporting a client's cause.

    A practitioner shall put forth his best effort to maintain and 
defend the rights of his client. Fear of disfavor of the Commission or 
public unpopularity should not cause a practitioner to refrain from the 
full discharge of his duty. The client is entitled to the benefit of any 
and every remedy and defense authorized by law. The client may expect 
his counsel to assert every such remedy or defense. However, the 
practitioner shall act within the bounds of the law. A practitioner 
shall not violate the law or be involved in any manner of fraud or 
chicanery for any client.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.22  Restraining clients from improprieties.

    A practitioner should see that his clients act with the same 
restraint that

[[Page 174]]

the practitioner himself uses, particularly with reference to the 
client's conduct toward the Commission, fellow practitioners, witnesses 
and other litigants. If a client persists in improper conduct, the 
practitioner should terminate their relationship.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.23  Confidences of a client.

    (a) The practitioner's duty to preserve his client's confidence 
outlasts the practitioner's employment by the client, and this duty 
extends to the practitioner's employees as well. Neither practitioner 
nor his employees shall accept employment which involves the disclosure 
or use of a client's confidences without knowledge and consent of the 
client even though there are other available sources of information. A 
practitioner shall not continue employment when he discovers that this 
obligation presents a conflict in his duty between the former and the 
new client.
    (b) If a practitioner is falsely accused by his client, he is not 
precluded from disclosing the truth in respect to the false accusation. 
The announced intention of a client to commit a crime is not included in 
the confidence which a practitioner is bound to respect. The 
practitioner may properly make such disclosures to prevent the act or 
protect those against whom that is threatened.

  The Practitioner's Duties and Responsibilities Regarding Witnesses, 
                     Other Litigants and the Public


<R05>
Sec. 1103.24  Use of adverse witnesses.

    A practitioner shall not be deterred from seeking information from a 
witness connected with or reputed to be biased in favor of an adverse 
party, if the ascertainment of the truth requires that such a person be 
called as a witness in a proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.25  Treatment of witnesses, litigants and other counsel.

    (a) A practitioner shall always treat adverse witnesses and other 
litigants with fairness and due consideration. He should never minister 
to the prejudice of a client in a trial or conduct in a cause. The 
client has no right to demand that the practitioner representing him 
abuse the opposing party or indulge in offensive personal attacks.
    (b) A practitioner shall not attempt to obstruct Commission 
investigations or corruptly to influence witnesses and potential 
witnesses during an investigation.
    (c) In conducting a case it is improper for a practitioner to allude 
to the personal history or the personal peculiarities or idiosyncracies 
of practitioners on the other side, or otherwise engage in personal 
abuse of other practitioners.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.26  Discussion of pending litigation in the public press.

    Attempts to influence the action and attitude of the members and 
administrative law judges of the Commission through propaganda or 
through colored or distorted articles in the public press, should be 
avoided. However, it is not against the public interest or unfair to the 
Commission if the facts of pending litigation are made known to the 
public through the press in a fair and unbiased manner and in 
dispassionate terms. When the circumstances of a particular case appear 
to justify a statement to the public through the press, it is unethical 
to make it anonymously.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.27  Candor and fairness in dealing with other litigants.

    (a) The conduct of practitioners before the Commission and with 
other practitioners should be characterized by candor and fairness. The 
practitioner shall observe scrupulously the principles of fair dealing 
and just consideration for the rights of others.
    (b) It is not candid or fair for a practitioner knowingly to 
misstate or misquote the contents of a paper, the testimony of a 
witness, the language or the argument of an opposing practitioner, or 
the language or effect of a decision or a text book; or, with knowledge 
of its invalidity to cite as authority a decision which has been 
overruled or otherwise impaired as a precedent or a statute which has 
been repealed; or in argument to assert as a fact that which has not 
been proved, or to mislead his opponent by concealing or withholding 
positions in his opening

[[Page 175]]

argument upon which his side then intends to rely.
    (c) It is dishonorable to deal other than candidly with the facts in 
taking the statements of witnesses, in drawing affidavits and other 
documents, and in the presentation of cases.
    (d) A practitioner shall not offer evidence which he knows the 
Commission should reject, in order to get the same before the Commission 
by argument for its admissibility, or arguments upon any point not 
properly calling for determination. He shall not introduce into an 
argument remarks or statements intended to influence the bystanders.
    (e) A practitioner shall rely on his judgment concerning matters 
incidental to the trial which may, in some cases, affect the proceeding. 
For example, a practitioner should not force a matter to trial when 
there is affliction or bereavement on the part of the opposing 
practitioner if no harm will come from postponing the proceeding.
    (f) A practitioner shall not ignore known customs or practice of the 
Commission, even when the law permits, without giving timely notice to 
the opposing practitioner.
    (g) Insofar as is possible, important agreements affecting the 
rights of the clients should be made in writing. It is, however, 
dishonorable to avoid performance of an agreement fairly made only 
because it is not made in writing.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.28  Negotiations with opposing party.

    A practitioner shall not in any way communicate upon the subject of 
controversy with a party represented by another practitioner except upon 
express agreement with the practitioner representing such party. He 
shall not negotiate or make compromises with the other party, but shall 
deal only with the opposing practitioner. The practitioner shall avoid 
everything that may tend to mislead a party not represented by a 
practitioner and should not advise that party as to the law.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.29  Public communication and solicitation.

    (a) A practitioner shall not make any public communication or 
solicitation for employment containing a false, fraudulent, misleading, 
or deceptive statement or claim. This prohibition includes, but is not 
limited to:
    (1) The use of statements containing a material misrepresentation of 
fact or omission of a material fact necessary to keep the statement from 
being misleading;
    (2) Statements intended or likely to create an unjustifiable 
expectation; statements of fee information which are not complete and 
accurate;
    (3) Statements containing information on past performance or 
prediction of future success;
    (4) Statements of prior Commission employment outside the context of 
biographical information; statements containing a testimonial about or 
endorsement of a practitioner;
    (5) Statements containing an opinion as to the quality of a 
practitioner's services, or statements intended or likely to attract 
clients by the use of showmanship, puffery, or self-laudation, including 
the use of slogans, jingles, or sensational language or format.
    (b) A practitioner shall not solicit a potential client who has 
given the practitioner adequate notice that he does not want to receive 
communications from the practitioner, nor shall a practitioner make a 
solicitation which involves the use of undue influence.
    (c) A practitioner shall not solicit a potential client who is 
apparently in a physical or mental condition which would make it 
unlikely that he could exercise reasonable, considered judgment as to 
the selection of a practitioner.
    (d) A practitioner shall not pay or otherwise assist any other 
person who is not also a practitioner and a member or associate of the 
same firm to solicit employment for the practitioner.
    (e) If a public communication is to be made through use of radio or 
television, it must be prerecorded and approved for broadcast by the 
practitioner. A recording of the actual transmission must be retained by 
the practitioner for a period of 1 year after the date of the final 
transmission.
    (f) A paid advertisement must be identified as such unless it is 
apparent

from the context that it is a paid advertisement.
    (g) A practitioner shall not compensate or give anything of value to 
a representative of any communication medium in anticipation of or in 
return for professional publicity in a news item.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.30  Acceptance of employment.

    (a) The practitioner must decline to conduct a case or to make a 
defense when convinced that it is intended merely to harass or to injure 
the opposing party, or to work oppression or wrong. Otherwise, it is the 
practitioner's right, and having accepted retainer, it becomes the 
practitioner's duty, to insist upon the judgment of the Commission as to 
the merits of the client's claim. The practitioner's acceptance of a 
case is equivalent to the assertion that the client's case is proper for 
determination.
    (b) No practitioner is obliged to act either as adviser or advocate 
for every potential client. The practitioner has the right to decline 
employment. Every practitioner shall decide what employment he will 
accept, what cases he will bring before the Commission for complainants, 
or contest for defendants or respondents.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.31  Responsibility for litigation.

    The practitioner bears the responsibility for advising as to 
questionable transactions, bringing questionable proceedings, or urging 
questionable defenses. Client's instructions cannot be used as an excuse 
for questionable practices.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.32  Discovery of imposition and deception and duty to report corrupt or dishonest conduct.

    (a) The practitioner, upon detecting fraud or deception practiced 
against the Commission or a party in a case, shall make every effort to 
rectify the practice by advising his client to forgo any unjustly earned 
advantage. If such advice is refused, the practitioner should inform the 
injured party or that party's practitioner so that appropriate steps may 
be taken.
    (b) Practitioners shall expose without fear or favor before the 
proper tribunals any corrupt or dishonest conduct and should accept 
without hesitation employment against a practitioner who has wronged his 
client. The practitioner upon the trial of a case in which perjury has 
been committed owes it to the Commission and to the public to bring the 
matter to the knowledge of the prosecuting authorities.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.33  Responsibility when proposing a person for admission to practice before the Commission.

    The practitioner shall aid in guarding the bar of the Commission 
against admission of candidates unfit or unqualified because deficient 
in either moral character or qualification. A practitioner shall propose 
no person for admission to practice before the Commission unless from 
personal knowledge or after reasonable inquiry he sincerely believes and 
is able to vouch that such person possesses the qualifications 
prescribed in Sec. 1103.3.


<R05>
Sec. 1103.34  Intermediaries.

    (a) The services of a practitioner should not be controlled or 
exploited by any lay agency, personal or corporate, which intervenes 
between client and practitioner. The responsibility and qualifications 
of the practitioner are individual. The practitioner shall avoid all 
relations which direct the performance of his duties in the interest of 
such intermediaries. The practitioner's relationship and responsibility 
to the client should be direct.
    (b) The practitioner may accept employment from any organization 
(such as an association, club or trade organization) authorized by law 
to be a party to proceedings before the Commission, to render services 
in such proceedings in any matter in which the organization, as an 
entity, is interested. This employment should only include the rendering 
of such services to the members of the organization in respect to the 
individual affairs as are consistent with the free and faithful 
performance of his duties to the Commission.
    (c) Nothing in this canon shall be construed as conflicting with 
Sec. 1103.20(d).

[[Page 177]]


<R05>
Sec. 1103.35  Partnership or professional corporation names and titles.

    In the formation of a partnership or professional corporation among 
practitioners care should be taken to avoid any misleading name or 
representation which would create a false impression as to the position 
or privileges of a member not duly authorized to practice. No person 
should be held as a practitioner who is not duly qualified under 
Sec. 1103.2 or Sec. 1103.3 of these rules. No person who is not duly 
admitted to practice should be held out in a way which will give the 
impression that he is so admitted. No false or assumed or trade name 
should be used to disguise the practitioner or his partnership or 
professional corporation.

FR 19301, May 27, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 1104.4  Attestation and verification.

    (a) Signature of Attorney or Practitioner. If a party is represented 
by a practitioner or an attorney, the original of each paper filed 
should be signed in ink by the practitioner or attorney, whose address 
should be stated. The signature of a practitioner or attorney 
constitutes a certification that the representative:
    (1) Has read the pleading, document or paper;
    (2) Is authorized to file it;

[[Page 178]]

    (3) Believes that there is good ground for the document;

Commission. The original of each document not signed by a practitioner 
or attorney must be:
    (1) Signed in ink;

complaint, at least one complainant must sign and verify the pleading.


<R05>
Sec. 1104.5  Affirmation or declarations under penalty of perjury in accordance with 18 U.S.C. 1621 in lieu of oath.

    (a) An affirmation will be accepted in lieu of an oath.
    (b) Whenever any rule of this Commission requires or permits matter 
to be supported, evidenced, established, or proved by sworn declaration, 
verification, certificate, statement, oath, or affidavit, in writing of 
the person making the same (other than a deposition, oath of office, or 
an oath required to be taken before a special official other than a 
notary public), such matter may, with like force and effect, be 
supported, evidenced, established, or proven by the unsworn declaration, 
certificate, verification, or statement, in writing of such person which 
is subscribed by him, as true under penalty of perjury and dated, in the 
following form:

  I ____________________________, declare (certify, verify, or state) 
          under penalty of perjury (``under the laws of the United 
          States,'' if executed outside of the United States) that the 
          foregoing is true and correct. Further, I certify that I am 
          qualified and authorized to file this (specify type of 
          document). Executed on (date).

    Signature

    (c) Knowing and willful misstatements or omissions of material facts 
constitute federal criminal violations punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001 
by imprisonment up to 5 years and fines up to $10,000 for each offense. 
Additionally, these misstatements are punishable as perjury under 18 
U.S.C. 1621 which provides for fines up to $2,000 or imprisonment up to 
5 years for each offense.


<R05>
Sec. 1104.6  Timely filing required.

    Documents must be received for filing at the Commission's offices in 
Washington, DC within the time limits set for filing. The date of 
receipt at the Commission, and not the date of deposit in the mail, 
determines the timeliness of filing. However, if a document is mailed by 
United States express mail, postmarked at least one day prior to the due 
date, it will be accepted as timely. Other express mail, received by the 
private express mail carrier at least one day prior to the due date, 
also will be accepted as timely filed. The term express mail means that 
the carrier or delivery service offers next day delivery to Washington, 
DC.


<R05>
Sec. 1104.7  Computation and extension of time.

    (a) Computation. In computing any period of time, the day of the 
act, event, or default upon which the designated period of time begins 
to run is not included. The last day of the period is included unless it 
is Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday in the District of Columbia, in 
which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is not a 
Saturday, Sunday or holiday. This rule applies to forward and backward 
measurement of time.
    (b) Extensions. Any time period, except those provided by law or 
specified in these rules respecting informal complaints seeking damage 
may be extended by the Commission in its discretion, upon request and 
for good cause. Requests for extensions must be served on all parties of 
record at the same time and by the same means as service is made on the 
Commission, except if service is made on the Commission in person and 
personal service on other parties is not feasible, service on other

[[Page 179]]

parties should be made by first class or express mail. A request for an 
extension must be filed not less than 10 days before the due date. Only 
the original of the request and certificate of service need be filed 
with the Commission. If granted, the party making the request should 
promptly notify all parties to the proceeding of the extension and so 
certify to the Commission, except that this notification is not required 
in rulemaking proceedings.
    (c) Exception to time computation rules. See 49 CFR part 1152 for 
special abandonment rules.


<R05>
Sec. 1104.8  Objectionable matter.

    The Commission may order that any redundant, irrelevant, immaterial, 
impertinent, or scandalous matter be stricken from any document.
Sec. 1104.9  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1104.10  Rejection of a deficient document.

    (a) The Commission may reject a document, submitted for filing if 
the Commission finds that the document does not comply with the rules.
    (b) The Commission may either return the material unfiled or 
tentatively accept the material for filing and advise the person 
tendering it of the deficiency and require that the deficiency be 
corrected.


<R05>
Sec. 1104.11  Amendments.

    Leave to amend any document is a matter of the Commission's 
discretion.


<R05>
Sec. 1104.12  Service of pleadings and papers.

    (a) Generally. Every document filed with the Commission should 
include a certificate showing simultaneous service upon all parties to 
the proceeding. Service on the parties should be by the same method and 
class of service used in serving the Commission, with charges, if any, 
prepaid. One copy should be served on each party. If service is made on 
the Commission in person, and personal service on other parties is not 
feasible, service should be made by first-class or express mail. When a 
party is represented by a practitioner or attorney, service upon the 
practitioner is deemed to be service upon the party.
    (b) Exceptions. Copies of letters to the Commission relating to oral 
argument under part 1116, and subpoenas under Sec. 1113.2, need not be 
served on other parties of the proceeding. Service of comments in 
rulemaking proceedings is not required, unless specifically directed by 
the Commission.
    (c) Sample Certificate of Service.

    I certify that I have this day served copies of document upon all 
parties of record in this proceeding, by (here state the method of 
making service which must be consistent with this part).

    (a) Time. A party may file a reply or motion addressed to any 
pleading within 20 days after the pleading is filed with the Commission, 
unless otherwise provided.
    (b) Number of copies. The original of a reply or motion should be 
accompanied by the same number of copies required to be filed with the 
pleading to which the reply or motion is addressed.
    (c) Reply to a Reply. A reply to a reply is not permitted.


<R05>
Sec. 1104.14  Protective orders to maintain confidentiality.

    (a) Segregation of confidential material. A party submitting 
materials which it believes are entitled to be kept confidential and not 
made part of the public docket should submit these materials as a 
separate package, clearly marked on the outside ``Confidential materials 
subject to a request for a protective order.''
    (b) Requests for protective orders. A request that materials 
submitted to the Commission be kept confidential should be submitted as 
a separate pleading and clearly headed ``Motion for protective order.''

certificate, license or permit to operate as a motor, water, or rail 
carrier, household goods freight forwarder or property broker must

This certification is required if the transferee in a finance 
proceedings under 49 U.S.C. 10926, Sec. 11343, or Sec. 11344 is an 
individual. The certification also is required if an individual applies 
for authorization to acquire, to construct, to extend, or to operate a 
rail line.

distribution or possession of a controlled substance, or that if I have 
been so convicted, I am not ineligible to receive Federal Benefits, 
either by court order or by operation of law, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 
853a.

Sec. 1105.1  Purpose.

    These rules are designed to assure adequate consideration of 
environmental and energy factors in the Commission's decisionmaking 
process pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 
4332; the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, 42 U.S.C. 6362(b); and

<R05>
Sec. 1105.2  Responsibility for administration of these rules.

    The Director of the Office of Economics shall have general 
responsibility for the overall management and functioning of the Section 
of Energy and Environment. The Director is delegated the authority to 
sign, on behalf of the Commission, memoranda of agreement entered into 
pursuant to 36 CFR 800.5(e)(4) regarding historic preservation matters. 
The Chief of the Section of Energy and Environment is responsible for 
the preparation of documents under these rules and is delegated the 
authority to provide interpretations of the Commission's NEPA process, 
to render initial decisions on requests for waiver or modification of 
any of these rules for individual proceedings, and to recommend 
rejection of environmental reports not in compliance with these rules.

[[Page 181]]


<R05>
Sec. 1105.4  Definitions.

    In addition to the definitions contained in the regulations of the 
Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR part 1508), the following 
definitions apply to these regulations:
    (a) Act means the Interstate Commerce Act, Subtitle IV of Title 49, 
U.S. Code, as amended.
    (b) Applicant means any person or entity seeking Commission action, 
whether by application, petition, notice of exemption, or any other 
means that initiates a formal Commission proceeding.
    (c) Commission means the Interstate Commerce Commission.
    (d) Environmental Assessment or ``EA'' means a concise public 
document for which the Commission is responsible that contains 
sufficient information for determining whether to prepare an 
Environmental Impact Statement or to make a finding of no significant 
environmental impact.
    (e) Environmental documentation means either an Environmental Impact 
Statement or an Environmental Assessment.
    (f) Environmental Impact Statement or ``EIS'' means the detailed 
written statement required by the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 
U.S.C. 4332(2)(c), for a major Federal action significantly affecting 
the quality of the human environment.
    (g) Environmental Report means a document filed by the applicant(s) 
that:
    (1) Provides notice of the proposed action; and
    (2) Evaluates its environmental impacts and any reasonable 
alternatives to the action. An environmental report may be in the form 
of a proposed draft Environmental Assessment or proposed draft 
Environmental Impact Statement.
    (h) Filing means any request for ICC authority, whether by 
application, petition, notice of exemption, or any other means that 
initiates a formal Commission proceeding.
    (i) Section of Energy and Environment or ``SEE'' means the Section 
that prepares the Commission's environmental documents and analyses.
    (j) Third-Party Consultant means an independent contractor, utilized 
by the applicant, who works with SEE's approval and under SEE's 
direction to prepare any necessary environmental documentation. The 
third party consultant must act on behalf of the Commission. The 
railroad may participate in the selection process, as well as in the 
subsequent preparation of environmental documents. However, to avoid any 
impermissible conflict of interest (i.e, essentially any financial or 
other interest in the outcome of the railroad-sponsored project), the 
railroad may not be responsible for the selection or control of 
independent contractors.


<R05>
Sec. 1105.5  Determinative criteria.

    (a) In determining whether a ``major Federal action'' (as that term 
is defined by the Council on Environmental Quality in 40 CFR 1508.18) 
has the potential to affect significantly the quality of the human 
environment, the Commission is guided by the definition of 
``significantly'' at 40 CFR 1508.27.
    (b) A finding that a service or transaction is not within the ICC's 
jurisdiction does not require an environmental analysis under the 
National Environmental Policy Act or historic review under the National 
Historic Preservation Act.
    (c) The environmental laws are not triggered where the ICC's action 
is nothing more than a ministerial act, as in:
    (1) The processing of abandonments proposed under the Northeast Rail 
Services Act (45 U.S.C. 744(b)(3));
    (2) Statutorily-authorized interim trail use arrangements under 16 
U.S.C. 1247(d) [see, 49 CFR 1152.29]; or
    (3) Financial assistance arrangements under 49 U.S.C. 10905 (see 49 
CFR 1152.27).

Finally, no environmental analysis is necessary for abandonments that 
are authorized by a bankruptcy court, or transfers of rail lines under 
plans of reorganization, where our function is merely advisory under 11 
U.S.C. 1166, 1170, and 1172.

    (i) Involves a new operation (i.e., one that adds a significant 
number of barges to the inland waterway system requiring the addition of 
towing capacity, or otherwise significantly alters an existing 
operation, or introduces service to a new waterway that has had no 
previous traffic, or involves the commencement of a new service that is 
not statutorily exempt); or
    (ii) Involves the transportation of hazardous materials; and
    (7) Any other proceeding not listed in paragraphs (a) or (c) of this 
section.
    (c) No environmental documentation will normally be prepared

carrier operations (i.e., changes that do not exceed the thresholds 
established in section 1105.7(e) (4) or (5)), including (but not limited 
to) all of the following actions that meet this criterion:
    (i) An acquisition, lease, or operation under 49 U.S.C. 10901 or 
10910, or consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control under 49 
U.S.C. 11343 that does not come within subsection (b)(4) of this 
section.
    (ii) Transactions involving corporate changes (such as a change in 
the ownership or the operator, or the issuance of securities or 
reorganization) including grants of authority to hold position as an

no potential for significant environmental impacts.
    (d) The Commission may reclassify or modify these requirements for 
individual proceedings. For actions that generally require no 
environmental documentation, the Commission may decide that a particular 
action has the potential for significant environmental impacts and that, 
therefore, the applicant should provide an environmental report and 
either an EA or an EIS will be prepared. For actions generally requiring 
an EA, the Commission may

[[Page 183]]

prepare a full EIS where the probability of significant impacts from the 
particular proposal is high enough to warrant an EIS. Alternatively, in 
a rail construction, an applicant can seek to demonstrate (with 
supporting information addressing the pertinent aspects of 
Sec. 1105.7(e)) that an EA, rather than an EIS, will be sufficient 
because the particular proposal is not likely to have a significant 
environmental impact. Any request for reclassification must be in 
writing and, in a rail construction, should be presented with the 
prefiling notice required by Sec. 1105.10(a)(1) (or a request to waive 
that prefiling notice period).
    (e) The classifications in this section apply without regard to 
whether the action is proposed by application, petition, notice of 
exemption, or any other means that initiates a formal Commission 
proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 1105.7  Environmental reports.

    (a) Filing. An applicant for an action identified in Sec. 1105.6 (a) 
or (b) must submit (with or prior to its application, petition or notice 
of exemption) an Environmental Report on the proposed action containing 
the information set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (b) Distribution. The applicant must serve copies of the 
Environmental Report on:
    (1) The State Clearinghouse of each State involved (or other State 
equivalent agency if the State has no clearinghouse);
    (2) The State Environmental Protection Agency of each State 
involved;
    (3) The State Coastal Zone Management Agency for any state where the 
proposed activity would affect land or water uses within that State's 
coastal zone;
    (4) The head of each county (or comparable political entity 
including any Indian reservation) through which the line goes;
    (5) The appropriate regional offices of the Environmental Protection 
Agency;
    (6) The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service;
    (7) The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers;
    (8) The National Park Service;
    (9) The U.S. Soil Conservation Service;
    (10) The National Geodetic Survey (formerly known as the Coast and 
Geodetic Survey) as designated agent for the National Geodetic Survey 
and the U.S. Geological Survey; and
    (11) Any other agencies that have been consulted in preparing the 
report.

For information regarding the names and addresses of the agencies to be 
contacted, interested parties may contact SEE at the address and 
telephone number indicated in Sec. 1105.3. Applicants filing a notice of 
exempt abandonment under 49 CFR 1152.50 must file the information 
required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section with the appropriate State 
clearinghouses at least 20 days prior to filing the notice of exemption.
    (c) Certification. In its Environmental Report, the applicant must 
certify that it has sent copies of the Environmental Report to the 
agencies listed in paragraph (b) of this section and that it has 
consulted with all appropriate agencies in preparing the report. These 
consultations should be made far enough in advance to afford those 
agencies a reasonable opportunity to provide meaningful input. In a 
notice of exempt abandonment, applicant shall also certify that it has 
notified the appropriate State clearinghouses at least 20 days prior to 
filing the notice. Finally, in every abandonment exemption case, 
applicant shall certify that it has published in a newspaper of general 
circulation in each county through which the line passes a notice that 
alerts the public to the proposed abandonment, to available reuse 
alternatives, and to how it may participate in the ICC proceeding.
    (d) Documentation. Any written responses received from agencies that 
were contacted in preparing the Environmental Report shall be attached 
to the report. Oral responses from such agencies shall be briefly 
summarized in the report and the names, titles, and telephone numbers of 
the persons contacted shall be supplied. A copy of, or appropriate 
citation to, any reference materials relied upon also shall be provided.
    (e) Content. The Environmental Report shall include all of the 
information specified in this paragraph, except to the extent that 
applicant explains why any portion(s) are inapplicable. If

[[Page 184]]

an historic report is required under Sec. 1105.8, the Environmental 
Report should also include the Historic Report required by that section.
    (1) Proposed action and alternatives. Describe the proposed action, 
including commodities transported, the planned disposition (if any) of 
any rail line and other structures that may be involved, and any 
possible changes in current operations or maintenance practices. Also 
describe any reasonable alternatives to the proposed action. Include a 
readable, detailed map and drawings clearly delineating the project.
    (2) Transportation system. Describe the effects of the proposed 
action on regional or local transportation systems and patterns. 
Estimate the amount of traffic (passenger or freight) that will be 
diverted to other transportation systems or modes as a result of the 
proposed action.
    (3) Land use. (i) Based on consultation with local and/or regional 
planning agencies and/or a review of the official planning documents 
prepared by such agencies, state whether the proposed action is 
consistent with existing land use plans. Describe any inconsistencies.
    (ii) Based on consultation with the U.S. Soil Conservation Service, 
state the effect of the proposed action on any prime agricultural land.
    (iii) If the action affects land or water uses within a designated 
coastal zone, include the coastal zone information required by 
Sec. 1105.9.
    (iv) If the proposed action is an abandonment, state whether or not 
the right-of-way is suitable for alternative public use under 49 U.S.C. 
10906 and explain why.
    (4) Energy. (i) Describe the effect of the proposed action on 
transportation of energy resources.
    (ii) Describe the effect of the proposed action on recyclable 
commodities.
    (iii) State whether the proposed action will result in an increase 
or decrease in overall energy efficiency and explain why.
    (iv) If the proposed action will cause diversions from rail to motor 
carriage of more than:
    (A) 1,000 rail carloads a year; or
    (B) An average of 50 rail carloads per mile per year for any part of 
the affected line, quantify the resulting net change in energy 
consumption and show the data and methodology used to arrive at the 
figure given. To minimize the production of repetitive data, the 
information on overall energy efficiency in Sec. 1105.7(e)(4)(iii) need 
not be supplied if the more detailed information in 
Sec. 1105.7(e)(4)(iv) is required.
    (5) Air. (i) If the proposed action will result in either:
    (A) An increase in rail traffic of at least 100 percent (measured in 
gross ton miles annually) or an increase of at least eight trains a day 
on any segment of rail line affected by the proposal, or
    (B) An increase in rail yard activity of at least 100 percent 
(measured by carload activity), or
    (C) An average increase in truck traffic of more than 10 percent of 
the average daily traffic or 50 vehicles a day on any affected road 
segment, quantify the anticipated effect on air emissions. For a 
proposal under 49 U.S.C. 10901 (or 10505) to construct a new line or 
reinstitute service over a previously abandoned line, only the eight 
train a day provision in subsection (5)(i)(A) will apply.
    (ii) If the proposed action affects a class I or nonattainment area 
under the Clean Air Act, and will result in either:
    (A) An increase in rail traffic of at least 50 percent (measured in 
gross ton miles annually) or an increase of at least three trains a day 
on any segment of rail line,
    (B) An increase in rail yard activity of at least 20 percent 
(measured by carload activity), or
    (C) An average increase in truck traffic of more than 10 percent of 
the average daily traffic or 50 vehicles a day on a given road segment, 
then state whether any expected increased emissions are within the 
parameters established by the State Implementation Plan. However, for a 
rail construction under 49 U.S.C. 10901 (or 49 U.S.C. 10505), or a case 
involving the reinstitution of service over a previously abandoned line, 
only the three train a day threshold in this item shall apply.
    (iii) If transportation of ozone depleting materials (such as 
nitrogen oxide

[[Page 185]]

and freon) is contemplated, identify: the materials and quantity; the 
frequency of service; safety practices (including any speed 
restrictions); the applicant's safety record (to the extent available) 
on derailments, accidents and spills; contingency plans to deal with 
accidental spills; and the likelihood of an accidental release of ozone 
depleting materials in the event of a collision or derailment.
    (6) Noise. If any of the thresholds identified in item (5)(i) of 
this section are surpassed, state whether the proposed action will 
cause:
    (i) An incremental increase in noise levels of three decibels Ldn or 
more; or
    (ii) An increase to a noise level of 65 decibels Ldn or greater. If 
so, identify sensitive receptors (e.g., schools, libraries, hospitals, 
residences, retirement communities, and nursing homes) in the project 
area, and quantify the noise increase for these receptors if the 
thresholds are surpassed.
    (7) Safety. (i) Describe any effects of the proposed action on 
public health and safety (including vehicle delay time at railroad grade 
crossings).
    (ii) If hazardous materials are expected to be transported, 
identify: the materials and quantity; the frequency of service; whether 
chemicals are being transported that, if mixed, could react to form more 
hazardous compounds; safety practices (including any speed 
restrictions); the applicant's safety record (to the extent available) 
on derailments, accidents and hazardous spills; the contingency plans to 
deal with accidental spills; and the likelihood of an accidental release 
of hazardous materials.
    (iii) If there are any known hazardous waste sites or sites where 
there have been known hazardous materials spills on the right-of-way, 
identify the location of those sites and the types of hazardous 
materials involved.
    (8) Biological resources. (i) Based on consultation with the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service, state whether the proposed action is likely 
to adversely affect endangered or threatened species or areas designated 
as a critical habitat, and if so, describe the effects.
    (ii) State whether wildlife sanctuaries or refuges, National or 
State parks or forests will be affected, and describe any effects.
    (9) Water. (i) Based on consultation with State water quality 
officials, state whether the proposed action is consistent with 
applicable Federal, State or local water quality standards. Describe any 
inconsistencies.
    (ii) Based on consultation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 
state whether permits under section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 
U.S.C. 1344) are required for the proposed action and whether any 
designated wetlands or 100-year flood plains will be affected. Describe 
the effects.
    (iii) State whether permits under section 402 of the Clean Water Act 
(33 U.S.C. 1342) are required for the proposed action. (Applicants 
should contact the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or the state 
environmental protection or equivalent agency if they are unsure whether 
such permits are required.)
    (10) Proposed Mitigation. Describe any actions that are proposed to 
mitigate adverse environmental impacts, indicating why the proposed 
mitigation is appropriate.
    (11) Additional Information for Rail Constructions. The following 
additional information should be included for rail construction 
proposals (including connecting track construction):
    (i) Describe the proposed route(s) by State, county, and 
subdivision, including a plan view, at a scale not to exceed 1:24,000 
(7\1/2\ minute U.S.G.S. quadrangle map), clearly showing the 
relationship to the existing transportation network (including the 
location of all highway and road crossings) and the right-of-way 
according to ownership and land use requirements.
    (ii) Describe any alternative routes considered, and a no-build 
alternative (or why this would not be applicable), and explain why they 
were not selected.
    (iii) Describe the construction plans, including the effect on the 
human environment, labor force requirements, the location of borrow 
pits, if any, and earthwork estimates.
    (iv) Describe in detail the rail operations to be conducted upon the 
line, including estimates of freight (carloads

[[Page 186]]

and tonnage) to be transported, the anticipated daily and annual number 
of train movements, number of cars per train, types of cars, motive 
power requirements, proposed speeds, labor force, and proposed 
maintenance-of-way practices.
    (v) Describe the effects, including indirect or down-line impacts, 
of the new or diverted traffic over the line if the thresholds governing 
energy, noise and air impacts in Secs. 1105.7(e)(4), (5), or (6) are 
met.
    (vi) Describe the effects, including impacts on essential public 
services (e.g., fire, police, ambulance, neighborhood schools), public 
roads, and adjoining properties, in communities to be traversed by the 
line.
    (vii) Discuss societal impacts, including expected change in 
employment during and after construction.
    (f) Additional Information. The Commission may require applicants to 
submit additional information regarding the environmental or energy 
effects of the proposed action.
    (g) Waivers. The Commission may waive or modify, in whole or in 
part, the provisions of this section where a railroad applicant shows 
that the information requested is not necessary for the Commission to 
evaluate the environmental impacts of the proposed action.

Sec. 1105.8  Historic Reports.

    (a) Filing. An applicant proposing an action identified in 
Sec. 1105.6 (a) or (b), or an action in Sec. 1105.6(c) that will result 
in the lease, transfer, or sale of a railroad's line, sites or 
structures, must submit (with its application, petition or notice) the 
Historic Report described in paragraph (d) of this section, unless 
excepted under paragraph (b) of this section. This report should be 
combined with the Environmental Report where one is required. The 
purpose of the Historic Report is to provide the Commission with 
sufficient information to conduct the consultation process required by 
the National Historic Preservation Act.
    (b) Exceptions. The following proposals do not require an historic 
report:
    (1) A sale, lease or transfer of a rail line for the purpose of 
continued rail operations where further ICC approval is required to 
abandon any service and there are no plans to dispose of or alter 
properties subject to ICC jurisdiction that are 50 years old or older.
    (2) A sale, lease, or transfer of property between corporate 
affiliates where there will be no significant change in operations.
    (3) Trackage rights, common use of rail terminals, common control 
through stock ownership or similar action which will not substantially 
change the level of maintenance of railroad property.
    (4) A rulemaking, policy statement, petition for declaratory order, 
petition for waiver of procedural requirements, or proceeding involving 
transportation rates or classifications.
    (c) Distribution. The applicant must send the Historic Report to the 
appropriate State Historic Preservation Officer(s), preferably at least 
60 days in advance of filing the application, petition, or notice, but, 
at the latest, with the filing.
    (d) Content. The Historic Report should contain the information 
required by Sec. 1105.7(e)(1) and the following additional historic 
information:
    (1) A U.S.G.S. topographic map (or an alternate map drawn to scale 
and sufficiently detailed to show buildings and other structures in the 
vicinity of the proposed action) showing the location of the proposed 
action, and the locations and approximate dimensions of railroad 
structures that are 50 years old or older and are part of the proposed 
action;
    (2) A written description of the right-of-way (including approximate 
widths, to the extent known), and the topography and urban and/or rural 
characteristics of the surrounding area;
    (3) Good quality photographs (actual photographic prints, not 
photocopies) of railroad structures on the property that are 50 years 
old or older and of the immediately surrounding area;
    (4) The date(s) of construction of the structure(s), and the date(s) 
and extent of any major alterations, to the extent such information is 
known;

[[Page 187]]

    (5) A brief narrative history of carrier operations in the area, and 
an explanation of what, if any, changes are contemplated as a result of 
the proposed action;
    (6) A brief summary of documents in the carrier's possession, such 
as engineering drawings, that might be useful in documenting a structure 
that is found to be historic;
    (7) An opinion (based on readily available information in the 
railroad's possession) as to whether the site and/or structures meet the 
criteria for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (36 CFR 
60.4), and whether there is a likelihood of archeological resources or 
any other previously unknown historic properties in the project area, 
and the basis for these opinions (including any consultations with the 
State Historic Preservation Office, local historical societies or 
universities);
    (8) A description (based on readily available information in the 
railroad's possession) of any known prior subsurface ground disturbance 
or fill, environmental conditions (naturally occurring or manmade) that 
might affect the archeological recovery of resources (such as swampy 
conditions or the presence of toxic wastes), and the surrounding 
terrain.
    (9) Within 30 days of receipt of the historic report, the State 
Historic Preservation Officer may request the following additional 
information regarding specified nonrailroad owned properties or groups 
of properties immediately adjacent to the railroad right-of-way: 
photographs of specified properties that can be readily seen from the 
railroad right-of-way (or other public rights-of-way adjacent to the 
property) and a written description of any previously discovered 
archeological sites, identifying the location and type of the site 
(i.e., prehistoric or native American).
    (e) Any of these requirements may be waived or modified when the 
information is not necessary to determine the presence of historic 
properties and the effect of the proposed action on them.
    (f) Historic preservation conditions imposed by the Commission in 
rail abandonment cases generally will not extend beyond the 330-day 
statutory time period in 49 U.S.C. 10904 for abandonment proceedings.


<R05>
Sec. 1105.9  Coastal Zone Management Act requirements.

    (a) If the proposed action affects land or water uses within a State 
coastal zone designated pursuant to the Coastal Zone Management Act (16 
U.S.C. 1451 et seq.) applicant must comply with the following 
procedures:
    (1) If the proposed action is listed as subject to review in the 
State's coastal zone management plan, applicant (with, or prior to its 
filing) must certify (pursuant to 15 CFR 930.57 and 930.58) that the 
proposed action is consistent with the coastal zone management plan.
    (2) If the activity is not listed, applicant (with, or prior to its 
filing) must certify that actual notice of the proposal was given to the 
State coastal zone manager at least 40 days before the effective date of 
the requested action.
    (b) If there is consistency review under 15 CFR 930.54, the 
Commission and the applicant will comply with the consistency 
certification procedures of 15 CFR 930. Also, the Commission will 
withhold a decision, stay the effective date of a decision, or impose a 
condition delaying consummation of the action, until the applicant has 
submitted a consistency certification and either the state has concurred 
in the consistency certification, or an appeal to the Secretary of 
Commerce (under 15 CFR 930.64(e)) is successful.


<R05>
Sec. 1105.10  Commission procedures.

    (a) Environmental Impact Statements. (1) Prefiling Notice. Where an 
environmental impact statement is required or contemplated, the 
prospective applicant must provide the Section of Energy and Environment 
with written notice of its forthcoming proposal at least 6 months prior 
to filing its application.
    (2) Notice and Scope of EIS. When an Environmental Impact Statement 
is prepared for a proposed action, the Commission will publish in the 
Federal Register a notice of its intent to prepare an EIS, with a 
description of the proposed action and a request for written comments on 
the scope of the

[[Page 188]]

EIS. Where appropriate, the scoping process may include a meeting open 
to interested parties and the public. After considering the comments, 
the Commission will publish a notice of the final scope of the EIS. If 
the Environmental Impact Statement is to be prepared in cooperation with 
other agencies, this notice will also indicate which agencies will be 
responsible for the various parts of the Statement.
    (3) Notice of Availability. The Commission will serve copies of both 
the draft Environmental Impact Statement (or an appropriate summary) and 
the full final Environmental Impact Statement (or an appropriate 
summary) on all parties to the proceeding and on appropriate Federal, 
State, and local agencies. A notice that these documents are available 
to the public will be published (normally by the Environmental 
Protection Agency) in the Federal Register. (Interested persons may 
obtain copies of the documents by contacting the Section of Energy and 
Environment.)
    (4) Comments. The notice of availability of the draft Environmental 
Impact Statement will establish the time for submitting written 
comments, which will normally be 45 days following service of the 
document. When the Commission decides to hold an oral hearing on the 
merits of a proposal, the draft Environmental Impact Statement will be 
made available to the public in advance, normally at least 15 days prior 
to the portion of the hearing relating to the environmental issues. The 
draft EIS will discuss relevant environmental and historic preservation 
issues. The final Environmental Impact Statement will discuss the 
comments received and any changes made in response to them.
    (5) Supplements. An Environmental Impact Statement may be 
supplemented where necessary and appropriate to address substantial 
changes in the proposed action or significant new and relevant 
circumstances or information. If so, the notice and comment procedures 
outlined above will be followed to the extent practical.
    (b) Environmental Assessments. In preparing an Environmental 
Assessment, the Section of Energy and Environment will verify and 
independently analyze the Environmental Report and/or Historic Report 
and related material submitted by an applicant pursuant to sections 
1105.7 and 1105.8. The Environmental Assessment will discuss relevant 
environmental and historic preservation issues. SEE will serve copies of 
the Environmental Assessment on all parties to the proceeding and 
appropriate federal, state, and local agencies, and will announce its 
availability to the public through a notice in the Federal Register. In 
the case of abandonment applications processed under 49 U.S.C. 10903, 
the availability of the Environmental Assessment must be announced in 
the applicant's Notice of Intent filed under 49 CFR 1152.21. The 
deadline for submission of comments on the Environmental Assessment will 
generally be within 30 days of its service (15 days in the case of a 
notice of abandonment under 49 CFR 1152.50). The comments received will 
be addressed in the Commission's decision. A supplemental Environmental 
Assessment may be issued where appropriate.
    (c) Waivers. (1) The provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(4) of 
this section or any ICC-established time frames in paragraph (b) of this 
section may be waived or modified where appropriate.
    (2) Requests for waiver of Sec. 1105.10(a)(1) must describe as 
completely as possible the anticipated environmental effects of the 
proposed action, and the timing of the proposed action, and show that 
all or part of the six month lead period is not appropriate.
    (d) Third-Party Consultants. Applicants may utilize independent 
third-party consultants to prepare any necessary environmental 
documentation, if approved by SEE. The environmental reporting 
requirements that would otherwise apply will be waived if a railroad 
hires a consultant, SEE approves the scope of the consultant's work, and 
the consultant works under SEE's supervision. In such a case, the 
consultant acts on behalf of the Commission, working under SEE's 
direction to collect the needed environmental information and compile it 
into a draft EA or draft EIS, which is then submitted to SEE for its 
review, verification, and

[[Page 189]]

approval. We encourage the use of third-party consultants.
    (e) Service of Environmental Pleadings. Agencies and interested 
parties sending material on environmental and historic preservation 
issues directly to the Commission should send copies to the applicant. 
Copies of Commission communications to third-parties involving 
environmental and historic preservation issues also will be sent to the 
applicant where appropriate.
    (f) Consideration in Decisionmaking. The environmental documentation 
(generally an EA or an EIS) and the comments and responses thereto 
concerning environmental, historic preservation, CZMA, and endangered 
species issues will be part of the record considered by the Commission 
in the proceeding involved. The Commission will decide what, if any, 
environmental or historic preservation conditions to impose upon the 
authority it issues based on the environmental record and its 
substantive responsibilities under the Interstate Commerce Act. The 
Commission will withhold a decision, stay the effective date of an 
exemption, or impose appropriate conditions upon any authority granted, 
when an environmental or historic preservation issue has not yet been 
resolved.
    (g) Finding of No Significant Impact. In all exemption cases, if no 
environmental or historic preservation issues are raised by any party or 
identified by SEE in its independent investigation, the Commission will 
issue a separate decision making a Finding of No Significant Impact 
(``FONSI'') to show that it has formally considered the environmental 
record.

Sec. 1109.1  Invoking ADR in Commission proceedings.

    Any proceeding may be held in abeyance for 90 days while 
administrative dispute resolution (ADR) procedures (such as arbitration 
and mediation) are pursued. (Additional 90 day periods can be 
requested.) The period while any proceeding is held in abeyance to 
facilitate ADR will not be counted towards the statutory deadlines. All 
parties are required to indicate their written consent for ADR 
treatment. Requests that a proceeding be held in abeyance while ADR 
procedures are pursued should be submitted to the Office of the 
Secretary. The Secretary shall promptly issue an order in response to 
such requests. Unless arbitration or some other binding process 
involving a neutral has been undertaken, any party believing that ADR 
procedures are not yielding the intended results shall inform the 
Secretary and all parties in writing, and normal agency procedures will 
be reactivated by the Secretary by notice served on all the parties.


<R05>
Sec. 1109.2  Appeals from arbitration decisions.

    Appeals are limited to clear errors of general transportation 
importance, and not issues of causation or fact. Arbitration awards can 
be challenged on the basis that they do not take their essence from the 
Interstate Commerce Act, or are not limited to the matters the parties 
have referred for arbitration. Appeals are limited to 10 typewritten 
pages. Parties will have 20 days from the service date of the decision 
to file, and opposing parties 20 days to answer. Arbitration decisions 
will become effective in 30 days unless a party seeks a stay of the 
decision within 10 days of its issuance, and we grant the stay. Appeals 
and stay petitions should be limited to extraordinary circumstances.

Commission, adopted under the procedures of section 553 of title 5 of 
the United States Code (the Administrative Procedure Act).


<R05>
Sec. 1110.2  Opening of proceeding.

    (a) The Commission may open a rulemaking proceeding on its own 
motion.

[[Page 192]]

In doing so, it may consider the recommendations of other agencies of 
the United States and of other persons.
    (b) Any person may petition the Commission to issue, amend, or 
repeal a rule.
    (c) Each petition seeking the institution of a proceeding, filed 
under this section must:
    (1) Be submitted, along with 15 copies if possible, to the 
Secretary, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423;
    (2) Set forth the text or substance of the rule or amendment 
proposed or specify the rule that the petitioner wants to have repealed 
or modified;
    (3) Explain the interest of the petitioner in the action requested; 
and
    (4) Contain any information and arguments available to the 
petitioner to support the action sought and may detail any 
environmental, energy, or small business considerations.
    (d) In rail cases, the Commission will grant or deny a petition 
within 120 days of its receipt.
    (e) If the Commission determines that a petition contains adequate 
justification, it will open a rulemaking proceeding pursuant to 
Sec. 1110.3 and will notify the petitioner of its action.
    (f) If the Commission determines that the petition does not contain 
adequate justification for opening a rulemaking proceeding, the petition 
will be denied, with a brief statement of the grounds for denial, and 
the petitioner will be notified of the Commission's action.
    (g) If a petition under this section concerning a common carrier by 
railroad is granted, the Commission will proceed as soon as it is 
practicable. If the petition is denied, the Commission will publish a 
statement of the reasons for the denial in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 1110.3  Publication of notices.

    (a) Interpretive rules, general statements of policy, and rules 
relating to organization, procedure, or practice may be issued as final 
without notice or other public rulemaking proceedings.
    (b) General rulemaking proceedings will be opened by the issuance of 
either a notice of intent to institute a rulemaking proceeding, an 
advance notice of proposed rulemaking, or a notice of proposed rules. 
The Commission will publish the notice in the Federal Register, and it 
will invite the public to participate in the rulemaking proceeding. No 
notice will be issued when the Commission finds for good cause, that 
notice is impractical or unnecessary or contrary to the public interest.
    (c) Notices of proposed rulemakings will include:
    (1) The proposed rules, if prepared;
    (2) A discussion of why the rulemakings are needed and what they are 
intended to accomplish;
    (3) Identification of significant dates in the proceedings, such as 
dates by which comments must be filed or on which the rules are proposed 
to take effect;
    (4) Any relevant addresses;
    (5) The name and phone number of an individual within the Commission 
who can provide further information concerning the proceedings;
    (6) Any supplementary information required; and
    (7) Reference to the legal authority under which the rules are 
proposed.
    (d) In addition to being published in the Federal Register, notices 
of proposed rulemaking and subsequent notices and decisions in 
rulemaking proceedings, will be served on the parties and made available 
to the public through the Office of the Secretary. To the extent 
possible, the date of service will be the same as the date of 
publication in the Federal Register. When the service and publication 
dates are not the same, the date of publication in the Federal Register 
is controlling for the purpose of determining time periods set by these 
procedures or by notices issued in individual proceedings.


<R05>
Sec. 1110.4  Participation.

    Any person may participate in rulemaking proceedings by submitting 
written information or views. In addition, the Commission may invite 
persons to present oral arguments, participate in informal conferences, 
appear at informal fact-finding hearings, or participate in any other 
proceedings. Information contained in written submissions will be given 
the same consideration.

[[Page 193]]


<R05>
Sec. 1110.5  Consideration of comments received.

    All timely comments will be considered before final action is taken 
on a rulemaking proposal. Comments which are filed late will be 
considered so far as possible without incurring additional expense, 
delay, or prejudice to other parties.


<R05>
Sec. 1110.6  Petitions for extension of time to comment.

    (a) Any person may petition the Commission for an extension of time 
to submit comments in response to a notice of proposed rulemaking. The 
petition and one copy must be submitted at least 10 days prior to the 
deadline for filing comments. The filing of the petition does not 
automatically extend the time for the filing of petitioner's comments.
    (b) The Commission will grant the petition only if the petitioner 
shows a substantive interest in the proposed rule and good cause for the 
extension, and if the extension is in the public interest. If an 
extension is granted, notice of it will be published in the Federal 
Register, and it will apply to all persons.


<R05>
Sec. 1110.7  Availability of dockets.

    Dockets of pending rulemaking proceedings are maintained in the

<R05>
Sec. 1111.1  Content of formal complaints; joinder.

    (a) General. A formal complaint must contain the correct, 
unabbreviated names and addresses of each complainant and defendant. It 
should set forth briefly and in plain language the facts upon which it 
is based. It should include specific reference to pertinent statutory 
provisions and Commission regulations, and should advise the Commission 
and the defendant fully in what respects these provisions or regulations 
have been violated. The complaint should contain a detailed statement of 
the relief requested. Relief in the alternative or of several different 
types may be demanded, but the issue raised in the formal complaint 
should not be broader than those to which complainant's evidence is to 
be directed at the hearing.
    (b) Requests for Oral Hearing. A formal complaint should include a 
request that the proceeding be handled either under the modified 
procedure or at oral hearing, and a request for oral hearing

[[Page 194]]

should detail why oral hearing is required and should include at least 
two alternative hearing sites.
    (c) Multiple causes of action. Two or more grounds of complaint 
concerning the same principle, subject, or statement of facts may be 
included in one complaint, but should be stated and numbered separately.
    (d) Joinder. Two or more complainants may join in one complaint 
against one or more defendants if their respective causes of action 
concern substantially the same alleged violations and like facts.


<R05>
Sec. 1111.2  Amended and supplemental complaints.

    An amended or supplemental complaint may be tendered for filing by a 
complainant against a defendant or defendants named in the original 
complaint, stating a cause of action alleged to have accrued within the 
statutory period immediately preceding the date of such tender, in favor 
of complainant and against the defendant or defendants. The time limits 
for responding to an amended or supplemental complaint are computed 
pursuant to Secs. 1111.4 and 1111.5, as if the amended or supplemental 
complaint was an original complaint.


<R05>
Sec. 1111.3  Copies; service.

    Formal complaints, amended or supplemental complaints, and cross 
complaints will be served by the Commission. The original of each formal 
complaint, or cross complaint must be accompanied by a sufficient number 
of copies to enable the Commission to serve one upon each defendant and 
to retain 10 copies in addition to the original.

[47 FR 49557, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 53 FR 19301, May 27, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 1111.4  Answers and cross complaints.

    (a) Generally. An answer may be filed within the time provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section. Whether or not an answer is filed and 
served, the issue is joined at the conclusion of the time for filing 
answers, and the Commission may then proceed to a decision. In the 
alternative, the Commission may provide for the taking of evidence under 
the modified or oral hearing procedures, and in such a case the failure 
to answer a complaint will not bar a party from further participation in 
a proceeding or from the presentation of its evidence. An answer should 
be responsive to the complaint and should fully advise the Commission 
and the parties of the nature of the defense.
    (b) Time for filing; copies; service. An answer must be filed within 
20 days after the service of the complaint or within such additional 
time as the Commission may provide. The original and 10 copies of an 
answer must be filed with the Commission. The defendant must serve 
copies of the answer upon the complaint and any other defendants.
    (c) Cross complaints. A cross complaint alleging violations by other 
parties to the proceeding or seeking relief against them may be filed 
with the answer. An answer to a cross complaint may be filed within 20 
days after the service date of the cross complaint. The party shall 
serve copies of answer to a cross complaint upon the other parties.

[47 FR 49557, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 53 FR 19301, May 27, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 1111.5  Motions to dismiss or to make more definite.

    An answer to a complaint or cross complaint may be accompanied by a 
motion to dismiss the complaint or cross complaint or a motion to make 
the complaint or cross complaint more definite. A motion to dismiss can 
be filed at anytime during a proceeding. A complainant or cross 
complainant may, within 10 days after an answer is filed, file a motion 
to make the answer more definite. Any motion to make more definite must 
specify the defects in the particular pleading and must describe fully 
the additional information or details thought to be necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 1111.6  Satisfaction of complaint.

    If a defendant satisfies a formal complaint, either before or after 
answering, a statement to that effect signed by the complainant must be 
filed (original only need be filed), setting forth when and how the 
complaint has been satisfied.

[[Page 195]]


<R05>
Sec. 1111.7  Investigations on the Commission's own motion.

    (a) Service of decision. A decision instituting an investigation on 
the Commission's own motion will be served by the Commission upon 
respondents.
    (b) Default. If within the time period stated in the decision 
instituting an investigation, a respondent fails to comply with any 
requirement specified in the decision, the respondent will be deemed in 
default and to have waived any further proceedings, and the 
investigation may be decided forthwith.

<R05>
Sec. 1112.1  When modified procedure is used.

    The Commission may decide that a proceeding be heard under modified 
procedure when it appears that substantially all material issues of fact 
can be resolved through submission of written statements, and efficient 
disposition of the proceeding can be accomplished without oral 
testimony. Modified procedure may be ordered on the Commission's 
initiative, or upon approval of a request by any party.


<R05>
Sec. 1112.2  Decisions directing modified procedure.

    A decision directing that modified procedure be used will set out 
the schedule for filing verified statements by all parties and will list 
the names and addresses of all persons who at that time are on the 
service list in the proceeding. In this part, a statement responding to 
an opening statement is referred to as a ``reply'', and a statement 
responding to a reply is referred to as a ``rebuttal''. Replies to 
rebuttal material are not permitted.


<R05>
Sec. 1112.3  Default for failure to comply with schedule; effect of default.

    If a party fails to comply with the schedule for submission of 
verified statements, or any other requirements established by the 
modified procedure decision, that party will be deemed to be in default 
and to have waived any further participation in the proceeding. 
Thereafter, the proceeding may be disposed of without notice to and 
without participation by parties in default.


<R05>
Sec. 1112.4  Petitions to intervene.

    (a) The Commission may grant a petition to intervene in a proceeding 
set for modified procedure if intervention:
    (1) Will not unduly disrupt the schedule for filing verified 
statements, except for good cause shown; and
    (2) Would not unduly broaden the issues raised in the proceeding.
    (b) The petition to intervene shall set out:
    (1) The petitioner's interest in the proceeding;
    (2) Whether the petitioner supports or opposes the relief sought or 
the action proposed or is otherwise concerned with the issues presented 
in the proceeding; and
    (3) The petitioner's request, if any, for relief.
    (c) Petitions to intervene are not required in investigation 
proceedings under the modified procedure involving rate-related matters, 
provided that the substantive requirements of (a) and (b) are met.


<R05>
Sec. 1112.5  Joint pleadings.

    Parties with common interests are encouraged to prepare joint 
pleadings whenever possible.


<R05>
Sec. 1112.6  Verified statements; contents.

    A verified statement should contain all the facts upon which the 
witness relies, and to the extent that it contains arguments, they 
should be based only on those facts. Parties filing reply and

[[Page 196]]

rebuttal verified statements will be considered to have admitted the 
truth of material allegations of fact contained in their opponents' 
statements unless those allegations are specifically challenged. 
Rebuttal statements shall be confined to issues raised in the reply 
statements to which they are directed.


<R05>
Sec. 1112.7  Records in other Commission proceedings.

    If any portion of the record before the Commission in any proceeding 
other than the proceeding at issue is offered in evidence, a true copy 
should be presented for the record.


<R05>
Sec. 1112.8  Verification.

    The original of any pleading filed must show the signature, 
capacity, and seal, if any, of the person administering the oath, and 
the date thereof.

<R05>
Sec. 1112.10  Requests for oral hearings and cross examination.

    (a) Requests. Requests for oral hearings in matters originally 
assigned for handling under modified procedure should be included in the 
reply or rebuttal statement. The reasons why the matter cannot be 
properly resolved under modified procedure must be set out in full. 
Requests for cross examination of witnesses must include the name of the 
witness and the subject matter of the desired cross examination.
    (b) Disposition. Unless material facts are in dispute, oral hearings 
will not be held. If held, oral hearings will normally be confined to 
material issues upon which the parties disagree. The decision setting a 
matter for oral hearing will define the scope of the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 1112.11  Authority of officers.

    Except to the extent that they apply only to the conduct of a public 
hearing, the officer assigned to handle a proceeding under the modified 
procedure shall have the same authority as officers assigned to conduct 
oral hearings as described in Sec. 1113.3(a) and (b).

Sec. 1113.2  Subpoenas.

    (a) Issuance. A subpoena may be issued upon the direction of the 
Commission on its own motion or upon request. A subpoena may be issued 
by the Commission or by the officer presiding at a hearing and must be 
signed by the Secretary or a member of the Commission.
    (b) Requests. (1) A request for a subpoena to compel the appearance 
of a person at a hearing to give oral testimony, but not to produce 
documents, may be made either by letter (only the original need be filed 
with the Commission) or orally upon the record at the hearing. A showing 
of general relevance and reasonable scope of the evidence sought to be 
introduced through the subpoenaed person may be required.
    (2) A request for a subpoena to compel a witness to produce 
documentary evidence should be made in writing by petition. The petition 
should specify with particularity the books, papers, or documents 
desired and facts expected to be proved, and should show the general 
relevance and reasonable scope of the evidence sought. The officer 
presiding at a hearing may grant a request for such a subpoena made 
orally upon the record.
    (c) Service. The original subpoena should be exhibited to the person 
served, should be read to him if he is unable to read, and a copy should 
be delivered to him by the officer or person making service.
    (d) Return. If service of subpoena is made by a United States 
marshal or his deputy, service should be evidenced by his return on the 
subpoena. If made by any other person, such person shall make an 
affidavit stating the date, time and manner of service; and return such 
affidavit on, or with, the original subpoena in accordance with the form 
thereon. In case of failure to make service the reasons for the failure 
should be stated on the original subpoena. The written acceptance of 
service of a subpoena by the person subpoenaed will be sufficient 
without other evidence of return. The original subpoena bearing or 
accompanied by the required return, affidavit, statement, or acceptance 
of service, should be returned forthwith to the Secretary of the 
Commission, unless otherwise directed.
    (e) Witness fees. A witness who is summoned and responds to the 
summons is entitled to the same fee as is paid for like service in the 
courts of the United States. Such fee is to be paid by the party at 
whose instance the testimony is taken at the time the subpoena is 
served, except that when the subpoena is issued on behalf of the United 
States or an officer or agency thereof, fees and mileage need not be 
tendered at the time of service.


<R05>
Sec. 1113.3  Authority of officers.

    (a) General. (1) The presiding officer has the authority to regulate 
the procedure in the hearing before him, and has authority to take all 
measures necessary or proper for the efficient performance of the duties 
assigned him. These include authority: (i) To hold hearings; (ii) to 
administer oaths and affirmations; (iii) to grant intervention; (iv) to 
accept any pleading; (v) to establish special rules of procedure 
appropriate to the effective handling of the particular proceeding; (vi) 
to examine witnesses; (vii) to issue subpoenas at the hearing; (viii) to 
dispose of requests for discovery; (ix) to hold conferences for the 
settlement and simplification of issues; (x) to rule on motions and 
dispose of procedural requests; (xi) to make initial decisions; (xii) to 
exclude any person from the hearing for contemptuous conduct; and (xiii) 
to take any other action authorized by this part, by the Administrative 
Procedure Act, or by the Interstate Commerce Act and related acts.
    (2) The presiding officer has the authority: (i) To terminate 
examination

[[Page 198]]

or cross-examination of repetitious or cumulative nature; (ii) to limit 
direct examination to material matters; (iii) to limit cross-examination 
to disputed material facts; (iv) to require that principal examination 
or cross-examination be conducted by one or more counsel representing 
similar interests in proceedings where several parties are involved; (v) 
to set reasonable schedules for the presentation of witnesses; (vi) and 
to set reasonable time limits for the examination or cross-examination 
of witnesses. In order to enforce this paragraph, the officer may 
require a clear statement on the record of the nature of the testimony 
to be given by any witness.
    (b) Motions to dismiss; amendments. (1) The presiding officer shall 
have power to decide any motion to dismiss the proceeding or other 
motion which involves final determination of the merits of the 
proceeding.
    (2) The presiding officer may grant leave to amend any application 
or complaint except where the tendered amendment would result in such a 
change in the geographical scope of the proceeding that it would have to 
be reassigned from an administrative law judge to a joint board, or vice 
versa.
    (c) Preparation of the decision by the prevailing party. Any 
proceeding in which an oral hearing is held and in which the officer is 
able to announce his decision either:
    (1) On the record after the close of the taking of testimony and the 
hearing of arguments by the officer, or
    (2) By appropriate notification to the parties after the close of 
hearing, may be made the subject of an initial decision prepared by a 
party or parties in whose favor the officer decides, within a period 
specified by the officer, and subject to such changes as the officer 
considers appropriate in the draft prepared for him.
    (d) Recording; media coverage. The presiding officer shall have 
authority to permit or to refuse to permit the recording of the hearing 
by means of live or delayed television or radio broadcast, or the use of 
a tape recorder or other electronic or photographic equipment by any 
person other than the official reporter.


<R05>
Sec. 1113.4  Prehearing conferences.

    (a) Purposes. Upon written notice by the Commission in any 
proceeding, or upon written or oral instruction of an officer, parties 
or their representatives may be directed to appear before an officer at 
a specified time and place for a conference, prior to or during the 
course of a hearing, or in lieu of personally appearing, to submit 
suggestions in writing, for the purpose of formulating issues and 
considering:
    (1) The simplification of issues;
    (2) The necessity or desirability of amending the pleadings either 
for the purpose of clarification, amplification, or limitation;
    (3) The possibility of making admissions of certain averments of 
fact or stipulations concerning the use by any or all parties of matters 
of public record, such as annual reports and the like, to avoid the 
unnecessary introduction of proof;
    (4) The procedure at the hearing;
    (5) The limitation of the number of witnesses;
    (6) The propriety of prior mutual exchange between or among the 
parties of prepared testimony and exhibits; and
    (7) Such other matters, including disposition of requests for 
discovery, as may aid in the simplification of the evidence and 
disposition of the proceeding. Parties may request a prehearing 
conference.
    (b) Facts disclosed privileged. Facts disclosed in the course of the 
prehearing conference are privileged and, except by agreement, will not 
be used against participating parties either before the Commission or 
elsewhere unless fully corroborated by other evidence.
    (c) Recordation and decision. Action taken at the conference, 
including a recitation of the amendments allowed to the pleadings, the 
agreements made by the parties as to any of the matters considered, and 
defining the issues, will be recorded in an appropriate decision unless 
the parties enter into a written stipulation as to such matters, or 
agree to a statement thereof made on the record by the officer.
    (d) Objection to the decision; subsequent proceedings. If a decision 
is entered, the parties may, within 20 days of the date

[[Page 199]]

of service, or within such lesser time as is set by the officer, present 
objections on the grounds that the decision does not fully or correctly 
embody the agreements reached at the conference. Thereafter the terms of 
the written stipulation or statement of the officer, as the case may be, 
will determine the subsequent course of the proceedings, unless modified 
to prevent manifest injustice.


<R05>
Sec. 1113.5  Stipulations.

    Apart from the procedure contemplated by the prehearing provisions, 
the parties may, by stipulation in writing filed with the Commission at 
any stage of the proceeding, or orally made at the hearing, agree upon 
any pertinent facts in the proceeding. The parties should agree to facts 
in this manner whenever practicable.


<R05>
Sec. 1113.6  Appearances; withdrawal or absence from hearing.

    (a) Who may appear. Any individual may appear for himself. Any 
member of a partnership which is a party to any proceeding may appear 
for such partnerships upon adequate identification. A bona fide officer 
or a full-time employee of a corporation, association, or of an 
individual may appear for such corporation, association, or individual 
by permission of the officer presiding at the hearing. A party also may 
be represented by a practitioner.
    (b) Withdrawal or absence from hearing. A practitioner who has 
entered his appearance at the hearing shall not be permitted to withdraw 
from the hearing, or willfully be absent therefrom, except for good 
cause and, wherever practicable, only with the permission of the 
presiding officer. If a person who has entered an appearance withdraws 
from the hearing in a manner other than that specified, the Commission 
or the Officer may take such action as, in the interest of justice and 
the protection of the lawful rights of all parties to the proceeding, 
the circumstances of the case may warrant, including the striking out of 
all or any part of any pleading of the offending party, and including 
the possible dismissal of the action or proceeding, or any part thereof, 
the entry of an order of default against that party, or if the 
withdrawal is without the permission of the presiding officer, 
disciplining of the practitioner concerned.


<R05>
Sec. 1113.7  Intervention; petitions.

    (a) How requested. Intervention will normally be granted only upon 
petition. In exceptional circumstances, where the issues would not be 
broadened or the proceeding delayed, an officer may, at his or her 
discretion, allow intervention upon motion made orally at the hearing.
    (b) Content generally. A petition for leave to intervene must set 
forth the grounds for the proposed intervention, the position and 
interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and whether petitioner's 
position is in support of or in opposition to the relief sought. If the 
proceeding is by formal complaint and affirmative relief is sought by 
petitioner, the petition should conform to the requirements for a formal 
complaint.
    (c) When filed. A petition for leave to intervene in any proceeding 
should be filed prior to or at the time the proceeding is called for 
hearing, but not after, except for good cause shown.
    (d) Broadening issues; filing. If the petition seeks a broadening of 
the issues and shows that they would not thereby be unduly broadened, 
and in respect thereof seeks affirmative relief, the petition should be 
filed in time to permit service upon and answer by the parties in 
advance of the hearing.
    (e) Copies; service; replies. When a petition for leave to intervene 
is tendered at the hearing, sufficient copies of the petition must be 
provided for distribution to the parties represented at the hearing. If 
leave is granted at the hearing, 10 copies of the petition must be 
furnished for the use of the Commission. When a petition for leave to 
intervene is not tendered at the hearing, the original and 10 copies of 
the petition should be submitted to the Commission together with a 
certificate that service has been made by petitioner. Any reply in 
opposition to a petition for leave to intervene not tendered at the 
hearing must be filed within 20 days after service of the petition to 
intervene. At the discretion of the Commission leave to

[[Page 200]]

intervene may be granted or denied before the expiration of the time 
allowed for replies.
    (f) Disposition. Leave to intervene will be granted only when the 
petitioner addresses issues reasonably pertinent to the issues already 
presented and which do not unduly broaden them. If leave is granted the 
petitioner becomes an intervener and a party to the proceeding.

[47 FR 49559, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 53 FR 19301, May 27, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 1113.8  Witness examination; order of procedure.

    Witnesses will be orally examined under oath before the officer 
unless the facts are presented to the Commission in the manner provided 
under modified procedure. In formal complaint, application, and 
investigation proceedings, complainant, applicant, and respondent, 
respectively, shall open and close at the hearing. In the event of 
further hearings granted on petition, the petitioners requesting further 
hearing shall open and close the proceeding. Instances exist in which 
parties other than the respondent may open and close in investigations 
where the burden of proof is not upon the respondent. Interveners shall 
follow the party in whose behalf the intervention is made. The foregoing 
order of presentation may be varied by the officer.


<R05>
Sec. 1113.9  Prepared statements.

    With the approval of the officer, a witness may read into the 
record, as his testimony, statements of fact or expressions of opinion 
prepared by the witness, or written answers to interrogatories of 
counsel. A prepared statement of a witness who is present at the hearing 
may be received as an exhibit, provided that the statement does not 
include argument. Before any such statement is read or admitted in 
evidence, the witness shall deliver to the officer, the reporter, and to 
opposing counsel, as may be directed by the officer, a copy of such 
statement or of such interrogatories and the written answers thereto. 
The admissibility of the evidence contained in such statement will be 
subject to the same rules as if such testimony was produced orally, 
including the right of cross-examination of the witness. The officer may 
require that the witness testify orally if, in the officer's opinion, 
the memory or demeanor of the witness may be of importance.


<R05>
Sec. 1113.10  Records in other Commission proceedings.

    A portion of the record before the Commission in another proceeding 
may be offered in evidence at an oral hearing. A party making such an 
offer must provide, as an exhibit, a certified copy of the material 
sought to be introduced. A hearing officer may waive the requirement 
that a copy be provided, subject to such conditions as he or she may 
impose to assure that a copy will be available later, if needed, at no 
expense to the Commission and to assure that the interests of other 
parties are not prejudiced. An offer of evidence under this section will 
be subject to objection by other parties.


<R05>
Sec. 1113.11  Abstracts of documents.

    When documents, such as freight bills or bills of lading, are 
numerous, the officer may refuse to receive all the documents and in 
evidence instead admit only a limited number of representative 
documents. He may instruct, if the proffer be for the purpose of proving 
damage, that introduction be deferred until there is opportunity to 
comply with Sec. 1133.2. If the proffer be for another purpose the 
officer may require the party in orderly fashion to abstract the 
relevant data from the documents, affording other parties reasonable 
opportunity to examine both the documents and the abstract, and 
thereupon offer such abstract in evidence in exhibit form.


<R05>
Sec. 1113.12  Exhibits.

    (a) Copies. Unless the officer otherwise directs, the original and 
10 copies of each exhibit of a documentary character should be furnished 
for the use of the Commission. The original will be delivered to the 
reporter, and the copy to the officer. If the hearing is before a board, 
a copy of the exhibit should be furnished to each member of the board, 
unless the board otherwise directs. Unless the officer for cause directs 
otherwise, a reasonable number of copies

[[Page 201]]

should be furnished to counsel in attendance at the hearing.
    (b) Interchange prior to hearing. Whenever practicable, the parties 
should interchange copies of exhibits or other pertinent material or 
matter before or at the commencement of the hearing; and the Commission 
or presiding officer may so direct.
    (c) When excluded how treated. When exhibit has been identified, 
objected to, and excluded, the officer will develop whether the party 
offering the exhibit withdraws the offer, and if so, permit the return 
of the exhibit to him. If the excluded exhibit is not withdrawn, it 
should be given an exhibit number for identification and be incorporated 
in the record. Exhibit numbers once used for identification will not be 
duplicated thereafter.

[47 FR 49559, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 53 FR 19301, May 27, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 1113.13  Filing evidence subsequent to hearing; copies.

    Except as provided in this section or as expressly may be permitted 
in a particular instance, the Commission will not receive in evidence or 
consider as part of the record any documents, letters, or other writings 
submitted for consideration in connection with any proceeding after 
close of the hearing, and may return any such documents to the sender. 
Before the close of a hearing the officer may, at the request of a party 
or upon his own motion, or upon agreement of the parties, require that a 
party furnish additional documentary evidence that supplements the 
existing record, within a stated period of time. Documentary evidence to 
be furnished in this way will be given an exhibit number at the time of 
filing and the parties advised accordingly. Unless otherwise directed by 
the officer, the original and 10 copies of such submission should be 
filed with the Commission.

[47 FR 49559, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 53 FR 19301, May 27, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 1113.14  Objections to rulings.

    It is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling is made or 
sought, make known to the officer on the record the action which he 
desires the officer to take or his objection to the action of the 
officer and his grounds for that objection. An objection not pressed in 
brief will be considered as waived. Where no brief is filed an objection 
will be considered as waived if not pressed in an appeal or reply to an 
appeal, if filed, or in a separate petition dealing only with that 
objection.


<R05>
Sec. 1113.15  Interlocutory appeals.

    Rulings of the presiding officer may be appealed prior to service of 
the initial decision only if:
    (a) The ruling denies or terminates any person's participation,
    (b) The ruling grants a request for the inspection of documents not 
ordinarily available for public inspection,
    (c) The ruling overrules an objection based on privilege, the result 
of which ruling is to require the presentation of testimony or 
documents, or
    (d) The presiding officer finds that the ruling may result in 
substantial irreparable harm, substantial detriment to the public 
interest, or undue prejudice to a party.


<R05>
Sec. 1113.16  Oral argument before the hearing officer.

    At the discretion of the hearing officer and upon reasonable notice 
to the parties, oral argument may be made at the close of testimony 
before him as an alternative to the filing of written briefs. Such 
argument, which should include requested findings and conclusions, will 
be recorded and made a part of the transcript of testimony, and will be 
available to the Commission for consideration in deciding the case. The 
making of such argument will not preclude oral argument before the 
Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 1113.17  Transcript of record.

    (a) Filing. After the close of the hearing, the complete transcript 
of the testimony taken and the exhibits shall be part of the record in 
the proceeding.
    (b) Corrections. A suggested correction in a transcript ordinarily 
will be considered only if offered not later than 20 days after the date 
each transcript is filed with the Commission. A copy of the letter 
(original only need be filed with the Commission) requesting the 
suggested corrections should be

[[Page 202]]

served upon all parties of record and with 2 copies to the official 
reporter.
    (c) Objections to corrections. Parties disagreeing with corrections 
suggested pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section should file written 
objections in the same manner as suggested corrections are to be filed. 
Objections to suggested corrections should be filed not later than 15 
days after the filing with the Commission of suggested corrections. If 
no objections are timely filed, the Secretary of the Commission shall 
make the suggested corrections to the transcript. If objections are 
timely filed, the officer who presided at the hearing shall determine 
the merits of the suggested correction and enter an appropriate decision 
in the proceeding.
    (d) No free copies. The Commission will not furnish free copies of 
the transcript to any party to any proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 1113.18  Briefs.

    (a) When filed. In a proceeding which has been the subject of oral 
hearing, and in which briefs are to be filed, that fact will be stated 
by the officer on the record. The officer shall fix the time for filing 
briefs. Simultaneous filing will normally be required, and reply briefs 
will not normally be permitted.
    (b) Evidence abstract. A brief filed after a hearing may contain an 
abstract of the evidence relied upon by the party filing it, preferably 
assembled by subjects, with reference to the pages of the record, if 
written, or exhibit where the evidence appears. In the event the party 
elects not to include a separate abstract in his brief, he should give 
specific reference to the portions of the record, whether transcript or 
otherwise, relied upon in support of the respective statements of fact 
made throughout the brief.
    (c) Requested findings. Each brief should include such requests for 
specific findings, separately stated and numbered, as the party desires 
the Commission to make.
    (d) Exhibit reproduction. Exhibits should not be reproduced in the 
brief, but may be shown, within reasonable limits, in an appendix to the 
brief. Analysis of such exhibits should be included in the brief where 
pertinent.


<R05>
Sec. 1113.19  Pleadings: part of the record.

    Matters of fact that are verified and filed prior to oral hearing 
and that are not specifically denied constitute evidence and are part of 
the record. A witness, who would present such evidence, must be made 
available for cross-examination if a request is reasonably made. This 
rule does not apply to protest against tariffs or schedules.
Secs. 1113.20--1113.30  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1113.31  Joint boards.

    (a) Organization. After a joint board has been established according 
to 49 U.S.C. 10342 et seq., it will select one of its members to act as 
chairman. If the person selected as chairman is absent from a meeting, 
the members attending shall select a temporary substitute chairman for 
that meeting.
    (b) Waiver of action by absence of a joint board. If a joint board 
member fails to participate in a hearing after notice of the hearing, 
the failure to participate acts as a waiver of action on the part of the 
State from which the member was appointed.
    (c) Procedural ruling by chairman in case of disagreement. If the 
members of a joint board or a majority of the board attending a hearing 
cannot agree upon the disposition of a procedural question arising at 
the hearing, the chairman, or acting chairman, shall decide the 
question.
    (d) Form of joint board's decision; service. The board's decision 
will conform as nearly as possible to the form of decisions issued by 
the Commission. The board's decision will be served by the Commission.
    (e) Termination of joint board jurisdiction and subsequent 
procedure. The jurisdiction of a joint board over a referred matter will 
terminate when the decision of the joint board is served by the 
Commission. Joint board jurisdiction also may be terminated by 
Commission decision, and it will terminate if:
    (1) The board's conclusions are submitted without a written 
decision;
    (2) Each state entitled to appoint a member waives action in writing 
from the appropriate state authority;
    (3) All of the members of the board fail to appear at the hearing;

[[Page 203]]

    (4) A majority of the board fails to agree on substantive matters; 
or
    (5) The board fails to act in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 10343(d)(2).

When jurisdiction of the joint board has been terminated without a 
decision by the board due to the reasons stated in paragraphs (e)(1) 
through (4) of this section, the Commission or a designated officer will 
enter a decision based upon the record, if any, made before the board or 
after further hearings, if required.

<R04>
                  Subpart A--General Rules of Evidence


<R05>
Sec. 1114.1  Admissibility.

    Any evidence which is sufficiently reliable and probative to support 
a decision under the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, or 
which would be admissible under the general statutes of the United 
States, or under the rules of evidence governing proceedings in matters 
not involving trial by jury in the courts of the United States, will be 
admissible in hearings before the Commission. The rules of evidence will 
be applied in any proceeding to the end that necessary and proper 
evidence will be conveniently, inexpensively, and speedily produced, 
while preserving the substantial rights of the parties.


<R05>
Sec. 1114.2  Official records.

    An official record or an entry therein, when admissible for any 
purpose, may be evidenced by an official publication thereof or by a 
copy attested by the officer having the legal custody of the record, or 
by a deputy, and accompanied with a certificate that such officer has 
the custody. If the office in which the record is kept is within the 
United States or within a territory or insular possession subject to the 
dominion of the United States, the certificate may be made by a judge of 
a court of record of the district or political subdivision in which the 
record is kept, authenticated by the seal of the court, or may be made 
by any public officer having a seal of office and having official duties 
in the district or political subdivision in which the record is kept, 
authenticated by the seal of his office. If the office in which the 
record is kept is in a foreign state or country, the certificate may be 
made by a secretary of embassy or legation, consul general, consul, vice 
consul, or consular agent or by officer in the foreign service of the 
United States stationed in the foreign state or country in which the 
record is kept, and authenticated by the seal of his office. A written 
statement signed by an officer having the custody of an official record 
or by his deputy that after diligent search no record or entry of a 
specified tenor is found to exist in the records of his office, 
accompanied by a certificate as above provided, is admissible as 
evidence that the records of this office contain no such record or 
entry. This section does not prevent the proof of official records or of 
entry or lack of entry therein or official notice thereof by a method 
authorized by any applicable statute or by the rules of evidence.

[[Page 204]]


<R05>
Sec. 1114.3  Admissibility of business records.

    Any writing or record, whether in the form of an entry in a book or 
otherwise, made as a memorandum or record of any act, transaction, 
occurrence, or event, will be admissible as evidence thereof if it 
appears that it was made in the regular course of business, and that it 
was the regular course of business to make such memorandum or record at 
the time such record was made, or within a reasonable time thereafter.


<R05>
Sec. 1114.4  Documents in Commission's files.

    If a party offers in evidence any matter contained in a report or 
other document open to public inspection in the files of the Commission, 
such report or other document need not be made available at the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 1114.5  Records in other Commission proceedings.

    If any portion of the record before the Commission in any proceeding 
other than the proceeding at issue is offered in evidence, a true copy 
will be presented for the record.


<R05>
Sec. 1114.6  Official notice of corroborative material.

    The Commission or a hearing officer may take notice of official 
records, records in other Commission proceedings, or other materials 
which are otherwise subject to specific rules governing admissibility 
regardless of compliance with the full technical provisions of such 
rules, where the admissibility of the evidence is for purposes of 
corroboration of testimony presented or to evaluate the credibility of 
testimony or allegations made in proceedings where the public interest 
is not otherwise adequately represented by counsel capable of fully 
complying with such rules.


<R05>
Sec. 1114.7  Exhibits.

    (a) Generally. Whenever practical the sheets of each exhibit and the 
lines of each sheet should be numbered. If the exhibit consists of five 
or more sheets, the first sheet or title-page should be confined to a 
brief statement of what the exhibit purports to show with reference by 
sheet and line to illustrative or typical examples contained therein. 
The exhibit should bear an identifying number, letter, or short title 
which will readily distinguish it from other exhibits offered by the 
same party. It is desirable that, whenever practicable, evidence should 
be condensed into tables. Whenever practicable, especially in 
proceedings in which it is likely that many documents will be offered, 
all the documents produced by a single witness should be assembled and 
bound together, suitably arranged and indexed, so that they may be 
identified and offered as one exhibit. Exhibits should not be 
argumentative and should be limited to statements of facts, and be 
relevant and material to the issue, which can better be shown in that 
form than by oral testimony.
    (b) Reference to tariff authority, routes, and distances. All 
exhibits showing rates, fares, charges, or other tariff or schedule 
provisions must, by appropriate Interstate Commerce Commission number 
reference, indicate the tariff or schedule authority therefor. If 
distances are shown, they must also show the authority therefor, and, by 
lines, highways, or waterways, and junction points, the routes over 
which the distances are computed. The routes over which the distances 
are computed need not be shown when such distances are specifically 
published in a tariff or schedule lawfully on file with the Commission, 
or definitely ascertainable from a tariff or schedule on file with the 
Commission showing rates prescribed by the Commission and based on short 
line distances, or short-highway distances, provided the exhibit makes 
specific reference to such tariff or schedules as provided by this 
section.

                          Subpart B--Discovery


<R05>
Sec. 1114.21  Applicability; general provisions.

    (a) When discovery is available. (1) Parties may obtain discovery 
under this subpart regarding any matter, not privileged, which is 
relevant to the subject matter involved in a proceeding other than an 
informal proceeding.

[[Page 205]]

For the purpose of this subchapter, informal proceedings are those not 
required to be determined on the record after hearing and include 
informal complaints and all proceedings assigned for initial disposition 
to employee boards (except the review boards) under Sec. 1011.6.
    (2) It is not grounds for objection that the information sought will 
be inadmissible as evidence if the information sought appears reasonably 
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
    (b) How discovery is obtained. (1) In non-rail licensing proceedings 
governed by 49 CFR part 1160, no discovery procedures may be used unless 
the Commission, upon its own motion or upon verified petition of a 
party, shall have entered a decision approving discovery.
    (2) In other proceedings other than those governed by 49 CFR part 
1160, those discovery procedures providing for the service of written 
interrogatories and requests for admissions (Secs. 1114.26 and 1114.27) 
may be used by parties without filing a petition and obtaining prior 
Commission approval. The other discovery procedures may be used only 
when the Commission, upon its own motion or upon verified petition of a 
party, has entered a decision approving discovery.
    (3) Whenever possible a petition for discovery must be filed in 
sufficient time to allow for the filing of replies and for consideration 
by the Commission without requiring the postponement of any hearing or 
the submission of initial statements under modified procedure. Use of 
discovery in those circumstances where no petition is required must also 
be accomplished whenever possible without requiring any such 
postponement.
    (c) Protective conditions. Upon motion by any party, by the person 
from whom discovery is sought, or by any person with a reasonable 
interest in the data, information, or material sought to be discovered 
and for good cause shown, any order which justice requires may be 
entered to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, 
oppression, or undue burden or expense, or to prevent the raising of 
issues untimely or inappropriate to the proceeding. Relief through a 
protective order may include one or more of the following:
    (1) That the discovery not be had;
    (2) That the discovery may be had only on specified terms and 
conditions, including a designation of the time and place;
    (3) That the discovery may be had only upon such terms and 
conditions as the Commission may impose to insure financial 
responsibility indemnifying the party or person against whom discovery 
is sought to cover the reasonable expenses incurred;
    (4) That the discovery may be had only by a method other than that 
selected by the party seeking discovery;
    (5) That certain matters not be inquired into or that the scope of 
discovery be limited to certain matters;
    (6) That discovery be conducted with no one present except persons 
designated in the protective order;
    (7) That a deposition after being sealed be opened only by order of 
the Commission;
    (8) That a trade secret or other confidential research development 
or commercial information not be disclosed or be disclosed only in a 
designated way; and
    (9) That the parties simultaneously file specified documents or 
information enclosed in sealed envelopes to be opened only upon 
direction or order of the Commission.

If the motion for a protective order is denied in whole or in part, the 
Commission may, on such terms and conditions as it deems just, enter an 
order requiring any party or person to provide or permit discovery. A 
protective order under this paragraph may only be sought after, or in 
conjunction with, an effort by any party to obtain relief under 
Secs. 1114.24(a), 1114.26(a), or 1114.31.
    (d) Sequence and timing of discovery. Unless the Commission upon 
motion, for the convenience of parties and witnesses and in the interest 
of justice, orders otherwise, methods of discovery may be used in any 
sequence and the fact that a party is conducting discovery, whether by 
deposition or otherwise, should not operate to delay any party's 
discovery.
    (e) Stipulations regarding discovery. Unless otherwise ordered, a 
written

[[Page 206]]

stipulation entered into by all the parties and filed with the 
Commission may:
    (1) Provide that depositions be taken before any person, at any time 
or place, upon sufficient notice, and in any manner and when so taken 
may be used like other depositions; and
    (2) Modify the procedures provided by these rules for other methods 
of discovery.


<R05>
Sec. 1114.22  Deposition.

    (a) Purpose. The testimony of any person, including a party, may be 
taken by deposition upon oral examination.
    (b) Petition. The petition requesting an order to take a deposition 
and perpetuate testimony or to produce documents and materials:
    (1) Should set forth the facts it desires to establish and the 
substance it expects to elicit;
    (2) Should be served upon all parties to the proceeding and upon the 
person sought to be deposed and/or the custodian of the documents or 
materials sought to be produced;
    (3) Should set forth the name and address of the witness, the place 
where, the time when, the name and office of the officer before whom, 
and the cause or reason why such deposition should be taken; and
    (4) Should specify with particularity the documents and materials 
which the deponent is requested to produce.
    (c) Order. If the Commission is convinced on its own initiative or 
by the petition requesting an order to take a deposition that the 
deposition will prevent a failure or delay of justice, it will serve an 
order upon the parties and the witness, naming the witness whose 
deposition is to be taken, specifying the time when, the place where, 
and the officer before whom the deposition is to be taken, and 
specifying the subject matter of the examination and whether the 
depositions shall be taken upon oral examination or written 
interrogatories. The provisions for the taking of the deposition 
specified in the Commission's order may or may not be the same as 
requested in the petition. The deposition may then be taken in 
accordance with these rules, and the Commission may make orders of the 
character provided by Sec. 1114.31.


<R05>
Sec. 1114.23  Depositions; location, officer, time, fees, absence, disqualification.

    (a) Where deposition should be taken. Unless otherwise ordered or 
agreed to by stipulation, depositions should be taken in the city or 
municipality where the deponent is located.
    (b) Officer before whom taken. Within the United States or within a 
territory or insular possession subject to the dominion of the United 
States, depositions should be taken before an officer authorized to 
administer oaths by the laws of the United States or of the place where 
the examination is held. Within a foreign country, depositions may be 
taken before an officer or person designated by the Commission or agreed 
upon by the parties by stipulation in writing to be filed with the 
Commission.
    (c) Fees. A witness whose deposition is taken pursuant to these 
rules and the officer taking same, unless he be employed by the 
Commission, shall be entitled to the same fee paid for like service in 
the courts of the United States, which fee should be paid by the party 
at whose instance the deposition is taken.
    (d) Failure to attend or to serve subpoena; expenses. (1) If the 
party who filed a petition for discovery fails to attend and proceed 
with the taking of the deposition and another party attends in person or 
by representative pursuant to an order of the Commission granting 
discovery the Commission may order the party who filed the petition to 
pay to such other party the reasonable expenses incurred by him and his 
representative in so attending, including reasonable attorney's fees.
    (2) If the party who filed a petition for discovery fails to serve a 
subpoena upon the witness and the witness because of such failure does 
not attend, and if another party attends in person or by representative 
because he expects the deposition of the witness to be taken, the 
Commission may order the party who filed the petition to pay to such 
other party the reasonable expenses incurred by him and his 
representative in so attending, including reasonable attorney's fees.

[[Page 207]]

    (e) Disqualification for interest. No deposition should be taken 
before a person who is a relative or employee or representative or 
counsel of any of the parties, or is a relative or employee of such 
representative or counsel or is financially interested in the 
proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 1114.24  Depositions; procedures.

    (a) Examination. Examination and cross-examination of witnesses 
should proceed as permitted at a hearing and should be limited to the 
subject matter specified in the order granting discovery. All objections 
made at the time of the examination to the qualifications of the officer 
taking the deposition, or to the manner of taking it, or to the evidence 
presented, or to the conduct of any party, and any other objection to 
the proceedings, should be noted by the officer upon the deposition. 
Evidence objected to should be taken subject to the objections. In lieu 
of participating in the oral examination, parties may serve written 
questions in a sealed envelope on the party taking the deposition, and 
shall transmit them to the officer, who shall open the sealed envelope, 
propound the questions to the witness, and record the answers verbatim.
    (b) Use of depositions. At the hearings, any part or all of a 
deposition, so far as admissible under the rules of evidence, may be 
used against any party who was present or represented at the taking of 
the deposition or who had due notice thereof, in accordance with any one 
of the following provisions:
    (1) Any deposition may be used by any party for the purpose of 
contradicting or impeaching the testimony of the deponent as a witness.
    (2) The deposition of a party or of anyone who at the time of taking 
the deposition was an officer, director, or managing agent, or a person 
designated to testify on behalf of a public or private corporation, 
partnership, association or governmental agency (other than this 
Commission, except in those instances where the Commission itself is a 
party to the proceeding) which is a party, may be used by an adverse 
party for any purpose.
    (3) The deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be used 
by any party for any purpose if the presiding officer or Commission 
finds:
    (i) That the witness is dead; or
    (ii) That the witness is at a greater distance than 100 miles from 
the place of hearing or is out of the United States, unless it appears 
that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the 
deposition; or
    (iii) That the witness is unable to attend or testify because of 
age, illness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or
    (iv) That the party offering the deposition has been unable to 
procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or
    (v) Upon application and notice, that such exceptional circumstances 
exist as to make it desirable, in the interest of justice and with due 
regard to the importance of presenting the testimony of witness orally 
at public hearing, to allow the deposition to be used.
    (4) If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, 
an adverse party may require him to introduce any other part which ought 
in fairness to be considered with the part introduced, and any party may 
introduce any other parts. Substitution of parties does not affect the 
right to use depositions previously taken.
    (c) Effect of taking or using depositions. A party should not be 
deemed to make a person his own witness for any purpose by taking his 
deposition. The introduction in evidence of the deposition or any part 
thereof for any purpose other than that of contradicting or impeaching 
the deponent makes the deponent the witness of the party introducing the 
deposition, but this should not apply to the use of an adverse party of 
a deposition under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. At the hearing any 
party may rebut any relevant evidence contained in a deposition whether 
introduced by him or by any other party.
    (d) Motions to protect. At any time during the taking of the 
deposition, on motion of any party or of the deponent and upon a showing 
that the examination is being conducted in bad faith or in such manner 
as unreasonably to annoy, embarrass, or oppress the deponent or party, 
the Commission may order the officer conducting the examination to cease 
forthwith from taking

[[Page 208]]

the deposition, or may limit the scope and manner of the taking of the 
deposition as provided in Sec. 1114.21(c). If the order made terminates 
the examination, it should be resumed thereafter only if so ordered. 
Upon demand of the objecting party or deponent, the taking of the 
deposition should be suspended for the time necessary to make a motion 
for an order.
    (e) Recordation. The officer before whom the deposition is to be 
taken shall observe the provisions of Sec. 1113.6 respecting appearances 
and typographical specifications, shall put the witness under oath, and 
shall personally, or by someone acting under his direction and in his 
presence, record and transcribe the testimony of the witness as required 
by these rules.
    (f) Signing. When the testimony is fully transcribed or otherwise 
recorded, the deposition should be submitted to the witness for 
examination and should be read to or by him unless such examination and 
reading are waived by the witness and the parties. Any changes in form 
or substance which the witness desires to make should be entered upon 
the deposition by the officer with a statement of the reasons given by 
the witness for making them. The witness shall then sign the deposition, 
unless the parties by stipulation waive the signing or the witness is 
ill or cannot be found or refuses to sign. If the deposition is not 
signed by the witness within 15 days of its submission to him, the 
officer shall sign it and state on the record the fact of the waiver or 
of the illness or absence of the witness or the fact of the refusal to 
sign together with the reason, if any, given therefor; and the 
deposition may then be used fully as though signed, unless, on a motion 
to suppress, it is found that the reasons given for refusal to sign 
require rejection of the deposition in whole or in part.
    (g) Attestation. The officer shall certify on the deposition that 
the witness was duly sworn by him and that the deposition is a true 
record of the testimony given by the witness, and that the officer is: 
(1) Not a relative, employee, representative or counsel of any of the 
parties, (2) not a relative or employee of such representative or 
counsel, and (3) not financially interested in the proceeding.
    (h) Return. The officer shall securely seal the deposition in an 
envelope endorsed with sufficient information to identify the proceeding 
and marked ``Deposition of (here insert name of witness)'' and shall 
either personally deliver or promptly send the original and one copy of 
all exhibits by registered mail to the Secretary of the Commission. A 
deposition to be offered in evidence must reach the Commission not later 
than 5 days before the date it is to be so offered.
    (i) Notice. The party taking the deposition shall give prompt notice 
of its filing to all other parties.
    (j) Copies. Upon payment of reasonable charges, the officer before 
whom the deposition is taken shall furnish a copy of it to any 
interested party or to the deponent.


<R05>
Sec. 1114.25  Effect of errors and irregularities in depositions.

    (a) As to disqualification of officer. Objection to taking a 
deposition because of disqualification of the officer before whom it is 
to be taken is waived unless made before the taking of the deposition 
begins or as soon thereafter as the disqualification becomes known or 
could be discovered with reasonable diligence.
    (b) As to taking of deposition. (1) Objections to the competency of 
a witness or to the competency, relevancy, or materiality of testimony 
are not waived by failure to make them before or during the taking of 
the deposition, unless the ground of the objection is one which might 
have been obviated or removed if presented at that time.
    (2) Errors and irregularities occurring at the oral examination in 
the manner of taking the deposition, in the form of the questions or 
answers in the oath or affirmation, or in the conduct of parties, and 
errors of any kind which might be obviated, removed, or cured if 
promptly presented, are waived unless seasonable objection thereto is 
made at the taking of the deposition.
    (c) As to completion and return of deposition. Errors and 
irregularities in the manner in which the testimony is transcribed or 
the deposition is prepared, signed, certified, sealed, endorsed,

[[Page 209]]

transmitted, filed, or otherwise dealt with by the officer under 
Sec. 1114.23 and 1114.24 are waived unless a motion to suppress the 
deposition or some part thereof is made with reasonable promptness after 
such defect is, or with due diligence might have been, ascertained.


<R05>
Sec. 1114.26  Written interrogatories to parties.

    (a) Availability; procedures for use. Subject to the provisions of 
Sec. 1114.21(b)(2), any party may serve upon any other party written 
interrogatories to be answered by the party served, or if the party 
served is a public or private corporation, partnership, association, or 
Governmental agency (other than this Commission, except in those 
instances where the Commission itself is a party to the proceeding), by 
any officer or agent, who shall furnish such information as is available 
to the party. Copies of any interrogatories served, and answers thereto, 
should also be filed with the Commission. Each interrogatory should be 
answered separately and fully in writing, unless it is objected to, in 
which event the reasons for objection should be stated in lieu of an 
answer. The answers are to be signed by the person making them and 
subscribed by an appropriate verification generally in the form 
prescribed in Sec. 1112.9. Objections are to be signed by the 
representative or counsel making them. The person upon whom the 
interrogatories have been served shall serve a copy of the answers and 
objections within the time period designated by the party submitting the 
interrogatories, but not less than 15 days after the service thereof.
    (b) Option to produce business records. Where the answer to an 
interrogatory may be derived or ascertained from the business records of 
the party upon whom the interrogatory has been served or from an 
examination, audit, or inspection of such business records or from a 
compilation, abstract, or summary based thereon, and the burden of 
deriving or ascertaining the answer is substantially the same for the 
party serving the interrogatory as for the party served, it is a 
sufficient answer to such interrogatory to specify the records from 
which the answer may be derived or ascertained and to afford to the 
party serving the interrogatory reasonable opportunity to examine, 
audit, or inspect such records and to make copies thereof, or 
compilation, abstracts, or summaries therefrom. If information sought is 
contained in computer runs, punchcards, or tapes which also contain 
privileged or proprietary information or information the disclosure of 
which is proscribed by the act, it will be sufficient response under 
these rules that the person upon whom the interrogatory has been served 
is willing to make available to and permit an independent professional 
organization not interested in the proceeding and paid by the party 
serving the interrogatory to extract from such runs, punchcards, or 
tapes the information sought in the interrogatory that is not privileged 
or proprietary information or information the disclosure of which is 
proscribed by the act.
    (c) Service of interrogatories in those proceedings not requiring a 
petition. In those proceedings not requiring a petition for 
interrogatories, and unless under special circumstances and for good 
cause, no written interrogatories shall be served within 20 days prior 
to the date assigned for commencement of hearing or the filing of 
opening statements of fact and argument under the modified procedure, 
and when the written interrogatories are to be served in a foreign 
country, they shall not be served within 40 days prior to such date.


<R05>
Sec. 1114.27  Request for admission.

    (a) Availability; procedures for use. Subject to the provisions of 
Sec. 1114.21(b)(2), a party may serve upon any other party a written 
request for the admission, for purposes of the pending proceeding only, 
of the truth of any matters within the scope of Sec. 1114.21 set forth 
in the request, including the genuineness of any documents described in 
the request for admission. Copies of documents should be served with the 
request unless they have been or are otherwise furnished or made 
available for inspection and copying. Copies of any requests for 
admission served, and answers thereto, should also be filed with the 
Commission. Each matter of which an admission is

[[Page 210]]

requested should be separately set forth. The matter is admitted unless, 
within a period designated in the request, not less than 15 days after 
service thereof, the party to whom the request is directed serves upon 
the party requesting the admission a written answer or objection 
addressed to the matter, signed by the party or his representative or 
counsel. If objection is made, the reasons therefor should be stated. 
The answer should specifically deny the matter or set forth in detail 
the reasons why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny the 
matter. A denial should fairly meet the substance of the requested 
admission, and when good faith requires that a party qualify his answer 
or deny only a part of the matter of which an admission is requested, he 
shall specify so much of it as is true and qualify or deny the 
remainder. An answering party may not give lack of information or 
knowledge as a reason for failure to admit or deny unless he states that 
he has made reasonable inquiry and that the information known or readily 
obtainable by him is insufficient to enable him to admit or deny. A 
party who considers that a matter of which an admission has been 
requested presents a genuine issue for hearing may not, on that ground 
alone, object to the request; he may, subject to the provisions of 
Sec. 1114.31, deny the matter or set forth reasons why he cannot admit 
or deny it. Copies of any answers or objections should be filed with the 
Commission.
    (b) Effect of admission. Any matter admitted under this rule is 
conclusively established unless upon petition and a showing of good 
cause the Commission enters an order permitting withdrawal or amendment 
of the admission. Any admission made by a party under this rule is for 
the purpose of the pending proceeding only and is not an admission by 
him for any other purpose nor may it be used against him in any other 
proceeding.
    (c) Service of written requests for admission in those proceedings 
not requiring a petition. In those proceedings not requiring a petition 
for requests for admission, and unless under special circumstances and 
for good cause shown, no requests for admission should be served within 
20 days prior to the date assigned for commencement of hearing or the 
filing of opening statements of fact and argument under the modified 
procedure, and when requests for admission are to be served in a foreign 
country they should not be served within 40 days prior to such date.


<R05>
Sec. 1114.28  Depositions, requests for admission, written interrogatories, and responses thereto: inclusion in record.

    At the oral hearing, or upon the submission of statements under the 
modified procedure, depositions, requests for admission and written 
interrogatories, and respective responses may be offered in evidence by 
the party at whose instance they were taken. If not offered by such 
party, they may be offered in whole or in part by any other party. If 
only part of a deposition, request for admission or written 
interrogatory, or response thereto is offered in evidence by a party, 
any other party (where the matter is being heard orally) may require him 
to introduce all of it which is relevant to the part introduced, and any 
party may introduce any other parts. Such depositions, requests for 
admission and written interrogatories, and responses thereto should be 
admissible in evidence subject to such objections as to competency of 
the witness, or competency, relevancy, or materiality of the testimony 
as were noted at the time of their taking or are made at the time they 
are offered in evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 1114.29  Supplementation of responses.

    A party who has responded to a request for discovery with a response 
that was complete when made is under a duty to supplement his response 
to include information thereafter acquired in the following instances:
    (a) A party is under a duty seasonably to supplement his response 
with respect to any question directly addressed to:
    (1) The identity and locations of persons having knowledge of 
discoverable matters, and
    (2) The identity of each person expected to be called as an expert 
witness at the hearing, the subject matter on

[[Page 211]]

which he is expected to testify, and the substance of his testimony.
    (b) A party who knows or later learns that his response is incorrect 
is under a duty seasonably to correct his response.
    (c) A duty to supplement responses may be imposed by order, 
agreement of the parties, or at any time prior to the hearing or the 
submission of verified statements under the modified procedure through 
new requests for supplementation of prior responses.


<R05>
Sec. 1114.30  Production of documents and records and entry upon land for inspection and other purposes.

    (a) Scope. Any party may be ordered and directed:
    (1) To produce and permit the petitioning party to inspect any 
designated documents (including writings, drawings, graphs, charts, 
photographs, phonograph records, tapes, and other data compilations from 
which information can be obtained, translated, if necessary, with or 
without the use of detection devices into reasonably usable form), or to 
inspect and copy, test, or sample any tangible things which are in the 
possession, custody, or control of the party upon whom the order is 
served, but if the writings or data compilations (including computer 
runs, punchcards, and tapes) include privileged or proprietary 
information or information the disclosure of which is proscribed by the 
act, such writings or data compilations need not be produced under this 
rule but may be provided pursuant to Sec. 1114.26(b); or
    (2) To permit, subject to appropriate liability releases and safety 
and operating considerations, entry upon designated land or other 
property in the possession or control of the party upon whom the order 
is served for the purpose of inspecting and measuring, surveying, 
photographing, testing, or sampling the property or any designated 
object or operation thereon.
    (b) Procedure. Any petition filed pursuant to this rule should set 
forth the items to be inspected either by individual item or by category 
and describe each item and category with reasonable particularity. The 
petition should specify a reasonable time, place, and manner of making 
the inspection and performing the related acts.


<R05>
Sec. 1114.31  Failure to respond to discovery.

    (a) Failure to answer. If a deponent fails to answer or gives an 
evasive answer or incomplete answer to a question propounded under 
Sec. 1114.24(a), or a party fails to answer or gives evasive or 
incomplete answers to written interrogatories served pursuant to 
Sec. 1114.26(a), the party seeking discovery may apply for an order 
compelling an answer by motion filed with the Commission and served on 
all parties and deponents. Such motion to compel an answer must be filed 
with the Commission and served on all parties and deponents. Such motion 
to compel an answer must be filed with the Commission within 10 days 
after the failure to obtain a responsive answer upon deposition, or 
within 10 days after expiration of the period allowed for submission of 
answers to interrogatories. On matters relating to a deposition on oral 
examination, the proponent of the question may complete or adjourn the 
examination before he applies for an order.
    (b) Failure to comply with order. (1) If a party or other witness 
refuses to be sworn or refuses to answer any question after being 
directed to do so by the Commission, such refusal may subject the 
refusing party or person to action by the Commission under 49 U.S.C. 
10321(c)(3) and (d)(4) to compel appearance and compliance with the 
Commission's order.
    (2) If any party or an officer, director, managing agent, or 
employee of a party or person refuses to obey an order made under 
paragraph (a) of this section requiring him to answer designated 
questions, or an order made under Sec. 1114.30 requiring him to produce 
any document or other thing for inspection, copying, testing, sampling, 
or photographing or to permit it to be done, or to permit entry upon 
land or other property, the Commission may make such orders in regard to 
the refusal as are just, and among others the following:
    (i) An order that the matters regarding which questions were asked, 
or the character or description of the thing or

[[Page 212]]

land, or the contents of the paper, or any other designated facts should 
be taken to be established for the purposes of the proceeding in 
accordance with the claim of the party obtaining the order:
    (ii) An order refusing to allow the disobedient party to support or 
oppose designated claims or defenses, or prohibiting him from 
introducing in evidence designated documents or things or items of 
testimony:
    (iii) An order striking out pleadings or parts thereof, or staying 
further proceedings until the order is obeyed, or dismissing the 
proceedings or any party thereof.
    (c) Expenses on refusal to admit. If a party, after being served 
with a request under Sec. 1114.27 to admit the genuineness of any 
document or the truth of any matter of fact, serves a sworn denial 
thereof, and if the party requesting the admission thereafter proves the 
genuineness of any such document or the truth of any such matter of fact 
the Commission may order the party making such denial to pay to such 
other party the reasonable expenses incurred in making that proof, 
including reasonable attorney's fees.
    (d) Failure of party to attend or serve answers. If a party or a 
person or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party 
or person willfully fails to appear before the officer who is to take 
his deposition, after being served with a proper notice, or fails to 
serve answers to interrogatories submitted under Sec. 1114.26, after 
proper service of such interrogatories, the Commission on motion and 
notice may strike out all or any part of any pleading of that party or 
person, or dismiss the proceeding or any part thereof.
    (e) Expenses against United States. Expenses and attorney's fees are 
not to be imposed upon the United States under this rule.

<R05>
Sec. 1115.1  Scope of rule.

    (a) These appellate procedures apply in cases where a hearing is 
required by law or Commission action. They do not apply to informal 
matters such as car service, temporary authority, suspension, special 
permission actions, or to other matters of an interlocutory nature 
except as specifically provided below. Except as provided in paragraph 
(c) of this section, these procedures do not apply to appeals from 
decisions of individual Commission employees in purely procedural 
matters made pursuant to authority delegated to them by the Chairman of 
the Commission. (See 49 CFR part 1152) Abandonment and discontinuance 
proceedings instituted under 49 U.S.C. 10903 are governed by separate 
appellate procedures exclusive to those proceedings. (See 49 CFR part 
1152)
    (b) Requests for appellate relief may relate either to initial 
decisions or to Commission actions other than initial decisions. For 
each category, this rule describes the types of appeal permitted, the 
requirements to be observed in filing an appeal, provisions for stay of 
the action, and the status of the action in the absence of a stay.
    (c) Appeals from the decisions of employees acting under authority 
delegated to them by the Chairman of the Commission pursuant to 
Sec. 1011.7 will be acted upon by the Chairman of the Commission. 
Appeals must be filed within 10 days of the date of the action taken by 
the employee, and responses to appeals must be filed within 10 days 
thereafter. Such appeals are not favored; they will be granted only in 
exceptional circumstances to correct a clear error of judgment or to 
prevent manifest injustice.

[[Page 213]]


<R05>
Sec. 1115.2  Initial decisions.

    This category includes the initial decision of an administrative law 
judge, individual Commissioner, employee board, or joint board.
    (a) An appeal of right is permitted.
    (b) Appeals must be based on one or more of the following grounds:
    (1) That a necessary finding of fact is omitted, erroneous, or 
unsupported by substantial evidence of record;
    (2) That a necessary legal conclusion, or finding is contrary to 
law, Commission precedent, or policy;
    (3) That an important question of law, policy, or discretion is 
involved which is without governing precedent;
    (4) That prejudicial procedural error has occurred.
    (c) Appeals must detail the assailed findings with supporting 
citations to the record and authorities.
    (d) Appeals and replies shall not exceed 30 pages in length, 
including argument, and appendices or other attachments, but excluding a 
table of cases and an index of subject matter.
    (e) Appeals must be filed within 20 days after the service date of 
the decision or within any further period (not to exceed 20 days) the 
Commission may authorize. In proceedings seeking motor carrier operating 
authority replies must be filed within 15 days of the date the appeal is 
due. In all other proceedings covered by these rules, replies must be 
filed within 20 days of the date the appeal is due.
    (f) The timely filing of an appeal to an initial decision will stay 
the effect of the action pending determination of the appeal.
    (g) If an appeal of an initial decision is not timely filed or the 
Commission does not stay the effectiveness on its own motion, the order 
set forth in the initial decision shall become the action of the 
Commission and be effective at the expiration of the time for filing, 
unless otherwise provided.

<R05>
Sec. 1115.3  Commission actions other than initial decisions.

    This category includes: a decision of a division in the first 
instance, where the requirement for an initial decision was voided (for 
rail proceedings pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 10327(c)) or waive (for nonrail 
proceedings pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 10322(c)); an action of the entire 
Commission in the first instance; and an action taken by a division on 
an appeal filed under Sec. 1115.2.
    (a) A discretionary appeal is permitted. It will be designated a 
``petition for administrative review,'' except that, when it is related 
to an action of the entire Commission in the first instance, it must be 
designated a ``petition to reopen.''
    (b) The petition will be granted only upon a showing of one or more 
of the following points:
    (1) The prior action (all categories) will be affected materially 
because of new evidence or changed circumstances.
    (2) The prior action was taken by a division in the first instance 
or by a division in an appellant capacity, and involves a matter of 
general transportation importance.
    (3) The prior action was taken by the entire Commission in the first 
instance, and involves material error.
    (c) To the extent the petition requests further hearing, rehearing, 
reargument, or reconsideration, the petition must state in detail the 
nature of and reasons for the relief requested. When in a petition filed 
under this section, a party seeks an opportunity to introduce evidence, 
the evidence must be stated briefly, must not appear to be cumulative, 
and explanation must be given why it was not previously adduced.
    (d) The petition and any reply must not exceed 20 pages in length. A 
separate preface and summary of argument, not exceeding 3 pages, may 
accompany petitions and replies and must accompany those that exceed 10 
pages in length.
    (e) Petitions must be filed within 20 days after the service of the 
action or within any further period (not to exceed 20 days) as a 
division or the Commission may authorize. In proceedings seeking motor 
carrier authority replies must be filed within 15 days of the date the 
appeal is due. In all other proceedings covered by these rules, replies 
must be filed within 20 days of the date the appeal is due.

[[Page 214]]

    (f) The filing of a petition will not automatically stay the effect 
of a prior action, but the Commission may stay the effect of the action 
on its own motion or on petition. A petition to stay may be filed in 
advance of the petition for administrative review or petition to reopen 
and shall be filed within 10 days of service of the action. No reply 
need be filed. However, if a party elects to file a reply, it must reach 
the Commission no later than 16 days after service of the action.
    (1) In a rail proceeding, the action, if not stayed, will become 
effective 30 days after it is served, unless the acting body provides 
for the action to become effective at a different date. On the day the 
action is served parties may initiate judicial review.
    (2) In a nonrail proceeding, the action, if not stayed, will be 
effective on the date it is served, and parties may initiate judicial 
review.
    (3) In all final actions, the provisions of the action will take 
effect on the date of service, unless otherwise provided. On this date 
parties must comply with the terms, conditions, or orders of the 
effective decision.

49 FR 31071, Aug. 3, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 1115.4  Petitions to reopen administratively final actions.

    A person at any time may file a petition to reopen any 
administratively final action of the Commission pursuant to the 
requirements of Sec. 1115.3(c) and (d) of this part. A petition to 
reopen an operating rights application proceeding must state in detail 
information sufficient to establish either fraud or ministerial mistake 
in the earlier decision. A petition to reopen all other proceedings must 
state in detail the respects in which the proceeding involves material 
error, new evidence, or substantially changed circumstances and must 
include a request that the Commission make such a determination.


<R05>
Sec. 1115.5  Petitions for other relief.

    (a) A party may petition for a stay of an action pending a request 
for judicial review, for extension of the compliance date, or for 
modification of the date the terms of the decision take effect. The 
reasons for the desired relief must be stated in the petition, and the 
petition must be filed not less than 10 days prior to the date the terms 
of the action take effect. No reply need be filed. If a party elects to 
file a reply, the reply must reach the Commission no later than 5 days 
after the petition is filed.
    (b) When the terms of a Commission action take effect on less than 
15 days' notice, a petition for stay pending a request for judicial 
review must be filed prior to the institution of court action and as 
close to the service date as practicable. No reply need be filed. Where 
time permits, a party may elect to file a reply.
    (c) A petition or reply must not exceed 10 pages in length.


<R05>
Sec. 1115.6  Exhaustion of remedies and judicial review.

    These rules do not relieve the requirement that a party exhaust its 
administrative remedies before going to court. Any action appealable as 
of right must be timely appealed. If an appeal, discretionary appeal, or 
petition seeking reopening is filed under Sec. 1115.2 or Sec. 1115.3 of 
this part, before or after a petition seeking judicial review is filed 
with the courts, the Commission will act upon the appeal or petition 
after advising the court of its pendency unless action might interfere 
with the court's jurisdiction.


<R05>
Sec. 1115.7  Petitions for judicial review; mailing address.

    Petitions for judicial review of final agency orders may be served 
on the Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2112(a) and be addressed to 
``General Counsel, Office of the General Counsel, Interstate Commerce 
Commission, Washington, DC 20423.''

[53 FR 20854, June 7, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 1115.8  Petitions to review arbitration decisions.

    An appeal of right is permitted. The appeal must be filed within 20 
days of a final arbitration decision, unless a

[[Page 215]]

later date is authorized by the Commission, and is subject to the page 
limitations of Sec. 1115.2(d). Standards for Commission review of 
arbitration decisions are set forth in Chicago and North Western Transp. 
Co.--Abandonment, 3 I.C.C.2d 729 (1987), aff'd sub nom. International 
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers v. ICC, No. 87-1629 (D.C. Cir. 
November 25, 1988). The timely filing of a petition will not 
automatically stay the effect of the arbitration decision. A stay may be 
requested under Sec. 1115.5.

    (a) Standing to appeal. Appeals of the decisions of the employee 
boards subject to this part and replies to appeals may be filed by any 
person.
    (b) Number of copies. The original and 10 copies of each pleading or 
paper permitted or required to be filed under this section should be 
furnished for the use of the Commission.
    (c) Time for filing. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this 
section with respect to matters involving emergency temporary authority, 
appeals in proceedings governed by this part must be filed within 20 
days after the date of service of the decision.
    (d) Where filed. Appeals and replies to appeals of Regional Motor 
Carrier Board temporary authority (TA) and emergency temporary authority 
(ETA) application decisions must be filed with the Regional Office in 
which the application was filed [see Secs. 1162.6 (d) and (e)]. Appeals 
and replies to appeals of all other decisions issued by employee boards 
must be filed with the Secretary, Interstate Commerce Commission, 
Washington, DC 20423.
    (e) Appeals in emergency temporary authority proceedings. An 
applicant seeking reconsideration of a decision concerning emergency 
temporary authority must file a petition within 20 days after it is

petition. Pleadings must be served on all parties of record.
    (f) Appeals in valuation proceedings. An appeal of a tentative 
valuation must contain precise references to the matters objected to and 
must include a statement of the changes in the valuation desired by the 
appellant. When practicable, each object of appeal should be set up as a 
separately numbered item. An appeal against land values or areas must 
state the valuation section and zone on the Commission's maps in which 
the land is located. When appellant claims that property owned or used 
has been omitted, a full description of the property and its location 
must be included.
    (g) Decisions on appeal. An appeal from an employee board's initial 
decision in a matter subject to this part will be reviewed by the board 
which may elect to modify its decision in light of new facts or 
arguments presented on appeal. If the board elects not to modify its 
prior decision, the appeal will be forwarded to the appropriate 
appellate body for determination. If a modified decision is issued by 
the board, a further appeal lies under this part. A decision on appeal 
by an appellate body is administratively final.

    Authority: 49 U.S.C. 10505; 5 U.S.C. 553.

    Source: 56 FR 46391, Sept. 12, 1991, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1121.1  Scope.

    These procedures govern petitions filed under 49 U.S.C. 10505 to 
exempt a transaction or service from 49 U.S.C. subtitle IV, or any 
provision of 49 U.S.C. subtitle IV.


<R05>
Sec. 1121.2  Criteria.

    Under 49 U.S.C. 10505, the Commission must exempt a person, class of 
persons or a transaction or service from regulation when it finds that:
    (a) Regulation is not necessary to carry out the rail transportation 
policy of 49 U.S.C. 10101a; and
    (b) Either:
    (1) The transaction is of limited scope; or
    (2) Regulation is not necessary to protect shipppers from the abuse 
of market power.


<R05>
Sec. 1121.3  Petitions for exemption.

    (a) A petition must comply with environmental or historic reporting 
and notice requirements of 49 CFR Part 1105, if applicable.
    (b) If the exemption proposal involves the acquisition of a motor 
carrier by a rail carrier (or person who controls or is affiliated with 
a rail carrier) under 49 U.S.C. 11344(c), the petition must include 
sufficient information to show that the transaction:
    (1) Is consistent with the public interest;
    (2) Will enable the rail carrier to use motor carrier transportation 
to public advantage in its operations; and
    (3) Will not unreasonably restrain competition.


<R05>
Sec. 1121.4  Procedures.

    (a) Proposals contained in a petition for exemption under 49 U.S.C. 
10505 are considered on their own merit.
    (b) Exemption proceedings are informal, and public comments are not 
sought during consideration of exemption petition proposals. However, 
the Commission may consider during its deliberation any public comments 
filed in response to a petition for exemption.
    (c) If the Commission determines that the criteria in 49 U.S.C. 
10505 are met for the proposed exemption, it will issue the exemption 
and publish a notice of the exemption in the Federal Register.
    (d) If the impact of the proposed exemption cannot readily be 
ascertained from the information contained in the petition or 
accompanying submissions or if significant adverse impacts might occur 
if the proposed exemption were granted, the Commission, in its 
discretion, may:
    (1) Direct that additional information be filed; or
    (2) Publish a notice in the Federal Register requesting public 
comments.
    (e) Exemption petitions containing proposals that are directly 
related to and concurrently filed with a primary application will be 
considered along with that primary application.
    (f) Under 49 U.S.C. 10505(g), the Commission may not relieve a 
carrier from the statutory obligation to protect the interests of 
employees. Accordingly, the Commission will impose appropriate employee 
protective conditions in decisions involving transactions subject to 
mandatory labor protection. Where labor protection is not mandatory, the 
Commission will exercise its discretion and impose labor protection

[[Page 218]]

when protection is found to be warranted under the circumstances.
    (g) An exemption generally will be effective 30 days from the 
service date of the decision granting the exemption. Unless otherwise 
provided in the decision, petitions to stay must be filed within 10 days 
of the service date, and petitions to reopen under 49 CFR part 1115 or 
1152.25(e) must be filed within 20 days of the service date. A petition 
to reopen may include comments on the proposal, requests for employee 
protection, or other conditions.
    (h) For good cause shown, an exemption may become effective at a 
time earlier than 30 days from the date of service. In such cases, the 
decision will specify the time for filing petitions to stay or reopen 
the exemption.
    (i) Under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) or 49 CFR 1152.25(e), the Commission 
may revoke an exemption in whole or in part. Petitions to revoke may be 
filed any time after the exemption becomes effective. The person seeking 
revocation has the burden of showing that the revocation criterion of 
section 10505(d) is met.
    (j) In abandonment exemptions, petitions to revoke in part to impose 
public use conditions under 49 CFR 1152.28, or to invoke the Trails Act, 
16 U.S.C. 1247(d), may be filed at any time prior to consummation of the 
abandonment.

contain the essential elements of a formal complaint as specified at 49 
CFR 1131.1 and may embrace supporting papers. The original and one copy

attempt to have it satisfied by correspondence, thereby avoiding the 
filing of a formal complaint.
    (c) Discontinuance of informal proceeding. The filing of an informal 
complaint does not preclude complainant from filing a formal complaint. 
If a formal complaint is filed, the informal proceeding will be 
discontinued.

within the statutory period, and should identify with reasonable 
definiteness the involved shipments or transportation services. The 
complaint should include:
    (1) A statement that complainant seeks to recover damages;
    (2) The names of each individual seeking damages;
    (3) The names and addresses of defendants against which claim is 
made;
    (4) The commodities, the rate applied, the date on which the charges 
were paid, the names of the parties paying the charges, and, if 
different, the names of the parties bearing the charges;
    (5) The period of time within which or the specific dates upon which 
the shipments were made, and the dates when they were delivered or 
tendered for delivery;
    (6) The specific origin and destination points or, where they are 
numerous, the territorial or rate group of the origin and destination 
points and, if known, the routes of movement; and
    (7) The nature and amount of the injury sustained by each claimant.

[[Page 219]]

    (c) Statement of prior claim. A complaint filed under paragraph (b) 
or (e) of this section containing a claim which has been the subject of 
a previous informal or formal complaint must specifically refer to the 
previous complaint.
    (d) Copies. The original of an informal complaint seeking damages 
must be accompanied by a sufficient number of copies to enable the 
Commission to send one to each defendant named.
    (e) Special-docket proceedings--(1) Petitions based on damages. 
Where the Act provides for an award of damages for a violation, and a 
carrier is willing to pay them, or to waive collection of undercharges, 
and the amount involved is more than $25,000.00, petitions for 
appropriate authority should be filed by the carrier on the special 
docket by submitting either a Letter of Intent to Pay Reparations, a 
Letter of Intent to Pay Reparations and Waive Undercharges, or a Letter 
of Intent to Waive Undercharges. Such petitions, when not filed in 
connection with an Informal Complaint pending before the Commission, 
must be filed within the statutory period and will be deemed the 
equivalent of an informal complaint and an answer admitting the matters 
stated in the petition. These petitions shall contain, as a minimum, the 
following information:
    (i) The names and addresses of the complainants seeking damages.
    (ii) The names of the defendants against which the claim is filed.
    (iii) The amount of the claim.
    (iv) The tariff authority for both the assailed and the sought rate.
    (v) The dates on which, or within which, the shipments moved and, 
when necessary to show compliance with the statute of limitations, the 
dates when the shipments were delivered or tendered for delivery.
    (vi) The points of origin and destination of the shipments and the 
routes of movement.
    (vii) The commodity.
    (viii) An admission by the carrier that the assailed rate was 
unreasonable, and a showing, where appropriate, that it has been removed 
from the tariff.
    (ix) A statement certifying that all defendants against which the 
claim is lodged concur in the intent to pay reparations or waive 
undercharges.
    (x) Evidence to show compliance with the statute of limitations.
    (xi) A brief explanation of the circumstances causing the claim for 
damages and the precedent relied upon by the carrier in agreeing to 
honor it.

If a carrier is unable to file such petition within the statutory period 
and the claim is not already protected from the operation of the statute 
by informal complaint, a Letter of Registration setting forth the facts 
may be submitted by the carrier within the statutory period. This letter 
will also be deemed the equivalent of an informal complaint filed on 
behalf of the shipper or consignee and sufficient to stay the operation 
of the statute. However, an appropriate Letter of Intent must be filed 
within one year following receipt by the Commission of the Letter of 
Registration. If an amount to be waived or refunded is $25,000.00 or 
less, no petition (Letter-of-Intent) need be filed prior to waiver or 
reparation. However, a Letter of Disposition informing the Commission of 
the action taken, the date of the action, the amount waived or refunded, 
and the date or dates shipments moved shall be submitted to the Special 
Docket Board, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423, 
within 30 days of the waiver or refund. The Letter of Disposition is 
deemed to be Commission action on a complaint for payment of reparations 
or waiver of undercharges. Letters of Disposition will be kept in a 
public file at the Commission for three years. Interested persons may 
see the file by inquiring at the Special Docket Board, Bureau of 
Traffic, during normal working hours of the Commission.
    (2) Petitions to waive collection of insignificant amounts. If a 
rail carrier wishes to waive the collection of amounts due under 49 
U.S.C. 10707(d)(2), when such amounts are more than $25,000.00, a 
petition for appropriate authority should be filed by the carrier on the 
special docket by submitting a Letter of Intent to Waive Insignificant 
Amounts. These petitions should contain the following information:
    (i) The name and address of the customer for whom the carrier wishes 
to waive collection.

[[Page 220]]

    (ii) The name and addresses of the carriers involved in the intended 
waiver and a statement certifying that all carriers concur in the 
action.
    (iii) The amount intended to be waived.
    (iv) The number of the investigation and suspension case involved, 
the beginning and ending dates of the suspension period, and any other 
pertinent tariff information.
    (v) The points of origin and destination of the shipments and the 
routes of movement, if relevant.
    (vi) A brief statement of justification for the intended waiver, 
including the anticipated costs of billing, collecting and/or litigating 
if the waiver is not permitted.

If the amount to be waived is $25,000.00 or less, no petition need be 
filed prior to waiver, provided that this exemption may be invoked by a 
carrier only once for any person (as defined at 49 U.S.C. 10102(16)) who 
uses the suspended rate during the suspension period. However, a Letter 
of Disposition informing the Commission of the action taken, the date of 
the action, and the amount waived shall be submitted to the Special 
Docket Board, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423, 
within 30 days of the waiver.
    (3) Public Notice and Protest. Petitions on the Special Docket to 
pay reparations, waive the collection of undercharges or waive the 
collection of insignificant amounts shall be made available by the 
Commission for public inspection five (5) days after receipt, in the 
Board of Suspension Public File Room, Room 4339, 12th & Constitution 
Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20423 and remain available for 25 days. Any 
interested person may protest the granting of a petition by filing a 
Letter of Objection with the Special Docket Board within 30 days of 
Commission receipt of the petition. Letters of Objection shall identify 
the Special Docket number, shall clearly state the reasons for the 
objection, and shall certify that a copy of the Letter of Objection has 
been served on all parties named in the petition. A period of 15 days 
will be allowed for reply.
    (4) Uncontested petitions. A petition which is not contested will be 
considered an order of the Commission authorizing the action 
contemplated in the petition 45 days after Commission receipt of the 
petition. Within 30 days after the expiration of the 45-day period the 
carrier filing the petition shall file a Letter of Disposition informing 
the Special Docket Board of the action taken, the date of the action, 
and the amount paid or waived.
    (f) Notification to the parties; six month's rule. If an informal 
complaint seeking damages (other than a contested Special-docket 
petition or tariff reconciliation petition) cannot be disposed of 
informally or is denied or withdrawn by complainant, the parties 
affected will be so notified in writing by the Commission. Contested 
Special-docket or tariff reconciliation petitions either will be granted 
or denied by the entry of a decision. Unless within six months after the 
date on which a notice is mailed or a decision is served, a party either 
files a formal complaint or resubmits its informal complaint on an 
additional-fact basis, the matter in the complaint or petition will not 
be reconsidered. The claim will be considered abandoned and no complaint 
seeking damages on the same cause of action will be accepted unless 
filed within the statutory period. Any filing or resubmission satisfying 
the six months' requirement will be considered filed as of the date of 
the original filing and must specifically refer to that date and to the 
Commission's file number. An original and 10 copies of a petition for 
reconsideration should be filed.
    (g) Tariff reconciliation proceedings for motor common carriers--(1) 
Petitions to waive collection or permit payment. Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 
11712, subject to Commission review and approval, motor common carriers 
(other than household goods carriers) and shippers may resolve, by 
mutual consent, overcharge and undercharge claims resulting from 
incorrect tariff provisions or billing errors arising from the 
inadvertent failure to properly and timely file and maintain agreed-upon 
rates, rules or classifications in compliance with 49 U.S.C. 10761 and 
10762. Under section 11712, the Commission may approve any departure 
from the filed rate when the shipper and carrier agree, and the 
departure is needed for the reason(s) stated in section 11712. Petitions

[[Page 221]]

for appropriate authority may be filed by either the carrier, shipper or 
consignee on the Commission's tariff reconciliation docket by submitting 
a letter of intent to depart from the filed rate. The petitions will be 
deemed the equivalent of an informal complaint and answer admitting the 
matters stated in the petition. Petitions shall be sent to the Special 
Docket Board, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. The 
petitions shall contain, at a minimum, the following information:
    (i) The name(s) and address(es) of the payer(s) of the freight 
charges;
    (ii) The name(s) of the carrier(s) involved in the traffic;
    (iii) An estimate of the amount(s) involved;
    (iv) The time period when the shipment(s) involved were delivered or 
tendered for delivery;
    (v) A general description of the point(s) of origin and destination 
of the shipment(s);
    (vi) A general description of the commodity(ies) transported;
    (vii) A statement certifying that the carrier(s) and shipper(s) 
participating in the shipment(s) or the payer(s) of the freight charges 
concur(s) with the intent to depart from the filed rate; and
    (viii) A brief explanation of the incorrect tariff provision(s) or 
billing error(s) causing the request to depart from the filed rate.
    (2) Public notice and protest. Tariff reconciliation petitions 
(letters of intent) shall be served on all parties named in the petition 
by the party who files the petition and will be made available by the 
Commission for public inspection in the Special Docket Board Public 
File, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. Any 
interested person may protest the granting of a petition by filing a 
letter of objection with the Special Docket Board within 30 days of 
Commission receipt of the petition. Letters of objection shall identify 
the tariff reconciliation proceeding, shall clearly state the reasons 
for the objection, and shall certify that a copy of the letter of 
objection has been served on all parties named in the petition. The 
Commission may initiate an investigation of the petition on its own 
motion.
    (3) Uncontested petitions. If a petition is not contested, and if 
the Commission does not initiate an investigation of the petition on its 
own motion, approval is deemed granted without further action by the 
Commission, effective 45 days after Commission receipt of the petition.
    (4) Contested petitions. If a petition is contested or the 
Commission initiates an investigation of the petition on its own motion, 
15 days will be allowed for reply. The 15-day period will commence on 
the date of service of the objections or, if the Commission initiates an 
investigation on its own motion, on the date of service of the decision 
initiating the investigation. After the period for reply has expired, 
the Commission will issue a decision approving or disapproving the 
petition, or requesting further submissions from the parties, and then 
will issue a decision based on the further submissions.

[47 FR 49572, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 48 FR 44827, Sept. 30, 1983]
Sec. 1131.3  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1131.4  Railroad allegations of unlawful intrastate rates.

    (a) Actions under 49 U.S.C. 11501(c). A rail carrier may file a 
petition with the Commission to review the decision of any certified 
State authority in any administrative proceeding in which the lawfulness 
of an intrastate rate, classification, rule, or practice is determined. 
The petition must show in what way the standards and procedures applied 
by the State were not in accordance with Subtitle IV of Title 49 of the 
United States Code, and it must be served on the State authority and all 
parties to the proceedings before the State authority consistent with 
Sec. 1104.12. Replies must be filed within 10 days after a carrier 
petition is filed, and must also be served. The Commission will act on 
the petition within 30 days.
    (b) Actions under 49 U.S.C. 11501(d). A rail carrier may file an 
application with the Commission to prescribe an intrastate rate if the 
appropriate State authority fails to act within 120 days after the rail 
carrier filed with it a change in an intrastate rate, or a change in a 
classification, rule or practice that has the effect of changing an 
intrastate rate, to the level charged on similar traffic moving in 
interstate or foreign commerce. The application must include a copy of 
the change as filed with the State authority, the comparable interstate 
rate items, and a showing that the State authority failed to act within 
120 days. The petition must be served on the State authority and all 
parties to the proceeding before the State authority consistent with 
Sec. 1104.12.


<R05>
Sec. 1131.5  Other specifications.

    (a) Tariff or schedule references. A formal complaint that brings in 
issue any rate, fare, charge, schedule, classification, regulation or 
practice should specifically identify the pertinent tariff or schedule.
    (b) References to States in which transportation occurs. A formal 
complaint under subchapter II of chapter 105 of 49 U.S.C. should 
specifically name the States in and through which the transportation 
which gives rise to the complaint is performed.


<R05>
Sec. 1131.6  Multiple causes of action; joinder.

    (a) Multiple causes of action. Two or more grounds of complaint 
concerning the same principle, subject, or facts may be included in one 
complaint, but should be stated and numbered separately.
    (b) Multiple complainants. Two or more complainants may join in one 
complaint against one or more defendants if their respective causes of 
action concern substantially the same alleged violation of the Act and 
like facts.

[[Page 223]]

    (c) Defendants. If complaint is made with respect to through 
transportation by continuous carriage or shipment, all persons subject 
to the Act participating therein, and against which a decision is 
sought, should be made defendants. If complaint is made regarding a 
classification or any of its provisions, ordinarily it will suffice to 
make defendants the persons operating one or more through routes between 
representative points of origin and destination, and serve notice of 
filing the complaint upon the tariff agent for the railroads which are 
subscribers to the tariff containing the challenged classification.


<R05>
Sec. 1131.7  Amended and supplemental formal complaints.

    An amended or supplemental complaint may be tendered for filing by a 
complainant against a defendant or defendants named in the original 
complaint, stating a cause of action alleged to have accrued within the 
statutory period immediately preceding the date of such tender, in favor 
of complainant and against the defendant or defendants. The time limits 
for responding to an amended or supplemental complaint are computed 
pursuant to Secs. 1111.4 and 1111.5, as if the amended or supplemental 
complaint was an original complaint.


<R05>
Sec. 1131.8  Copies; service.

    Formal complaints amended or supplemental complaints, and cross 
complaints will be served by the Commission. The original of each 
complaint or cross complaint must be accompanied by a sufficient number 
of copies to enable the Commission to serve one upon each defendant and 
to retain 10 copies in addition to the original.

[47 FR 49572, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 53 FR 19302, May 27, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 1131.9  Answers and cross complaints.

    (a) Generally. An answer may be filed within the time provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section. Whether or not an answer is filed and 
served, issue is joined at the conclusion of the time for filing 
answers, and the Commission may than proceed to a decision. In the 
alternative, the Commission may then proceed to a decision. In the 
alternative, the Commission may provide for the taking of evidence under 
the modified or oral hearing procedures, and in such a case the failure 
to answer a complaint will not bar a party from further participating in 
a proceeding or from the presentation of its evidence. An answer should 
be responsive to the complaint and should fully advise the Commission 
and the parties of the nature of the defense.
    (b) Time for filing; copies; service. An answer must be filed within 
20 days after the service of the complaint or within such additional 
time as the Commission may provide. The original and 10 copies of an 
answer must be filed with the Commission. The defendant must serve 
copies of the answer upon the complainant and any other defendants.
    (c) Cross complaints. A cross complaint alleging violations by 
parties to the proceeding or seeking relief against them may be filed 
with the answer. An answer to a cross complaint may be filed within 20 
days after the service date of the cross complaint. The party shall 
serve copies of answer to a cross complaint upon the other parties.

<R05>
Sec. 1131.10  Motions to dismiss or to make more definite.

    An answer to a complaint or cross complaint may be accompanied by a 
motion to dismiss the complaint or cross complaint or a motion to make 
the complaint or cross complaint more definite. A motion to dismiss can 
be filed at anytime during a proceeding. A complainant or a cross 
complainant may, within 10 days after an answer is filed, file a motion 
to make the answer more definite. Any motion to make more definite must 
specify the defects in the particular pleading and must describe fully 
the additional information or details thought to be necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 1131.11  Satisfaction of complaint.

    If a defendant satisfies a formal complaint, either before or after 
answering, a statement to that effect signed by the opposing parties 
must be filed (original only need be filed), setting forth when and how 
the complaint has

[[Page 224]]

been satisfied. This action should be taken as expeditiously as 
possible.


<R03>
PART 1132--PROTESTS AGAINST TARIFFS; PROCEDURES IN CERTAIN SUSPENSION AND LONG AND SHORT HAUL RESTRICTION MATTERS--Table of Contents

<R05>


    Authority: 49 U.S.C. 10321, 10707, 10708, and 10726; 5 U.S.C. 553 
and 559.


<R05>
Sec. 1132.1  Protests against tariffs.

    (a) Content. The protested tariff or schedule sought to be suspended 
should be identified by making reference to: The name of the publishing 
carrier, household goods freight forwarder, or agent; the Interstate 
Commerce Commission number; the specific items or particular provisions 
protested; and the effective date of the tariff or schedule. Reference 
should also be made to the tariff or schedule, and the specific 
provisions proposed to be superseded. The protest should state the 
grounds in support thereof, indicate in what respect the protested 
tariff or schedule is considered to be unlawful. Such protests will be 
considered as addressed to the discretion of the Commission. Should a 
protestant desire to proceed further against a tariff or schedule which 
is not suspended, or which has been suspended and the suspension 
vacated, a separate later formal complaint or petition should be filed.
    (b) When filed. Protests against, and requests for suspension of, 
tariffs, or schedules filed under the Act will not be considered unless 
made in writing and filed with the Commission at Washington, DC. 
Protests and requests for suspension shall reach the Commission at least 
12 days (except as provided in paragraphs (c), (g), and (j) of this 
section) before the effective dates of the tariffs, schedules, or parts 
thereof to which they refer, unless the protested publications were 
filed on less than 30 days' notice in which even the protests (except as 
provided in paragraph (g) of this section) must reach the Commission not 
less than 5 days before the effective dates. Protests or petitions for 
investigation and suspension of tariffs filed on less than 10 days' 
notice will be accepted, Provided That they reach the Suspension/Special 
Permission Board not later than 9:00 a.m. on the last workday before the 
tariffs' scheduled effective date. Appeals from decisions by the 
Suspension/Special Permission Board not to suspend or not to investigate 
matters in which the protests reached the Board later than 9 a.m. on the 
second working day before the protested tariffs' scheduled effective 
date will not be accepted. In an emergency, telegraphic protests will be 
acceptable if received within the time limits herein specified, provided 
they also fully comply with paragraphs (a) and (g) of this section and 
copies are immediately telegraphed by protestants to the proponent 
carriers or their publishing agents. However, protests against and 
requests for suspension of tariffs applicable on household goods as 
defined in 49 CFR 1056.1(b)(1), when published for the account of 
household goods carriers as defined in 49 CFR 1056.1(b)(1), when 
published for the account of househould goods carriers as defined in 49 
CFR 1056.1(b)(1) on not less than 45 days' notice, must reach the 
Commission no later than 27 days before the effective dates of the 
tariffs, schedules, or parts thereof to which they refer. Six copies of 
such telegrams should immediately be mailed by the protestants to the 
Commission at Washington.
    (c) Motor carrier tariff bureau filings. When motor common carrier 
tariff bureaus file schedules of proposed general increases in rates and 
charges, or of proposed rate restructurings subject to the special 
procedures adopted in Ex Parte No. MC-82, New Procedures in Motor 
Carrier Rev. Proc. 340 I.C.C. 1 (1971), and set forth at 49 CFR part 
1139, protests thereto must reach the Commission at least 22 days before 
the published effective dates of those schedules. All statements should 
be served by express mail or an equivalent expedited delivery service 
upon any party undertaking to bear the cost. Written request for this 
expedited service must be made no less than 5 days before the statement 
is due to be filed with the Commission.
    (d) Copies; service. In connection with proceedings involving 
proposals subject to the special procedures in Ex Parte No. MC-82, New 
Procedures in Motor Carrier Rev. Proc. 339 I.C.C. 324, and set

[[Page 225]]

forth at 49 CFR part 1139, an original and 10 copies of every protest or 
reply filed under this section should be furnished for the use of the 
Commission. Except as provided for proposals subject to the special 
procedures in Ex Parte No. MC-82, the original and 10 copies of each 
protest, except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, or of each 
reply filed under this section, must be filed with the Commission, and 
one copy of the protest simultaneously must be served upon the 
publishing carrier, household goods freight forwarder, or agent, and 
upon other persons known by protestants to be interested. If in the 
publication of an agency tariff, the proponent carrier elects to list 
itself with its full address on the cover page of the supplement or new 
tariff, service shall be made on such carrier simultaneously with 
service upon the Commission. These pleadings should be directed to the 
attention of the Suspension/Special Permission Board.
    (e) Passenger fare increases. The original only of each protest or 
request for investigation and suspension of increased passenger fares 
need be filed with the Commission. Requests for suspension of charges in 
rail passenger fares must include a verified (notarized) complaint.
    (f) Reply to protest. A reply to a protest filed under this section 
must reach the Commission not later than the fourth working day prior to 
the scheduled effective date of the protested schedules unless otherwise 
provided. Replies to protests against motor carrier rate bureau 
proposals other than proposals affecting tariffs for the transportation 
of household goods as defined in Sec. 1056.1(a) subject to Ex Parte No. 
MC-82 procedures to be assured of consideration, must reach the 
Commission no later than 14 days before the scheduled effective date of 
the protested schedules. Replies to protests against tariffs applicable 
on household goods (as defined in Sec. 1056.1(a)), published for the 
account of household goods carriers (as defined in Sec. 1040.2(b)) on 
not less than 45 days' notice shall be filed with the Commission not 
more than 5 days after the protest is filed. Replies to protests against 
motor common carrier of passengers general increase proposals subject to 
Ex Parte No. MC-82 procedures filed on not less than 30 days' notice 
must reach the Commission not later than the second working day prior to 
the effective date of the protested schedules.
    (g) Special requirements for protests against revisions to rail 
rates and charges and replies thereto. (1) Protests against, and 
requests for suspension of, tariffs or schedules filed by rail carriers, 
or their publishing agents on 20 days' notice under the provisions of 49 
U.S.C. 10762(c)(3) must reach the Commission at least 10 days before the 
proposed effective date of the protested matter. When the protested 
matter is filed on 10 days' notice under the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 
10762(c)(3), the protest or requests for suspension must reach the 
Commission at least 5 days before the proposed effective date of the 
protested matter.
    (2) Protests against and requests for suspension of, tariffs or 
schedules containing proposed rates, classifications, rules, or 
practices filed by rail carriers or their publishing agents shall also 
include a verified statement containing specific facts showing:
    (i) It is substantially likely that the protestant will prevail on 
the merits pursuant to any applicable provisions of the law;
    (ii) Without suspension, the proposed rate change will cause 
substantial injury to the protestants or the party represented by the 
protestants; and
    (iii) Because of the peculiar economic circumstances of the 
protestant, investigation of the rate (subject to a refund by the 
carrier should the rate subsequently be found unlawful) will not protect 
the protestant. The burden is on the protestant to prove the matters 
described in paragraphs (g)(2), (i), (ii) and (iii) of this section.
    (3) Where protestants allege that a rate is unreasonably high in 
violation of 49 U.S.C. 10701, they must submit evidence relating to 
market dominance pursuant to guidelines established in Ex Parte No. 320 
(Sub-No. 2), 365 I.C.C. 118.
    (4) Replies to verified statements filed under this section shall be 
verified.
    (h) Except in extraordinary circumstances, the Suspension/Special

[[Page 226]]

Permission Board will act on protests against or requests for suspension 
of tariffs applicable on household goods as defined in 49 CFR 1056.1(a), 
when published for the account of household goods carriers as defined in 
Sec. 1040.2(b) on not less than 45 days' notice, no later than 18 days 
before the effective dates of the tariffs, schedules, or parts thereof 
to which they refer. When the Commission acts initially on questions of 
investigation and suspension of tariffs applicable on household goods 
published for the account of household goods carriers and filed on not 
less than 45 days' notice, the Commission will act not later than 12 
days before the tariffs' scheduled effective date. If the Commission 
concludes: Not to investigate and suspend; to investigate, but not to 
suspend; or not to investigate (without suspension), its decision will 
not be subject to petitions for reconsideration, except at the 
Commission's discretion. (A petition to discontinue an investigation 
will be accepted if filed within 20 days of the service date of the 
decision ordering the investigation.) No petition other than a petition 
for discontinuance of an investigation will be accepted that does not 
reach the Commission by 4:00 p.m. as provided in paragraph (i) of this 
section.
    (i) Except in extraordinary circumstances, the Commission will act 
on protests or requests for suspension of tariffs filed under paragraph 
(c) of this section no later than 5 days before the effective date of 
the tariffs, schedules, or parts thereof to which the protests refer. A 
decision at the suspension level by the entire Commission on the 
protests will not be subject to petitions for reconsideration, except at 
the Commission's discretion. No petition will be accepted that does not 
reach the Commission by 4:00 p.m. (United States Standard Time or local 
Daylight Saving Time, whichever is in effect in Washington, DC) on the 
work-day following the Commission's action.
    (j) Motor carriers of passengers filings. When motor common carriers 
of passengers file schedules of proposed general increases in rates and 
charges subject to the special procedures adopted in Ex Parte No. MC-82 
(Sub-No. 1), Procedures in Motor Carrier Revenue Proceedings--Intercity 
Bus Industry, 357 I.C.C. 35 (1977) and set forth at 49 CFR Part 1139, 
protests thereto must reach the Commission at least 8 days before the 
proposed effective date of the protested matter.

See also Sec. 1115.5. In connection with proceedings involving proposals 
subject to the special procedures in Ex Parte No. MC-82, New Procedures 
in Motor Carrier Rev. Proc. 339 I.C.C. 324, and set forth at 49 CFR Part 
1139, and original and 10 copies of every protest or reply filed under 
this section should be furnished for the use of the Commission. Except 
as provided for proposals subject to the special procedures in Ex Parte 
No. MC-82, the original and 10 copies of every pleading, document or 
paper filed under this section must be furnished for the use of the 
Commission. Any interested person may file and serve a reply to any 
petition for reconsideration permitted under this paragraph within 20 
days after the filing of such petition with the Commission but if the 
facts stated in any such petition discloses a need for accelerated 
action, such action may be taken before expiration of the time allowed 
for reply. In all other respects, such petitions and replies thereto 
will be governed by the rules of general applicability of the Rules of 
Practice.
    (c) When the Suspension/Special Permission Board has declined to 
suspend a proposed tariff or schedule, or any part thereof, a petition 
in writing by any protestant or protestants may be filed with the 
Commission for reconsideration provided it reaches the Commission at 
least two work-days prior to the effective date of the tariff or 
schedule in question. However, when the Suspension/Special Permission 
Board has declined to suspend a protested change in rail rates filed on 
10 days' notice under the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 10762(c)(3), the 
petition must be in the hands of the Suspension/Special Permission Board 
not later than 9 a.m., United States Standard or local Daylight Saving, 
whichever is in effect in Washington, D.C., on the work-day before the 
proposed effective date of the protested matter. Further, when the 
Suspension/Special Permission Board has declined to suspend a proposed 
tariff or schedule applicable on household goods as defined in 
Sec. 1056.1(a) published for the account of a household goods carrier as 
defined in Sec. 1040.2(b) on not less than 45 days' notice, the petition 
must be filed within 2 work-days after the Suspension/Special Permission 
Board has acted. For the purpose of this section, a work day shall be 
considered as any day except Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday in the 
District of Columbia. (A legal holiday of less than one day shall be 
considered a work-day within the meaning of this section). Petitions 
submitted under this section shall (except as provided in the case of a 
protested change in rail rates filed under the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 
10762(c)(3) be filed with the Secretary of the Commission by 4 p.m. 
United States Standard Time or local Daylight Saving Time whichever is 
in effect in Washington, D.C. Telegraphic notice or the equivalent 
thereof must be given by the petitioners to the respondent or 
respondents. As no replies to the petitions for reconsideration are 
contemplated under this rule, petitioners will be expected, except in 
unusual circumstances, to rely wholly on the information previously 
filed with the Suspension/Special Permission Board. Written or 
telegraphic communication in intelligible form requesting 
reconsideration will be sufficient. Such request should contain the 
following prefatory statement: ``This matter requires expedited handling 
under Sec. 1132.2''. A petition not timely filed may be rejected by the 
Secretary.
    (d) When the Suspension/Special Permission Board has declined to 
suspend a proposed tariff or schedule applicable on household goods as 
defined in Sec. 1056.1(a) published for the account of a household goods 
carrier as defined in Sec. 1040.2(b) on not less than 45 days' notice, 
the Commission will, except in extraordinary circumstances, act on 
petitions for reconsideration no later than 2 work-days after the 
petition is filed.

should immediately prepare a statement showing details of the shipments 
on which damages are claimed, in accordance with the following form:

    Claim of ______ under decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission 
in Docket No. ______.
    ______ Date of shipment.

    (b) The statement should not include any shipment not covered by the 
Commission's findings, or any shipment on which complaint was not filed 
with the Commission within the statutory period. The filing of a 
statement will not stop the running of the statute of limitations as to 
shipments not covered by complaint or supplemental complaint. If the 
shipments moved over more than one route, a separate statement should be 
prepared for each route, and separately numbered, except that shipments 
as to which the collecting carrier is in each instance the same may be 
listed in a single statement if grouped according to routes. The 
statement, together with the paid freight bills on the shipments, or 
true copies thereof, should then be forwarded to the carrier which 
collected the charges, for verification and certification as to its 
accuracy. If the statement is not forwarded immediately to the 
collecting carrier for certification, a letter request from defendants 
that forwarding be expedited will be considered to the end that steps be 
taken to have the statement forwarded immediately. All discrepancies, 
duplications, or other errors in the statements should be adjusted by 
the parties and corrected agreed statements submitted to the Commission. 
The certificate must be signed in ink by a general accounting officer of 
the carrier and should cover all of the information shown in the

[[Page 229]]

statement. If the carrier which collected the charges is not a defendant 
in the case, its certificate must be concurred in by like signature on 
behalf of a carrier defendant. Statements so prepared and certified 
shall be filed with the Commission whereupon it will consider entry of a 
decision awarding damages.

PART 1135--RAILROAD COST RECOVERY PROCEDURES--Table of Contents

<R05>


    Authority:: 5 U.S.C. 553 and 49 U.S.C. 721 and 10708.


<R05>
Sec. 1135.1  Quarterly adjustment of rates.

    (a) Rail carriers may adjust rates and charges quarterly in order to 
compensate for inflationary cost increases. The quarterly adjustment 
shall not exceed the percentage change in the all inclusive index of 
railroad costs as proposed by the Association of American Railroads and 
modified by the Commission. The Commission will make modifications of 
the revisions to the index as necessary.
    (b) The allowable increase will be based on a projection of the 
index to the midpoint of the quarter to which the index will apply. The 
percentage change must be calculated from a comparison of the forecast 
index for the midpoint of the quarter during which the rates will be in 
effect with the forecast index for the midpoint of the previous quarter. 
Each quarterly index will be adjusted for forecast error in the index 
issued six months earlier. The adjustments will be made by adding or 
subtracting, as appropriate, the difference between the index using 
actual data for the second prior quarter and the index using forecasted 
data for that quarter. Additionally, AAR shall file an index adjusted 
for productivity changes. The adjustment will be made by applying the 
multi-year average annual growth in productivity spread evenly over four 
quarters, compounded each quarter. Productivity adjustments shall 
compound in the same manner as rate changes.
    (c) The Association of American Railroads must file its calculations 
with the Commission on the fifth day of the last month of the prior 
quarter (or the closest business day if the fifth is a Saturday, Sunday 
or holiday). The calculations are to be for the mid-point of the next 
quarter.
    (d) Tariffs containing adjustments under the provisions of this rule 
may be filed to become effective on not less than ten days notice when 
the Rail Cost Adjustment Factor adopted by the Commission does not 
differ from that proposed by the Association of American Railroads. When 
the Rail Cost Adjustment Factor adopted by the Commission differs from 
that proposed by the Association of American Railroads the notice period 
shall be not less than five days. Reductions to rates published in the 
initial RCCR tariff may be published on one day's notice during the 
period between the publication of the tariff and the first day of the 
calendar quarter for which that tariff applies.
    (e) Increases in rates consistent with these standards will not be 
investigated or suspended by the Commission unless the filing results in 
a double recovery of inflation-based cost increases.
    (f) All cost recovery tariffs filed with the Commission shall state 
that they are being filed in conformity with the rules in 49 CFR 1135.1 
and 1312.17(k), and shall be amended under the same timetable applicable 
to rate increases, to reflect declines in the cost index. Any declines 
in the index below the level in effect on December 31, 1985, will be 
addressed by postponing authorizations for future cost recovery rate 
increases pursuant to a ``banking'' procedure described more fully in Ex 
Parte No. 290 (Sub-No. 2), Railroad Cost Recovery Procedures, served 
October 17, 1986.
    (g) In accordance with the procedures outlined in Sec. 1312.17(k), 
each carrier shall timely file (either directly or through a duly 
authorized tariff-publishing agent) with the regulatory authority of 
each State in which it operates, all tariffs filed with the Commission 
in accordance with these procedures. The carrier will file with the

[[Page 230]]

State at the same time that it files with the Commission.

Sec. 1137.1  Divisions of revenue cases.

    (a) Notice of intent to file complaint.
    (1) An original and 10 copies shall be filed for Commission use. 
Complainant shall serve copies of the notice upon each party (each 
receiver or trustee if a bankrupt line) to the joint rate.
    (2) The notice of intent shall state generally: The involved traffic 
and applicable joint rates, the territorial scope, the participating 
railroads, and the present and proposed divisions.
    (3) The notice shall include a statement indicating when filing of 
the formal complaint is expected. The formal complaint may not be filed 
more than one year after the filing of the notice of intent, unless the 
Commission approves an extension of time. Lack of diligence in filing of 
the formal complaint may result in dismissal of the action.
    (b) Notice of intent to file cross complaint. These notices shall be 
filed within 30 days from service of the original notice and are subject 
to the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Formal complaint (and cross complaint). The formal complaint 
(and cross complaint) shall be filed no sooner than 120 days after the 
filing of the notice of intent unless good cause is shown either for not 
filing a notice or for a shorter notice period. The request to waive the 
notice time requirement may be included in the formal complaint or in a 
separate petition. The formal complaint (or cross complaint) shall 
contain the case-in-chief. All supporting papers shall be made available 
to opposing parties for inspection and copying. Complaints (and cross 
complaints) are subject to the same copy requirements as in paragraph 
(a) of this section. Complainant (or cross complainant) shall serve 
copies on each party of record. If circumstances permit, the cross 
complaint will be consolidated for disposition.
    (d) Answer. The answer to the formal complaint shall contain the 
entire case-in-rebuttal. Supporting papers shall be made available to 
opposing parties for inspection and copying. If the notice of intent 
procedure was used, the case-in-rebuttal shall be filed within 30 days 
from service of the complaint. If the notice procedure is waived, the 
case-in-rebuttal shall be filed within 5 months of the filing of the 
complaint. Answers shall be served on each party of record. An original 
and 10 copies shall be submitted to the Commission.
    (e) Further proceedings. Following submission of defendant's 
evidence, complainant may, within 2 months, submit reply evidence which 
shall be served on each party of record. Unless otherwise ordered, no 
further filing shall be accepted. Divisions cases shall be handled under 
the modified procedure, unless oral hearing is shown to be necessary.

[[Page 231]]

    (f) Discovery. If the notice of intent procedure was used, discovery 
shall be available to all parties only prior to the filing of the 
complaint. If the notice procedure was not used, discovery shall be 
available to defendants only and must be exercised under the time 
restrictions contained in paragraph (d) of this section. Prehearing 
conferences may be requested to adjudicate discovery requests, or they 
may be resolved by written pleadings.
    (g) Evidentiary guidelines. (1) Traffic and cost studies, either 
individual or joint, may be submitted. Studies shall be accepted for 
consideration as long as they do not delay the process or conflict with 
other applicable deadlines. Cost studies should be developed, absent a 
more specific method, in accordance with Rail Form A (or URCS, if 
implemented), adjusted to reflect the specific traffic and updated to a 
current level. Studies may include the types of evidence discussed in 
appendix D of Expeditious Handling of Divisions of Revenue Cases, 353 
I.C.C. 349, 388 (1976).
    (2) The following evidentiary standards apply:
    (i) Costs associated with exempt or contract traffic shall not be 
included, except that allocation of certain common costs to regulated 
traffic may be acceptable if adequately explained.
    (ii) Elements of profit, income tax, and passenger, commuter, and 
LCL deficits are not proper expense items for developing fully allocated 
cost [See Rules to Govern Assembling and Presenting Cost Evidence, 337 
I.C.C. 298 (1970)], but will be treated under the issue of revenue need.
    (iii) Passenger and commuter service costs shall be considered only 
in relation to the carrier's revenue need.
    (iv) All subsidies shall be disclosed and explained.
    (v) The same divisional basis shall apply on ``border point'' 
traffic.
    (h) Time periods for completion of proceedings. In accordance with 
section 10705(f)(1)(A)(ii), a party, for good cause, may seek extension 
of any applicable filing deadline. If a requested extension will result 
in an evidentiary period in excess of 9 months and the proceeding does 
not involve Class III carriers, the request shall contain sufficient 
information to allow the required report to Congress and set forth the 
reasons why the extension is necessary. When the proceeding involves a 
railroad in reorganization or a contention that the divisions do not 
cover the variable costs of handling the traffic, requests for extension 
of filing deadlines shall be viewed with disfavor. The Act directs us to 
give these proceedings preference and to take final action at the 
earliest practicable time. 49 U.S.C. 10705(f)(1)(A)(i).

Sec. 1137.2   Expeditious procedures for publication of separate rates for distinct services.

    (a) Purpose. These regulations are designed to facilitate the 
publication of and thus encourage the use of separate rates for distinct 
rail services. Increased utilization of such rates will also increase 
the attractiveness of investing in railroads and rail service related 
enterprises by creating a keener competition among rail carriers and 
other modes of transportation. Encouraging these goals, the Commission 
also seeks to promote experimentation and innovative ratemaking through 
the initiation of rail carriers and the requests of their customers. 
Special permission requests for publication on short notice will be 
granted whenever feasible, and any proceedings involving separate rates 
for distinct services will be expedited.
    (b) Definitions. (1) Distinct rail services are those railroad 
transportation services, which are separate from line-haul 
transportation services necessary for the movement of freight, and for 
which a specific tariff item is published by the railroads either upon 
their own initiative or upon the request of any shipper or receiver of 
freight.

The following definitions refer to those factors included in 
Sec. 1137.2(h) in the determination of reasonableness:
    (2) The term ``cash-outlays'' as used in 49 U.S.C. 10728 shall 
consist of the following:
    (i) The annualized operating expenses, rents and taxes (including 
labor, materials and supplies, fuel and utilities, but excluding 
depreciation, amortization, and Federal income taxes) which change 
directly with the

[[Page 232]]

carrier's production of a distinct rail service.
    (ii) The annualized cash-outlays equivalent to the carrier's capital 
investment, including the cost of providing such capital, which change 
directly with the carrier's production of a distinct rail service. These 
cash-outlays may be determined based on either the cost of sunk and new 
investment combined or the cost of new investment only.
    (3) Demand is the willingness of a shipper to purchase a distinct 
rail service (as that term is defined in Sec. 1137.2(b)(1)) at a 
specified price under the prevailing circumstances.
    (c) Title page. In addition to requirements of Sec. 1312.12, a 
tariff title page must also state whether the tariff or supplement 
contains new or changed rates for distinct rail services as defined in 
Sec. 1137.2(b) and bear the following notation:

    This tariff (or supplement or loose leaf amendment) contains 
separate rates for distinct rail services (see item(s)______) within the 
meaning of Sec. 1137.2(b).

    (d) Letters of transmittal. In connection with separate rates for 
distinct rail services filed with the Commission, the letter of 
transmittal (required in Sec. 1312.4) must also bear the notation found 
in Sec. 1137.2(c).
    (e) Justification statements. Justification statements in support of 
the publication of a separate rate or charge for a distinct rail service 
may be filed concurrently with the filing of the tariff. Information of 
the type specified in Sec. 1137.2(h), if included in the justification 
statement, would assist the Commission in its initial evaluation of the 
proposal.
    (f) Protest(s) and investigation. Protests to a tariff (or 
supplement) making reference on the title page to Sec. 1137.2(b) must be 
verified and filed in accordance with Sec. 1132.1(g). In the event of 
investigation or suspension, these proceedings will be accorded 
priority, and modified procedure (49 CFR Part 1112), to the extent 
feasible, will be followed.
    (g) Reply to protest. Replies to protests of rates proposals under 
this section must be verified and should be filed and served promptly in 
accordance with Sec. 1132.1(f). Respondents are urged to submit the 
information specified in Sec. 1137.2(h) unless previously furnished.
    (h) Initial statement. In order to expedite the proceedings in the 
event of the suspension of tariff schedules setting forth separate rates 
for distinct rail services or in the event that investigation without 
suspension of such schedules is ordered, respondent railroad or 
railroads shall submit in writing, under verfication, support of the 
tariff in issue. Such data should consist of the following:
    (1) Cash-outlays. The dollars of ``cash-outlays'' as that term is 
defined in Sec. 1137.2(b)(2). A full explanation of the methods, 
procedures and data used to determine ``cash-outlays'' should be 
supplied.
    (2) Demand. Evidence supporting existence of a ``demand'' for the 
proposed service as that term is defined in Sec. 1137.2(b)(3).
    (3) Market dominance. If the proposal involves a new or increased 
charge for a distinct service, evidence prepared in accordance with the 
guidelines established in Ex Parte No. 320 (Sub-No. 2), 365 ICC 118 
should be supplied. However, if such data has been previously submitted 
in the same proceeding, a notation to that effect will suffice.
    (4) Revenues. The annualized dollars of revenue to be obtained from 
the rate or charge associated with providing the distinct rail service.
    (5) Outputs. The annualized number of service outputs associated 
with the rate or charge per service unit. For example, if the proposed 
rate is stated in cents per hundredweight, per car switched, or per 
stop, then the number of service outputs should be expressed as x number 
of hundredweight, cars switched, or stops made.
    (6) Ratios. The revenue-to-cost ratio (percentage) for the distinct 
rail service, based on the revenues to be obtained, and the carrier's 
``cash-outlays.''
    (7) Effect. A statement as to how the proposed rate on the distinct 
rail service will encourage competition; promote increased reinvestment 
by the railroad; or encourage and facilitate increased non-railroad 
investment in the production of rail services.

[[Page 233]]

    (8) Alternative data. The submission of the above evidence, 
paragraphs (h)(1) through (7) of this section, represents data which the 
Commission believes would provide a basis for meaningful analysis of the 
lawfulness of such rates. However, in lieu thereof or in addition 
thereto, respondents may justify their proposal on the basis of other 
relevant evidence or cost levels. A full explanation of the methods and 
procedures used shall be provided.
    (i) Reporting requirements. For the 6-month period beginning 
February 5, 1977, all common carriers by rail, subject to 49 U.S.C. 
11145; shall submit information showing those distinct rail service 
rates published in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 10728, showing actual or 
estimated revenues derived therefrom during the 6-month period. In 
addition, these reports, which shall be filed with the Commission by 
July 30, 1977, shall state whether the rates accomplished their intended 
purpose, and if not whether they intend any change in the level of 
charge or other change.

Sec. 1139.1  Application.

    (a) Upon the filing by the tariff publishing agencies named 
hereinafter on behalf of their motor common carrier members, or by such 
other agencies as the Commission may by order otherwise designate, of 
agency tariff schedules which contain (1) proposed general increases in 
rates or charges on general freight where such proposal would result in 
an increase of $1 million or more in the annual operating revenues on 
the tariff affected by the proposal, or (2) a proposed general 
adjustment with the objective of restructuring the rates on a wide range 
of traffic, involving both increases and reductions in rates and 
charges, where such proposal would result in a net increase of $1 
million or more in annual operating revenues, the motor common carriers 
of general freight on whose behalf such schedules are filed shall, 
concurrently with the filing of those tariff schedules, file and serve, 
as provided hereinafter, a verified statement presenting and comprising 
the entire evidential case which is relied upon to support the proposed 
general increase or rate restructuring. Carriers thus required to submit 
their evidence when they file their schedules are hereby notified that 
special permission to file those schedules shall be conditioned upon the 
publishing of an effective date at least 45 days later than the date of 
filing, to enable proper evaluation of the evidence presented. Data to 
be submitted in accordance with Secs. 1139.2 through 1139.5 of this part 
represent the minimum data required to be filed and served, and in no

[[Page 234]]

way shall be considered as limiting the type of evidence that may be 
presented at the time of filing of the schedules. If a formal proceeding 
is instituted, the carriers are not precluded from updating the evidence 
submitted at the time of filing of the schedules to reflect the 
contemporary situation.
    (b) The motor common carriers of general freight which are subject 
to the provisions of this section are those which are members of the 
following tariff publishing agencies:

Central and Southern Motor Freight Tariff Association, Inc.
Central States Motor Freight Bureau, Inc.
The Eastern Central Motor Carriers Association, Inc.
Middle Atlantic Conference
Middlewest Motor Freight Bureau
The New England Motor Rate Bureau, Inc.
Pacific Inland Tariff Bureau, Inc.
Rocky Mountain Motor Tariff Bureau, Inc.
Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference

    (c) Upon the filing of tariff schedules other than those described 
hereinabove, the carriers or their tariff publishing agencies shall be 
required to comply with such procedures as the Commission may direct in 
the event an investigation is instituted. In any proceeding involving a 
proposed rate restructuring which would produce additional net revenue 
of less than $1 million the carriers will be required to submit only the 
data sought in Secs. 1139.2 and 1139.3. Nothing stated in this part 
shall relieve the carriers of their burden of proof imposed under the 
Interstate Commerce Act.


<R05>
Sec. 1139.2  Traffic study.

    (a) The respondents shall submit a traffic study for the most 
current 12-month calendar year available, which shall be referred to as 
the ``base-calendar year--actual.'' This year shall be the calendar year 
that has ended at least 7 months prior to the published effective date 
of the tariff schedules. If the effective date is less than 7 months 
following the end of the preceding calendar year, than the second 
preceding calendar year shall be considered at the ``base-calendar 
year--actual.'' The study shall include a probability sampling of the 
actual traffic handled during identical time periods for each study 
carrier.
    (b) The study carriers shall consist of those carriers subject to 
the requirements for allocation of expenses between line-haul and pickup 
and delivery services, as provided in Part 1207 of this chapter, 
Instructions 27 and 9002, which participate in one of the motor carrier 
industry's Continuous Traffic Studies, and which derive either $1 
million or more in annual operating revenues from this issue traffic or 
1 percent or more of the total annual operating revenues of all carriers 
from the issue traffic. A list of such carriers and the appropriate 
revenue data shall be submitted to corroborate the selection of the 
study carriers. ``Issue traffic'' consists of those shipments on which 
the freight rates or charges would be affected by the rate proposal.
    (c) Respondents shall take a sample of the traffic handled by the 
study carriers according to acceptable standards of probability sampling 
principles and practices, and shall explain and evaluate the probability 
sample from the standpoint of: Purpose, sample design (including 
explanation of estimation procedure and disclosure of sampling errors 
for derived characteristics), quality control aspects involved in 
processing and tabulating data and any statistical analysis performed on 
the sampled data.<SUP>4
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Although not adopted by the Commission, attention is called to a 
staff report, ``Guidelines for the Presentation of the Results of Sample 
Studies,'' February 1, 1971, available from the Superintendent of 
Documents.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) For cost and revenue purposes, the ``carried'' tariff basis 
shall be used. ``Carried'' tariff means the issue traffic handled solely 
by the study carriers, either single-line or interline. Estimates of 
current revenues applicable to the issue traffic should reflect all 
rates and charges in effect no later than 45 days prior to the date of 
tariff filing.


<R05>
Sec. 1139.3  Cost study.

    (a) The respondents shall submit a cost study. Highway Form B may be 
used for this purpose. Service unit-costs shall be developed for each 
individual study carrier, adjusted by size of shipment and length of 
haul, and shall be applied to respective individual carrier's traffic 
service units as developed

[[Page 235]]

from its traffic study. Operating ratios shall be determined for the 
issue traffic handled by the study carriers on the ``carried'' basis by 
individual weight brackets included within the rate proposal, for: (1) 
The traffic study year, that is, the ``base-calendar year--actual,'' as 
hereinbefore defined, (2) a ``present proforma year'' reflecting 
conditions prevailing on a date no later than 45 days prior to the date 
of the tariff filing, and (3) a ``restated proforma year'' based on 
conditions anticipated on the effective date of the proposed rates, with 
a separation indicating projected operating ratios on two bases, namely, 
``based on current revenues,'' and ``based on proposed revenues''. 
Operating ratios shall also be shown for all other traffic not affected 
by the rate proposal for the same weight brackets as shown for the issue 
traffic, but only for the period indicated in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section.
    (b) In addition to the operating ratios, the cost study shall also 
be used to develop and provide the revenue-to-cost comparisons required 
in Appendix I hereto for the same time periods indicated for the 
operating ratios plus a ``restated proforma year'' based on constructed 
revenue need.
    (c) For both the operating ratios and the revenue-to-cost 
comparisons in Appendix I, the ``each-to-each'' costing method, i.e., 
the application of each individual study carrier's unit-cost to its 
traffic service units, applies only to the ``base calendar year--
actual.'' The application of possible labor and nonlabor cost increases 
for the purpose of updating the ``base calendar year--actual'' cost data 
may be accomplished by the use of either individual carrier data for 
each of the study carriers, or the composite carrier data for those 
study carriers whose revenue from the issue traffic amount to 50 percent 
or more of their total system revenues for the ``base calendar year--
actual.'' The sample values for expenses and revenues shall be expanded 
to full year values without adjustments to known annual report figures 
of any carrier.
    (d) Where cost studies are developed through the use of computer 
processing techniques, there shall be submitted a manual application of 
the costing procedures used for one traffic and cost study carrier 
(study carrier) in order to demonstrate the procedures by which the 
computer program distributes the annual report statistics, and applies 
service unit-costs to each shipment. An illustration of the application 
of service unit-costs to the applicable traffic service units generated 
by one single-line sample shipment and by one interline sample shipment 
shall also be submitted. These sample shipments shall be on the 
``Carried'' basis.


<R05>
Sec. 1139.4  Revenue need.

    Traffic and cost study carrier, i.e., the study carriers, shall 
submit evidence of the sum of money, in addition to operating expenses, 
including that needed to attract debt and equity capital, which they 
require to insure financial stability and the capacity to render 
service. This evidence shall include data required by Appendix I, parts 
I and II, and Appendix II.


<R05>
Sec. 1139.5  Affiliate data.

    Each individual traffic and cost study carrier having transactions 
with affiliates, subject to the reporting requirements of schedules 
9009-A and 9009-B in the annual report for class I motor carriers, shall 
submit appropriate data and analyses reflecting the effect on the parent 
carrier's profits of transactions with affiliates. Such data and 
analyses shall be adequately supported, and there shall be submitted 
such underlying data as will permit a reconciliation of these data to 
the data supplied in the appropriate schedules of each carrier's annual 
report.

<R05>
Sec. 1139.6  Official notice.

    The Commission will take official notice of all of the proponent 
carriers' annual and quarterly reports on file with the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 1139.7  Service.

    The detailed information called for herein shall be in writing and 
shall be verified by a person or persons having knowledge thereof. The 
original and 10 copies of each verified statement for the use of the 
Commission shall be

[[Page 236]]

filed with the Secretary, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 
20423. One copy of each statement shall be sent by first-class mail to 
each of the regional offices of the Commission in the area affected by 
the proposed increase, where it will be open to public inspection. A 
copy of each statement shall be mailed by first-class mail to each party 
of record in the last formal proceeding concerning a general rate 
increase in the affected area or territory. However, one copy of each 
statement shall be sent by express mail to any person undertaking to 
bear the cost. Written request for this expedited service must be made 
no less than 5 days before the statement is due to be filed with the 
Commission. Otherwise, the service requirements of 49 CFR 1104.12 should 
be observed. Information with respect to carrier affiliates may be 
served on the parties in summary form, if so desired. A copy of each 
statement shall be furnished to any interested person on request.

[47 FR 49577, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 53 FR 19302, May 27, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 1139.8  Availability of underlying data.

    All underlying data used in preparation of the material outlined 
above shall be made available in the office of the party serving such 
verified matter during usual office hours for inspection by any party of 
record desiring to do so, and shall be made available to the Commission 
upon request therefor. The underlying data shall be made available also 
at the hearing, but only if and to the extent specifically requested in 
writing and required by any party for the purpose of cross-examination. 
Since appendix I data are to be submitted on a combined carrier basis, 
any underlying individual carrier data used to complete appendix I 
should be furnished to the Commission for its use as well as for the use 
of parties opposing the sought increases.

Note A: This procedure allocates constant costs and the sum of money based on the ton and ton-mile method and   
  should be submitted for the information of the Commission. How much of the constant and sum of money costs may
  or should be recovered by any specific segment of traffic rest on (1) considerations including value of       
  service, demand, and ability to pay, and (2) considerations which involve matters relating to regulatory      
  policy.

Note A: This procedure allocates constant costs and the sum of money based on the dollar (expense) method and   
  should be submitted for the information of the Commission. How much of the constant and sum of money costs may
  or should be recovered by any specific segment of traffic rests on (1) considerations including value of      
  service, demand, and ability to pay, and (2) consideration which invlove matters relating to regulatory       
  policy.                                                                                                       
Note B: Determine the amount of constant costs, including unrelated, by using Statement No. 6-68, Highway Form  
  B, Schedule A, Line 111, column (3) multiplied by 10 percent; insert this amount on line (a).                 
Note C: Determine the amount of variable costs, including unrelated, by using Statement No. 6-68, Highway Form  
  B, Schedule A, line 111, column (3) multiplied by 90 percent to obtain the variable portion.                  
Note D: Show variable expenses allocated to the issue traffic based on an expansion of a sample to a full year. 
                                                                                                                
Footnotes to Appendix I:                                                                                        
                                                                                                                
Explanatory: The Purpose of Appendix I is twofold, namely: (1) to obtain, through part 1, Revenue Need,  an     
  indication of the past actual, present, and restated system revenue needs of the traffic and cost study       
  carriers, which, along with the financial data required in appendix B, will facilitate an analysis of the     
  financial stability of these carriers, and (2) to allocate a part of these system revenue needs to the traffic
  at issue as provided for in part II, line 13. It is that portion of constant and sum of money costs resulting 
  from this allocation plus the related variable expenses (line 14) which produces the total costs assigned to  
  the issue traffic (line 16) which is then compared to the issue traffic revenues in the revenue-to-cost       
  comparison shown on line 17. This comparison provides some indication of how much the total issue traffic is  
  contributing to the carriers' overall revenue needs; and serves as a reference point for the consideration of 
  ratemaking factors, other than costs, which may influence the appropriateness of the issue traffic's          
  contribution.                                                                                                 
Appendix I data should be completed and submitted for all traffic and cost study carriers combined. However,    
  data for the ``base calendar year--actual,'' column (3), should be developed and completed for each traffic   
  and cost study carrier and the results combined for all such carriers. The data in part I, columns (4) through
  (7), which reflect an updating of revenue need data for the ``base calendar year--actual'' to present and     
  restated levels, should be developed on either an individual carrier basis, or on a composite carrier basis   
  comprised of all traffic and cost study carriers. Data in part II, line 14 columns (4) through (7), which     
  reflect an updating of the cost and traffic study data for the ``base calendar year--actual'' to present and  
  restated levels, should be developed by the use of either individual carrier data for each of the study       
  carriers, or the composite carrier data for those study carriers whose revenues from the issue traffic amount 
  to 50 percent or more of their total system revenues for the ``base calendar year--actual.'' However, for line
  14, the method selected should be the same as that used to update the operating ratios to present and restated
  levels as required in .3 Cost study. As indicated above, appendix I data should be completed and submitted    
  only for all traffic and cost study carriers combined. Since appendix I are to be submitted on a combined     
  carrier basis, any underlying individual carrier data used to complete this appendix should be furnished to   
  the Commission for its use as well as for the use of parties opposing the sought increases. Data in columns   
  (4) through (7) must be appropriately explained and supported. Each of the dollar figures called for in these 
  columns shall be accompanied by an explanation of the bases or methods of restatement, including explicit     
  identification of all projected or assumed changes in revenues, in wage rates, in price levels of other       
  expenses and property items, and in productivity, as compared with the preceeding (actual) year results. Note 
  that the time periods referred to in appendix I, that is, ``Base calendar year--actual,'' ``Present proforma  
  year'' and ``Restated proforma year'' are the same time periods indicated in Sec.  1139.3, Cost study.        
\1\ Sources in this column apply to column (3) ``Base calendar year--actual.'' Data for columns (4) through (7) 
  should rely on column (3) as a base in order to reflect data for the ``Present proforma year'' and the        
  ``Restated proforma year.'' Annual report sources apply to class I motor carriers for class II carriers use   
  comparable sources.                                                                                           
\2\ The data in column (3) should reflect the revenue need data (part 1), and the traffic and cost study data   
  (part II), for the traffic study year. That is, the ``Base calendar year--actual,'' which should coincide with
  the ``Base calendar year--actual'' referred to in the Cost study (Sec.  1139.3). Parts I and II should be     
  completed for each individual study carrier--the purpose being to allocate a portion of each carrier's system 
  revenue need to the traffic at issue as provided for in part II. The results for all study carriers should    
  then be aggregated and submitted on a combined carrier basis.                                                 
\3\ The data in column (4) should be based on present wage, price and productivity levels and reflect conditions
  prevailing on a date no later than the 45 days prior to the date of the tariff filing.                        
\4\ The data in columns (5), (6), and (7) should be based on wage, price, and productivity levels anticipated on
  the effective date of the proposed rates.                                                                     
\5\ The purpose of this column is to obtain data on what system revenue needs of the study carriers should be at
  a giving time. Part I should consider the sum of money in addition to operating expenses (including that      
  needed to attract debt and equity capital) which the carriers feel they require to insure financial stability 
  and the capacity to render service.

\6\ In columns (4) through (7), show income taxes based on estimated taxable income reduced by the taxes        
  applicable to other income such as, for example, capital gains transactions.                                  
\7\ In columns (4) through (7), determine the net income based on data shown for lines 1 though 7. In column    
  (7), the estimate of the net income needed should be supported by evidence that it is a just and reasonable   
  amount.                                                                                                       
\8\ Show expenses and revenues allocated to the total issue traffic based on an expansion of the sample to a    
  full year. The amount shown on line 14 for variable expenses should agree with that shown in Method B, line   
  (d).

the Commission

[[Page 240]]

may by order otherwise designate, of agency tariff schedules which 
contain proposed general increases in fares or charges where such 
proposal would result in an increase of $1 million or more in the annual 
operating revenues on the traffic affected by the proposal, the motor 
common carriers of passengers on whose behalf such schedules are filed 
shall, concurrently with the filing of those schedules, file and serve, 
as provided hereinafter, a verified statement presenting and comprising 
the entire evidential case which is relied upon to support the proposed 
general increase. Carriers thus required to submit their evidence when 
they file their schedules are hereby notified that special permission to 
file those schedules shall be conditioned upon the publishing of an 
effective date at least 30 days later than the date of filing, to enable 
proper evaluation of the evidence presented. Data to be submitted in 
accordance with Secs. 1139.21 through 1139.23 represent the minimum data 
required to be filed and served, and in no way shall be considered as 
limiting the type of evidence that may be presented at the time of 
filing of the schedules. If a formal proceeding is instituted, the 
carriers are not precluded from updating the evidence submitted at the 
time of filing of the schedules to reflect the current situation.
    (b) When filing tariff schedules other than those described 
hereinabove, the carriers or their tariff publishing agencies shall be 
required to comply with such procedures as the Commission may direct in 
the event an investigation is instituted. Nothing stated in this part 
shall relieve the carriers of their burden of proof imposed under the 
Interstate Commerce Act.

Sec. 1139.21   Study carriers.

    (a) For the purposes of this proceeding the ``study carriers'' shall 
consist of those Class I motor common carriers of passengers which are 
members of NBTA and which, during the latest calendar year available 
preceding the filing date of the proposed increase in fares and/or 
charges, derived $500,000 or more in annual operating revenues from the 
issue traffic, or 1 percent or more of the total annual operating 
revenues received by all Class I carriers from the issue traffic. Issue 
traffic is defined as that traffic (services) directly affected by the 
proposed increases in fares and/or charges.
    (b) To corroborate the selection of the above study carriers, and to 
provide a data base for a continuing evaluation of the validity and 
usefulness of those carriers as a study group, respondents shall submit, 
as a part of their verified statement (justification), a list of all 
Class I motor common carriers of passengers participating in the issue 
traffic (services). For the above specified calendar year, the dollar 
amounts of total system operating revenues for each such carrier shall 
be arrayed in descending order; and, there shall be shown the amount of 
annual operating revenues received by each carrier from the total 
traffic at issue. Also, to be shown is the percent that each such 
carrier's total issue traffic revenue is to its total system revenues, 
and the percent that each carrier's total issue traffic revenue is to 
the total issue traffic revenues for all Class I carriers indicated in 
the above list. This list of carriers and the carrier's applicable 
revenues shall be referred to as Schedule A, Class I Participating 
Carriers' Revenue Data.

Sec. 1139.22   Revenue data for study carriers.

    The study carriers, as identified above, shall submit the revenue 
data called for in Schedule B herein, the purpose of which is to 
determine the amount of increased revenues which might be expected under 
the proposed increase in fares and/or charges on the issue traffic, and 
to evaluate the revenue aspects of the non-issue traffic, including that 
traffic subject to Interstate Commerce Commission rate regulation but 
not here at issue, and that traffic which is intrastate in character and 
under the jurisdiction of state public commissions.

Commission shall be filed with the Secretary, Interstate Commerce 
Commission, Washington, DC 20423. One copy of each statement shall be 
sent first-class mail to each of the regional offices of the Commission 
in the area affected by the proposed increase, where it will be open to 
public inspection. A copy of each statement shall be mailed by first-
class mail to each party of record in the last formal proceeding 
concerning a general increase in bus passenger fares in the affected 
area or territory. Otherwise, the service requirements of Sec. 1130.1 
shall be observed.


<R05>
Sec. 1139.26   Availability of underlying data.

    All underlying data used in preparation of the material outlined 
above shall be made available in the office of the party serving such

                         Explanatory--Schedule A

    Purpose. The purpose of Schedule A is to corroborate the selection 
of the ``study carriers'', as defined in Sec. 1139.21 of the prescribed 
procedures, and to provide a data base for the continuing evaluation of 
the validity and usefulness of the ``study carrier'' group.
    Calendar Year. For the purpose of this schedule use the latest 
calendar year available preceding the filing date of the proposed 
increased fares and/or charges.
    Column (a). The annual report number is that number assigned to the 
carrier by the Bureau of Accounts, Interstate Commerce Commission, for 
identification purposes.
    Column (b). List Class I carrier members of national Bus Traffic 
Association and other interested Class I carriers participating in the 
tariffs of NBTA which will be affected by the proposal, in descending 
order of total system operating revenues.
    Column (c). Use the following code for this column. For study 
carriers (as defined in Sec. 1139.21) insert ``S''. For non-study 
carriers insert ``NS''.
    Column (d). Use amount shown in carrier's Annual Report, Schedule 
2998, Line 9.
    Column (e). Issue traffic is defined as that traffic (services) 
directly affected by the proposed increase in fares and/or charges.
    Columns (f) and (g). These columns are self-explanatory and are 
obtained by calculations using columns (d) and (e).

                         Explanatory--Schedule B

    Purpose. The purpose of this schedule is to obtain--for each study 
carrier and by totals for all study carriers--(1) total operating 
revenue, (2) revenues attributable to the various types of traffic at 
issue, (3) revenue attributable to the total non-issue traffic, and (4) 
miscellaneous station and other operating revenues. These data shall be 
provided for the specified study periods, namely: Base year actual, pro 
forma year based on current revenues, and pro forma year based on 
proposed revenues.
    The pro forma year based on proposed revenues for the traffic at 
issue will be compared to the issue traffic revenues for the pro forma 
year based on current revenues and for the base year actual to determine 
the amount of the proposed revenue increase being sought over these two 
periods. In addition, the revenue data for the total issue traffic 
(column (d)), will be used in Schedule C, Part III as a basis for 
allocating increased costs, i.e., the increased operating expenses and 
the increased ``sum of money'' costs.
    Base Year Actual. Data to be reported in this and other schedules 
herein for the base year actual shall be based on the 4-quarter calendar 
year periods identified below:

                   Filing Month of Verified Statement                   
January...............................  Sept. 30, preceding year.       
February..............................      Do.                         
March.................................      Do.                         
April.................................  Dec. 31, preceding year.        
May...................................      Do.                         
June..................................      Do.                         
July..................................  Mar. 31, filing-month year.     
August................................      Do.                         
September.............................      Do.                         
October...............................  June 30, filing-month year.     
November..............................      Do.                         
December..............................  June 30, filing-month year.     
                                                                        


[[Page 244]]

    The 4-quarter calendar year periods identified above represent the 
minimum requirement. However, in event a proposed fare/charge increase 
is filed at a time when data for a more current quarter than that 
specified are obtainable then that more current quarter may be used in 
the base year actual. For example, if an increase is filed in late March 
and data for the 4th quarter of the preceding year are obtainable, then 
the base year actual ending December 31 may be used in lieu of the base 
year actual ending September 30.
    Pro forma year data. Revenue data for the pro forma year shall be 
reported in two ways, namely: Based on current revenues and based on 
proposed revenues. Separate schedules are required for each pro forma 
year. These data do not represent a forecast but reflect the results of 
12 months of operation at particular rate levels. Thus, data for the pro 
forma year based on current revenues should be based on a restatement of 
the revenue data for the base year actual to reflect fares and/or 
charges which are currently in effect. Similarly data for the pro forma 
year based on proposed revenues should reflect a restatement of the base 
year actual data but at levels reflecting the proposed fares and/or 
charges.
    Column (a). Insert in this column the company name of each ``study 
carrier'' as defined in Sec. 1139.21 of the prescribed procedures.
    Column (b). Use carrier's Annual Report, Schedule 2998, Line 9. The 
dollar amount in this column, for each study carrier, should equal the 
total of columns (d), (e), and (f).
    Columns (c-1), (c-2), etc. As defined in Sec. 1139.21, ``issue 
traffic'' means that traffic (service) affected by the proposed increase 
in fares and/or charges, and is limited to the fares and/or charges 
published in schedules and tariffs filed with the Interstate Commerce 
Commission. For the purpose of the proposed increases filed under the 
prescribed procedures of this proceeding, column (c) should be 
subdivided into columns (c-1), (c-2), etc. to show separately the 
revenue for each type of traffic in issue and each column should be 
appropriately headed. For instance, a proposal to increase passenger 
fares and express rates would call for Intercity Passenger Revenue in 
column (c-1), and Express Revenue in column (c-2). If a third basic 
service is included in the proposed increase, column (c-3) should show 
revenue from that traffic with an appropriate identification in this 
column heading.
    Column (d). The total issue traffic revenues in this column should 
equal the sum of columns (c-1), (c-2), etc.
    Column (e). The revenues to be reported in this column shall consist 
of those revenues other than ``total issue traffic revenue'' (Column 
(d)), and ``miscellaneous station and other operating revenues'' (Column 
(f)). Thus, ``non-issue traffic revenue'' means those revenues accruing 
from providing the types of services indicated in columns (c-1), etc., 
but which may be ``intrastate'' in nature, are ``exempt'' as provided 
under 49 U.S.C. 10721, 10722, 10723 and 10724, or which are otherwise 
not at issue in a proposed fare and/or charge increase. Such non-issue 
traffic may also include a commuter or mass transportation service, 
which is the transportation of passengers generally performed within a 
city or town and the suburban areas contiguous thereto. However, in some 
instances this service may also be intercity in character where the 
cities involved are within relatively short distances of each other and 
the primary purpose is the mass transportation of commuter passengers to 
and from these cities.
    Column (f). For the purpose of this schedule the revenues to be 
reported in this column shall consist of those in Account 3600, 
Miscellaneous Station Revenue, and in Account 3900, Other Operating 
Revenue. (See 49 CFR Part 1206.)
    Presentation of statement on revenue sample studies. Historically, 
in order to separate interstate from intrastate revenues, it has not 
been necessary for annual report purposes for each carrier to conduct 
studies of its traffic operations, whether based upon sampling or 
otherwise, however, many of the Class I carriers make such studies for 
managerial purposes. In order to permit the evaluation of such studies, 
and the evidence derived therefrom, each study carrier, as defined in 
section 1139.21, shall submit an affidavit explaining how its study was 
conducted and how it appraises the reliability of the results. Carriers 
having studies based upon sampling should conform with the staff report 
entitled ``Guidelines for the Presentation of the Results of Sample 
Studies,'' February 1, 1971.

             Explanatory--Schedule C (Parts I, II, and III)

    Columns (d) through (h). These columns shall contain the pro forma 
year data.
    The data reported in column (d) shall be the base year actual 
(column (c)) restated to reflect conditions (wage, price, and 
productivity, etc.) prevailing on or near the effective date of the 
proposed increase. Revenues in column (d) shall be based on fares and 
charges which are currently in effect.
    The data reported in column (e) shall also be the base year actual 
(column (c)) restated to reflect conditions (wage, price, and 
productivity, etc.) prevailing on or near the effective date of the 
proposed increase. Unlike column (d), however, revenues in column (e) 
shall be based on the proposed fares and charges.
    The data reported in column (f) shall also be the base year actual 
(column (c)) restated to reflect conditions (wage, price, and 
productivity, etc.) prevailing on or near the effective date of the 
proposed increase plus allowable foreseeable future costs. Revenues 
shall be based on the proposed fares and charges.
    The data reported in columns (g) and (h) shall be based on what the 
system revenue needs of the study carriers should be at a given time, 
including the constructed projected and future operating expenses and 
the constructed ``sum of money'' above these expenses. The constructed 
``sum of money'' should be supported by evidence that it is a just and 
reasonable amount and is that needed to attract debt and equity capital 
and to insure financial stability and the capacity to render service. 
Such evidence should include an analysis of the adequacy of the 
carriers' earnings, the carriers' cost of debt and equity capital, the 
various kinds of risk attending their operations and the financing 
thereof, and the carriers' ongoing needs for working capital, new 
equipment and facilities.

                    Explanatory--Schedule D (Part I)

    Purpose. The purpose of Schedule D (Part I) is to ascertain the 
financial posture of Greyhound Lines, Inc. and all the study carrier 
carriers by an analysis of certain key financial data, with a view to 
determining revenue needs.
    Study Carrier Groupings. Schedule D (Part I) shall be prepared on 
the following two bases:
    1. Greyhound Lines, Inc.
    2. Trailways Combined (study carriers, only)
    3. All Study Carriers
    Column (b). The annual report sources in this column refer to the 
1976 Annual Report Form MP-1. For years prior or subsequent to 1976, use 
comparable sources.
    Column (c). If the fare/charge increase is filed during the first 
six months of the calendar year, the data reported in column (c) shall 
be based on the 3rd calendar year preceding the filing year. For 
example, if the rate increase is filed on May 15, 1977, column (c) shall 
report data for calendar year 1974.
    If the fare/charge increase is filed during the last six months of 
the calendar year, the data reported in column (c) shall be based on the 
2nd calendar year preceding the filing year. For example, if the rate 
increase is filed on Nov. 15, 1977, column (c) should report data for 
calendar year 1975.
    Column (d). If the fare/charge increase is filed during the first 
six months of the calendar year, the data reported in column (d) should 
be based on the 2nd calendar year preceding the filing year. For 
example, if the rate increase is filed on May 15, 1977, column (d) 
should report data for calendar year 1975.
    If the rate increase is filed during the last six months of the 
calendar year, the data reported in column (d) shall be based on the 1st 
calendar year preceding the filing year. If, for example, the fare/
charge increase is filed on November 15, 1977, column (d) should report 
data for calendar year 1976.
    Column (e). Data to be reported in this column for the base year 
actual shall be based on the 4-quarter calendar year periods identified 
below:

December..............................      Do.                         
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The 4-quarter calendar year periods identified above represent the 
minimum requirement. However, in event a proposed fare/charge increase 
is filed at a time when data for a more current quarter than that 
specified are obtainable, the more current quarter may be used in the 
base year-actual. For example, if an increase is filed in late March and 
data for the 4th quarter of the preceding year is obtainable, the base 
year-actual ending December 31, may be used in lieu of the base year-
actual ending September 30.

                    Explanatory--Schedule D (Part II)

    Purpose. Schedule D (Part II) is designed to segregate the impacts 
of: (1) The Commission's deferred tax accounting rule change; and (2) 
the impact of the investment tax credit on continuing operations.
    Study Carrier Groupings. The study carrier groups for Part II shall 
be the same as those designated for Part I.
    Column (b). The annual report sources in this column refer to the 
1976 Annual Report Form MP-1. For years prior or subsequent to 1976, use 
comparable sources.
    Columns (c), (d) and (e). The reporting periods for Part II shall 
correspond to those in Part I.
    Investment Tax Credit Impact. This impact is: (1) The amount by 
which Account 8000, Income Taxes on Income from Continuing Operations, 
was credited for the investment tax credit if the flow-through 
accounting method was elected or (2) the amount by which Account 8040, 
Provision for Deferred Taxes, was credited for the amortization of the 
investment tax credit if the deferral accounting method was elected.

                         Explanatory--Schedule E

    Purpose. Schedule E is designed to provide the Commission with an 
indication of the carrier's sources and uses of funds over the recent 
past.
    Study Carrier Groupings. Schedule E shall be prepared on the 
following two bases:
    1. Greyhound Lines, Inc.
    2. Trailways Combined (study carriers, only)
    3. All Study Carriers

[[Page 252]]

    ``Funds''. The term ``Funds'' for the purpose of this schedule shall 
include all assets or financial resources even though a transaction may 
not directly affect cash or working capital. For example, the purchase 
of property in exchange for bonds or shares of stock would be an 
application of funds for investment in property provided by the issue of 
securities.
    Sources and uses of funds should be individually disclosed. For 
example, outlays for fixed assets should not be reported net of 
retirements.
    Column (b). The annual report sources in this column refer to the 
1976 Annual Report Form MP-1. For years prior or subsequent to 1976, use 
comparable sources.
    Column (c). If the fare/charge increase is filed during the first 
six months of the calendar year, the data reported in column (c) shall 
be based on the 3rd calendar year preceding the filing year. For 
example, if the rate increase is filed on May 15, 1977, column (c) shall 
report data for calendar year 1974.
    If the fare/charge increase is filed during the last six months of 
the calendar year, the data reported in column (c) shall be based on the 
2nd calendar year preceding the filing year. For example, if the rate 
increase is filed on Nov. 15, 1977, column (c) should report data for 
calendar year 1975.
    Column (d). If the fare/charge increase is filed during the first 
six months of the calendar year, the data reported in column (d) should 
be based on the 2nd calendar year preceding the filing year. For 
example, if the rate increase is filed on May 15, 1977, column (d) 
should report data for calendar year 1975.
    If the rate increase is filed during the last six months of the 
calendar year, the data reported in column (d) shall be based on the 1st 
calendar year preceding the filing year. If, for example, the fare/
charge increase is filed on November 15, 1977, column (d) should report 
data for calendar year 1976.
    Column (e). Data to be reported in this column for the base year-
actual shall be based on the 4-quarter calendar year periods identified 
below:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The 4-quarter calendar year periods identified above represent the 
minimum requirement. However, in event a proposed fare/charge increase 
is filed at a time when data for a more current quarter than that 
specified are obtainable, the more current quarter may be used in the 
base year-actual. For example, if an increase is filed in late March and 
data for the 4th quarter of the preceding year is obtainable, the base 
year-actual ending December 31, may be used in lieu of the base year-
actual ending September 30.

be based on the 3rd calendar year preceding the filing year. If the 
fare/charge increase is filed during the last six months of the calendar 
year, the data reported in column (b) shall be based on the 2nd calendar 
year preceding the filing year.
    Column (c). If the fare/charge increase is filed during the first

  NBTA Will Undertake the Development of a Cost Allocation System for 
                      Motor Carriers of Passengers

    At the conclusion of the hearing in this proceeding, the 
Administrative Law Judge requested a discussion of the feasibility of 
NBTA undertaking the traffic and cost studies necessary to permit the 
separation of bus carrier expenses by types of service. As the record in 
this case indicates, no such studies have ever been undertaken and there 
is no present capability on the part of either the Commission or the 
carriers themselves to allocate total operating expenses by types of 
carrier service. As the testimony of Mr. Bilz reveals, data derived from 
traffic studies is the source of only a few of the factors which must be 
developed to permit the identification of cost.<SUP>18 Consequently, the 
development of a carefully conceived overall cost allocation system must 
be accomplished first, and then a determination must be made of the 
types and kinds of studies needed to develop the specific factors 
required for implementation to the system.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>18 Tr. 183-186.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At its annual meeting held in Newton, Massachusetts, on September 
27-28, 1976, the members of the National Bus Traffic Association 
considered the question of undertaking the analyses, planning, and 
studies leading to the development and implementation of a cost 
allocation system and agreed to undertake such a program. Mr. Bilz, the 
cost analyst retained by the Association, has been request to work with 
appropriate carrier personnel and an initial meeting to outline the 
first steps is scheduled to be held during November of this year. In the 
meantime, after consultation with Mr. Bilz, we set forth the following 
discussion of what will be involved.
    In assessing the problems and complexities involved in formulating a 
procedure to develop costs by types of service for the bus lines, some 
parallels may be drawn with the procedure which has evolved over the 
years for general commodity motor carriers. Cost formulas for general 
commodity carriers were developed by the Cost Finding Section of the 
Interstate Commerce Commission more than thirty years ago. These cost 
formulas have been modified and refined from time-to-time in order to 
adjust for changing operating practices and conditions, improvements in 
accounting technology or the need to develop costs for particular kinds 
of service or types of traffic. At a later point in time when the need 
arose in general revenue increase cases for more detailed separations of 
the expenses of the general commodity carriers among types of service 
and types of traffic, procedures were developed whereby a continuing 
sample of traffic data could be developed to tie in with unit costs 
produced by the motor carrier cost formulas.<SUP>19 Thus, the detailed 
separation of traffic data developed in the continuing traffic studies 
was designed to tie in with existing cost allocation formulas. More 
recently, a complete revision of the Uniform System of Accounts for 
general commodity motor carriers necessitated further modification of 
the cost formulas; however, at the same time, such revisions served to 
increase the amount of expenses allocated in the formulas on a direct 
basis and reduced the amount of expenses which could only be allocated 
by means of factors derived from special studies or other means.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>19 Probability sampling of general freight motor carrier 
traffic did not develop until some 20 years after the Commission's cost 
formulas for truck lines.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At the present time, the bus industry has committed itself to a 
review of its Uniform System of Accounts, jointly with the Bureau of 
Accounts of the Interstate Commerce Commission, to determine the need 
for revising the accounts to conform more closely with generally 
accepted accounting principles and, most importantly, to facilitate cost 
finding and financial analysis. In the review and analysis of the 
Uniform System of Accounts, consideration should be given to possible 
benefits from a matrix approach in accumulating operating expenses, 
similar in some respects but not necessarily as detailed as the approach 
used in redesigning the system of accounts for general commodity 
carriers. The separations of expenses for bus lines need not be as 
detailed as those made for general commodity carriers since the needs 
for expense segregations are not the same. However, use of a matrix 
system by the bus lines to accumulate operating expenses would result in 
the direct assignment of various categories of expense which would 
otherwise be included in a common pool of expense to be allocated on the 
basis of the best available data. Therefore, as a necessary preliminary 
step toward the development of a cost allocation system for the bus 
lines, the Uniform System of Accounts must be examined for the purpose 
of identifying expenses which can be directly assigned to particular 
services or operations.
    Basically, a cost study for the bus lines involves, first, a 
determination of the expenses chargeable to each of the various services 
provided by the carriers. These services include regular route intercity 
service, involving transportation of passengers, express, baggage, 
newspapers and mail, local service and special services including 
charter operations and tours. Secondly, the need for further separations 
within these categories must be explored. An all-out study would involve 
the allocation of expenses for regular route service among passengers 
and their baggage, express traffic and all other traffic;

[[Page 256]]

however, such detailed separations--which can only be made by means of 
specially-designed allocating procedures and special studies--may not be 
necessary, at least in the initial design of a cost allocation system 
for the bus lines. From the standpoint of current and potential use to 
be made of cost study data, it is reasonable, at this point, to design a 
system which will separate expenses for regular route service involving 
passenger and express traffic (including baggage) on the one hand, and 
all other services on the other. Finally, an additional separation of 
the expenses for regular route service between interstate and intrastate 
traffic is necessary.
    In connection with the first step, i.e., allocation of expenses 
among services, although a number of the various categories of expense 
incurred by the bus lines may be directly allocated to various services, 
there are additional items of expense which are jointly incurred in 
connection with two or more services and can only be separated among 
services on the basis of appropriate allocation factors. The same 
problems arise in the second and third steps, to an even greater extent, 
in determining the extent to which expenses assigned to a particular 
service must be allocated among the various types of traffic handled in 
that service and in making the further separation between interstate and 
intrastate traffic. These separations should be made by means of cost 
allocation factors which are functionally related to the fullest extent 
possible to each item of expense. This calls for the development of 
additional allocation factors which are not presently maintained by the 
bus lines.
    At the present time, the carriers can accurately determine from 
their regularly maintained accounting records the amount of revenue 
accruing from regular route operations, separately for passenger and 
express service, and from operations in connection with charter and 
special service. By means of established probability sampling 
procedures, Greyhound and Continental Trailways can further separate 
passenger revenue in intercity service between interstate and intrastate 
traffic. Other carriers are able to make the latter separation of 
revenue on various bases consistent with the size of their operations. 
It is possible that the probability sampling procedure and other bases 
employed by the smaller carriers may be expanded to include statistical 
data as well as revenue information. The bus lines currently maintain 
records, for the purpose of their annual reports to the Interstate 
Commerce Commission, of the number of bus miles operated separately for 
intercity service, local service and special services. Such data will 
undoubtedly come into use in allocating expenses among services. 
Similarly, records of the number of passengers carried in various 
services, maintained by the bus lines, may be used in some of the 
expense allocations. However, no continuing records are maintained 
showing the number of passengers carried separately in interstate and 
intrastate commerce nor are any separations made of the number of 
passenger miles in each category. Such statistical separations are 
required regardless of the methodology followed in the cost study, that 
is, whether the separations of expenses between interstate and 
intrastate traffic are made within the framework of a cost allocation 
formula or whether the expenses in each category are developed on the 
basis of average mileage-related and non-mileage unit costs developed 
from a cost formula and applied to traffic service units developed for 
interstate and intrastate traffic, i.e., number of passengers and number 
of passenger miles.
    As noted above, expenses for each type of traffic must be separated 
between those which are related to mileage operated and those which are 
not related to mileage. This brings in the problem of segregating the 
terminal activities of the carriers among services and types of traffic. 
Segregation of such expenses will probably require time and motion 
analyses, calculation of space utilization factors at various 
representative terminals and other special studies.
    The formulation of a cost allocation system and the gathering of 
input data for the system will require an extensive amount of work and 
expense on the part of the bus lines. If the amount of time required in 
developing acceptable cost allocation procedures for general freight 
motor carriers is any indication, several years may be required before a 
cost system for the bus lines can be formulated, applied and tested. The 
bus industry recognizes that, because of its workload and limited staff, 
the Cost Finding Section of the Commission cannot take on the task of 
developing a cost allocation system for the bus lines as it did in 
connection with general freight motor carriers; however, it is hoped 
that the efforts of the bus lines in this regard will receive the full 
support and guidance of the Commission's staff so that the best possible 
results may be achieved in the shortest possible time.

<R05>
Sec. 1141.1  Procedures to calculate interest rates.

    (a) For purposes of complying with a Commission decision in a 
complaint or investigation proceeding, interest rates

[[Page 257]]

to be computed shall be the coupon equivalent yield (investment rate) of 
marketable securities of the United States Government having a duration 
of 91 days (3 months). The rate levels will be determined as follows:
    (1) For investigation proceedings, the interest rate shall be the 
coupon equivalent yield in effect on the date the statement is filed 
accounting for all amounts received under the new rates (See 49 U.S.C. 
10707(d)(1)).
    (2) For complaint proceedings, the interest rate shall be the coupon 
equivalent yield in effect on the first day of the calendar quarter in 
which an unlawful charge is paid. The interest rate in complaint 
proceedings shall be updated as of the first day of all subsequent 
calendar quarters, at the coupon equivalent yields in effect on those 
days. Updating will continue until the required reparation payments are 
made.
    (3) For purposes of this section, coupon equivalent yields shall be 
considered ``in effect'' on the date the securities are issued, not on 
the date they are auctioned. If the date the statement is filed (for 
investigation proceedings) or if the first day of the calendar quarter 
(for complaint proceedings) is the same as the issue date, then the 
yield on that date shall be used.
    (b) Interest in a complaint or investigation proceeding shall be 
compounded quarterly, as follows:
    (1) For investigation proceedings, the reparations period shall 
begin on the date the investigation is started. Thus, unless by 
coincidence, the quarterly compounding periods in investigation 
proceedings will not coincide with the calendar quarters.
    (2) For complaint proceedings, the reparations period shall begin on 
the date the unlawful charge is paid. However, in order for the 
quarterly compounding periods in complaint cases to coincide with the 
calendar quarters (so that only one interest rate is in effect during 
each compounding period), the first compounding period shall run from 
the date the unlawful charge is paid to the last day of the current 
calendar quarter, and all subsequent compounding periods shall coincide 
with the calendar quarters.
    (3) For both investigation and complaint proceedings, the annual 
effective interest rate shall be the same as the annual nominal (or 
stated) rate. Thus, the nominal rate must be factored exponentially to 
the power representing the portion of the year covered by the interest 
rate. A simple multiplication of the nominal rate by the portion of the 
year covered by the interest rate would not be appropriate because it 
would result in an effective rate in excess of the nominal rate. Under 
this ``exponential'' approach, the total cumulative reparations payment 
(including interest) is calculated by multiplying the interest factor 
for each quarterly period (or part thereof) by the principal amount for 
that period plus any accumulated interest from previous periods. The 
``interest factor'' for each period is 1.0 plus the interest rate for 
that period to the power representing the portion of the year covered by 
the interest rate. As an example, if the annual interest rate for the 
quarter is 5.6 percent, then the interest factor would be 1.01368, or 
1.056 to the power of 91/365.

an intercity motor carrier of passengers under provisions of the zone of 
rate freedom shall file a formal complaint. The complaint may challenge 
only the reasonableness of the rate or fare under these special rules. 
Complaints on other grounds, such as discrimination or predatory 
practices, shall be filed under other sections of 49 CFR part 1131.
    (b) A formal complaint must contain the correct, unabbreviated names 
and addresses of each complainant and defendant. It should set forth 
briefly and in plain language the facts upon which it is based. It 
should include specific reference to pertinent statutory provisions and 
Commission regulations, and should advise the Commission and the 
defendant fully in what respects these provisions or regulations have 
been or are violated or will be violated. The complaint should contain a 
detailed statement of the relief requested. Relief in the alternative or 
of several different types may be demanded, but the issues raised should 
not be broader than those to which complainant's verified statement is 
directed.
    (c) Complainant's verified statement of facts and argument shall be 
filed simultaneously with its complaint, and they shall constitute 
complainant's case-in-chief. Whatever evidence is relied upon shall be 
set forth in sufficient detail to support the complaint, such as cost of 
service, rate or fare comparisons, or other information which may be 
pertinent (such as type of service rendered, distance traveled, or 
patronage experienced).
    (d) Complainant shall serve a copy of its complaint and a copy of 
its verified statement on defendant on the same day that these pleadings 
are filed with the Commission. Such service and filing shall comply with

carriers providing intrastate service. (Commission preemption of State 
jurisdiction over passenger exit is covered at 49 CFR part 1169.)


<R05>
Sec. 1143.2  Commission jurisdiction.

    If an interstate passenger carrier has requested of a proper State 
authority permission to establish an increased intrastate rate, rule, or 
practice and all or part of the request has been denied, or the State 
has not taken final action (in whole or in part) on the request within 
120 days, the carrier may petition the Interstate Commerce Commission 
for review.


<R05>
Sec. 1143.3  Petition.

    A petition for review shall include the following:
    (a) A cover sheet indicating that the filing is authorized under 49

    Source: 50 FR 46066, Nov. 6, 1985, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1144.1  Notification, explanation, and justification.

    (a) Notification. A rail carrier proposing to cancel a through route 
and/or a joint rate shall comply with the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 
10762(c)(3) and 10705a(f), as appropriate, and 49 CFR part 1312, and 
shall give notice of its intent to make such a cancellation 45 days 
prior to the effective date of the cancellation. For cancellations under 
49 U.S.C. 10705(e), the 45-day period must consist of at least a 25-day 
notice of intent to file followed by a 20-day tariff filing in 
compliance with 49 U.S.C. 10762(c)(3).
    (b) Explanation and justification--(1) Request. After a rail carrier 
has given notice of a proposed cancellation, any

[[Page 260]]

affected party may ask the canceling rail carrier to:
    (i) Explain how the proposed cancellation will affect the party, and
    (ii) Justify the application of the cancellation to a route or rate 
actively used by or participated in by the party.
    (2) Reply. The rail carrier proposing the cancellation must give the 
party the requested explanation and justification, including pertinent 
mileage and cost data, within 10 days of the date the request is made.
    (3) Time. By mutual agreement, the rail carrier proposing the 
cancellation and the affected party may alter the time frames of 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The 49 CFR part 1132 time periods for 
protests and replies apply.
    (4) Content. The content of the request and reply (other than 
pertinent mileage and cost data) will be left to the parties, though all 
information pertinent to the individual case should be included. The 
failure to provide information necessary to analyze the action under the 
criteria established in Sec. 1144.3 may be treated as an admission 
against interest.

[50 FR 46066, Nov. 6, 1985; 51 FR 18333, May 19, 1986; 56 FR 18532, Apr. 
23, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 1144.2  Negotiation.

    (a) Timing. At least 5 days prior to challenging a cancellation of a 
through route or joint rate, or seeking the prescription of a through 
route, joint rate, or reciprocal switching, the party intending to 
initiate such action must first seek to engage in negotiations to 
resolve its dispute with the prospective defendants.
    (b) Participation. Participation or failure to participate in 
negotiations does not waive a party's right to file a timely request for 
suspension and/or investigation or prescription.
    (c) Arbitration. The parties may use arbitration as part of the 
negotiation process, or in lieu of litigation before the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 1144.3  Suspension.

    (a) General. Under these rules the Commission will suspend and 
investigate, investigate, or not suspend and investigate a proposed 
cancellation of a through route and/or joint rate. A persuasive 
presentation under all of the criteria below is sufficient for the 
Commission to determine that the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 10707(c)(1) 
have been met warranting suspension and investigation of the proposed 
cancellation. Failure to convince the Commission on any one of the 
criteria may result in either only an investigation (no suspension) or a 
determination not to investigate. This will be decided on a case-by case 
basis.
    (b) Statutory factors. A decision under (a) will be made based on 
the broad factors in 49 U.S.C. 10707(c)(1). The criteria considered in 
analyzing the factors in 49 U.S.C. 10707(c)(1) (A and B) are in 
paragraph (c) of this section. The requirements to keep account under 49 
U.S.C. 10707(c)(1)(C) cannot be applied to cancellation cases, and will 
not be considered.
    (c) Criteria. The Commission will suspend and investigate if a 
protestant shows:
    (1) The cancellations of a through route and/or joint rate would 
eliminate effective railroad competition for the affected traffic 
between the origin and destination. Among other evidence, the Commission 
will consider two rebuttable presumptions to show the elimination of 
effective railroad competition: (i) That the mileage between the origin 
and destination over the route to be canceled is not more than that of 
any feasible alternative rail route; and (ii) that the cost of operating 
via the route to be canceled is not more than that of any feasible 
alternative rail route; and
    (2) Either (i) a protesting shipper has used or would use the 
through route and/or joint rate proposed to be canceled to meet a 
significant portion of its current or future railroad transportation 
needs between the origin and destination; or
    (ii) A protesting carrier has used or would use the affected through 
route and/or joint rate for a significant amount of traffic.


<R05>
Sec. 1144.4  Investigation of proposed cancellations.

    (a) General. The Commission shall determine that a proposed 
cancellation of a through route and/or joint rate is contrary to the 
public interest under 49

[[Page 261]]

U.S.C. 10705 if it finds that the cancellation, or a rate that would 
remain in place after the cancellation, is contrary to the competition 
policies of 49 U.S.C. 10101a or is otherwise anticompetitive.
    (b) Factors. In making its determination, the Commission will take 
into account all relevant factors, including:
    (1) The revenues of the involved railroads on the affected traffic 
via the rail routes in question.
    (2) The efficiency of the rail routes in question, including the 
costs of operating via those routes.
    (3) The rates charged or sought to be charged by the canceling 
railroad or railroads.
    (4) The revenues, following the cancellation, of the involved 
railroads for the traffic in question via the affected through route; 
the costs of the involved railroads for that traffic via that route; the 
ratios of those revenues to those costs; and all circumstances relevant 
to any difference in those ratios; provided that the mere loss of 
revenue to an affected carrier will not be a basis for finding that a 
cancellation is anticompetitive.
    (c) Other considerations. (1) The Commission will not consider 
product competition.
    (2) If a railroad wishes to rely in any way on geographic 
competition, it will have the burden of proving the existence of 
effective geographic competition by clear and convincing evidence.
    (3) Where a cancellation has been determined to be contrary to the 
competitive standards of this section, the overall revenue inadequacy of 
the canceling carrier will not excuse such a cancellation.
    (4) Any investigations of proposed cancellations under the terms of 
this paragraph will be conducted and concluded by the Commisson on an 
expedited basis.


<R05>
Sec. 1144.5  Prescription.

    (a) General. A through route or a through rate shall be prescribed 
under 49 U.S.C. 10705, or a switching arrangement shall be established 
under 49 U.S.C. 11103, if the Commission determines:
    (1) That the prescription or establishment (i) is necessary to 
remedy or prevent an act that is contrary to the competition policies of 
49 U.S.C. 10101a or is otherwise anticompetitive, and (ii) otherwise 
satisfies the criteria of 49 U.S.C. 10705 and 11103, as appropriate. In 
making its determination, the Commission shall take into account all 
relevant factors, including:
    (A) The revenues of the involved railroads on the affected traffic 
via the rail routes in question.
    (B) The efficiency of the rail routes in question, including the 
costs of operating via those routes.
    (C) The rates or compensation charged or sought to be charged by the 
railroad or railroads from which prescription or establishment is 
sought.
    (D) The revenues, following the prescription, of the involved 
railroads for the traffic in question via the affected route; the costs 
of the involved railroads for that traffic via that route; the ratios of 
those revenues to those costs; and all circumstances relevant to any 
difference in those ratios; provided that the mere loss of revenue to an 
affected carrier shall not be a basis for finding that a prescription or 
establishment is necessary to remedy or prevent an act contrary to the 
competitive standards of this section; and
    (2) That either:
    (i) The complaining shipper has used or would use the through route, 
through rate, or reciprocal switching to meet a significant portion of 
its current or future railroad transportation needs between the origin 
and destination; or
    (ii) The complaining carrier has used or would use the affected 
through route, through rate, or reciprocal switching for a significant 
amount of traffic.
    (b) Other considerations. (1) The Commission will not consider 
product competition.
    (2) If a railroad wishes to rely in any way on geographic 
competition, it will have the burden of proving the existence of 
effective geographic competition by clear and convincing evidence.
    (3) When prescription of a through route, a through rate, or 
reciprocal switching is necessary to remedy or prevent an act contrary 
to the competitive standards of this section, the

[[Page 262]]

overall revenue inadequacy of the defendant railroad(s) will not be a 
basis for denying the prescription.
    (4) Any proceeding under the terms of this section will be conducted 
and concluded by the Commission on an expedited basis.


<R05>
Sec. 1144.6  General.

    (a) These rules will govern the Commission's adjudication of 
individual cases pending on or after the effective date of these rules 
(October 31, 1985).
    (b) These rules supersede the rules at 49 CFR part 1132 to the 
extent they are inconsistent.
    (c) Discovery under these rules is governed by the Commission's 
general rules of discovery at 49 CFR part 1114.
    (d) Any Commission determinations or findings under this part with 
respect to compliance or non-compliance with the standards of 
Secs. 1144.4 and 1144.5 shall not be given any res judicata or 
collateral estoppel effect in any litigation involving the same facts or 
controversy arising under the antitrust laws of the United States.

              Subpart A--Applications Under 49 U.S.C. 10901


<R05>
Sec. 1150.1  Introduction.

    (a) When an application is required. This subpart governs 
applications under 49 U.S.C. 10901 for a certificate of

[[Page 263]]

public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction, 
acquisition or operation of railroad lines. Noncarriers require 
Commission approval under section 10901 to construct, acquire or operate 
a rail line in interstate commerce. Existing carriers require approval 
under section 10901 only to construct a new rail line or operate a line 
owned by a noncarrier, since acquisition by a carrier of an active rail 
line owned by a carrier is covered by 49 U.S.C. 11343. We have exempted 
from these requirements the acquisition by a State entity of a rail line 
that has been approved for abandonment, as well as operations over these 
lines. See subpart C of this part. In addition, where appropriate, we 
have granted individual exemptions from these certification 
requirements. See 49 U.S.C. 10505.
    (b) Content of the application. Applications filed under this 
subpart shall include the information set forth in Secs. 1150.2 through 
1150.9. The applicant must also comply with the Energy and Environmental 
Regulations, at 49 CFR parts 1106 and 1105 (including consulting with 
the Commission's Energy and Environmental Branch at least 6 months prior 
to filing an application, to begin the scoping process to identify 
environmental issues and outline procedures for analysis of this aspect 
of the proposal).

                     Subpart B--Designated Operators


<R05>
Sec. 1150.11  Introduction.

    A certificate of designated operator will be issued to an operator 
providing service pursuant to a rail service continuation agreement 
under section 304 of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, as 
amended by the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 
1976. The designated operator (D-OP) may commence and terminate the 
service in accordance with the terms of the agreement. When service is 
terminated the D-OP must notify all shippers on the line. To obtain a D-
OP certificate, the information in this subpart must be filed with the 
Commission. A copy of the certificate of designated operator shall be 
served on the Association of American Railroads.


<R05>
Sec. 1150.12  Information about the designated operator.

    (a) The name and address of the D-OP.
    (b) If a new corporation or other new business entity, a copy of the 
certificate of incorporation or, if unincorporated, the facts and 
official organizational documents relating to the business entity.
    (c) The names and addresses of all officers and directors, with a 
statement from each which indicates present affiliation, if any, with a 
railroad.
    (d) Sufficient information to establish its financial responsibility 
for the proposed undertaking, unless the D-OP is a common carrier by 
railroad. The nature and extent of all liability insurance coverage, 
including insurance binder or policy number, and name of insurer.


<R05>
Sec. 1150.13  Relevant dates.

    The exact dates of the period of operation which have been agreed 
upon by the D-OP, the offeror of the rail service continuation payment, 
and the owner of the line to be operated, in their lease and operating 
agreements.


<R05>
Sec. 1150.14  Proposed service.

    (a) A copy of all agreements between the D-OP, the offeror of the 
rail service continuation payment, and the owner of the line to be 
operated.
    (b) Any additional information which is necessary to provide the 
Commission with a description of:
    (1) The line over which service is to be provided (e.g., U.S.R.A. 
Line); and
    (2) All interline connections, including the names of the connecting 
railroads.


<R05>
Sec. 1150.15  Information about offeror.

    (a) The name and address of the offeror of the rail service 
continuation payment.
    (b) Sufficient information to establish the financial responsibility 
of the offeror for the proposed undertaking, or if the offeror is a 
State or municipal corporation or authority, a statement that it has 
authority to perform the service or enter into the agreement for 
subsidy.


<R05>
Sec. 1150.16  Procedures.

    Upon receipt of this information, the matter will be docketed by the 
prefix initials ``D-OP.'' Operators may begin operating immediately upon 
the filing of the necessary information (plus three copies). Although 
the designated operator will not be required to seek and obtain 
authority from the Commission either to commence or to terminate 
operations, the designated operator is a common carrier by railroad 
subject to all other applicable provisions of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle IV. 
However, we have exempted designated operators from some aspects of 
regulation. See ``Exempting of Certain Designated Operators from section 
11343, 361 ICC 379 (1979), as modified by No. 79-2457, John W. 
McGinness, Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Railway Labor 
Executives' Association v. Interstate Commerce Commission and United

[[Page 267]]

States of America.'' (U.S.C.A. D.C. Cir., decided August 17, 1981).


<R04>
   Subpart C--Modified Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity


<R05>
Sec. 1150.21  Scope of rules.

    These special rules apply to operations over abandoned rail lines, 
which have been acquired (through purchase or lease) by a State. The 
rail line must have fully abandoned, or approved for abandonment by the 
Commission or a bankruptcy court. As used in these rules, the term 
``State'' includes States, political subdivisions of States, and all 
instrumentalities through which the State can act. An operator has the 
option of applying for a modified certificate of public convenience and 
necessity under this subpart or a common carrier certificate under 
Subpart A of this part. A copy of the modified certificate shall be 
served on the Association of American Railroads.


<R05>
Sec. 1150.22  Exemptions and common carrier status.

    The acquisition by a State of a fully abandoned line is not subject 
to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The 
acquisition by a State of a line approved for abandonment and not yet 
fully abandoned is exempted from the Commission's jurisdiction. If the 
State intends to operate the line itself, it will be considered a common 
carrier. However, when a State acquires a rail line described under 
Sec. 1150.21 and contracts with an operator to provide service over the 
line, only the operator incurs a common carrier obligation. The 
operators of these lines are exempted from 49 U.S.C. 10901 and 10903 
which are the statutory requirements governing the start up and 
termination of operations. Operators exempted from these requirements 
must comply with the requirements of this part and must apply for a 
modified certificate of public convenience and necessity. The operator 
is a common carrier and incurs all benefits and responsibilities under 
49 U.S.C. subtitle IV; however, the State through its operational 
agreement or the operator of the line may determine certain 
preconditions, such as payment of a subsidy, which must be met by 
shippers to obtain service over the line. The operator must notify the 
shippers on the line of any preconditions. The modified certificate will 
authorize service to shippers who meet these preconditions and the 
operator will be required to provide complete common carrier service 
under this certificate only to those shippers. (See 363 ICC 132.)


<R05>
Sec. 1150.23  Modified certificate of public convenience and necessity.

    (a) The operator must file a notice with the Commission for a 
modified certificate of public convenience and necessity. Operations may 
commence immediately upon the filing; however, the Commission will 
review the information filed, and if complete, will issue a modified 
certificate notice.
    (b) A notice for a modified certificate of public convenience and 
necessity shall include the following information:
    (1) The name and address of the operator and, unless the operator is 
an existing rail carrier:
    (i) Its articles of incorporation or, if it is unincorporated, the 
facts and organizational documents relating to its formation;
    (ii) The names and addresses of all of its officers and directors 
and a statement indicating any present affiliation each may have with a 
rail carrier; and
    (iii) Sufficient information to establish the financial 
responsibility of the operator.
    (2) Information about the prior abandonment, including docket 
number, status and date of the first decision approving the abandonment.
    (3) The exact dates of the period of operation which have been 
agreed upon by the operator and the State which owns the line (if there 
is any agreement, it should be provided);
    (4) A description of the service to be performed including, where 
applicable, a description of:
    (i) The line over which service is to be performed;
    (ii) All interline connections including the names of the connecting 
railroads;
    (iii) The nature and extent of all liability insurance coverage, 
including

[[Page 268]]

binder or policy number and name of insurer; and
    (iv) Any preconditions which shippers must meet to receive service.
    (5) The name and address of any subsidizers, and
    (6) Sufficient information to establish the financial responsibility 
of any subsidizers (if the subsidizer is a State, the information should 
show that it has authority to enter into the agreement for subsidized 
operations).
    (c) The service offered and the applicable rates, charges, and 
conditions must be described in tariffs published by the operator to the 
Commission's rules.


<R05>
Sec. 1150.24  Termination of service.

    The duration of the service may be determined in the contract 
between the State and the operator. An operator may not terminate 
service over a line unless it first provides 60 days' notice of its 
intent to terminate the service. The notice of intent must be:
    (a) Filed with the State and the Commission, and
    (b) Mailed to all persons that have used the line within the 6 
months preceding the date of the notice.

          Subpart D--Exempt Transactions Under 49 U.S.C. 10901

    Source: 51 FR 2504, Jan. 17, 1986, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1150.31  Scope of exemption.

    (a) Except as indicated below, this exemption applies to all 
acquisitions and operations under section 10901 (See 1150.1, supra). 
This exemption also includes:
    (1) Acquisition by a noncarrier of rail property that would be 
operated by a third party;
    (2) Operation by a new carrier of rail property acquired by a third 
party;
    (3) A change in operators on the line; and
    (4) Acquisition of incidental trackage rights. Incidental trackage 
rights include the grant of trackage rights by the seller, or the 
assignment of trackage rights to operate over the line of a third party 
that occur at the time of the exempt acquisition or operation. This 
exemption does not apply when a class I railroad abandons a line and 
another class I railroad then acquires the line in a proposal that would 
result in a major market extension as defined at Sec. 1180.3(c).
    (b) Other exemptions that may be relevant to a proposal under this 
subpart are the exemption for control at Sec. 1180.2(d)(1) and (2), and 
the from securities regulation at 49 CFR part 1175.


<R05>
Sec. 1150.32  Procedures and relevant dates--transactions that involve creation of Class III carriers.

    (a) To qualify for this exemption, applicant must file a verified 
notice providing details about the transaction, and a brief caption 
summary, conforming to the format in Sec. 1150.34, for publication in 
the Federal Register.
    (b) The exemption will be effective 7 days after the notice is 
filed. The Commission, through the Director of the Office of 
Proceedings, will publish a notice in the Federal Register within 30 
days of the filing. A change in operators would follow the provisions at 
Sec. 1150.34, and notice must be given to shippers.
    (c) If the notice contains false or misleading information, the 
exemption is void ab initio. A petition to revoke under 49 U.S.C. 
10505(d) does not automatically stay the exemption.
    (d) Applicant must preserve intact all sites and structures more 
than 50 years old until compliance with the requirements of Section 106 
of the National Historic Preservation Act, 16 U.S.C. 470 is achieved.

Sec. 1150.36   Exempt construction of connecting track.

    (a) Scope. This class exemption applies to proceedings involving the 
construction and operation of connecting lines of railroad within 
existing rail rights-of-way, or on land owned by connecting railroads, 
under 49 U.S.C. 10901 (a), (b), and (c). (See the reference to 
connecting track in 49 CFR 1105.6(b)(1).) This class exemption is 
designed to expedite and facilitate connecting track construction while 
ensuring full and timely environmental review. The Surface 
Transportation Board (Board) has found that its prior review of 
connecting track construction and operation is not necessary to carry 
out the rail transportation policy of 49 U.S.C. 10101; that continued 
regulation is not necessary to protect shippers from abuse of market 
power; and that the construction of connecting track would be of limited 
scope. See 49 U.S.C. 10502. To use this class exemption, a pre-filing 
notice, environmental report, historic report, and notice of exemption 
must be filed that complies with the procedures in Sec. 1150.36 (b) and 
(c), and the Board's environmental rules, codified at 49 CFR part 1105.
    (b) Environmental requirements. The environmental regulations at 49 
CFR part 1105 must be complied with fully. An environmental report 
containing the information specified at 49 CFR 1105.7(e), as well as an 
historic report containing the information specified at 49 CFR 
1105.8(d), must be filed either before or at the same time as the notice 
of exemption is filed. See 49 CFR 1105.7(a). The entity seeking the 
exemption authority must also serve copies of the environmental report 
on the agencies listed at 49 CFR 1105.7(b). Because the environmental 
report must include a certification that appropriate agencies have been 
consulted in its preparation (see 49 CFR 1105.7(c)), parties should 
begin environmental and historic consultations well before the notice of 
exemption is filed. Environmental requirements may be waived or modified 
where a petitioner demonstrates in writing that such action is 
appropriate. See 49 CFR 1105.10(c). It is to the advantage of parties to 
consult with the Board's Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) at the 
earliest possible date to begin environmental review.
    (c) Procedures and dates. (1) At least 20 days prior to the filing 
of a notice of exemption with the Board, the party seeking the exemption 
authority must notify in writing: the State Public Service Commission, 
the State Department of Transportation (or equivalent agency), and the 
State Clearinghouse (if there is no clearinghouse, the State 
Environmental Protection Agency), of each State involved. The pre-filing 
notice shall include: the name and address of the railroad (or other 
entity proposing to construct the line) and the proposed operator; a 
complete description of the proposed construction and operation, 
including a map; an indication that the class exemption procedure is 
being used; and the approximate date that construction is proposed to 
begin. This pre-filing notice shall include a certification that the 
petitioner will comply with the Board's environmental regulations, 
codified at 49 CFR part 1105, and a statement that those regulations 
generally require the Board to:
    (i) Prepare an environmental assessment (EA) (or environmental 
impact statement (EIS) if necessary),
    (ii) Make the document (EA or EIS, as appropriate) available to the 
parties (and to the public, upon request to SEA); and
    (iii) Accept for filing and consideration comments on the 
environmental document as well as petitions for stay and 
reconsideration.
    (2) Petitioner must file a verified notice of exemption with the 
Board at least 90 days before the construction is proposed to begin. In 
addition to the information contained in Sec. 1150.36(c)(1), the notice 
shall include a statement certifying compliance with the environmental 
rules at 49 CFR part 1105 and the pre-filing notice requirements of 49 
CFR 1150.36(c)(1).

[[Page 271]]

    (3) The Board, through the Director of the Office of Proceedings, 
shall publish a notice in the Federal Register within 20 days after the 
notice of exemption is received that describes the construction project 
and invites comments. SEA will then prepare an EA (or, if necessary, an 
EIS). The EA generally will be made available 15 days after the Federal 
Register notice. It will be served on all parties and appropriate 
agencies. Others may request a copy from SEA. The deadline for 
submission of comments on the EA will generally be within 30 days of its 
availability (see 49 CFR 1105.10(b)). If an EIS is prepared, the time 
frames and procedures set forth in 49 CFR 1105.10(a) generally will 
apply.
    (4) The Board's environmental document (together with any comments 
and SEA's recommendations) shall be used in deciding whether to allow 
the particular construction project to proceed under the class exemption 
and whether to impose appropriate mitigating conditions upon its use 
(including use of an environmentally preferable route). If the Board 
concludes that a particular project will result in serious adverse 
environmental consequences that cannot be adequately mitigated, it may 
deny authority to proceed with the construction under the class 
exemption (the ``no-build'' alternative). Persons believing that they 
can show that the need for a particular line outweighs the adverse 
environmental consequences can file an application for approval of the 
proposed construction under 49 U.S.C. 10901.
    (5) No construction may begin until the Board has completed its 
environmental review and issued a final decision.
    (6) Petitions to stay the effective date of the notice of exemption 
on other than environmental and/or historic preservation grounds must be 
filed within 10 days of the Federal Register publication. Petitions to 
stay the effective date of the notice on environmental and/or historic 
preservation grounds may be filed at any time but must be filed 
sufficiently in advance of the effective date to allow the Board to 
consider and act on the petition before the notice becomes effective. 
Petitions for reconsideration must be filed within 20 days of the 
Federal Register publication.
    (7) The exemption generally will be effective 70 days after 
publication in the Federal Register, unless stayed. If the notice of 
exemption contains false or misleading information, the exemption is 
void ab initio and the Board shall summarily reject the exemption 
notice.
    (8) Where significant environmental issues have been raised or 
discovered during the environmental review process, the Board shall 
issue, on or before the effective date of the exemption, a final 
decision allowing the exemption to become effective and imposing 
appropriate mitigating conditions or taking other appropriate action 
such as selecting the ``no build'' alternative.
    (9) Where there has been full environmental review and no 
significant environmental issues have been raised or discovered, the 
Board, through the Director of the Office of Proceedings, shall issue, 
on or before the effective date of the exemption, a final decision 
consisting of a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) to show that 
the environmental record has been considered (see 49 CFR 1105.10(g)).
    (10) The Board, on its own motion or at the request of a party to 
the case, will stay the effective date of individual notices of 
exemption when an informed decision on environmental issues cannot be 
made prior to the date that the exemption authority would otherwise 
become effective. Stays will be granted initially for a period of 60 
days to permit resolution of environmental issues and issuance of a 
final decision. The Board expects that this 60-day period will usually 
be sufficient for these purposes unless preparation of an EIS is 
required. If, however, environmental issues remain unresolved upon 
expiration of this 60-day period, the Board, upon its own motion, or at 
the request of a party to the case, will extend the stay, as necessary 
to permit completion of environmental review and issuance of a final 
decision. The Board's order will specify the duration of each extension 
of the initial stay period. In cases requiring the preparation of an 
EIS, the Board will extend the stay for a period sufficient to permit

[[Page 272]]

compliance with the procedural guidelines established by the Board's 
environmental regulations.
    (d) Third-Party Consultants. An environmental and historic report 
required under 49 CFR 1105.7 and 1105.8 will not be required where a 
petitioner engages a third-party consultant who is approved by SEA and 
acts under SEA's direction and supervision in preparing the EA or EIS. 
In such a case, the third-party consultant must act on behalf of the 
Board, working under SEA's direction to collect the environmental 
information that is needed and to compile it into a draft EA or EIS, 
which is prepared under SEA's direction and then submitted to SEA for 
its final review and approval. See 49 CFR 1105.10(d).

Sec. 1151.1  Scope.

    This part governs applications filed under 49 U.S.C. 10910. The 
Commission can require the sale of a rail line to a financially 
responsible person. A rail line is eligible for a forced sale if it 
appears in category 1 or 2 of the owning railroad's system diagram map 
(but the railroad has not filed an application to abandon the line), or 
the public convenience and necessity, as defined in 49 U.S.C. 
10910(c)(1), permit or require the sale of the line.

[48 FR 9654, Mar. 8, 1983, as amended at 56 FR 37861, Aug. 9, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 1151.2  Procedures.

    (a) Service. When an application is filed, applicant must 
concurrently serve a copy of the application by first class mail on:
    (1) The owning railroad;
    (2) All rail patrons who originated and/or received traffic on the 
line during the 12-month period preceding the month in which the 
application is filed;
    (3) The designated State agency in the State(s) where the property 
is located;
    (4) County governments where the line is located;
    (5) The National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) (if Amtrak 
operates on the line);
    (6) And the national offices of rail unions with employees on the 
line.
    (b) Acceptance or rejection of an application.
    (1) The Commission, through the Director of the Office of 
Proceedings, will accept a complete application no later than 30 days 
after the application is filed by publishing a notice in the Federal 
Register. An application is complete if it has been properly served and 
contains substantially all information required by Sec. 1151.3, except 
as modified by advance waiver. The notice will also announce the 
schedule for filing of competing applications and responses.
    (2) The Commission, through the Director of the Office of 
Proceedings, will reject an incomplete application by serving a decision 
no later than 30 days after the application is filed. The decision will 
explain specifically why the application was incomplete. A revised 
application may be submitted, incorporating portions of the prior 
application by reference.
    (c) Competing applications.
    (1) Unless otherwise scheduled in the notice, competing applications 
by other parties seeking to acquire all or any portion of the line 
sought in the initial application are due within 30 days after the 
initial application is accepted.
    (2) The Commission, through the Director of the Office of 
Proceedings, will issue a decision accepting or rejecting a competing 
application no later than 15 days after it is filed. A competing 
application will be rejected if it does not substantially contain the 
information required by Sec. 1151.3, except as modified by advance 
waiver.
    (d) Incomplete applications.
    (1) If an applicant seeking to file an initial or competing 
application is unable to obtain required information that is primarily 
or exclusively within the personal knowledge of the owning carrier, the 
applicant may file an incomplete application if it files at the same 
time a request for discovery under 49 CFR part 1114 to obtain the needed 
information from the owning carrier.
    (2) The Commission, through the Director of the Office of 
Proceedings, will by decision conditionally accept incomplete initial or 
competing applications, if the Director determines that the discovery 
sought is necessary for the application and primarily or exclusively 
within the knowledge of the owning carrier.
    (3) When the information sought through discovery has been filed for 
an initial application, Federal Register notice under paragraph (b) of 
this section will be published.
    (4) When the information sought through discovery has been filed for 
a competing application, a decision will be issued under paragraph (c) 
of this section.
    (e) Comments. Unless otherwise scheduled in the notice, verified 
statements and comments addressing both the initial and competing 
applications must be filed within 60 days after the initial application 
is accepted.

[[Page 275]]

    (f) Replies. Unless otherwise scheduled in the notice, verified 
replies by applicants and other interested parties must be filed within 
80 days after the initial application is accepted.
    (g) Publication. If the Commission finds that the public convenience 
and necessity require or permit sale of the line, the Commission shall 
concurrently publish this finding in the Federal Register.
    (h) Acceptance or rejection. If the Commission concludes that sale 
of the line should be required, the applicant(s) must file a notice with 
the Commission and the owning railroad accepting or rejecting the 
Commission's determination. The notice must be filed within 10 days of 
the service date of the decision.
    (i) Selection. If two or more applicants timely file notices 
accepting the Commission's determination, the owning railroad must 
select the applicant to which it will sell the line and file notice of 
its selection with the Commission and serve a copy on the applicants 
within 15 days of the service date of the Commission decision.
    (j) Waiver. Prior to filing an initial or competing application, an 
applicant may file a petition to waive or clarify specific portions of 
part 1151. A decision by the Director of the Office of Proceedings 
granting or denying a petition for waiver or clarification will be 
issued within 30 days of the date the petition is filed. Appeals from 
the Director's decision will be decided by the entire Commission.
    (k) Extension. Extensions of filing dates may be granted for good 
cause.

include the following information in the form of verified statements:
    (1) Identification of the line to be purchased including:
    (i) The name of the owning carrier; and
    (ii) The exact location of the line to be purchased including 
milepost designations, origin and termination points, stations located 
on the line, and cities, counties and States traversed by the line.
    (2) Identification of applicant including:
    (i) The applicant's name and address;
    (ii) The name, address, and phone number of the representative to 
receive correspondence concerning this application;
    (iii) A description of applicant's affiliation with any railroad; 
and
    (iv) If the applicant is a corporation, the names and addresses of 
its officers and directors.
    (3) Information sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a 
financially responsible person. In this regard, the applicant must 
demonstrate its ability:
    (i) To pay the higher of the net liquidation value (NLV) or going 
concern value (GVC) of the line; and
    (ii) To cover expenses associated with providing services over the 
line (including, but not limited to, operating costs, rents, and taxes) 
for at least the first 3 years after acquisition of the line.
    (4) An estimate of the NLV and the GCV of the line and evidence in 
support of these estimates.
    (5) An offer to purchase the line at the higher of the two estimates 
submitted pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
    (6) The dates for the proposed period of operation of the line 
covered by the application.
    (7) An operating plan that identifies the proposed operator; 
attaches any contract that the applicant may have with the proposed 
operator; describes in detail the service that is to be provided over 
the line, including all interline connections; and demonstrates that 
adequate transportation will be provided over the line for at least 3 
years from the date of acquisition.
    (8) A description of the liability insurance coverage carried by 
applicant or any proposed operator. If trackage rights are requested, 
the insurance must be at a level sufficient to indemnify the owning 
railroad against all personal and property damage that may result from 
negligence on the part of the operator in exercising the trackage 
rights.
    (9) Any preconditions (such as assuming a share of any subsidy 
payments) that will be placed on shippers in order

[[Page 276]]

for them to receive service, and a statement that if the application is 
approved, no further preconditions will be placed on shippers without 
Commission approval. (This Statement Will Be Binding Upon Applicant if 
the Application is Approved.)
    (10) The name and address of any person(s) who will subsidize the 
operation of the line.
    (11) A statement that the applicant will seek a finding by the 
Commission that the public convenience and necessity permit or require 
acquisition, or a statement that the line is currently in category 1 or 
2 of the owning railroad's system diagram map.
    (i) If the applicant seeks a finding of public convenience and 
necessity, the application must contain detailed evidence that permits 
the Commission to find that:
    (A) The rail carrier operating the line refused within a reasonable 
time to make the necessary efforts to provide adequate service to 
shippers who transport traffic over the line;
    (B) The tranportation over the line is inadequate for the majority 
of shippers who transport traffic over the line;
    (C) The sale of the line will not have a significantly adverse 
financial effect on the rail carrier operating the line;
    (D) The sale of the line will not have an adverse effect on the 
overall operational performance of the rail carrier operating the line; 
and
    (E) The sale of the line will be likely to result in improved 
railroad transportation for shippers who transport traffic over the 
line.
    (ii) If the applicant seeks a finding that the line is currently in 
category 1 or 2 of the owning carrier's system diagram map, the relevant 
portion of the current map must be attached to the application.
    (12) A statement detailing applicant's election of exemption from 
the provisions of Title 49, United States Code, and a statement that if

<R05>
Sec. 1151.4  Commission determination.

    (a) The Commission shall determine whether each applicant is a 
financially responsible person. To be a financially responsible person, 
the Commission must find that:
    (1) The applicant is capable of paying the constitutional minimum 
value of the line and able to assure that adequate transportation will 
be provided over the line for at least 3 years;
    (2) The applicant is not a class I or class II railroad or an entity 
affiliated with a class I or class II railroad.
    (b) If the Commission finds that one or more applicants are 
financially responsible parties, it shall determine whether the involved 
line or line segment is a qualified line. A line is a qualified line if:
    (1) Either
    (i) The public convenience and necessity require or permit the sale 
of line or line segment; or
    (ii) The line or line segment is classified in category 1 or 2 of 
the owning carrier's system diagram map; and
    (2) The traffic level on the line or line segment sought to be 
acquired was less than 3 million gross ton-miles of traffic per mile in 
the preceding calendar year (Note: This finding will not be required for 
applications filed after October 1, 1983).
    (c) If the Commission finds that one or more financially responsible 
parties have offered to buy a qualifying line of railroad, the 
Commission shall set the acquisition cost of the line at the higher of 
NLV or GCV, order the owning carrier to sell the rail line to one of the 
financially responsible applicants, and resolve any related issues 
raised in the application. If an applicant and the owning railroad agree 
on an acquisition price, that price shall be the final price.
    (d) If trackage rights are sought in the application, the Commission 
shall, based on the evidence of record, set the adequate compensation 
for such rights, if the parties have not agreed.
    (e) If the applicant requests the Commission to set joint rates or 
divisions and the line carried less than 3 million gross ton-miles of 
traffic per mile during the preceding calendar year, the Commission 
shall, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 10705(a), establish joint rates and 
divisions based on the evidence of record in the proceeding. Unless 
specifically requested to do so by the selling carrier, the Commission 
will not set the rate for the selling railroad's share of the joint rate 
at less than the applicable level (for the year in which the acquisition 
is made) set by 49 U.S.C. 10709(d)(2), which limits Commission maximum 
ratemaking jurisdiction to rates above certain cost/price ratios.

extending from railroad milepost near (station name) to (the end of line 
or rail milepost) near (station name), a distance of miles, in           
   County(ies), State(s). The line for which the abandonment (or 
discontinuance) application will be filed includes the stations of (list 
all stations on the line in order of milepost number, indicating 
milepost location).
    The reason(s) for the proposed abandonment (or discontinuance) is 
(are)              (explain briefly and clearly why the proposed action 
is being undertaken by the applicant). Based on information in our 
possession, the line (does) (does not) contain federally granted rights-
of-way. Any documentation in the railroad's possession will be made 
available promptly to those requesting it.
    This line of railroad has appeared on the system diagram map in 
category 1 since (insert date).
    The interest of railroad employees will be protected by (specify the

oral hearing or through the submission of additional material in the 
form of verified statements. Parties seeking information concerning the 
filing of protests should refer to Sec. 1152.25.
    Written comments and protests should indicate the proceeding 
designation No. AB____________ (Sub-No.__________) and should be filed 
with the Secretary, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 
20423, no later than (insert the date 30 days after the date applicant 
intends to file its application). Interested persons may file a written 
comment or protest with the Commission to become a party to this 
abandonment (or discontinuance) proceeding. A copy of each written 
comment or protest shall be served upon the representative of the 
applicant (insert name, address, and phone number). The original and 2 
copies of all comments or protests shall be filed with the Commission 
with a certificate of service.
    If no protests are received within 30 days after the application is 
filed, the Commission will grant the abandonment (or discontinuance) 
request and issue a certificate which permits the abandonment (or 
discontinuance) to occur within 75 days after the application is filed.
    The line sought to be abandoned (or discontinued) will be available 
for subsidy or sale for continued rail use, if the Commission decides to 
permit the abandonment (or discontinuance), in accordance with 
applicable laws and regulations (49 U.S.C. 10905 and 49 CFR 1152.27). 
Applicant will promptly provide upon request to each interested party an 
estimate of the subsidy and minimum purchase price required to keep the 
line in operation. The carrier's representative to whom inquiries may be 
made concerning sale or subsidy terms is (insert name and business 
address).
    Persons seeking further information concerning abandonment 
procedures may contact the Interstate Commerce Commission's Office of 
Proceedings or refer to the full abandonment or discontinuance 
regulations at 49 CFR Part 1152. Questions concerning environmental 
issues may be directed to the Commission's Section of Energy and 
Environment.
    A copy of the application will be available for public inspection on 
or after (insert date abandonment application is to be filed with 
Commission) at each agency station or terminal on the line proposed to 
be abandoned or discontinued [if there is no agency station on the line, 
the application shall be deposited at any agency station through which 
business for the line is received or forwarded (insert name, address, 
location, and business hours)]. The carrier shall furnish a copy of the 
application to any interested person proposing to file a protest or 
comment, upon request.
    An environmental assessment (or environmental impact statement, if 
necessary) prepared by the Section of Energy and Environment will be 
served upon all parties of record and upon any agencies or other persons 
who commented during its preparation. Any other persons who would like 
to obtain a copy of the EA (or EIS) may contact the Section of Energy 
and Environment. EA's in these abandonment proceedings normally will be 
made available within 33 days of the filing of the application. The 
deadline for submission of comments on the EA will generally be within 
30 days of its service. The comments received will be addressed in the 
Commission's decision. A supplemental EA may be issued where 
appropriate.

    (v) If an oral hearing is desired, a request for and reasons why an 
oral hearing is necessary.

[[Page 288]]

    (2) Additional information. In addition to the information required 
in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a commenting party or protestant 
may provide a statement of position and a summary of evidence regarding:

rail banking under 16 U.S.C. 1247(d) and 49 CFR 1152.29.
    (3) Investigations. (i) Based on the written comments and protests, 
the Commission will determine whether an investigation is needed to 
assist in determining what disposition to make of the application. The 
Commission will automatically direct investigation if a protest is filed 
which demonstrates:
    (A) The protestant filed a feeder line application under 49 U.S.C. 
10910;
    (B) The feeder line application involves any portion of the rail 
line involved in the abandonment or discontinuance application;
    (C) The feeder line application was filed prior to the date the 
abandonment or discontinuance application was filed; and
    (D) The feeder line application is pending before the Commission.
    (ii) If an investigation is conducted, parties filing written 
comments or protests may participate in the investigated proceeding. A 
party filing a protest should be prepared to actively participate either 
in modified procedure investigation (i.e. through the submission of 
written verified statements) or in oral hearing.
    (b) Employee or employee representative participation. Employees or 
their representatives may file protests or comments to an application. 
However, since the Commission will impose employee protective conditions 
under 49 U.S.C. 10903(b)(2) if an application is granted, employees and 
their representatives need not file comments or protests seeking this 
protection.
    (c) Filing and service of written comments, protests, and replies. 
(1) Written comments and protests shall be filed with the Commission 
(the Secretary, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423) 
within 30 days of the filing with the Commission of an abandonment or 
discontinuance application. Requests for public use conditions (see 
Sec. 1152.28(a)(3)) may be filed no later than 10 days after the date of 
publication in the Federal Register of the notice of findings that the 
public convenience and necessity require or permit the abandonment or 
discontinuance. The proposed date of filing of an abandonment or 
discontinuance application shall be included in the Notice of Intent 
required in Secs. 1152.20 through 1152.21.
    (2) An original and 10 copies of each written comment or protest 
shall be filed with the Commission.
    (3) A copy of each written comment or protest shall be served on 
applicant or its representative at the time of filing with the 
Commission. Each filing shall contain a certificate of service.
    (4) Replies to written comments and protests will be considered by 
the Commission provided they are filed and served within 5 days of the 
due date of the pleadings they address. An original and 10 copies of 
such replies shall be filed with the Commission.
    (d) Time limits. (1) Pleadings, requests or other papers or 
documents (including any comments or protests and any appeal from a 
Commission decision) required or permitted to be filed under this part 
must be received for filing at the Commission's Offices at Washington, 
DC within the time limits, if any, for such filing. The date of receipt 
at the Commission and not the date of deposit in the mails is 
determinative, provided, however, that if such document is mailed by 
certified, registered, or express mail, postmarked at least 3 days prior 
to the due date, it will be accepted as timely filed.
    (2) In computing any time period prescribed or allowed by this part, 
the day of the act, event, or default after which the designated period 
of time begins to run is not to be included.

legal holiday in the District of Columbia, may be filed at the 
Commission by the end of the next day which is neither a Saturday, 
Sunday, nor a holiday, except as indicated in paragraph (d)(4) of this 
section. A half holiday shall not be considered as a holiday.
    (4) Offers of financial assistance made pursuant to Sec. 1152.27(c) 
must be filed on or before their statutory due date as computed in 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section, regardless of whether that date is a 
Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday in the District of Columbia.
    (5) The Commission will reject any pleading filed after its due date 
unless good cause is shown why the pleading is filed late.
    (6) Modified procedure: (i) If the Commission decides to institute 
an investigation under the modified procedure, the following time limits 
shall govern the submission of evidence:
    (A) Applicant's initial verified statements due no later than 15 
days after the date the decision instituting an investigation is served;
    (B) Protestant's verified statements due no later than 40 days after 
the date the decision instituting an investigation is served; and
    (C) Applicant's reply verified statements due no later than 55 days 
after the date the decision instituting an investigation is served.
    (ii) Under the schedule established in paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this 
section, parties shall not be permitted to file motions to strike all or 
part of any evidence submitted.
    (7) Oral Hearings: (i) If the Commission decides to institute an 
investigation through oral hearing, the oral hearing shall be for the 
primary purpose of cross examination of witnesses filing verified 
statements pursuant to paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of this section. Any direct 
testimony, other than applicant's rebuttal evidence, shall be received 
at the discretion of the hearing officer.
    (ii) The following time limits shall govern the submission of 
written evidence prior to the commencement of the hearing:
    (A) Applicant's initial verified statements due no later than 15 
days after the date the decision instituting an investigation is served; 
and
    (B) Protestant's verified statements due no later than 40 days after 
the date the decision instituting an investigation is served. Any 
rebuttal evidence by applicant shall be received in the form of 
testimony at the oral hearing.
    (iii) Post hearing legal briefs shall be due 20 days after the close 
of the oral hearing, or at an earlier date if established at the hearing 
by the hearing officer.
    (e) Appellate procedures--(1) Scope of rule. Except as specifically 
indicated below, these appellate procedures are to be followed in 
abandonment and discontinuance proceedings in lieu of the general 
procedures at 49 CFR 1115. Appeals of initial decisions of the Director 
of the Office of Proceedings determining:
    (i) Whether to designate protested abandonment proceedings for 
investigation (including action on requests for oral hearing);
    (ii) Whether offers of financial assistance satisfy the standards of 
49 U.S.C. 10905(d) for purposes of negotiations or, in exemption 
proceedings, for purposes of partial revocation and negotiations;
    (iii) Whether partially to revoke or to reopen abandonment 
exemptions authorized, respectively, under 49 U.S.C. 10505 and 49 CFR 
part 1152 subpart F for the purpose of imposing public use conditions 
under the criteria in 49 CFR 1152.28 and/or conditions limiting salvage 
of the rail properties for environmental and historic preservation 
purposes; and
    (iv) The applicability and administration of the Trails Act [16 
U.S.C. 1247(d)] in abandonment proceedings under 49 U.S.C. 10903-04 (and 
abandonment exemption proceedings) as set forth in 49 CFR 1011.8(c)(4) 
and (5) will be acted on by the entire Commission as set forth at 49 CFR 
1011.2(a)(8).

An original and 10 copies of all appeals, and replies to appeals, under 
this section should be filed with the Commission.

    (2) Appeals criteria. (i) Appeals to the initial decision in non-
protested proceedings or non-investigated (protested) proceedings will 
not be entertained. Those decisions are administratively final upon the 
date they are served.

[[Page 290]]

    (A) In a protested but not investigated proceeding, parties seeking 
further administrative action may file a petition to reopen the 
proceeding under paragraph (e)(6) of this section. If an abandonment or 
discontinuance is granted and a party wishes the Commission to consider 
a petition to reopen before the abandonment or discontinuance 
certificate becomes effective, it must file its petition within 15 days 
after the administratively final decision is served (together with any 
necessary request for a stay of the certificate's effectiveness). If a 
petition is received within that 15 day period, any replies to the 
petition must be filed no later than 25 days after the date the decision 
is served. The Commission will then announce whether it will grant the 
petition (and reopen the proceeding) by the 120th day after the 
application was filed (the last date upon which the certificate could 
become effective).
    (B) In a proceeding that is not protested, since the Commission is 
required to authorize abandonment or discontinuance, the only subsequent 
pleadings permitted are petitions to vacate the certificate filed under 
paragraph (e)(8) of this section.
    (ii) In investigated proceedings, the Commission may hear appeals in 
its discretion, if it finds that either:
    (A) The action (if taken by an administrative law judge, an employee 
board, or a division) involves a matter of general transportation 
importance, or
    (B) The action would be affected materially because of new evidence, 
changed circumstances, or material error.
    (3) Time limits. (i) Any appeal from the initial decision in an 
investigated proceeding shall be filed no later than 20 days after the 
date the initial decision is served.
    (ii) The Commission will announce whether it will hear an appeal 
filed under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section within 30 days after the 
date the initial decision is served. If the Commission decides to hear 
the appeal, other parties will be afforded 15 days from the date of 
service of the decision to file replies to the appeals.
    (iii) In order to exhaust its administrative remedies, a party must 
file an appeal under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section from the 
initial decision in an investigated proceeding no later than 20 days 
after the date the initial decision is served before seeking judicial 
review. In the event an appeal is timely filed, administratively final 
action for the purposes of this rule is deemed to occur when the 
Commission (A) issues its decision not to hear the appeal, (B) fails to 
issue such a decision within 30 days after the date the initial decision 
was served, or (C) hears the appeal and issues a decision on the appeal. 
If the Commission decides to hear the appeal, the decision to hear the 
appeal will operate as an automatic stay and no certificate will be 
issued until the Commission has acted on the appeal.
    (4) Form. An appeal and any reply shall not exceed 30 pages in 
length, including the index of subject matter, argument, and appendices 
or other attachments.
    (5) To the extent that an appeal requests further hearing, 
rehearing, reargument, or reconsideration, the appeal shall state in 
detail the nature of the relief requested and the reasons therefor. When 
a party seeks an opportunity to introduce evidence, the appeal must 
state briefly the evidence, explain why it is not cumulative, and 
explain why it was not previously adduced.
    (6) Petitions to reopen administratively final actions: Except as 
provided for in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section, a person may 
file a petition to reopen any administratively final action of the 
Commission. A petition to reopen shall state in detail the respects in 
which the proceeding involves material error, new evidence, or 
substantially changed circumstances. An original and 10 copies of such 
petitions should be filed with the Commission.
    (7) Judicial review: (i) Parties may seek judicial review of a 
Commission action in an abandonment or discontinuance proceeding on the 
day the action of the Commission becomes final.
    (ii) If an appeal or a petition seeking reopening is filed under 
this section, before or after a petition seeking judicial review is 
filed with the courts, the Commission will act upon the appeal or 
petition after advising the court of its

[[Page 291]]

pendency unless action might interfere with the court's jurisdiction.
    (8) Petitions to vacate certificates: In the event of procedural 
defects (such as the loss of a properly filed protest, the failure of 
the applicant to afford the public the requisite notice of its proposed 
abandonment, etc.) the Commission will entertain petitions to vacate 
certificates in these abandonment or discontinuance proceedings. An 
original and 10 copies of these petitions to vacate should be filed with 
the Commission.
    (9) Petitions to stay. (i) The filing of an appeal shall not stay 
the effect of a prior action. An original and 10 copies of any petitions 
to stay should be filed with the Commission.
    (ii) If an appeal is filed in an investigated proceeding, under 
paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, a petition to stay is unnecessary 
and inappropriate. A certificate will not have been issued at that time 
and, if the Commission decides to hear the appeal, will not be issued 
until the Commission has acted upon the appeal. Therefore, there is no 
action requiring a stay.
    (iii) A petition to reopen an administratively final action in a 
protested but non-investigated proceeding may be accompanied by a 
petition for a stay of the effectiveness of a certificate of abandonment 
or discontinuance, which permits the abandonment or discontinuance to 
occur prior to 120 days after the application is filed. The petitions 
may seek postponement of the effectiveness of the certificate only until 
the 120th day after the application is filed. The petitions may seek 
postponement of the effectiveness of the certificate only until the 
120th day after the application is filed, when effectiveness is required 
by law (49 U.S.C. 10904(c)(2)).
    (iv) A party may petition for a stay of the effectiveness of a 
certificate of abandonment or discontinuance pending a request for 
judicial review. The reasons for the desired relief shall be stated in 
the petition, and the petition shall be filed not less than 10 days 
prior to the effective date of the certificate. No reply need be filed. 
If a party elects to file a reply, the reply must reach the Commission 
no later than 5 days after the petition is filed.

Sec. 1152.26  Commission determination and certification under 49 U.S.C. 10904.

    (a) If no protests to an application are filed under Sec. 1152.25, 
the Commission shall (1) find that the public convenience and necessity 
require or permit the abandonment or discontinuance, and (2) no later 
than 45 days after the application is filed, issue a certificate which

    (1) If no investigation is instituted, the Commission shall issue a 
decision no later than 75 days after the date the application is filed. 
If the Commission finds that the present or future public convenience 
and necessity require or permit the abandonment or discontinuance, it 
shall issue a certificate no later than 90 days after the application is

    (2) If the Commission decides to institute an investigation, the 
investigation shall be completed no later than 135 days, and an initial 
decision issued no later than 165 days, after the date the application 
is filed.
    (i) The initial decision following an investigation shall become the 
final decision of the Commission unless, during the 30 days following 
the initial decision, the Commission decides to hear appeals in 
accordance with the criteria set forth in Sec. 1152.25(e)(2)(ii).

[[Page 292]]

permit the abandonment or discontinuance, the Commission will issue a 
certificate no later than 15 days following the final decision, 
permitting the abandonment or discontinuance to occur no later than 75 
days following issuance of the final decision (unless the financial 
assistance procedures provided for in Sec. 1152.27 have not been 
concluded).
    (3) A copy of the decision instituting an investigation of an 
abandonment or discontinuance application shall be served on the carrier 
which owns or operates the line of railroad or its representative.

parties which filed written comments and on all persons upon which 
copies of the application are required to be served under 
Sec. 1152.24(c).

<R05>
Sec. 1152.27  Financial assistance procedures.

    (a) Provision of information. An applicant must provide promptly 
upon request to a party considering an offer of financial assistance to 
continue existing rail service, and concurrently to the Commission, the 
following:
    (1)(i) In an application proceeding, an estimate of the annual 
subsidy and minimum purchase price required to keep the line or a 
portion of the line in operation;
    (ii) In an exemption proceeding, either an estimate of the annual 
subsidy or the minimum purchase price, depending upon the type of 
financial assistance indicated in the potential offeror's formal 
expression of intent submitted under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this 
section;
    (2) Its most recent reports on the physical condition of the 
involved line; and
    (3) Traffic, revenue, and other data necessary to determine the 
amount of annual financial assistance that would be required to continue 
rail transportation over that part of the railroad line. In an exemption 
proceeding, the data to be provided must at a minimum include the 
carrier's estimate of the net liquidation value of the line, with 
supporting data reflecting available real estate appraisals, assessments 
of the quality and quantity of track materials in a line, and removal 
cost estimates (including the cost of transporting removed materials to 
point of sale or point of storage for relay use), and, if an offer of 
subsidy is contemplated, an estimate of the cost of rehabilitating the 
line to Federal Railroad Administration Class I Safety Standards (49 CFR 
part 213).
    (b) Federal Register notice. (1) Abandonment and discontinuance 
applications. If the Commission finds that the present or future public 
convenience and necessity permit or require the proposed abandonment or 
discontinuance, the Commission will publish these findings in the 
Federal Register concurrently with the service of the decision. The 
Federal Register publication will serve as notice to persons intending 
to offer financial assistance to assure continued rail service under 49 
U.S.C. 10905 and these regulations as they relate to abandonment and 
discontinuance applications.
    (2) Exemption proceedings. If the Commission exempts a proposed 
abandonment of a line of railroad from the prior approval requirements 
of 49 U.S.C. 10903, et seq., the Commission will publish notice of this 
action in the Federal Register. The Federal Register publication will 
serve as notice to persons with a potential interest in providing 
financial assistance to assure continued rail service under 49 U.S.C. 
10905 and these regulations as they relate to exempt abandonments and 
discontinuances.
    (c) Submission of financial assistance offer--(1) Abandonment and 
discontinuance applications. (i) Service and filing. An offeror must 
serve its offer of assistance on the carrier owning and operating the 
line and all parties to the

[[Page 293]]

abandonment or discontinuance proceeding. The offer must be filed 
concurrently with the Secretary, Interstate Commerce Commission, 
Washington, DC 20423.
    (A) An offer may be filed and served at any time after the filing of 
the abandonment or discontinuance application. Once notice of the 
abandonment findings is published in the Federal Register, however, the 
Commission must be notified that an offer has previously been submitted.
    (B) An offer, or notification of a previously filed offer, must be 
filed and served no later than 10 days after the Federal Register 
publication described in paragraph (b) of this section. This filing and 
service is subject to the requirements of 49 CFR 1152.25 (d)(1), (d)(2), 
and (d)(4).
    (C) If, after a bona fide request, applicant has failed to provide a 
potential offeror promptly with the information required under paragraph 
(a) of this section and if that information is not contained in the 
application, the Commission will entertain petitions to toll the 10-day 
period for submitting offers of financial assistance under paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section. Petitions must be filed with the Commission 
within 5 days after publication in the Federal Register (described in 
paragraph (b) of this section). Petitions should include copies of the 
prior written request for information or an accurate outline of the 
specific information that was orally requested. Replies to these 
petitions must be filed within 10 days after the publication. These 
petitions and replies must be filed on or before their actual due date 
under 49 CFR 1152.25(d)(4). The Commission will issue a decision on 
petitions within 15 days after publication.
    (ii) Contents of offer. The offeror shall set forth its offer in 
detail. The offer must:
    (A) Identify the line, or the portion of the line, in question;
    (B) Demonstrate that the offeror is financially responsible; that 
is, that it has or within a reasonable time will have the financial 
resources to fulfill proposed contractual obligations;
    (C) Explain the disparity between the offeror's purchase price or 
subsidy if it is less than the carrier's estimate under paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section, and explain how the offer of subsidy or purchase is 
calculated.
    (2) Exemption proceedings. (i) Expression of intent to file offer. 
Persons with a potential interest in providing financial assistance must 
no later than 10 days after the Federal Register publication described 
in paragraph (b)(2) of this section submit to the carrier and the 
Commission a formal expression of their intent to file an offer of 
financial assistance, indicating the type of financial assistance they 
wish to provide (i.e., subsidy or purchase). Such submissions are 
subject to the filing requirements of Sec. 1152.25(d)(1) through (d)(3). 
Submission of a formal expression of intent under this subsection will 
automatically stay the effective date either of the decision granting an 
individual exemption or the notice of exemption under the class 
exemption for 40 days (normally, this will be 10 days beyond the date 
stated in the Federal Register publication).
    (ii) Service and filing. An offeror must serve its offer of 
assistance on the carrier that instituted the exempt filing as well as 
all other parties to the proceeding. The offer must be filed 
concurrently with the Secretary, Interstate Commerce Commission, 
Washington, DC 20423.
    (A) An offer may be filed and served at any time after the filing of 
the exemption petition or notice of exemption. Once notice of exemption 
is published in the Federal Register, however, the Commission must be 
notified that an offer has previously been submitted.
    (B) An offer, or notification of a previously filed offer, must be 
filed and served no later than 30 days after the Federal Register 
publication described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. This filing 
and service is subject to the requirements of 49 CFR 1152.25 (d)(1), 
(d)(2), and (d)(4).
    (C) If, after a bona fide request, applicant has failed to provide a 
potential offeror promptly with the information required under paragraph 
(a) of this section and if that information is not contained in the 
exemption petition or notice of exemption, the Commission will entertain 
petitions to toll the 30- 

[[Page 294]]

day period for submitting offers of financial assistance under paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section. Petitions must be filed with the Commission 
within 25 days after publication in the Federal Register (described in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section). Petitions should include copies of 
the prior written request for information or an accurate outline of the 
specific information that was orally requested. Replies to these 
petitions must be filed within 30 days after the publication. These 
petitions and replies must be filed on or before their actual due date 
under 49 CFR 1152.25(d)(4). The Commission will issue a decision on 
petitions to toll the offer period within 35 days after publication.
    (D) Upon receipt of a formal expression of intent to file an offer 
under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, applicant may advise the 
Commission and the potential offeror that additional time is needed to 
develop the information required under paragraph (a) of this section. 
Applicant shall expressly indicate the amount of time it considers 
necessary (not to exceed 60 days) to develop and submit the required 
information to the potential offeror. For the duration of the time 
period so indicated by applicant the 30-day period for submitting offers 
of financial assistance under paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall be 
tolled without formal Commission action.
    (iii) Contents of offer. The offeror shall set forth its offer in 
detail. The offer must meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii).
    (d) Access to documents. Upon receipt by the carrier of a written 
comment under Sec. 1152.25 or a formal expression of intent under 
paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section indicating an intent to offer 
financial assistance or upon receipt by the carrier of an offer of 
financial assistance, whichever occurs earlier, the carrier must make 
available to that party or offeror the records, accounts, appraisals, 
working papers, and other documents used in preparing Exhibit 1 
(Sec. 1152.36) or, if an exemption proceeding, those documents that 
would have been used in preparing Exhibit 1 had an abandonment or 
discontinuance application been filed or whatever records, reports, and 
other data in the possession of the carrier seeking the exemption which 
provide data comparable to that which would have been utilized in 
preparing an Exhibit 1. These documents shall be made available during 
regular business hours at a time and place mutually agreeable to the 
parties.
    (e) Review of offers. (1) Abandonment and discontinuance 
applications. The Commission will review each offer submitted to 
determine if the offeror is a financially responsible person offering 
assistance which is likely to cover:
    (i) The difference between the revenues attributable to the line and 
the avoidable cost of providing freight service on the line plus a 
reasonable return on the value of the line, or
    (ii) The acquisition cost of all or any portion of the line.

If these criteria are met, the Commission will issue a decision 
postponing the issuance of a certificate of abandonment or, if a 
certificate has been issued, postponing the effective date of the 
certificate. This decision will be issued within 15 days of the Federal 
Register publication described in paragraph (b) of this section (or five 
days after the offer is filed if the time for filing has been tolled 
under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section). Under the delegation of 
authority at Sec. 1011.8, the Director of the Office of Proceedings will 
make the initial determination whether offers of financial assistance 
satisfy the standards of 49 U.S.C. 10905(d) for purposes of 
negotiations. Appeals of initial decisions determining whether offers of 
financial assistance satisfy the standards of 49 U.S.C. 10905(d) for 
purposes of negotiations will be acted upon by the entire Commission 
pursuant to the rule set forth at 49 CFR 1011.2(a)(8).
    (2) Exemption proceedings. The Commission will review each offer 
submitted to determine if the offeror is a financially responsible 
person offering assistance which is likely to cover:
    (i) The difference between the revenues attributable to the line and 
the avoidable cost of providing freight service on the line plus a 
reasonable return on the value of the line; or
    (ii) The acquisition cost of all or any portion of the line.


[[Page 295]]


If these criteria are met, the Commission will postpone the effective 
date either of the decision granting an individual exemption or the 
notice of exemption under the class exemption and partially revoke the 
exemption or (in the case of a class exemption) the notice of exemption 
to the extent it applies to 49 U.S.C. 10905. The decision to postpone 
and partially revoke will be issued within 35 days of the Federal 
Register publication described in paragraph (b) of this section (or five 
days after the offer is filed if the time for filing has been tolled 
under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) or (c)(2)(ii)(D) of this section). Under 
the delegation of authority at Sec. 1011.8, the Director of the Office 
of Proceedings will make the initial determination whether offers of 
financial assistance satisfy the standards of 49 U.S.C. 10905(d) for 
purposes of partial revocation and negotiations. Appeals of initial 
decisions determinig whether offers of financial assistance satisfy the 
standards of 49 U.S.C. 10905(d) for purposes of partial revocation and 
negotiations will be acted upon by the entire Commission pursuant to the 
rule set forth at 49 CFR 1011.2(a)(8).
    (f) Agreement on financial assistance. (1) If the carrier and a 
person offering financial assistance enter into a subsidy agreement 
designed to provide for continued rail service, the Commission will 
postpone the issuance of a certificate authorizing the abandonment or 
discontinuance. If a certificate, decision granting an individual 
exemption, or notice of exemption has been issued, the Commission will 
postpone the effective date of the certificate, decision, or notice of 
exemption. The postponement will be for as long as the subsidy agreement 
is in effect.
    (2) If the carrier and a person offering to purchase a line enter 
into a purchase agreement which will result in continued rail service, 
the Commission will approve the transaction and dismiss the application 
for abandonment or discontinuance, or the petition for exemption or 
notice of exemption. Commission approval is not required under 49 U.S.C. 
10901 or 11343 for the parties to consummate the transaction or for the 
purchaser to institute service and operate as a railroad subject to 49 
U.S.C. 10501(a).
    (g) Failure to reach agreement on financial assistance. (1) If the 
carrier and a financially responsible person fail to agree on the amount 
or terms of subsidy or purchase, either party may request the Commission 
to establish the conditions and amount of compensation. This request 
must be filed with the Commission within 30 days after the offer is made 
and served concurrently on all parties to the proceeding.
    (2) If no agreement is reached within 30 days after the offer of 
purchase or subsidy is made, and no request is made to the Commission to 
set the conditions and amount of compensation under paragraph (g)(1) of 
this section, the Commission will serve either:
    (i) A certificate authorizing the abandonment or discontinuance 
within 10 days after the date the request to set conditions and amount 
of compensation was due (unless an appeal is being heard under 
Sec. 1152.25(e)), or
    (ii) A decision vacating the prior decision, which postponed the 
effective date of either the decision granting the exemption or the 
notice of exemption and partially revoked either the decision granting 
the exemption or (in the case of a class exemption) the notice of 
exemption.

The certificate or decision to vacate will be effective on its date of 
service. If a certificate was issued but its effective date was 
postponed under paragraph (e) of this section, the certificate will 
become effective 10 days after the date the request to set conditions 
and compensation was due (unless an appeal is being heard under 
Sec. 1152.25(e)).
    (h) Request to establish conditions and compensation for financial 
assistance. (1) If the Commission is requested to establish conditions 
and compensation for financial assistance under paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section, the Commission will issue a decision within 60 days after the 
request is due (i.e., within 90 days after the offer is made).
    (2) If the applicant receives multiple offers of financial 
assistance, requests to establish conditions and compensation will not 
be permitted before the applicant selects the offeror with whom it 
wishes to transact business. (See paragraph (l)(1) of this section).

[[Page 296]]

    (3) A party requesting the Commission to establish conditions and 
compensation for financial assistance must provide with the request, a 
narrative indicating the status of the negotiations between the parties 
and the likelihood of voluntary settlement prior to the issuance of a 
Commission decision setting terms. The party filing the request must 
also, within the time period set forth in paragraph (h)(4) of this 
section, provide reasons why its estimates are correct and the other 
negotiating party's estimates are incorrect; points of agreement and 
points of disagreement between the negotiating parties; and evidence 
substantiating these allegations. The offeror has the burden of proof as 
to all issues in dispute.
    (4) The offeror must submit all evidence and information supporting 
the terms it seeks within 30 days after the offer is made. The carrier's 
reply to this evidence and support for the terms it seeks are due within 
50 days after the offer is made. The offeror may submit rebuttal 
evidence within 60 days after the offer is made. Evidence and 
information submitted after these dates may be rejected.
    (5) If requested, the Commission will determine the amount and terms 
of subsidy based on the avoidable cost of providing continued rail 
transportation, plus a reasonable return on the value of the line.
    (6) If requested, the Commission will determine the price and other 
terms of sale. The Commission will not set a price below the fair market 
value of the line (including, unless otherwise agreed upon by the 
parties, all facilities on the line or portion necessary to provide 
effective transportation services). Fair market value equals 
constitutional minimum value which is the greater of the net liquidation 
value of the line or the going concern value of the line. The 
constitutional minimum value is computed without regard to labor 
protection costs.
    (7) Within 10 days of the service date of the Commission's decision, 
the offeror must accept or reject the Commission's terms and conditions 
with a written notification to the Commission and all parties to the 
proceeding. If the offeror accepts the terms and conditions set by the 
Commission, the Commission's decision is binding on both parties. If the 
offeror withdraws its offer or does not accept the terms and conditions 
set by the Commission with a timely written notification, the Commission 
will serve, within 20 days after the service date of the Commission 
decision setting the terms and conditions, either
    (i) A certificate authorizing the abandonment or discontinuance 
(unless other offers are being considered under paragraph (l) of this 
section and unless an appeal is being heard under Sec. 1152.25(e)), or
    (ii) A decision vacating the prior decision, which postponed the 
effective date of either the decision granting the exemption or the 
notice of exemption and partially revoked the exemption or (in the case 
of a class exemption) the notice of exemption (unless other offers are 
being considered under paragraph (l) of this section).

The certificate or decision to vacate will be effective on its date of 
service. If a certificate was issued but its effective date was 
postponed under paragraph (e) of this section, the certificate will 
become effective 20 days after the service date of the Commission 
decision setting the terms and conditions (unless other offers are being 
considered under paragraph (l) of this section or an appeal is being 
heard under Sec. 1152.25(e)).
    (i) Substitution of purchasers and disposition after sale. (1) Prior 
to the consummation of a purchase under this section, an offeror may 
substitute its corporate affiliate as the purchaser under an agreement, 
provided the Commission has determined either
    (i) The original offeror has guaranteed the financial responsibility 
of its affiliate, or
    (ii) The affiliate has demonstrated financial responsibility in its 
own right.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(3) of this section, a 
purchaser under this section may not:
    (i) Transfer the line or discontinue service over the line prior to 
the end of the second year after consummation of the original sale under 
these provisions, or

[[Page 297]]

    (ii) Transfer the line, except to the carrier from whom the line was 
purchased, prior to the end of the fifth year after consummation.
    (3) Paragraph (i)(2) of this section does not preclude a purchaser 
under this section from transferring the line to a corporate affiliate 
following the consummation of the original sale. Prior Commission 
approval of the affiliate's acquisition and operation, however, is 
required under 49 U.S.C. 10901 or 11343. A corporate affiliate acquiring 
a line under this section is prohibited from discontinuing service over 
the line or transferring the line to a party that is not a corporate 
affiliate during the time periods prescribed in paragraph (i)(2) of this 
section.
    (j) Discontinuance of subsidy. A subsidizer may discontinue a 
subsidy under this section by giving 60 days notice of the 
discontinuance to the applicant and all other parties to the proceeding. 
Unless another financially responsible party enters into a subsidy 
agreement as beneficial to the carrier as the discontinued subsidy 
agreement, the carrier may by filing a request with the Commission and 
serving the request on all parties to the abandonment or exemption 
proceeding obtain
    (1) A certificate authorizing abandonment or discontinuance of 
service or
    (2) A decision vacating the decision postponing the effective date 
of either the decision granting the exemption or the notice of 
exemption.

The Commission will issue a certificate or decision to vacate within 10 
days after the filing and service of the request. This certificate or 
decision to vacate will be effective immediately. If a certificate was 
issued but its effective date was postponed under paragraph (e) of this 
section, the certificate will become effective 10 days after the filing 
and service of the request.
    (k) Default on agreement. If any party defaults on its obligations 
under a financial assistance agreement, any other party to the agreement 
may promptly inform the Commission of that default. Upon notification, 
the Commission will take appropriate action.
    (l) Multiple offers of financial assistance. (1) If an applicant 
receives more than one offer to purchase or subsidize the line, the 
applicant must select the offeror with whom it wishes to transact 
business. In abandonment and discontinuance application proceedings 
within 25 days after the Federal Register publication described in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section and in exemption proceedings within 45 
days after the Federal Register publication described in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, applicant must:
    (i) File a written notification of its selection with the 
Commission, and
    (ii) Serve a copy of the notification on all parties to the 
proceeding.
    (2)(i) Abandonment and discontinuance applications. If the applicant 
has received multiple offers of financial assistance and has selected 
the offeror with whom it wishes to transact business, the negotiating 
parties shall complete the sale or subsidy agreement or request the 
Commission to establish the conditions and amount of compensation within 
40 days after the Federal Register publication described in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section. The request must be served concurrently on all 
parties to the proceeding. If no agreement on subsidy or sale is reached 
within the 40 day period and the Commission has not been requested to 
establish the conditions and amount of compensation, any other offeror 
may request the Commission to establish the conditions and amount of 
compensation. This request must be filed at the Commission within 50 
days of the Federal Register publication described in paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section and served concurrently on all parties to the 
proceeding. If no other request is filed, the Commission will issue a 
certificate authorizing abandonment or discontinuance within 60 days of 
the Federal Register publication described in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section (unless an appeal is being heard under Sec. 1152.25(e)). This 
certificate will be effective immediately. If no other request is filed 
and a certificate was issued but its effective date was postponed under 
paragraph (e) of this section, the certificate will become effective 60 
days after the Federal Register publication described in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section (unless an appeal is being heard under 
Sec. 1152.25(e)).

[[Page 298]]

    (ii) Exemption proceedings. If the carrier seeking the exemption has 
received multiple offers of financial assistance and has selected the 
offeror with whom it wishes to transact business, the negotiating 
parties shall complete the sale or subsidy agreement or request the 
Commission to establish the conditions and amount of compensation within 
60 days after the Federal Register publication described in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section. The request must be served concurrently on all 
parties to the proceeding. If no agreement on subsidy or sale is reached 
within the 60 day period and the Commission has not been requested to 
establish the conditions and amount of compensation, any other offeror 
may request the Commission to establish the conditions and amount of 
compensation. This request must be filed at the Commission within 70 
days of the Federal Register publication described in paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section and served concurrently on all parties to the 
proceeding. If no other request is filed, the Commission will issue a 
decision vacating the decision postponing the effective date of either 
the decision granting exemption or (in the case of a class exemption) 
the notice of exemption within 80 days of the Federal Register 
publication described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The decision 
to vacate will be effective immediately.
    (3) If the Commission has established the conditions and amount of 
compensation, and the original offer is withdrawn under paragraph (h)(7) 
of this section, any other offeror may accept the Commission's decision. 
If the decision is accepted by another offeror, the Commission will 
require the applicant to accept the terms incorporated in the 
Commission's decision.

Sec. 1152.28  Public use procedures.

    (a)(1) If the Commission finds that the present or future public 
convenience and necessity require or permit abandonment or 
discontinuance, the Commission will determine if the involved rail 
properties are suitable for other public purposes.
    (2) A request for a public use condition under 49 U.S.C. 10906 must 
be in writing and set forth: (i) The condition sought; (ii) the public 
importance of the condition; (iii) the period of time for which the 
condition would be effective; and (iv) justification for the imposition 
of the time period. A copy of the request shall be mailed to the 
applicant.
    (3) For applications filed under part 1152, subpart C, a request for 
a public use condition must be filed not more than 10 days from the date 
of publication of the notice of findings in the Federal Register. A 
decision on the public use request will be issued by the Director of the 
Office of Proceedings prior to the effective date of the abandonment. 
For abandonment exemptions under part 1152, subpart F or exemptions 
granted on the basis of an individual petition filed under 49 U.S.C. 
10505, a request for a public use condition must be filed not more than 
20 days from the date of publication of the notice of exemption in the 
Federal Register.
    (b) If the Commission finds that the rail properties are suitable 
for other public purposes, the railroad may dispose of the rail 
properties only under the conditions described in the Commission's 
decision. The conditions imposed by the Commission may include a 
prohibition against the disposal of the rail assets for a period of not 
more than 180 days from the effective date of the decision authorizing 
the abandonment or discontinuance, unless the properties have first been 
offered, on reasonable terms, for sale for public purposes. This period 
will run concurrently with any other postponements. Jurisdiction to 
impose such conditions expires after 180 days from the effective date of 
the decision authorizing the abandonment or discontinuance.

Sec. 1152.29  Prospective use of rights-of-way for interim trail use and rail banking.

    (a) If any state, political subdivision, or qualified private 
organization is interested in acquiring or using a right-of-way of a 
rail line proposed to be

[[Page 299]]

abandoned for interim trail use and rail banking pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 
1247(d), it must file a comment (in a regulated abandonment proceeding) 
or a petition (in an exemption proceeding) indicating that it would like 
to do so. The comment or petition must include:
    (1) A map depicting, and an accurate description of, the right-of-
way, or portion thereof (including mileposts), proposed to be acquired 
or used;
    (2) A statement indicating the user's willingness to assume full 
responsibility: For managing the right-of-way; for any legal liability 
arising out of the use of the right-of-way (unless the user is immune 
from liability, in which case it need only indemnify the railroad 
against any potential liability); and for the payment of all taxes 
assessed against the right-of-way; and
    (3) An acknowledgment that interim trail use is subject to the 
user's continuing to meet its responsibilities described in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, and subject to possible future reconstruction 
and reactivation of the right-of-way rail service. The statement must be 
in the following form:

       Statement of Willingness to Assume Financial Responsibility

    In order to establish interim trail use and rail banking under 16 
U.S.C. 1247(d) and 49 CFR 1152.29,____________________ (Interim Trail 
User) is willing to assume full responsibility for management of, for 
any legal liability arising out of the transfer or use of (unless the 
user is immune from liability, in which case it need only indemnify the 
railroad against any potential liability), and for the payment of any 
and all taxes that may be levied or assessed against the right-of-way 
owned by ____________________ (Railroad) and operated by 
____________________ (Railroad). The property, known as 
____________________ (Name of Branch Line), extends from railroad 
milepost ________, near____________________(Station name), to railroad 
milepost________, near ____________________ (Station name), a distance 
of ________ miles in ____________________ County(ies), 
____________________ (State(s)). The right-of-way is part of a line of 
railroad proposed for abandonment in Docket No. AB-__________ (Sub-No. 
____________________
    A map of the property depicting the right-of-way is attached.
    ____________________ (Interim Trail User) acknowledges that use of 
the right-of-way is subject to the user's continuing to meet its 
responsibilities described above and subject to possible future 
reconstruction and reactivation of the right-of-way for rail service. A 
copy of this statement is being served on the railroad(s) on the same 
date it is being served on the Commission.
    (b)(1) In regular (regulated) abandonment proceedings under 49 
U.S.C. 10903-04, interim trail use statements are due within the 30-day 
protest and comment period following the date the abandonment 
application is filed. See Sec. 1152.25(c).
    (i) In every proceeding where a Trails Act request is made, the 
Commission will determine whether the Trails Act is applicable.
    (ii) In a nonprotested proceeding, when a timely trail use statement 
is filed, the Commission, by the 35th day after the abandonment 
application is filed, will issue a decision that either:
    (A) Finds that the Trails Act is not applicable because of failure 
to comply with the provisions of Sec. 1152.29(a); or
    (B) Finds that the Trails Act is applicable and directs the carrier 
to notify the Commission, within 5 days, about whether it intends to 
negotiate an agreement.

If the Trails Act is not applicable, or is applicable but the carrier 
either does not intend to negotiate an agreement, or does not timely 
notify the Commission of its intention to negotiate, the public 
convenience and necessity will be found to require or permit 
abandonment, and a certificate of abandonment will be issued pursuant to 
Sec. 1152.26(a). If the carrier is willing to negotiate an agreement, 
and the public convenience and necessity permit abandonment, the 
Commission will issue a Certificate of Interim Trail Use or Abandonment 
by the 45th day after the application is filed.
    (iii) In a protested but noninvestigated proceeding, when a timely 
trail use statement is filed, the initial decision determining that no 
investigation will be undertaken, which is issued

[[Page 300]]

within 45 days after the application is filed, will include a finding 
that either:
    (A) The Trails Act is not applicable because of failure to comply 
with the provisions of Sec. 1152.29(a); or
    (B) The Trails Act is applicable, and directing the carrier to 
notify the Commission within 10 days about whether it intends to 
negotiate an agreement.

If the Trails Act is not applicable, or is applicable but the carrier 
either does not intend to negotiate an agreement, or does not timely 
notify the Commission of its intention to negotiate, a decision on the 
merits will be issued under Sec. 1152.26(b)(1). If the carrier is 
willing to negotiate an agreement, and the public convenience and 
necessity permit abandonment, the Commission will issue a Certificate of 
Interim Trail Use or Abandonment by the 75th day after the application 
is filed.
    (2) In exemption proceedings, a petition containing an interim trail 
use statement are due within 10 days after the date the Notice of 
Exemption is published in the Federal Register.
    (3) If the regular abandonment or exemption request is investigated, 
comments will be accepted at any time during the time provided for 
making evidentiary filings in the investigation.
    (4) In Conrail abandonment proceedings under NERSA, interim trail 
use statements are due within 60 days after the date that Conrail's 
abandonment application is filed.
    (5) When an interim trail use comment(s) or petition(s) is filed, 
the railroad must submit a reply to the Commission within 10 days after 
the date the Commission issues a Notice of Findings in regular 
abandonment proceedings, and within 10 days after the date a petition 
requesting interim trail use is filed in an exemption or NERSA 
proceeding indicating whether and with whom it intends to negotiate an 
agreement.
    (6) Late-filed trail use statements must be supported by a statement 
showing good cause for late filing.
    (7) In proceedings where a Trails Act request is made, the 
Commission will determine whether the Trails Act is applicable.
    (c) Regular and NERSA abandonment proceedings. (1) If continued rail 
service does not occur pursuant to Sec. 1152.27, and a railroad intends 
to enter into an interim trail use/rail banking agreement, then the 
Commission will issue a Certificate of Interim Trail Use or Abandonment 
(CITU) to the railroad and to the interim trail user for that portion of 
the right-of-way to be covered by the agreement. The CITU will: Permit 
the railroad to discontinue service, cancel tariffs, and salvage track 
and material consistent with interim trail use and rail banking, as long 
as it is consistent with any other Commission order, 30 days after the 
date it is issued (10 days after issuance in Conrail proceedings); and 
permit the railroad to fully abandon the line if no agreement is reached 
180 days after it is issued, subject to appropriate conditions, 
including labor protection, and environmental matters.
    (2) The CITU will indicate that interim trail use is subject to 
future restoration of rail service, and subject to the user continuing 
to meet the financial obligations for the right-of-way. The CITU will 
also indicate that, if the user intends to terminate trail use, it must 
send the Commission a copy of the CITU and request that it be vacated on 
a specified date. The Commission will reopen the abandonment proceeding, 
vacate the CITU, and issue an effective abandonment certificate for the 
involved portion of the right-of-way. Copies of the abandonment 
certificate will be sent to:
    (i) The abandonment applicant;
    (ii) The owner of the right-of-way; and
    (iii) The current trail user.
    (3) If an application to construct and operate a rail line over the 
right-of-way is authorized under 49 U.S.C. 10901 and 49 CFR Part 1150, 
or exempted under 49 U.S.C. 10505, then the CITU will be vacated 
accordingly.
    (d) Exempt abandonment proceedings. (1) If a railroad intends to 
enter into an interim trail use/rail banking agreement, then the 
Commission will issue a Notice of Interim Trail Use or Abandonment 
(NITU) to the railroad and to the interim trail user for the portion of 
the right-of-way to be covered by the agreement. The NITU will permit 
the railroad to discontinue service, cancel tariffs, and salvage track 
and materials, consistent with interim trail use

[[Page 301]]

and rail banking, 30 days after the date it is issued, and permit the 
railroad to fully abandon the line if no agreement is reached 180 days 
after it is issued, subject to appropriate conditions, including labor 
protection, and environmental matters.
    (2) The NITU will indicate that interim trail use is subject to 
future restoration of rail service, and subject to the user continuing 
to meet the financial obligations for the right-of-way. The NITU will 
also indicate that if the user intends to terminate trail use, it must 
send the Commission a copy of the NITU and request that it be vacated on 
a specific date. The Commission will reopen the exemption proceeding, 
vacate the NITU, and reissue a Notice of Exemption for that portion of 
the right-of-way. Copies of the reissued Notice of Exemption will be 
sent to:
    (i) The abandonment exemption applicant;
    (ii) The owner of the right-of-way; and
    (iii) The trail user.
    (3) If an application to construct and operate a rail line over the 
right-of-way is authorized under 49 U.S.C. 10901 and 49 CFR Part 1150, 
or exempted under 49 U.S.C. 10505, then the NITU will be vacated 
accordingly.
    (e) Where late-filed trail use statements are accepted, the Director 
(or designee) will telephone the railroad to determine whether 
abandonment has been consummated and, if not, whether the railroad is 
willing to negotiate an interim trail use agreement. The railroad shall 
confirm, in writing, its response, within 5 days. If abandonment has 
been consummated, the trail use request will be dismissed. If 
abandonment has not been consummated but the railroad refuses to 
negotiate, then trail use will be denied. If abandonment has not been 
consummated and the railroad is willing to negotiate, the abandonment 
proceeding will be reopened, the certificate of abandonment decision 
granting an exemption or notice of exemption will be vacated, and an 
appropriate CITU or NITU will be issued. The effective date of the CITU 
or NITU will be the same date as the vacated certificate, decision, or 
notice.
    (f) When a trail user intends to terminate trail use and another 
person intends to become a trail user by assuming financial 
responsibility for the right-of-way, then the existing and future trail 
users shall file, jointly:
    (1) A copy of the extant CITU or NITU; and
    (2) A Statement of Willingness to Assume Financial Responsibility by 
the new trail user.

The parties shall indicate the date on which responsibility for the 
right-of-way is to transfer to the new trail user. The Commission will 
reopen the abandonment or exemption proceeding, vacate the existing NITU 
or CITU; and issue an appropriate replacement NITU or CITU to the new 
trail user.
    (g) In proceedings where a timely trail use statement is filed, but 
due to either the railroad's indication of its unwillingness to 
negotiate interim trail use agreement, or its failure to timely notify 
the Commission of its willingness to negotiate, a certificate of 
abandonment or an exemption notice or decision is issued instead of a 
CITU or NITU, and subsequently the railroad and trail use proponent 
nevertheless determine to negotiate an interim trail use agreement under 
the Trails Act, then the railroad and trail use proponent must file a 
joint pleading requesting that an appropriate CITU or NITU be issued. 
The Commission will reopen the proceeding, vacate the outstanding 
certificate, decision or notice (or portion thereof), and issue an 
appropriate CITU or NITU that will permit the parties to negotiate for a 
period agreed to by the parties in their joint filing, but not to exceed 
180 days, at the end of which, the CITU or NITU will convert into a 
certificate, decision, or notice permitting abandonment.

<R05>
Sec. 1152.30  General.

    (a) Contents of subpart. (1) 49 U.S.C. 10905 directs the Commission 
to determine the extent to which the avoidable costs of providing rail 
service plus a reasonable return on the value of the line exceed the 
revenues attributable to the line. Section 205(e)(1)(B) of the Regional 
Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, as amended, directs the Office to 
publish standards for determining the ``avoidable costs of providing 
rail freight service'', as that phrase is used in section 10905. This 
subpart contains the methodology for such determinations and the 
standards necessary for application of those terms in the context of a 
particular proceeding. Such data will be used in reaching the 
Commission's findings on the merits of an abandonment of discontinuance 
proceeding and in making the necessary financial assistance 
determinations.
    (2) This subpart also sets forth a method by which the carrier may 
establish its Forecast Year estimates and Estimated Subsidy Payment to 
be included in its application (Sec. 1152.22(d) of this part). 
Furthermore, an offeror of financial assistance may use this method to 
formulate a subsidy offer and/or Proposed Subsidy Payment under 49 
U.S.C. 10905 and Sec. 1152.27 of Subpart C of this part.
    (b) Data collection. The owning or operating carrier shall establish 
a system to collect at branch level the data necessary to compute the 
base year data and the final subsidy payment. The collection and 
compilation of such data shall be in accordance with the Branch Line 
Accounting System (49 CFR Part 1201) established by the Office pursuant 
to section 205(e)(1)(a) of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, 
as amended.
    (c) Final payment of financial assistance. (1) When a financial 
assistance agreement is concluded and rail service continued thereunder, 
the final annual payment will be adjusted to reflect the actual revenues 
derived, avoidable costs incurred, and value of the properties used in 
the subsidy year.
    (2) Where an adjustment results in an increase in the Estimated 
Subsidy Payment upon which the financial assistance agreement is based, 
the amount of such increase in excess of 15 percent of the estimated 
payment shall be treated as a carryover avoidable cost in the subsequent 
subsidy year. However, if the railroad notifies the subsidizer that the 
estimate will be exceeded by more than 15 percent in one of the 
Financial Status Reports (Sec. 1152.37) issued during the first ten 
months of the subsidy year or the increase results from an expense 
preapproved by the subsidizer, the adjusted amount shall be included in 
the final annual payment.

Sec. 1152.31  Revenue and income attributable to branch lines.

    The revenue attributable to the rail properties is the total of the 
revenues assigned to the branch in accordance with this section, plus 
any subsidy payments that would cease upon discontinuance of service on 
the branch, for the subsidy year. The revenues assigned shall be derived 
from the following accounts:
    (a) Account 101-Freight. The revenue assigned under this account 
shall be the actual revenues, including transit revenues, accruing to 
the railroad, derived from waybills and other source documents, for all 
traffic that:
    (1) Originates and terminates on the branch;
    (2) Originates or terminates on the branch and is handled off the 
branch on the system but not on another carrier; and
    (3) Originates or terminates on the branch and is handled on another 
carrier.

All traffic that is received or forwarded through interchange at a point 
on the branch, including ferry operations, shall be considered as 
originating or terminating on the branch. The revenues of all other 
bridge or overhead traffic shall be attributed to the branch on the

provided, however, that the parties may agree on a mutually acceptable 
usage charge for bridge traffic in lieu of the mileage apportionment.

Sec. 1152.32  Calculation of avoidable costs.

    This section defines: Which cost elements are eligible for inclusion 
in the calculation of avoidable costs; the conditions under which 
certain cost elements become eligible for inclusion; and the basis of 
apportioning those cost elements which are not assigned to the branch on 
an actual expense basis. The avoidable costs of providing freight 
service on a branch shall be the total of the costs assigned to the 
branch in accordance with this section. The avoidable costs of providing 
freight service on a branch shall be just and reasonable, and shall not 
exceed those necessary for an honest and efficient operation. Those 
expenses apportioned under this section shall be derived from the latest 
Form R-1 or Form R-2 of the railroad filed with the ICC prior to the 
conclusion of the subsidy year, and assigned to the branch according to 
the procedures set forth in Sec. 1152.33 of these regulations. When the 
term ``Actual'' is specified as the basis for assigning an expense, it 
shall mean that the only costs which can be assigned to the account are 
those costs which are incurred solely as a result of the continuation of 
rail freight service on the branch. The accounts in the following 
charts, which list only the ``freight-only'' account numbers, shall 
include the portion of common expenses that have been apportioned to 
freight service.

    (e) Deadheading, taxi, and hotel costs. The costs assigned under 
this subsection shall be the actual costs incurred as a result of 
providing service to the branch line for deadheading, taxi, and hotel 
costs. The amounts included under this subsection shall not be included 
under other subsections of these regulations.
    (f) Overhead movement costs. The costs assigned under this 
subsection shall be the actual costs incurred in moving overhead in 
order to provide service to the branch. The amounts shown under this 
subsection shall not be included under other subsections of these 
regulations.
    (g) Freight car costs. For Class I railroads, the on-segment costs 
for time-mileage freight cars shall be calculated on the basis of the 
carrier's average cost per day and per mile. Those freight cars that are 
rented on a straight mileage basis are to be costed on the carrier's 
average cost per mile for each type of car rented on this basis. No 
costs are to be included in the calculation for private line (shipper 
owned) or other cars for which the railroad does not make payments. The 
cost per day and per mile shall be calculated separately for each type 
of car specified in Ex Parte No. 334, Car Service Compensation--Basic 
Per Diem Charges, 362 I.C.C. 884 (1980). The freight car costs shall be 
seporated between ``return on value-freight cars'' and ``freight car 
costs other than return on freight cars''. The costs assigned to a line 
under this subsection are to be derived from the accounts listed below.

The system total of the repair and maintenance accounts, all accounts 
designated XX-XX-42, and depreciation shall be divided into time-related 
costs and mileage-related costs on the basis of the present ``Rail Form 
A'' apportionment factors (i.e., 50 percent time and 50 percent mileage 
for repairs, and 60 percent time and 40 percent mileage for 
depreciation). Freight car costs shall not include depreciation as 
determined in Account No. 62-22-00. Freight car depreciation shall be 
calculated in the manner set forth in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this 
section. The system total receipts and payments for the hire of time-
mileage cars, and the basic data used in the development of the car-day 
and car-mile factors, shall be taken from the carrier's latest Form R-1 
and company records. The specific steps to complete the calculation are 
as follows:
    (1) The total system car days by car type shall be calculated by: 
(i) Averaging the carrier's freight car ownership at the beginning and 
end of the year (Form R-1, schedule 710, columns (b) and (k); (ii) 
multiplying the average by the standard active number of car days (346) 
as developed in ICC Docket No. 31358; (iii) subtracting car days on 
foreign lines (source: Company records); and (iv) adding the foreign car 
days on home line (source: Company records). This procedure shall be 
followed for each car type specified in Ex Parte No. 334, supra.
    (2) The total railroad car miles shall be calculated by adding the 
loaded car miles for the railroad owned and leased cars (R-1, Schedule 
755) to empty car miles for the railroad owned or leased cars (R-1, 
Schedule 755). The total car miles, loaded and empty, shall be 
calculated for each car type specified in Ex Parte No. 334, supra.

[[Page 317]]

    (3) The cost per car day shall be calculated for each type of time-
mileage car by adding 50 percent of total freight car repair costs for 
each type (Form R-1, schedule 415, column (b)), and 60 percent of the 
depreciation shall be developed as follows:
    (i) The current value for each type of car shall be calculated by 
first arriving at the current cost per car using the most recent 
purchase of this type by the railroad indexed to the midpoint of the 
year or a price quote from the manufacturer. This unit price shall be 
applied to the average number of this type of car owned by the carrier 
during the year. The current value developed for each car type is then 
multiplied by the composite depreciation rate for that type of car as 
shown in the latest annual report filed with the Commission or company 
records.
    (ii) Add 100 percent of the return on investment. Return on 
investment shall be determined by multiplying the current value of each 
type of car, developed in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section, by 1 
minus the ratio of accumulated depreciation to the total original cost 
investment. This will determine the net current value for each type of 
car. The net current value for each type of car shall then be multiplied 
by the nominal rate of return calculated in Sec. 1152.34(d) to obtain 
nominal return on investment for each type of car. The total return on 
investment shall then be calculated by deducting the projected holding 
gain (loss) for the forecast and/or subsidy year from the nominal return 
on investment for each type of car. The total return on investment for 
each type of car shall then be divided by total car-days for each car-
type developed in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
    (iii) To the amounts for repairs and depreciation, and add the time 
portion of the railroad's payment for hire of time-mileage freight cars 
(Form R-1, schedule 414, column (g)), and subtract the time portion of 
the railroad's receipts for hire of time mileage freight cars (Form R-1, 
schedule 414, column (d)). The total of these costs is divided by the 
total car days for each type developed in paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section.
    (4) The cost per mile shall be calculated for each type of time-
mileage car as follows. First, add: (i) 50 percent of the total freight 
train car repair cost for each car type (Form R-1, schedule 415, column 
(b)); (ii) 40 percent of the total depreciation costs for each car type 
developed in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section; and (iii) the mileage 
portion of the carrier's payments for the hire of time-mileage freight 
cars (Form R-1, schedule 414, column (f)). Then, subtract the mileage 
portion of the carrier's receipts for hire of time-mileage freight cars 
(Form R-1, schedule 414, column (c)). Finally, divide the result by the 
total car-miles for each car-type developed in paragraph (g)(2) of this 
section.
    (5) The costs per car day and per car mile developed in paragraphs 
(g)(3) and (4) of this section shall be applied to the total car days 
and total car miles for each car type accumulated on the line segment 
for all traffic originated and/or terminated on the segment plus those 
freight cars that bridge the line segment which are attributed to time-
mileage freight train cars. The on-segment costs for freight cars rented 
on a straight mileage basis shall be the railroad's total payments for 
mileage cars (Form R-1, schedule 414, column (e)), for each car type 
divided by the total miles on which the charges were based.
    (6) For Class II and III railroads, the on-segment costs for time-
mileage and straight mileage freight cars shall be calculated in the 
same manner prescribed for Class I railroads, using the latest data 
available.
    (h) Return on investment--locomotive (line). The return on 
investment shall be calculated for each type of classification of 
locomotive that is actually used to provide service to the line segment. 
The return for the locomotive(s) used shall be calculated in accordance 
with the following procedure:
    (1) The current replacement cost for each type of locomotive used to 
serve the line segment shall be based on the most recent purchase of 
that particular type and size locomotive by the carrier, indexed to the 
midpoint of the subsidy year, or an amount quoted by the manufacturer. 
The amount must be substantiated. This unit cost shall be multiplied by 
1 minus the ratio of total

[[Page 318]]

accumulated depreciation to original total cost of that type of 
equipment owned by applicant-carrier, as shown by company records.
    (2) The current nominal cost of capital shall be used in the 
calculation of return on investment for locomotives shall be calculated 
as provided in Sec. 1152.34(d).
    (3) The return on investment for each category or type of locomotive 
shall be the nominal return less the holding gain (loss). The nominal 
return is calculated by multiplying the replacement cost determined in 
paragraph (h)(1) of this section by the nominal rate of return 
determined in paragraph (h)(2) of this section. The holding gain (loss) 
shall be gain (loss) projected to occur during the forecast and/or 
subsidy year.
    (4) The return on investment for each type of locomotive shall be 
assigned to the line segment on a ratio of the locomotive unit hours on 
the segment to average locomotive unit hours per unit for each type of 
locomotive in the system. This ratio will be developed as follows:
    (i) The carrier shall keep and maintain records of the number of 
hours that each type of locomotive incurred in serving the segment 
during the subsidy period.
    (ii) The railroad shall develop the system average locomotive unit 
hours per unit for each of the following types of locomotives; yard 
diesel; yard-other; road diesel; and road-other.
    (iii) The ratio applied to the return on investment is calculated by 
dividing the hours that each type or class of locomotive is used to 
serve the segment, as developed in paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section, 
by the system average locomotive unit hours per unit for the applicable 
type developed in paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section.
    (5) The cost assigned to the segment for each type of locomotive 
shall be calculated by multipying the annual return on investment 
developed in paragraph (h)(3) of this section by the ratio(s) developed 
in paragraph (h)(4) of this section.
    (i) Revenue taxes. The amount of revenue taxes shall be computed 
based on the amounts directly paid in those States that subject the 
railroad to a revenue tax.
    (j) Property taxes (Line). (1) The assigned costs under this 
subsection shall be the net systemwide property tax savings resulting 
from the abandonment, calculated as set out below, if the applicant-
carrier intends subsequently to sell or otherwise dispose of the 
abandoned properties. If the applicant-carrier expresses an intent to 
dispose of the properties, it will be presumed that the properties will 
ultimately be sold or otherwise disposed of after abandonment. 
Protestants may rebut this presumption by showing that it would be 
financially beneficial to retain ownership of the property for 
investment purposes.
    (2) In States where a true ad valorem tax is levied on real property 
(such as track, land, buildings, and other facilities), applicant must 
affirm that the ad valorem method applies and must substantiate the 
amount of property taxes levied against the property on the line 
segment.
    (3) In States where the ad valorem method is not employed, applicant 
must describe the applicable property tax methodology if it is claiming 
the local property tax as an avoidable cost of operations. Additionally, 
it must substantiate with evidence and computations the actual Statewide 
tax savings attributable to the abandonment.
    (4) Any property tax properly substantiated under paragraphs (f)(2) 
or (3) of this section shall be presumed to represent systemwide savings 
to the carrier. Protestants may rebut this presumption by presenting 
evidence: (i) That property taxes in those States where the carrier 
operates that are not involved in the abandonment will increase 
significantly because of reassessments attributable to the abandonment; 
or (ii) that a significantly higher property tax will be levied against 
a retained portion of the abandoned property. If applicant does not 
refute protestant's evidence, it may claim avoidable property taxes only 
if, and to the extent, it proves systemwide property tax savings.
    (5) In States where real property taxes are assessed and levied 
against the owner of the property but the tax

[[Page 319]]

on rolling stock is assessed to the railroad operating the service on 
the basis of a formula of a State-wide valuation of property, the tax on 
rolling stock attributable to each line segment shall be determined as 
follows:
    (i) Using ratio of the cost of equipment (as used in the formula) to 
the total of all property costs (as used in formula);
    (ii) Apply that ratio to the total State assessment to determine the 
portion of the assessment attributable to rolling stock;
    (iii) Allocate the rolling stock assessment thus determined to each 
line segment on the basis of car and locomotive unit miles on the 
segment to total car and locomotive unit miles in the State; and
    (iv) Apply the appropriate tax rate or rates to the allocated 
assessment thus determined.
    (k) Administrative costs. The costs assigned under this account 
shall be the actual costs directly attributable to the administration of 
the subsidy program or at the option of the carrier, one percent of the 
total annual revenues attributed to the branch shall be allowable to 
cover all costs of administering the subsidy program. Either method may 
be used, but not both.
    (l) Casualty reserve account. The costs assigned under this account 
shall be any payments mutually agreed to by the person offering the 
subsidy and the railroad for the purpose of holding the subsidizer 
harmless from any liability under those accounts that are used to record 
any costs incurred by the railroad as a result of an accident.
    (m) Rehabilitation. (1) For abandonment purposes the applicant 
carrier shall project the amounts necessary to permit efficient 
operations over the line segment. The carrier shall indicate the level 
of FRA Class Safety Standard to be attained with the amount of 
expenditure. See 49 CFR Part 213. Applicant-carrier, in making its 
projection of rehabilitation costs, shall give consideration to
    (i) The cost to attain the lowest operationally feasible track 
level,
    (ii) The cost to attain the rehabilitation level resulting in the 
lowest operating and rehabilitation expenditures, or
    (iii) The cost to attain the rehabilitation level resulting in the 
lowest loss, or highest profit, from operations.
    (2) For subsidy purposes rehabilitation costs shall not be included 
unless:
    (i) The track does not meet minimum Federal Railroad Administrative 
Class I Safety Standards (49 CFR part 213), in which case the railroad 
will furnish, with the abandonment application, a detailed estimate of 
the costs to rehabilitate the track to the minimum level; or
    (ii) The potential subsidizer requests a level of service which 
requires expenditures for rehabilitation.
    (n) Off-branch costs. The off-branch costs developed in this section 
shall be separated between ``off-branch costs other than return on 
freight cars'' and ``return on value-freight cars''. The off-branch 
costs shall be developed in the following manner:
    (1) Terminal costs, line-haul costs, interchange costs, and modified 
terminal costs shall be considered as the off-branch avoidable costs of 
providing service over the remainder of the railroad's system. These 
costs shall be computed by applying the variable unit costs to the 
service units attributed to the branch line's traffic for the time 
periods specified in Sec. 1152.22(d) of this part.
    (2) The procedure for determining the off-branch costs shall be 
based upon the URCS cost formula. This formula shall be applied to the 
latest Annual Report Form R-1 filed by the railroad, with two 
exceptions. First, the amount used in the formula for freight car 
depreciation shall be calculated using the procedure discussed in 
paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section applied to the average total car 
fleet of the railroad. Second, the return on investment in freight cars 
shall be computed using the procedure set forth in paragraph (g)(3)(ii) 
of this section. In addition, the application of URCS shall include the 
use of the nominal cost of capital for all return on investment 
determinations.
    (3) The Class I Procedure: A Class I railroad shall calculate its 
off-branch costs using the Class I procedure set forth in this paragraph 
(n)(3).
    (i) The unit costs developed by applying URCS in the manner 
specified in

[[Page 320]]

paragraph (n)(2) of this section shall be applied to the service 
characteristics of each movement of traffic that is attributed to the 
branch line. This application shall result in the total off-branch cost 
associated with this traffic for normal terminal handlings, line-haul 
mileage, and interchange events.
    (ii) The modified terminal cost per carload shall be calculated 
separately for each type of freight car and applied to each car that is 
attributed to the branch line. The modified terminal cost shall consist 
of clerical costs, two days of freight car cost, and an inter-intra 
train switching cost (locomotive engine minute cost only). The clerical 
cost and inter-intra train switching cost shall be calculated from unit 
costs developed within the individual URCS application.
    (A) The unit costs for the clerical cost per carload calculation are 
located in Worktable E1, Part 1: Line 106, columns 1, 2, and 3; line 
107, column 1; line 108, column 1; line 109, column 1; and line 110, 
column 1.
    (B) The inter-intra train switching cost shall be calculated by 
multiplying the total switch engine minute cost from Worktable E1, Part 
1, line 111, columns 1, 2, and 3 by the total minutes specified in the 
next sentence. The total minutes specified in this sentence shall equal 
the sum of;
    (1) The minutes per switch event from Worktable E2, Part 1, line 
118, column 29; and
    (2) The product of the minutes per switch event from Worktable E2, 
Part 1, line 118, column 29 and the ratio of loaded to total car miles 
for the particular type of freight car being costed.
    (C) The freight car cost shall be the car ownership costs per car 
day for two days developed in accordance with the procedures set forth 
in paragraph (g)(3) of this section for the type of freight car being 
costed.
    (iii) For a Class I railroad, the total costs calculated using the 
procedures set forth in paragraphs (n)(3)(i) and (n)(3)(ii) of this 
section shall constitute the off-branch costs attributable to the branch 
line's traffic.
    (4) A Class II or Class III railroad shall calculate its off-branch 
costs using any one of three different procedures. The Class I 
Procedure: A Class II or Class III railroad may calculate its off-branch 
costs using the Class I procedure set forth in paragraph (n)(3) of this 
section, if the necessary data are available from the railroad's own 
records. If the data necessary to complete the Class I procedure set 
forth in paragraph (n)(3) of this section are not available from the 
railroad's own records, the Class II or Class III railroad shall 
calculate its off-branch costs using either one of the following 
procedures based on the latest regional URCS data and the railroad's own 
records. The Class II/III Simplified Costing Procedure: A Class II or 
Class III railroad may calculate its off-branch costs using the Class I 
procedure set forth in paragraph (n)(3) of this section, with regional 
URCS data of the Class I railroads used in lieu of individual URCS data 
of the Class II or Class III railroad. Costs developed through the use 
of the Class II/III simplified costing procedure shall enjoy a 
rebuttable presumption of correctness. The Class II/III Standard Costing 
Procedure: A Class II or Class III railroad may calculate its off-branch 
costs using the Class II/III standard costing procedure set forth in 
paragraphs (n)(4)(i) through (n)(4)(xiv) of this section. Costs 
developed through the use of the Class II/III standard costing procedure 
shall be given preference over costs developed through the use of the 
Class II/III simplified costing procedure.
    The Class II/III standard costing procedure is set forth in 
paragraphs (n)(4)(i) through (n)(4)(xiv) of this section.
    (i) The Class II or Class III railroad shall first determine which 
URCS regional application will be used based on its geographical 
location. The railroad's total estimated system variable expenses are 
calculated by multiplying its total operating expenses by the ratio of 
variable expenses to total expenses; this ratio is located in Worktable 
D8, Part 6, line 615, column 1 of the URCS printout for the appropriate 
region. If a railroad has passenger and freight service, the freight 
portion of the total estimated system variable expenses shall be 
calculated by multiplying the total estimated system variable expenses, 
calculated as above, by the

[[Page 321]]

ratio of freight related operating expenses to total railway operating 
expenses.
    (ii) The total number of revenue carload terminal handlings, as 
determined from the railroad's records, shall be calculated as the sum 
of:
    (A) Originated and terminated (local) revenue carloads multiplied by 
2; plus
    (B) Interchanged and either originated or terminated (interline) 
revenue carloads.
    (iii) The total number of revenue carload interchange handlings, as 
determined from the railroad's records, shall be calculated as the sum 
of:
    (A) Bridge (interchange to interchange) revenue carloads multiplied 
by 2; plus
    (B) Revenue carloads that are interchanged and either originated or 
terminated (interline).
    (iv) The system average shipment weight per car, as determined from 
the railroad's records, shall be calculated by dividing:
    (A) Ton-miles-revenue freight by
    (B) Loaded freight car miles.
    (v) The system average loaded car miles per car, as determined from 
the railroad's records, shall be calculated by dividing:
    (A) Revenue ton-miles by
    (B) Revenue tons.
    (vi) The railroad shall complete an URCS Phase III ``Movement 
Costing Program'' based on the application of URCS data for the 
appropriate region. The following data shall be inputs to the Phase III 
program application.
    (A) The carrier code, either ``REG 4'' or ``REG 7'', shall 
correspond to the appropriate region.
    (B) The type of shipment shall be designated as ``OD'' in order for 
the movement to be costed as an interline movement.
    (C) The distance shall be the system average loaded car miles per 
car as developed in paragraph (n)(4)(v) of this section.
    (D) The type of freight car shall be identified as a Box, General 
Service Equipped, which has an input user code of ``3''. If all of the 
traffic on the branch line is transported in a single type of car, and 
it is not a Box, General Service Equipped, the code for that type of car 
may be substituted.
    (E) The number of freight cars shall be ``1''.
    (F) The car ownership factor shall be designated as ``R'' for 
railroad owned cars unless all of the branch line traffic is moved in 
privately owned cars, in which case the code ``P'' for privately owned 
cars would be the input.
    (G) The program requires a loss and damage input. The code ``48'', 
representing the average of all commodities, shall be used.
    (H) The input for shipment weight shall be the system average 
shipment weight per car developed in paragraph (n)(4)(iv) of this 
section.
    (I) The input for type of movement shall be ``1'', representing an 
individual car movement.
    (vii) The ratios employed to separate the total estimated system 
variable expenses, as determined in paragraph (n)(4)(i) of this section, 
among terminal, interchange, and line-haul operations shall be based on 
the procedures outlined in this paragraph (n)(4)(vii). This separation 
shall reflect the variable costs resulting from the application of the 
URCS Phase III program based on the input factors specified in paragraph 
(n)(4)(vi) of this section. The ratios shall be calculated in the 
following manner:
    (A) The terminal expenses calculated by the application of the Phase 
III program shall consist of the following:

    (C) The line-haul expenses resulting from the application of the 
Phase III program shall be calculated by subtracting the sum of:
    (1) The terminal expenses as determined in paragraph (n)(4)(vii)(A) 
of this section, and
    (2) The interchange expenses as determined in paragraph 
(n)(4)(vii)(B) of this section, from
    (3) The total variable cost excluding loss and damage as calculated 
in the Phase III program at line 696.
    (D) The ratio for terminal expenses shall be calculated by dividing 
the terminal expenses as determined in paragraph (n)(4)(vii)(A) of this 
section by the total variable cost excluding loss and damage as

loaded and empty, as determined from the railroad's records.
    (x) The modified terminal cost per carload is a composite of costs 
developed in the Phase III program and costs determined in accordance 
with paragraph (g) of this section and this paragraph. The modified 
terminal cost per carload shall be calculated for each type of car as 
follows:
    (A) The station clerical cost per carload shall be developed in the 
following manner:
    (1) The station clerical expense ratio shall be calculated by 
dividing the total clerical cost (the sum of lines 256, 258, 260, 262,

(n)(4)(x)(C) of this section.
    (xi) The terminal costs shall be calculated by multiplying the 
terminal cost per carload as determined in paragraph (n)(4)(ix)(A) of 
this section by the number of carloads that both:
    (A) Originated or terminated on the branch, and
    (B) Are local to the railroad serving the branch.
    (xii) The interchange costs shall be calculated by multiplying the 
interchange cost per carload as determined in paragraph (n)(4)(ix)(B) of 
this section by the number of carloads that both:
    (A) Originated or terminated on the branch, and
    (B) Are received in or forwarded through interchange with other 
railroads.
    (xiii) The line-haul costs shall be calculated by multiplying the 
line-haul cost per car mile as determined in paragraph (n)(4)(ix)(C) of 
this section by the total loaded and empty car miles generated on the 
railroad's system off the branch by cars that originated or terminated 
on the branch.
    (xiv) The modified terminal costs shall be calculated by multiplying 
the modified terminal cost per carload as determined in paragraph 
(n)(4)(x)(D) of this section by the number of carloads that originated 
or terminated on the branch.
    (o) Locomotive depreciation. The depreciation cost for locomotives 
used on the line shall be calculated using the following procedure:
    (1) The current replacement cost for each type of locomotive used to 
serve the line will be based on the most recent purchase of that 
particular type and size locomotive by the carrier indexed to the 
midpoint of the year or an amount quoted by the manufacturer.
    (2) The depreciation rate that will be applied to the replacement 
cost shall be the carrier's component rate for each type of locomotive 
as reported in the latest Annual Report Form R-1 submitted to the 
Commission or from the company records. Carriers using depreciation 
rates based on company records must explain why composite rates are 
inappropriate; provide a detailed explanation of the methodology used to 
compute the alternate depreciation rate; and demonstrate that these 
rates have been used consistently.

[[Page 324]]

    (3) The annual depreciation cost for each type of locomotive shall 
be calculated by multiplying the replacement cost(s) developed in 
paragraph (o)(1) of this section by the rate from paragraph (o)(2) of 
this section.
    (4) The depreciation expense for each type of locomotive shall be 
assigned to the line on the ratio of the hours incurred serving the line 
to the average system locomotive unit hours in service by each of the 
following categories of locomotives: Yard-diesel; yard-other; road-
diesel; and road-other. The ratio for each type of locomotive used to 
serve the line shall be the same as that developed in paragraph (h)(4) 
of this section.
    (5) The depreciation shall be calculated by multiplying the annual 
depreciation expense for each type of locomotive developed in paragraph 
(o)(3) of this section by the ratio(s) developed in paragraph (o)(4) of 
this section.
    (p) Opportunity costs. Applicant-carrier may, at its discretion, 
present evidence of its opportunity costs, if the assets engaged in the 
line proposed to be abandoned could be used more profitably in some 
other capacity. Opportunity costs may be calculated in accordance with 
the methodology established in Sec. 1152.34 of this part, or by using 
any other reasonable, fully-explained method. Opportunity costs are not 
included as costs on Exhibit 1 described at Sec. 1152.36. These costs 
should be submitted as a separate exhibit to the application.
    (q) Labor costs. (1) The salaries, wages and fringe benefits of 
personnel exclusively assigned to the line segment shall be deemed 
attributable costs of the segment. The salaries, wages, and fringe 
benefits of personnel not exclusively assigned to the line segment shall 
be deemed attributable costs of the segment to the extent they are shown 
to be apportionable to the segment to be abandoned.
    (2) These costs shall be deemed attributable notwithstanding any 
obligation of applicant to provide employee protection for employees 
after the abandonment.

Sec. 1152.33  Apportionment rules for the assignment of expenses to on-branch costs.

    The accounts specified under Sec. 1152.32(a), (b), (c), and (d) as 
having an assignment basis other than ``Actual'' shall be apportioned 
according to the rules contained in this section.
    (a) Maintenance of way and structures--(1) Roadway machines. All 
accounts designated XX-13-36 shall be assigned to the branch on the 
basis of the average repair costs, for each type of machine, included in 
the daily rental fees charged by the operating railroad or as published 
by the General Manager's Association of Chicago (GMA), based on the 
actual number of days each type of machine is used on the branch.
    (2) Small tools and supplies. All accounts designated XX-13-37 shall 
be assigned to the branch as follows: (i) The costs of supplies, 
consumed in the operation of roadway machines, shall be assigned to the 
branch on the basis of the average costs of supplies per day, included 
in the daily rental fees charged by the operating railroad or as 
published by the GMA, multiplied by the actual number of days that the 
machine is used on the branch; (ii) the costs of small tools shall be 
assigned to the branch on the basis of the ratio that the branch amounts 
in Accounts 11-11-10 through 11-11-17 and 11-11-48, plus 11-12-10 
through 11-12-17 and 11-12-48 bear to the railroad's system total for 
the same accounts.
    (3) Fringe benefits. Fringe benefits shall be assigned to the branch 
separated between running, switching and other, on the ratio that the 
total branch salary and wages bear to the total system salaries and 
wages for each activity as follows:

[[Page 325]]

    (i) Fringe benefits--Running, Account 12-11-00, total of all 11-11-
XX accounts branch to system;
    (ii) Fringe benefits--Switching, Account 12-12-00, total of all 11-
12-XX accounts branch to system; and
    (iii) Fringe benefits--Other, Account 12-13-00, total of all 11-13-
XX accounts branch to system.
    (b) Maintenance of equipment--(1) Locomotive repairs and 
maintenance. All accounts designated XX-21-41 shall be separated between 
yard and road with a further separation between diesel and other 
(electric). The costs for these accounts for yard locomotives shall be 
assigned to the branch separately for diesel and electric locomotives on 
the basis of the ratio of branch diesel and electric yard locomotive 
unit-hours to the total system diesel and electric yard locomotive unit-
hours. The costs for these accounts for road locomotives shall be 
assigned to the branch separately for diesel and electric locomotives on 
the basis of the ratio of branch diesel and electric locomotive gross 
ton-miles in road service to the total system diesel and electric 
locomotive gross ton-miles in road service. The costs assigned under 
these accounts for specialized equipment devoted exclusively to branch 
line service shall be the actual costs for the specific equipment used.
    (2) Locomotive depreciation. Locomotive depreciation shall be 
calculated and assigned in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
Sec. 1152.32(o).
    (3) Fringe Benefits. Fringe benefits for locomotives and other 
equipment shall be assigned to the branch on the ratio that the total 
branch salary and wages bear to the system total salaries and wages for 
each type of equipment as follows:
    (i) Locomotives--Account 12-21-00, total of all 11-21-XX accounts 
branch to system.
    (ii) Other Equipment--Account 12-23-00, total of all 11-23-XX 
accounts branch to system.
    (iii) Fringe benefits for freight cars shall be calculated by first 
estimating the total in Account 11-22-42, Freight car repairs--salaries 
and wages, that is included in the total on branch costs for freight 
cars as determined from the car day and car mile cost calculations, in 
Sec. 1152.32(g) of these regulations.
    To this amount is added the branch totals in the balance of all 11-
22-XX accounts. The ratio of this total branch account to the system 
total for all 11-22-XX accounts is applied to Account 12-22-00, Fringe 
Benefits--Freight Cars.
    (c) Transportation--(1) Train operations--(i) Engine Crews-
Materials, Account 21-31-56; Train Crews-Materials, Account 21-31-57; 
Train Inspection and Lubrication-Salaries and Wages, Account 11-31-62; 
and Train Inspection and Lubrication-Materials, Account 21-31-62; If the 
branch is served by a local/way or through train, the costs in these 
accounts shall be assigned to the branch on the weighted ratio of the 
loaded freight train cars on the branch to the total system loaded 
freight train cars, and the loaded and empty car-miles on the branch to 
the total system loaded and empty car-miles. This shall be calculated as 
follows:
    (A) To determine the car-mile portion of these accounts,
    (1) Multiply the total amounts in these accounts (from the R-1 
Annual Report, Schedule 410) by 69 percent (the ratio of train-mile and 
running expenses from Rail Form A),
    (2) Divide the amount in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A)(1) of this section 
by the total system loaded and empty car-miles, and
    (3) Multiply the car-mile unit cost factor from paragraph 
(c)(1)(i)(A)(2) of this section by the on-branch car-miles (loaded and 
empty).
    (B) To determine the carload portion of these accounts.
    (1) Multiply the total amounts in these accounts by 31 percent (the 
ratio of terminal expenses from Rail Form A),
    (2) Divide the amount in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B)(1) of this section 
by the total system carloads, and
    (3) Multiply the carload unit cost factor from paragraph 
(c)(1)(i)(B)(2) of this section by the on branch carloads.
    (C) To determine the total costs assignable to the branch for these 
accounts, add the amounts developed in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(A)(3) and 
(c)(1)(i)(B)(3) of this section.

[[Page 326]]

    (ii) All accounts designated xx-31-67 shall be assigned to the 
branch in accordance with the following procedure. The dollar amounts 
used in the determination of locomotive fuel costs shall be based on 
data contained in the most recent publication issued by the General 
Managers Association (GMA) relating to the rental of locomotives. The 
total number of locomotive unit hours incurred by the locomotive(s) 
shall then be categorized according to the applicable GMA horsepower 
classification group. The fuel cost is derived from the Repairs and 
Supplies Expenses element of the locomotive rental rates published by 
the GMA. The fuel cost per locomotive unit hour shall be determined for 
each GMA horsepower classification group by multiplying the latest GMA 
fuel cost percentage by the Repairs and Supplies Expense per hour 
included in each group. The fuel cost update ratio is determined by 
using the indices for fuel from the Association of American Railroad's 
(AAR's) Railroad Cost Recovery Index (RCR). The indices shall be taken 
from the district of which the railroad is assigned by the Commission. 
The index for the current period is divided by the index of the period 
representative of the GMA publication to develop the fuel update ratio. 
The fuel cost per locomotive unit hour developed for each GMA horsepower 
group shall be multiplied by the fuel update ratio to determine the fuel 
cost per locomotive hour for each horsepower group. The updated fuel 
cost per locomotive unit hour for each applicable GMA group shall be 
multiplied by the number of locomotive unit hours incurred in serving 
the branch by locomotives of that GMA horsepower classification group. 
The total cost developed under this procedure for each horsepower 
classification shall be the locomotive fuel cost assignable to the 
branch line.
    (iii) Electric power purchased or produced for motive power--All 
accounts designated XX-31-68 shall be assigned to the branch on the 
ratio of road electric locomotive unit hours on the branch to the total 
system road electric locomotive unit hours.

be assigned to the branch on the ratio of road locomotive unit miles on 
the branch to the total system road locomotive unit miles.
    (2) Yard operations--(i) Switch Crews--Materials, Account 21-32-64, 
and Servicing Locomotives, all accounts designated XX-32-69. The costs 
for these accounts shall be assigned to the branch on the ratio of yard 
locomotive unit hours on the branch to the system total yard locomotive 
unit hours.
    (ii) Locomotive fuel--All accounts designated XX-32-67 shall be 
assigned to the branch on the ratio of yard diesel locomotive unit hours 
on the branch to the total system yard diesel locomotive unit hours.
    (iii) Electric power purchased or produced for motive power--All 
accounts designated XX-32-68 shall be assigned to the branch on the 
ratio of yard electric locomotive unit hours on the branch to the total 
system yard electric locomotive unit hours.
    (3) Administrative support operations--(i) Loss and damage claims 
processing--All accounts designated XX-35-78 shall be assigned to the 
branch on the ratio of the number of claims processed for loss or damage 
occurring on the branch to the total number of claims processed by the 
railroad.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (4) Transportation fringe benefits. Fringe benefits shall be 
assigned to the branch separated between train operations, yard 
operations, train and yard operations common, specialized service 
operations, and administrative support operations. The costs for each 
activity shall be assigned to the branch on the ratio that the total 
branch salary and wages bear to the total system salary and wages for 
each activity shown below.
    (i) Train Operations, Account 12-31-00, total of all 11-31-XX 
accounts branch to system.
    (ii) Yard Operations, Account 12-32-00, total of all 11-32-XX 
accounts branch to system.

    (c) Return on investment--road properties. Return on investment--
road properties shall be computed according to the following procedures:
    (1) The investment base to which the nominal return element shall 
apply shall be the sum of:
    (i) The allowable working capital computed at 15 days on-branch cash 
avoidable costs (on branch avoidable costs less depreciation).
    (ii) The amount of current income tax benefits resulting from 
abandonment of the line which would have been applicable to the period 
of the subsidy agreement. (Conversely, if the railroad would incur an 
income tax liability from abandonment, the liability should be deducted 
from the investment base.) This information is to be furnished by the 
railroad and subject to audit by the person offering the subsidy.
    (iii) The net liquidation value for the highest and best use for 
non-rail purposes, of the rail properties on the line to be subsidized 
which are used and required for performance of the services requested by 
the persons offering the subsidy. This value shall be determined by 
computing the current appraised market value of such properties for 
other than rail transportation purposes, less all costs of dismantling 
and disposition of improvements necessary to make the remaining 
properties available for their highest and best use and complying with 
applicable zoning, land use, and environmental regulations. If 
rehabilitation has been performed along the line during any subsidy year 
and rehabilitation expenses have been paid by the subsidizer under 49 
CFR 1152.32(m)(2), the investment base shall exclude the increment to 
the net liquidation value of the line caused by the rehabilitation 
project.
    (d) Reasonable return. A rail carrier shall furnish to the 
Commission, and to any financially responsible person considering making 
a offer of a rail service continuation payment, a substantiated 
statement showing its current nominal cost of capital. The railroad's 
nominal cost of capital shall be the current before tax cost of capital, 
weighted to the capital structure, and adjusted for the effects of the 
combined statutory Federal and State income tax rates. This rate of 
return expressed as a percent, shall be calculated as follows:
    (1) The railroad shall determine its permanent capital structure 
ratio for debt and equity capital such that the two numbers total 100 
percent. This capital structure will be the actual capital structure of 
the railroad. If this calculation is not possible or also not 
representative because the railroad is part of a conglomerate, the debt-
equity ratio from the Commission's latest Determination of Adequate 
Railroad Revenues will be used. However, if the debt-equity ratio for 
the railroad industry is used then the industry average equity and debt 
rate from the Commission's latest revenue adequacy finding must also be 
used in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section.
    (2) The current nominal cost of debt shall be determined by taking 
the average of all debt instruments (including bonds, equipment trust 
certificates, financial lease arrangement, et cetera) issued by the 
carrier in the most recent 12 month period. The debt cost calculated by 
this procedure is a before-tax rate and is not adjusted for inflation or 
income taxes.
    (3) The current nominal after tax cost of equity shall be an amount 
equal to that which a prudent investor would expect to earn through 
investment in the market place. The current after tax nominal cost of 
equity is divided by 1 minus the combined statutory Federal and State 
income tax rates. This will

[[Page 328]]

develop the nominal cost of equity on a before tax basis.
    (4) The current nominal before-tax cost of debt is multiplied by the 
current percentage of debt to total capital to obtain a weighted before-
tax nominal cost of current debt.
    (5) The current nominal before-tax cost of equity is multiplied by 
the current percentage of equity to total capital to obtain a weighted 
nominal before-tax cost of current equity.
    (6) The results of paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) are added together 
to determine the current nominal cost of capital.
    (e) Holding gain (loss)-road properties. The railroad shall 
determine the holding gain (loss) that is projected to occur during the 
forecast and/or subsidy year.

Sec. 1152.37  Financial status reports.

    Within 30 days after the end of each quarter of the subsidy year, 
each carrier which is party to a financial assistance agreement shall 
submit to the subsidizer a Financial Status Report for each line 
operated under subsidy. Such Financial Status Report shall be in the 
form prescribed below. Significant deviations from the negotiated 
estimates must be explained. Unless the parties agree otherwise, the 
last Financial Status Report issued within the first ten months of the 
subsidy period will be the basis for negotiating the financial 
assistance agreement for the subsequent subsidy year. The year-end 
report will be the basis of the subsidy payment adjustment. All data 
shall be developed in accordance with the methodology set forth in 
Secs. 1152.31 through 1152.35. In the quarterly reports, the actual data 
for the year to date and a projection to the end of the subsidy year 
shall be shown for each item.

date of figures) of each community in which a station on the line is 
located.
    (2) Identification of significant users, as defined in

   Subpart F--Exempt Abandonments and Discontinuances of Service and 
                             Trackage Rights


<R05>
Sec. 1152.50  Exempt abandonments and discontinuances of service and trackage rights.

    (a)(1) A proposed abandonment or discontinuance of service or 
trackage rights over a railroad line is exempt from the provisions of 49 
U.S.C. 10903-10905 if the criteria designated in this section are 
satisfied.
    (2) Whenever the Commission determines a proposed abandonment to be 
exempt from the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 10903-10905, whether under 
this section or on the basis of the merits of an individual petition, 
the provisions of Sec. 1152.27 and Sec. 1152.28 as they relate to 
exemption proceedings shall be applicable.
    (b) An abandonment or discontinuance of service or trackage rights 
is exempt if the carrier certifies that no local traffic has moved over 
the line for at least 2 years and any overhead traffic on the line can 
be rerouted over other lines and that no formal complaint filed by a 
user of rail service on the line (or a State or local government entity 
acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the 
line either is pending with the Commission or any U.S. District Court or 
has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period. 
The complaint must allege (if pending) or prove (if decided) that the 
carrier has imposed an illegal embargo or other unlawful impediment to 
service.
    (c) The Commission has found:
    (1) That its prior review and approval of these abandonments and 
discontinuances is not necessary to carry out the rail transportation 
policy of 49 U.S.C. 10101a; and
    (2) That these transactions are of limited scope and continued 
regulation is unnecessary to protect shippers from abuse of market 
power. 49 U.S.C. 10505.

A notice must be filed to use this class exemption. The procedures are 
set out in Sec. 1152.50(d). This class exemption does not relieve a 
carrier of its statutory obligation to protect the interests of 
employees. 49 U.S.C. 10505(g)(2) and 10903(b)(2). This also does not 
preclude a carrier from seeking an exemption of a specific abandonment 
or discontinuance that does not fall within this class.
    (d) Notice of exemption. (1) At least 10 days prior to filing a 
notice of exemption with the Commission, the railroad seeking the 
exemption must notify in writing (i) the Public Service Commission (or 
equivalent agency) in the State(s) where the line will be abandoned or 
the service or trackage rights discontinued, (ii) Department of Defense 
(Military Traffic Management Command, Transportation Engineering Agency, 
Railroads for National Defense Program), (iii) the National Park 
Service, Recreation Resources Assistance Division, (iv) the National 
Park Service, Land Resources Division, and (v) the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture,

[[Page 333]]

Chief of the Forest Service. The notice shall name the railroad, 
describe the line involved, indicate the exemption procedure is being 
used, and include the approximate date that the notice of exemption will 
be filed with the Commission. The notice shall include the following 
statement: ``Based on information in our possession, the line (does) 
(does not) contain federally granted rights-of-way. Any documentation in 
the railroad's possession will be made available promptly to those 
requesting it.''
    (2) The railroad must file a verified notice using its appropriate 
abandonment docket number and subnumber (followed by the letter ``X'') 
with the Commission at least 50 days before the abandonment or 
discontinuance is to be consummated. The notice shall include the 
proposed consummation date, the certification required in 
Sec. 1152.50(b), the information required in Sec. 1152.22(a)(1) through 
(5) and (8), and (e)(5), the level of labor protection, and a 
certificate that the notice requirements of Secs. 1152.50(d)(1) and 
1105.11 have been complied with.
    (3) The Commission, through the Director of the Office of 
Proceedings, shall publish a notice in the Federal Register within 20 
days after the filing of the notice of exemption. Petitions to stay the 
effective date of the notice on other than environmental or historic 
preservation grounds must be filed within 10 days of the publication. 
Petitions to stay the effective date of the notice on environmental or 
historic preservation grounds may be filed at any time but must be filed 
sufficiently in advance of the effective date in order to allow the 
Commission to consider and act on the petition before the notice becomes 
effective. Petitions for reconsideration, comments regarding 
environmental, energy and historic preservation matters, and requests 
for public use conditions under 49 U.S.C. 10906 and 49 CFR 1152.28(a)(2) 
must be filed within 20 days after publication. The exemption will be 
effective 30 days after publication, unless stayed. If the notice of 
exemption contains false or misleading information, the use of the 
exemption is void ab initio and the Commission shall summarily reject 
the exemption notice.
    (4) In out-of-service rail line exemption proceedings under 49 CFR 
1152.50, the Commission, on its own motion, will stay the effective date 
of individual notices of exemption when an informed decision on pending 
environmental and historic preservation issues cannot be made prior to 
the date that the exemption authority would otherwise become effective.
    (5) A request to implement interim trail use and rail banking under 
16 U.S.C. 1247(d) and 49 CFR 1152.29 should be filed with the Commission 
and served on the railroad within 10 days of publication of the notice 
of exemption in the Federal Register. A notice or decision to all 
parties will be issued if use of the exemption is made subject to 
environmental, energy, historic preservation, public use and/or interim 
trail use and rail banking conditions.
    (6) To address whether the standard labor protective conditions set 
forth in Oregon Short Line R. Co.--Abandonment--Goshen, 360 I.C.C. 91 
(1979), adequately protect affected employees, a petition for partial 
revocation of the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed.
    (e) Abandonment petitions for exemption. Whenever a petitioner 
intends to seek abandonment authority through a petition for exemption, 
a copy of the petition shall be served upon the persons receiving 
notices of exemption under Sec. 1152.50(d). The petition must include 
the following statement: ``Based on information in our possession, the 
line (does) (does not) contain federally granted right-of-way. Any 
documentation in petitioner's possession will be made available promptly 
to those requesting it.''

Sec. 1155.1  Purpose of the standards.

    (a) The 3R Act established a method of preserving rail service that 
would otherwise be discontinued as a result of the restructuring process 
developed by the final system plan. Section 304(c)(2) of the 3R Act, as 
amended, provides that no rail service or properties may be discontinued 
or abandoned if a financially responsible person or government entity 
offers a subsidy which: (1) Covers the difference between the carrier's 
revenues attributable to such rail properties and the carrier's 
avoidable costs of providing rail service on such properties, together 
with a reasonable management fee, and (2) includes a reasonable return 
on the value of such properties. Further, the person offering the 
subsidy shall designate the operator of the continued rail service.
    (b) RSPO was directed to develop and publish standards to determine 
``revenues attributable to the rail properties,'' the ``avoidable costs 
of providing service,'' a ``reasonable return on the value,'' and a 
``reasonable management fee'' as those phrases are used in section 304 
of the 3R Act as amended. These standards (49 CFR part 1155), developed 
by RSPO and referred to as the ``Regional Subsidy Standards,'' are 
applicable only for subsidized freight operations over those rail 
properties of the railroads in reorganization which were not conveyed to 
ConRail. (Methods governing the calculation of subsidies for rail 
properties of other railroads as well as those properties conveyed to 
ConRail are covered by a separate set of standards (49 CFR part 1152) 
and are referred to as the ``National Subsidy Standards.'')
    (c) These standards intend that parties to a subsidy agreement 
utilize arms-length negotiation to the fullest extent possible in 
establishing and executing a subsidy operating agreement. The standards 
presented here develop the methodologies for:
    (1) Calculating a subsidy estimate to be used as a basis for a 
subsidy offer under section 304(c)(2) of the 3R Act, as amended,
    (2) Determining the actual revenues and costs of a subsidized 
operation during the subsidy year, and
    (3) Establishing a return on the value of the properties used in 
continuing the rail service.

Parties may agree in arms-length negotiations to provisions which modify 
these standards, subject to review of such modifications by RSPO. RSPO 
would not expect to disapprove variations from the standards which are 
the product of arms-length negotiations and which are shown to be 
reasonable in the light of pertinent facts and circumstances. When an 
agreement has been reached, a copy shall be filed promptly with RSPO for 
its review.
    (d) In brief, the standards describe the method for establishing a 
subsidy estimate, the basis for paying this estimate during the subsidy 
year, the method of calculating the actual subsidy during the subsidy 
period, and the provisions for adjusting for the difference between the 
estimated subsidy and the actual subsidy at the end of the subsidy 
period.
    (e) For further information regarding these standards, persons may 
contact RSPO's Cost Evaluation Branch at 202-254-7552.

    4R Act means the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act 
of 1976, Pub. L. 94-210 (90 Stat. 31).
    Base year means, for initial subsidy estimates, the year employed by 
the U.S. Railway Association in developing the final system plan (1973). 
For subsequent subsidy estimates, the base year is the year immediately 
preceding the year for which the subsidy estimate is being calculated.
    Branch means a segment of a railroad that is not designated to be in 
the final system plan under the 3R Act, and that is the subject of a 
notice in writing of intent to discontinue service under section 304(a) 
of the 3R Act.
    Form R-1 means a class I railroad's annual report filed with the ICC 
in accordance with the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11145.
    Form R-2 means a class II railroad's annual report filed with the 
ICC in accordance with the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11145.
    FRA means the Federal Railroad Administration, U.S. Department of 
Transportation.
    GMA means General Managers Association of Chicago.
    ICC means the Interstate Commerce Commission.
    Just and Reasonable Charge means that a charge to an account shall 
not exceed an amount necessary to the honest and efficient operation and 
management of carrier business.

States, a local or regional transportation authority, or any responsible 
person offering a rail service continuation subsidy under section 
304(c)(2)(A) of the 3R Act.
    Rail Form A means the ICC's formula for use in determining rail 
freight service costs, statement 1F1-73.
    Railroad means a railroad company, or the trustee or trustees of a 
railroad company, that gives a notice in writing of intent to 
discontinue service under section 304(a) of the 3R act, and, as the 
context requires, ``railroad'' may mean either the owner of rail 
properties over which subsidized service is or may be performed, or the 
operator of that service, or both.
    RSPO means the Rail Services Planning Office established by section 
205 of the 3R Act.

means that all accounts containing the remaining four digits are to be 
used in the procedure being described. Example: ``11-21-XX'' refers to 
all salary and wage accounts for locomotives because ``11'' designates 
salaries and wages and ``21'' designates locomotives. Thus, ``11-21-XX'' 
includes all of the following accounts: 11-21-01, 11-21-40, 11-21-48, 
11-21-39, and 11-21-99. Similarly, ``XX-31-67'' means all accounts

<R05>
Sec. 1155.3  Procedure for calculating a subsidy estimate.

    (a) Discontinuance notice and subsidy offer procedures--(1) Notice 
of discontinuance. A railroad giving notice of intent to discontinue 
service on a branch shall provide an ``Estimate of Subsidy Payment'' and 
shall distribute copies of this estimate to the Director of RSPO, the 
Governor and railroad regulatory commission of each State within which 
the branch is located, and any other person upon request. The format of 
the ``Estimate of Subsidy Payment'' is prescribed in appendix I. The 
subsidy estimate shall be the difference between the revenues 
attributable to the rail properties and the avoidable costs of providing 
service on such rail properties, together with a reasonable management 
fee, plus a reasonable return on the value of the properties. Beginning 
with the week in which it gives notice of intent to discontinue service 
on the branch, pursuant to section 304(a)(1)(B) of the 3R Act, the 
railroad shall publish a copy of that notice of

[[Page 339]]

intent in a newspaper or newspapers of general circulation in the area 
encompassing the branch at least once a week for three consecutive 
weeks. Each railroad shall include in the required notices a statement 
of the address of the railroad's office within the State or States where 
interested persons may examine, during regular working hours, the 
materials and information upon which the subsidy estimate calculations 
were made. If the railroad so requests, examination of documents which 
disclose information concerning the nature, kind, quantity, destination, 
consignee, or routing of traffic may be restricted to the representative 
of the person offering a subsidy and then only if that representative 
agrees to keep that information confidential. A notice of intent to 
discontinue service, according to section 304(a)(1)(B) of the 3R Act, is 
not considered complete or given until the railroad has fulfilled these 
requirements.
    (2) Subsidy offer. Persons wishing to subsidize rail service 
proposed for discontinuance shall:
    (i) Communicate in writing with the railroad selected as the 
designated operator for the continuation of such service, offering to 
pay such operator the estimated subsidy amount, and
    (ii) Communicate in writing with the trustee(s) or owner(s) of the 
railroad which owns the branch line, offering to pay a reasonable return 
on the value of the properties.

Upon the offer of a subsidy from a financially responsible person, 
discontinuance of the rail service or abandonment of the rail properties 
for which the subsidy is being offered is prohibited, pursuant to 
section 304(c)(2)(A) of the 3R Act. The parties are free to negotiate 
operating levels and reasonable variations from the standards, but when 
impasse occurs in the negotiations, the standards established here can 
be invoked.

Because USRA was not required to utilize the standards promulgated by 
RSPO as criteria for inclusion of branch lines in the final system plan, 
it is possible that a branch line could be excluded from the final 
system plan and yet generate revenues which exceed the costs as 
calculated under these standards. Therefore, RSPO has established the 
amount that a potential subsidizer must offer under section 304(c)(2)(A) 
as the amount computed by the subsidy estimate formula or $1.00, 
whichever is the greater.
    (3) Use of prior subsidy standards. Even though these standards 
become effective January 1, 1978, parties to existing subsidy agreements 
may agree to continue to use the standards in effect prior to January 1, 
1978, for the remainder of the current subsidy year.
    (4) Basis of estimated subsidy. The estimated subsidy for the 
subsidy year immediately following conveyance in the reorganization 
process (ConRail start-up date) shall be calculated according to an 
interim formula based on data from 1973, which was the base year 
employed by USRA in developing the final system plan. This interim 
formula, using 1973 data, is to be employed only for the calculation of 
initial subsidy agreements; once a subsidy agreement is in place, 
subsequent years' estimates shall be based on data drawn from the 
preceding subsidy year. Estimates for revenues, on-branch avoidable 
costs, off-branch costs, a reasonable management fee, and a return on 
value shall be calculated according to the procedures in Secs. 1155.3(b) 
through 1155.3(f) inclusive. The subsidy estimate procedure relies in 
many instances on the same formulas that are used to calculate the 
actual subsidy amount; the basic difference between the estimated and 
actual subsidy calculations is that the actual subsidy amount is 
calculated using data reflecting the experience of the subsidy year, 
while the estimate is based on anticipated operational results.
    (b) Estimated revenues. Using base year data, estimated revenues 
shall include all sources of revenue and income prescribed as revenues 
and income attributable to the rail properties in the calculation of the 
actual subsidy, see Sec. 1155.6.
    (c) Estimated on-branch costs. On-branch cost estimates shall be 
separated and calculated as follows:
    (1) Routine maintenance of way and structures. These expenses shall 
be estimated at $1,000 per year per mile of track on the branch for 
which the railroad is responsible for maintenance,

[[Page 340]]

unless the parties agree to a higher level.
    (2) Rehabilitation. Rehabilitation costs shall not be included 
unless: (i) The track involved does not meet minimum FRA class I safety 
standards (49 CFR part 213), in which case, the railroad shall furnish a 
detailed estimate of the costs to rehabilitate the track to FRA class I 
level with the notice of intent and provision to cover such costs shall 
be included in the subsidy agreements; or (ii) The potential subsidizer 
requests a level of service which requires expenditures for 
rehabilitation and makes such a request within 10 days after the date of 
notice of intent is filed, in which case the railroad shall furnish an 
estimate of the costs involved within 20 days after the date of that 
request. All such requests and estimates shall refer to specific 
projects for rehabilitation.
    (3) Maintenance of equipment excluding freight cars.  Estimates for 
maintenance of equipment shall be developed by applying base year data 
to the formula for calculating the actual maintenance of equipment 
expense, see Sec. 1155.7(b). Unless the parties agree to a different 
base, the resulting average unit costs shall be applied to the branch 
base year service units to arrive at the estimate.
    (4) Transportation. Transportation costs shall be estimated based on 
system average costs. The number of trips per year shall be based on the 
frequency of service performed at the time the notice is filed unless 
the parties agree to a different level. Labor costs for train crews 
shall be based on system average costs for each type of crew applied to 
the hours of service on the branch. The crew costs shall be classified 
into three major categories: Yard, local/way, and through. The straight 
time average costs per hour for each yard, local/way, or through train 
crew member shall be calculated for class I railroads by using the 
railroad's Employees, Service, and Compensation Report (Form B) for the 
base year. The calculation is made by adding together the straight time 
compensation and the constructive allowances, and dividing this total by 
the straight time hours actually worked. This process would be repeated 
for each yard, local/way, and through train class of employee. For class 
II railroads, the straight time average cost per hour for each yard, 
local/way, or through train crew member shall be calculated in the same 
manner, using the railroad's payroll records for the base year. After 
the hourly rate is determined for each member, the cost per crew hour 
shall be calculated based on the exact size and consist of the crew 
currently serving the branch. The crew cost per hour is multiplied by 
the estimated hours that will be incurred in serving the branch during 
the subsidy period. The estimated direct crew costs must be increased to 
cover fringe benefits using the procedure specified in Sec. 1155.7(c). 
The railroad shall also furnish estimates of costs for the remaining 
transportation accounts using Sec. 1155.7(c) as a guide to their 
inclusion and basis of calculation.
    (5) General administrative expenses. In exceptional circumstances, 
the railroad may be allowed to include general administrative expenses. 
Such expenses are allowable only if the size of the railroad's operation 
(measured in total mileage, gross revenues, gross ton-miles, or car-
miles) is increased by more than 25 percent as a result of operating the 
subsidized service, or the individual line being operated under a 
subsidy agreement generates $10 million or more in gross revenues per 
annum. If the railroad foresees this increase, then estimates may be 
calculated for the accounts included under general administrative costs 
in Sec. 1155.7(d).
    (6) Deadheading, taxi, and hotel costs. Estimates for these costs 
shall be determined from base year data reflecting deadheading, taxi, 
and hotel costs incurred as a result of providing service to the branch 
line. The amounts under this section shall not be included under the 
wage accounts for yard conductors and brakemen, yard enginemen, or 
trainmen.
    (7) Overhead movement costs. Estimates for these costs shall be 
determined from base year data reflecting overhead movement costs 
incurred as a result of providing service to the branch. The amounts 
shown shall be limited to transportation, equipment, and freight cars. 
The amounts shown under this section shall not be included

[[Page 341]]

under other sections of these standards.
    (8) Freight car costs. Freight cars costs shall be estimated by a 
method consistent with the detailed procedures specified in 
Sec. 1155.7(g).
    (9) Taxes. Estimates for property taxes shall be based on the base 
year actual tax assessment, adjusted for tax rate changes; revenue taxes 
shall be based on the estimated revenue level.
    (10) Administrative fee. The estimated administrative fee shall be 
one percent of the revenues estimated under Sec. 1155.3(b).
    (11) Casualty reserve account. Estimates for this item shall be any 
payments mutually agreed to by the person offering the subsidy and the 
railroad for the purpose of holding the subsidizer harmless from any 
liability. Such cost may include a reasonable fee to cover the cost of 
administering the fund.
    (12) Termination costs. Estimates for these costs shall be 
determined according to a projection of costs reasonably and necessarily 
incurred should service to the subsidized branch be terminated. These 
costs shall not include any costs which the railroad would have incurred 
had the branch not been operated under the subsidy program. The 15 
percent ceiling discussed in Sec. 1155.5 is not applicable to these 
costs unless they are included in the estimated subsidy amount.
    (d) Estimated off-branch costs. A ratio of off-branch costs to 
revenues for the base year shall be used to derive the estimate of off-
branch costs for the subsidy year. Base year off-branch costs shall be 
calculated using the procedure established in Sec. 1155.7(n). If data 
identifying actual carloads by car type are not available, car type 
shall be based upon the railroad's best estimate. The resulting ratio of 
base year off-branch costs to revenues shall then be applied to the 
revenues estimated under Sec. 1155.3(b) to develop the estimated off-
branch costs for the subsidy year.
    (e) Estimated management fee. The estimated management fee shall be 
four and one-half percent of the revenues estimated under 
Sec. 1155.3(b). If the railroad and the person offering the subsidy 
agree to an additional fee designed as an incentive to maximize 
revenues, minimize expenses, promote efficient service, or otherwise 
achieve public interest objectives, the railroad shall be paid such fee 
as determined in accordance with an agreement to that effect.
    (f) Estimated return on value. The railroad shall appraise the value 
of the property using the procedures described in Sec. 1155.9(a). If the 
value is challenged, an appraisal of the property by a qualified and 
certified appraiser(s) shall be offered by the potential subsidizer. If 
the parties cannot agree on a valuation through negotiation, an average 
of the two appraisals shall be used as the estimated valuation. The rate 
of return to be applied to the value of the properties shall be 
determined in accordance with Sec. 1155.9(b).


<R05>
Sec. 1155.4  Interim payments, financial reports, and interpretations.

    (a) Interim Subsidy Payments. The person offering a subsidy shall 
offer to pay, in return for the continuation of rail service, an amount 
computed on the basis of the interim formula described in Sec. 1155.3. 
The interim payment may be adjusted, by agreement of the parties, to 
take into account factors, such as rate increases and changes in traffic 
levels, which would make the sole use of base year data an inappropriate 
means of estimating the payment for the subsidy year or to conform to 
amendments to these standards made subsequent to the original agreement. 
Interest shall be applied to any deferred payment, calculated at the 
same rate as the rate of return on value specified in Sec. 1155.9(b), 
for the period of time such payment is outstanding. The amount estimated 
for the management fee and for the difference between the revenues 
attributable and the avoidable costs shall be paid to the railroad 
operating the branch line. The amount estimated for the return on value 
shall be paid directly to the trustee(s) or owner(s) of the property, 
unless the parties agree that such payment shall be made by the railroad 
in behalf of the subsidizer.
    (b) Financial Status Reports. The railroad must establish a system 
for collecting costs and other required data at the branch level, and 
must, within

[[Page 342]]

thirty days after the end of each quarter of the subsidy year, file with 
the person offering the subsidy a ``Financial Status Report'' which 
shall include the information prescribed in the method for calculating 
the actual subsidy as specified in Secs. 1155.6, 1155.7, and 1155.9. The 
format of the ``Financial Status Report'' is prescribed in Appendix II. 
Significant deviations from the original estimates must be explained. In 
all reports, the actual data reflecting the year to date shall show a 
projection to the end of the subsidy year for each item, except that 
off-branch costs shall be estimated during the subsidy year by applying 
the ratio developed in accordance with Sec. 1155.3(d) to the revenues.

Unless the parties agree otherwise, the last Financial Status Report 
filed during the first ten months of the subsidy year shall be the basis 
for developing the estimated subsidy payment for the subsequent year's 
agreement. The Financial Status Reports should be considered detailed 
progress reports monitoring the actual costs and revenues involved for 
operating rail service on the branch throughout the subsidy year; the 
Financial Status Reports are not to be considered as ``progress 
billings'' for subsidy services performed.
    (c) Interpretations of the Standards. Parties desiring an 
interpretation of the standards should file a written petition with OTA 
citing the section involved and setting forth their position and 
rationale. If the request arises from a dispute with other parties, the 
petitioner shall identify those parties and serve each of them with a 
copy of the petition. Parties desiring to file a reply must do so within 
10 days of their receipt of the petition. OTA will issue an 
interpretation, unless it concludes that the matter raised requires 
amendment of the standards, in which case OTA will institute a 
rulemaking proceeding. The address of OTA is:

Sec. 1155.5  Year-end adjustment.

    (a) On the basis of the railroad's year-end Final Status Report and 
the net impact of inflation developed in Secs. 1155.7(n)(5) and 
1155.8(e), the subsidy payment shall be adjusted to reconcile any 
differences between the subsidy payments actually made based on the 
estimated subsidy and the actual subsidy calculated from data reflecting 
the actual revenues and costs experienced in the operation of the branch 
during the subsidy year.
    (b) Where an adjustment results in an increase in the estimated 
subsidy payment, the amount of such increase in excess of 15 percent of 
the estimated subsidy shall be treated as a carryover advoidable cost in 
the subsequent subsidy year. This provision shall apply unless:
    (1) The railroad notifies the subsidizer in one of the Financial 
Status Reports issued during the first ten months of the subsidy year 
that the estimate will be exceeded by more than 15 percent, or
    (2) The increase results from an expense approved in advance by the 
person offering the subsidy.
    (c) Should the year-end adjustment reflect an overpayment by the 
person offering the subsidy, the amount of overpayment shall be 
reimbursed by the railroad.

Sec. 1155.6  Revenue and income attributable to branch lines.

    The revenue attributable to the rail properties is the total of the 
revenues assigned to the branch in accordance with this section, plus 
any subsidy payments that would cease upon discontinuance of service on 
the branch, for the subsidy year. The revenues assigned shall be derived 
from the following accounts:
    (a) Account 101-Freight. The revenues assigned under this account 
shall be the actual revenues, including transit revenues, accruing to 
the railroad, derived from waybills and other source documents, for all 
traffic that:
    (1) Originates or terminates on the branch;

[[Page 343]]

    (2) Originates or terminates on the branch and is handled off the 
branch on the system but not on another carrier; and
    (3) Originates or terminates on the branch and is handled on another 
carrier.
    All traffic that is received or forwarded through interchange at a 
point on the branch, including ferry operations, shall be considered as 
originating or terminating on the branch. The revenues of all other 
bridge or overhead traffic shall be attributed to the branch on the 
ratio of miles moved on the branch to miles moved on the system, 
provided, however, that the parties may agree on a mutually acceptable 
usage charge for bridge traffic in lieu of the mileage apportionment.
    (b) Account 104--Switching; Account 105--Water transfers; Account 
106--Demurrage; Account 110--Incidental: Account 121--Joint Facility-
Credit; Account 122--Joint Facility-Debit; Account 506--Revenues from 
Properties Used in Other Than Carrier Operations; Account 510--
Miscellaneous Rent Income; Account 519--Miscellaneous Income. The 
revenues assigned under these accounts shall be the actual revenues 
accruing to the railroad that are directly attributable to the branch.

Sec. 1155.7  Calculation of avoidable costs and management fee.

    (a) This section defines:
    (1) Which cost elements are eligible for inclusion in the 
calculation of avoidable costs;
    (2) The conditions under which certain cost elements become eligible 
for inclusion; and
    (3) The basis of apportioning those cost elements which are not 
assigned to the branch on an actual expense basis.
    (b) The avoidable costs of providing freight service on a branch 
shall be the total of the just and reasonable charges assigned to the 
branch in accordance with this section. Those expenses apportioned under 
this section shall be derived from the latest Form R-1 or R-2 or R-3 of 
the railroad filed with the ICC prior to the conclusion of the subsidy 
year, and assigned to the branch according to the procedures set forth 
in Sec. 1155.8 of these regulations.
    (c) When the term ``actual'' is specified as the basis for assigning 
an expense, it shall mean that the only costs which can be assigned to 
the account are those costs which are incurred solely as a result of the 
continuation of rail freight service on the branch.
    (d) The accounts in the following charts, which list only the 
``freight-only'' account numbers, shall include the portion of common 
expenses that have been apportioned to freight service.

    (e) Deadheading, taxi, and hotel costs. The costs assigned under 
this subsection shall be the actual costs incurred as a result of 
providing service to the branch line for deadheading, taxi, and hotel 
costs. The amounts included under this subsection shall not be included 
under other subsections of these regulations.
    (f) Overhead movement costs. The costs assigned under this 
subsection shall be the actual costs incurred in moving overhead in 
order to provide service to the branch. The amounts shown under this 
subsection shall not be included under other subsections of these 
regulations.
    (g) Freight car costs. For Class I railroads, the on-branch costs 
for time-mileage freight cars shall be calculated on the basis of the 
railroad's average costs per day and per mile. The costs per day and per 
mile shall be calculated separately for each type of car specified in Ex 
Parte 334 (Car Service Compensation--Basic Per Diem Charges--Formula 
Revision In Accordance with the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory 
Reform Act of 1976). These costs shall include: Account 11-22-42--
Salaries and wages--freight cars--repairs and maintenance; Account 21-
22-42--Materials--freight cars--repairs and maintenance; Account 39-22-
42--Repairs billed by others (Debit)--freight cars--repairs and 
maintenance; Account 40-22-42--Repairs billed to others (Credit)--
freight cars--repairs and maintenance; Account 41-22-42--Other purchased 
services--freight cars--repairs and maintenance; Account 61-22-42--Other 
expenses--freight cars--repairs and maintenance; Account 31-22-00--Lease 
rentals (Debit) freight cars; Account 32-22-00--Lease Rentals (Credit)--
freight cars; Account 35-22-00--Other rents (Debit)--freight cars; 
Account 36-22-00--Other rents (Credit--freight cars; and Account 62-22-
00--Depreciation--freight cars; and the return on investment in freight 
cars. The system total of the repair and maintenance accounts, all 
accounts designated XX-XX-42, and depreciation shall be divided into 
time related costs and mileage related costs on the basis of the present 
Rail Form A apportionment factors (i.e., 50 percent time and 50 percent 
mileage for repairs, and 60 percent time and 40 percent mileage for 
depreciation). Return on investment shall be treated as a 100 percent 
time-related cost. The system total receipts and payments for the hire 
of time mileage cars and the basic data used in the development of the 
car-day and car-mile factors shall be taken from the railroad's latest 
Form R-1 and company records. The specific steps to complete the 
calculations are as follows:
    (1) The total system car days by car type shall be calculated by 
averaging the railroad's freight car ownership at the beginning and 
ending of the year (R-1, schedule 710, columns (b) and (k)), multiplying 
the average by the standard active number of car days (346) as developed 
in ICC Docket Number 31358; subtracting car days on foreign lines 
(source: Company records) and adding the foreign car days on home line 
(source: Company records). This procedure shall be completed for each 
car type specified in Ex Parte 334.
    (2) The total railroad car miles shall be calculated by adding the 
loaded car miles for railroad owned and leased cars (Form OSA, column 
(d), items 5-010 through 5-027), to the empty car miles for railroad 
owned and leased

[[Page 357]]

cars (Form OSA, column (d), items 5-110 through 5-127). The total car 
miles, loaded and empty shall be calculated for each car type specified 
in Ex Parte 334.
    (3) The cost per car-day shall be calculated for each type of time-
mileage car by adding 50 percent of the total freight car repair costs 
for each car type (R-1, schedule 415, column (b)); 60 percent of the 
depreciation costs for each car type (R-1, schedule 415, column (c)); 
100 percent of return on investment, which is calculated by obtaining 
the net depreciated investment for each car type and multiplying it by 
the cost of capital ratio developed for use in Form 2 of the unrevised 
Rail Form A of the railroad; the time portion of the railroad's payments 
for hire of time-mileage freight cars (R-1, schedule 366, columns (h) 
and (i)); subtracting the time portion of the railroad's receipts for 
hire of time-mileage freight cars (R-1, schedule 366, columns (d) and 
(e)); and dividing the result by the total car days for each car type 
developed in paragraph (1).
    (4) The cost per mile shall be calculated for each type of time-
mileage car by adding 50 percent of the total freight train car repair 
cost for each car type (R-1, schedule 415, column (b)); 40 percent of 
the total depreciation costs for each car type (R-1, schedule 415, 
column (c)); the mileage portion of the railroad's payments for the hire 
of time-mileage freight cars (R-1, schedule 366, column (g)); 
subtracting the mileage portion of the railroad's receipts for hire of 
time-mileage of freight cars (R-1, schedule 366, column (c)); and 
dividing the result by the total car miles for each car type developed 
in paragraph (2).
    (5) The costs per car-day and per car-mile developed in paragraphs 
(3) and (4) of this section shall be applied to the total car-days and 
total car miles for each car type accumulated on the branch for all 
traffic originated and/or terminated on the branch and all bridge 
traffic handled by the branch during the subsidy period which are 
attributed to time-mileage freight-train cars. The car-day and car-mile 
factors shall be furnished by the railroads.
    (6) The on-branch costs for freight cars rented on a straight 
mileage basis shall be the railroad's total payments for mileage cars 
(R-1, schedule 366, column (f)), for each car type; divided by the total 
miles on which the charges were based.
    (7) For Class II railroads, the on-branch costs for time-mileage and 
straight mileage freight cars shall be calculated in the same manner 
prescribed for Class I railroads, using the latest data available.
    (h) Revenue taxes. The amount of revenue taxes shall be computed 
based on the amounts directly paid in those States that subject the 
railroad to a revenue tax.
    (i) Property taxes. (1) The amount of property taxes shall be the 
amount levied against the property on the branch, in those States where 
a true ad valorem tax is levied, based on the value of certain kinds of 
railroad property, such as track, land, buildings, and other facilities.
    (2) In States where property taxes are assessed on the basis of a 
formula of a statewide valuation of property and the branch or branches 
are included in the valuation of the railroad operating the service, the 
tax on each branch shall be based on the distribution of the assessment 
by the State to that branch and the application of the appropriate tax 
rate or rates.
    (3) In States where the real property taxes are assessed and levied 
against the owner of the property but the rolling stock is assessed to 
the railroad operating the service on the basis of a formula of a 
statewide valuation of property, the tax on rolling stock attributable 
to each branch shall be determined as follows:
    (i) Find the percent which the cost of equipment as used in the 
formula is to the total of all property cost as used in the formula;
    (ii) Apply that percentage to the total State assessment to 
determine the portion of the assessment attributable to rolling stock;
    (iii) Allocate the rolling stock assessment thus determined to each 
branch on the basis of car and locomotive unit miles on the branch to 
total car and locomotive unit miles in the State;
    (iv) Apply appropriate tax rate or rates to the allocated assessment 
thus determined.

    (j) Administrative fee. A carrier shall be entitled to receive an 
administrative fee only if the carrier is not entitled to include 
General Administrative Expenses, Sec. 1155.7(d), as an avoidable cost. 
The administrative fee shall be calculated as one percent of the total 
revenues attributed to the branch under Sec. 1155.6 and shall be allowed 
as an avoidable cost to the railroad to cover all costs of administering 
the subsidy program.
    (k) Deferred subsidy payment. If the subsidy estimate or adjustment 
is paid in deferred payments, the railroad shall be compensated for the 
use of its working capital by applying the interest rate established in 
Sec. 1155.9(b) to the deferred payment for the period of time such 
payment is outstanding.
    (l) Casualty reserve account. The costs assigned under this account 
shall be any payment mutually agreed to by the person offering the 
subsidy and the railroad for the purpose of holding the subsidizer 
harmless from any liability under those accounts that are used to record 
any costs incurred by the railroad as a result of personal injury or 
property damage.
    (m) Termination Costs. The costs assigned under this subsection 
shall be the actual costs reasonably and necessarily incurred as a 
result of terminating service to the subsidized branch. These costs 
shall not include any costs which the railroad would have incurred had 
the branch not been operated under the subsidy program. The 15 percent 
ceiling contained in Sec. 1155.5 is not applicable to those costs unless 
such costs were included in the estimated subsidy payment.
    (n) Off-Branch Costs. Until the ICC revises the Rail Form A cost 
procedure to facilitate the incorporation of the new USOA as well as 
review and if necessary change the theories contained within the present 
formula the procedure for determining the off-branch costs will use the 
existing Rail Form A formula applied to the latest Annual Report, Form 
R-1, that has been filed by the railroad using the prior unrevised 
accounting system. The development of the off-branch costs shall be as 
follows:
    (1) Terminal costs, line-haul car costs, and interchange costs shall 
be considered as the off-branch avoidable costs of providing service 
over the remainder of the railroad's system. These costs shall be 
computed by applying variable unit costs to the service units attributed 
to the branch traffic during the subsidy period.
    (2) The following through-train, single-line, variable unit costs 
shall be developed by a Class I railroad by applying Rail Form A to data 
contained in its latest Form R-1 filed with the Commission:
    (i) Normal Rail Form A carload terminal cost per carload by car 
type.
    (ii) Modified Rail Form A carload terminal cost per carload by car 
type (i.e., (a) substitute an intertrain switching cost separated 
between mileage and other than mileage cars, in place of a roadtrain to 
industry switching cost; (b) substitute modified car ownership costs per 
car-day for two days developed in accordance with Sec. 1155.7(g), above, 
for the standard Rail Form A car ownership cost).
    (iii) Rail Form A per hundredweight terminal cost.
    (iv) Rail Form A cost per car-mile by car type.
    (v) Rail Form A cost per ton-mile.
    (vi) Rail Form A cost per car interchanged, separated between 
mileage and other than mileage cars.

These costs shall be applied by Class I railroads in accordance with the 
procedure set forth below in Sec. 1155.7(n)(3).
    (3) Calculations by car type: (i) The sum of all terminal costs 
incurred off the branch line shall be calculated by multiplying the 
modified terminal cost per carload by car type, paragraph (n)(2)(ii) 
above, by the total number of carloads originated or terminated on the 
branch line during the subsidy year. To this amount add the normal 
terminal cost per carload by car type, paragraph (n)(2)(i) above, times 
the number of carloads which originated or terminated on the branch that 
are local to the railroad serving the branch.
    (ii) The sum of the hundredweight terminal costs incurred off the 
branch line shall be calculated by multiplying the hundredweight of 
freight originated or terminated on the branch that are local to the 
railroad serving the branch.

[[Page 359]]

    (iii) The sum of the line-haul car-mile costs incurred off the 
branch line shall be calculated by multiplying the car-mile cost by car 
type, paragraph (n)(2)(iv) above, by the loaded car-miles generated off 
the branch line by cars originated or terminated on the branch during 
the subsidy year. Where overhead movements to and from the branch have 
been included in the on-branch cost calculation under other sections of 
Sec. 1155.7, the related loaded car-miles shall be excluded from this 
calculation.
    (iv) The sum of the line-haul ton-mile costs shall be determined by 
multiplying the ton-mile cost, paragraph (n)(2)(v) above, by the total 
ton-miles of revenue freight incurred by the railroad on its lines, 
other than the branch lines, for revenue freight originated or 
terminated on the branch during the subsidy year.
    (v) The interchange cost shall be calculated by multiplying the cost 
per car interchanged, paragraph (n)(2)(vi) above, by the number of 
carloads of traffic interchanged at a point off the branch line and 
originated or terminated on the branch.
    (4) Class II and Class III line-haul railroads shall calculate off-
branch costs as follows (based on: The carrier's latest Form R-2 or R-3 
filed with the ICC; the ICC's latest Rail Carload Cost Scales; and the 
carrier's own records):
    (i) A carrier that has only freight operations shall calculate the 
estimated system variable expenses by multiplying the total operating 
expenses by .78, the three-year composite variability ratio for all 
Class I railroads. If a carrier has passenger and freight service, the 
freight portion of the total estimated system variable expenses shall be 
calculated by multiplying the total estimated system variable expenses, 
calculated as above, by the ratio of freight related operating expenses 
to total railway operating expenses [freight related operating expenses 
divided by total railway operating expenses].
    (ii) The total number of revenue carload terminal handlings shall be 
determined from company records [originating and terminating (local) 
revenue carloads multiplied by 2, plus originating or terminating and 
interchange (interline) revenue carloads].
    (iii) The total number of revenue carload interchange handlings 
shall be determined from company records [bridge (interchange to 
interchange) revenue carloads multiplied by 2, plus revenue carloads 
that are originated or terminated and interchanged (interline)].
    (iv) The average load per car shall be determined from company 
records [ton-miles-revenue freight, divided by loaded freight car-
miles].
    (v) The ratios employed to separate the estimated system variable 
expenses between interchange, terminal and line-haul operations are 
calculated as follows:
    (A) Theoretical interchange expenses are calculated by multiplying 
the number of revenue carload interchange handlings, paragraph 
(n)(4)(iii) of this section, by the interchange variable cost per 
carload for other than box, unequipped, refrigerator, tank and TOFC cars 
(ICC Rail Carload Cost Scales, Table 12, Line 6 or 14, appropriate 
region, multiplied by 100).
    (B) Theoretical terminal carload expenses are calculated by 
multiplying the number of revenue carload terminal handlings, paragraph 
(n)(4)(ii) of this section, by the average train variable terminal cost 
per carload for box-general service, equipped (one half of the terminal 
cost per carload ICC Rail Carload Scales, Table 3, appropriate region, 
line 2, col. (6)).
    (C) Theoretical terminal lading expenses are calculated by 
multiplying the total terminal tons [terminal carload handlings, 
paragraph (n)(4)(ii) of this section, multiplied by average load per 
car, paragraph (n)(4)(iv) of this section] by the average train variable 
terminal cost per ton for box-general service, equipped [one half of the 
terminal cwt. cost, ICC Rail Carload Cost Scales, Table 3, appropriate 
region, line 2 col. (7), multiplied by 20].
    (D) Theoretical line-haul car expenses are calculated by multiplying 
the carrier's loaded car-miles by the average train variable cost per 
car-mile excluding interchange, for box-general service, equipped [ICC 
Rail Carload Cost Scales, Table 3, appropriate region, Line 2, col. (4) 
minus Appendix B, appropriate region, Line 2, col. (4)].

[[Page 360]]

multiplying the carrier's total ton-miles of revenue freight by the 
average train variable ton-mile cost for a box-general service, equipped 
[wt-mile cost ICC Rail Carload Cost Scales, Table 3, appropriate region, 
Line 2, col. (5), multiplied by 20].
    (F) Theoretical station clerical expenses are calculated by 
multiplying total revenue carload terminal handlings, paragraph 
(n)(4)(ii) of this section, by the variable station clerical cost per 
carload [one half of the station clerical cost per carload, ICC Rail 
Carload Cost Scales, Table 18, appropriate region, Line (2) multiplied 
by 100].
    (G) Total theoretical system variable expenses are calculated by 
adding paragraph (n)(4)(v)(A) plus (n)(4)(v)(B) plus (n)(4)(v)(C) plus 
(n)(4)(v)(D) plus (n)(4)(v)(E) of this section.
    (H) The ratio for interchange variable expenses is calculated by 
dividing total theoretical interchange variable expenses, paragraph 
(n)(4)(v)(A) of this section, by the total theoretical system variable 
expenses, paragraph (n)(4)(v)(G) of this section.

dividing the total theoretical terminal variable expenses, paragraph 
(n)(4)(v)(B) plus (n)(4)(v)(C) of this section, by the total theoretical 
system variable expenses, paragraph (n)(4)(v)(G) of this section.
    (J) The ratio for line-haul variable expenses is calculated by 
dividing total theoretical line-haul variable expenses, paragraph 
(n)(4)(v)(D) plus (n)(4)(v)(E) of this section, divided by the total 
theoretical system variable expenses, paragraph (n)(4)(v)(G) of this 
section.

Sec. 1155.8  Apportionment rules for the assignment of expenses to on-branch costs.

    The accounts specified under Sec. 1155.7(a), (b), (c), and (d) as 
having an assignment basis other than ``Actual'' shall be apportioned 
according to the rules contained in this section.
    (a) Maintenance of way and structures--(1) Roadway machines. All 
accounts designated XX-13-36 shall be assigned to the branch on the 
basis of the average repair cost, for each type of machine, included in 
the daily rental fees charged by the operating railroad or as published 
by the General Manager's Association of Chicago (GMA), based on the 
actual number of days each type of machine is used on the branch.
    (2) Small tools and supplies. All accounts designated XX-13-37 shall 
be assigned to the branch as follows: (i) The costs of supplies, 
consumed in the operation of roadway machines, shall be assigned to the 
branch on the basis of the average costs of supplies per day, included 
in the daily rental fees charged by the operating railroad or as 
published by the GMA, multiplied by the actual number of days that the 
machine is used on the branch; (ii) the costs of small tools shall be 
assigned to the branch on the basis of the ratio that the branch amounts 
in Accounts 11-11-10 through 11-11-17 and 11-11-48 plus 11-12-10 through 
11-12-17 and 11-12-48 bear to the railroad's system total for the same 
accounts.
    (3) Fringe benefits. Fringe benefits shall be assigned to the branch 
separated between running, switching and other, on the ratio that the 
total branch salaries and wages bear to the total system salaries and 
wages for each activity as follows:
    (i) Fringe Benefits--Running, Account 12-11-00, total of all 11-11-
XX accounts branch to system;

[[Page 365]]

    (ii) Fringe Benefits--Switching, Account 12-12-00, total of all 11-
12-XX accounts branch to system; and
    (iii) Fringe Benefits--Other, Account 12-13-00, total of all 11-13-
XX accounts branch to system.
    (b) Maintenance of equipment--(1) Locomotive repairs and 
maintenance. All accounts designated XX-21-41 shall be separated between 
yard and road with a further separation between diesel and other 
(electric). The costs for these accounts for yard locomotives shall be 
assigned to the branch separately for diesel and electric locomotives on 
the basis of the ratio of branch diesel and electric yard locomotive 
unit-hours to the total system diesel and electric yard locomotive unit-
hours. The costs for these accounts for road locomotives shall be 
assigned to the branch separately for diesel and electric locomotives on 
the basis of the ratio of branch diesel and electric locomotive gross 
ton-miles in road service to the total system diesel and electric 
locomotive gross ton-miles in road service. The costs assigned under 
these accounts for specialized equipment devoted exclusively to branch 
line service shall be the actual costs for the specific equipment used.
    (2) Locomotive Depreciation--Account 61-22-00, shall be separated 
between yard and road with a further separation between diesel and other 
(electric). The cost shall be assigned to the branch on the ratio of 
locomotive unit hours on the branch to the total locomotive unit hours 
on the system for the particular type of locomotive used to serve the 
branch The cost assigned under this account for specialized equipment 
devoted exclusively to branch line service shall be the actual cost for 
the specific equipment used.
    (3) Fringe benefits. Fringe benefits for locomotives and other 
equipment shall be assigned to the branch on the ratio that the total 
branch salaries and wages bear to the system total salaries and wages 
for each type of equipment as follows:
    (i) Locomotives--Account 12-21-00, total of all 11-21-XX accounts 
branch to system.
    (ii) Other Equipment--Account 12-23-00, total of all 11-23-XX 
accounts branch to system.
    (iii) Fringe benefits for freight cars shall be calculated by first 
estimating the total in Account 11-22-42, Freight car repairs--salaries 
and wages, that is included in the total on branch costs for freight 
cars as determined from the car day and car mile cost calculations, in 
Sec. 1155.77(g) of these regulations.

To this amount is added the branch totals in the balance of all 11-22-XX 
accounts. The ratio of this total branch amount to the system total for 
all 11-22-XX accounts is applied to Account 12-22-00, Fringe Benefits--
Freight Cars.
    (c) Transportation--(1) Train operations--(i) Engine Crews-
Materials, Account 21-31-56; Train Crews-Materials, Account 21-31-57; 
Train Inspection and Lubrication-Salaries and Wages, Account 11-31-62; 
and Train Inspection and Lubrication-Materials, Account 21-31-62. If the 
branch is served by a local/way or through train, the costs in these 
accounts shall be assigned to the branch on the weighted ratio of the 
loaded freight train cars on the branch to the total system loaded 
freight train cars, and the loaded and empty car-miles on the branch to 
the total system loaded and empty car-miles. This shall be calculated as 
follows:
    (A) To determine the car-mile portion of these accounts,
    (1) Multiply the total amounts in these accounts (from the R-1 
Annual Report, Schedule 410) by 69 percent (the ratio of train-mile and 
running expenses from Rail Form A),
    (2) Divide the amount in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A)(1) of this section 
by the total system loaded and empty car-miles, and
    (3) Multiply the car-mile unit cost factor from paragraph 
(c)(1)(i)(A)(2) of this section by the on-branch car-miles (loaded and 
empty).
    (B) To determine the carload portion of these accounts,
    (1) Multiply the total amounts in these accounts by 31 percent (the 
ratio of terminal expenses from Rail Form A),
    (2) Divide the amount in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B)(1) of this section 
by the total system carloads, and
    (3) Multiply the carload unit cost factor from paragraph 
(c)(1)(i)(B)(2) of this section by the onbranch carloads.

[[Page 366]]

    (C) To determine the total costs assignable to the branch for these 
accounts, add the amounts developed in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(A)(3) and 
(c)(1)(i)(B)(3) of this section.
    (ii) Locomotive fuel. All accounts designated XX-31-67 shall be 
assigned to the branch line in accordance with the following procedure. 
The dollar amounts used in the determination of locomotive fuel costs 
shall be based on data contained in the most recent publication issued 
by the General Managers Association (GMA) relating to the rental of 
locomotives. The total number of locomotive unit hours incurred by the 
locomotive(s) shall then be categorized according to the applicable GMA 
horsepower classification group. The fuel cost is derived from the 
Repairs and Supplies Expenses element of the locomotive rental rates 
published by the GMA. The fuel cost per locomotive unit hour shall be 
determined for each GMA horsepower classification group by multiplying 
the latest GMA fuel cost percentage by the Repairs and Supplies Expense 
per hour included in each group. The fuel cost per locomotive unit hour 
for each applicable GMA group shall be multiplied by the number of 
locomotive unit hours incurred in serving the branch by locomotives of 
that GMA horsepower classification group. The total cost developed under 
this procedure for each horsepower classification shall be the 
locomotive fuel cost assignable to the branch line.
    (iii) Electric power purchased or produced for motive power. All 
accounts designated XX-31-68 shall be assigned to the branch on the 
ratio of road electric locomotive unit hours on the branch to the total 
system road electric locomotive unit hours.
    (iv) Servicing locomotives. All accounts designated XX-31-69 shall 
be assigned to the branch on the ratio of road locomotive unit miles on 
the branch to the total system road locomotive unit miles.
    (2) Yard operations--(i) Switch Crews--Materials, Account 21-32-64, 
and Servicing Locomotives, all accounts designated XX-32-69. The costs 
for these accounts shall be assigned to the branch on the ratio of yard 
locomotive unit hours on the branch to the system total yard locomotive 
unit hours.
    (ii) Locomotive fuel. All accounts designated XX-32-67 shall be 
assigned to the branch on the ratio of yard diesel locomotive unit hours 
on the branch to the total system yard diesel locomotive unit hours.
    (iii) Electric power purchased or produced for motive power. All 
accounts designated XX-32-68 shall be assigned to the branch on the 
ratio of yard electric locomotive unit hours on the branch to the total 
system yard electric locomotive unit hours.
    (3) Administrative support operations--(i) Loss and damage claims 
processing. All accounts designated XX-35-78 shall be assigned to the 
branch on the ratio of the number of claims processed for loss or damage 
occurring on the branch to the total number of claims processed by the 
railroad.
    (4) Transportation fringe benefits. Fringe benefits shall be 
assigned to the branch separated between train operations, yard 
operations, train and yard operations common, specialized service 
operations, and administrative support operations. The costs for each 
activity shall be assigned to the branch on the ratio that the total 
branch salaries and wages bear to the total system salaries and wages 
for each activity shown below.
    (i) Train operations, account 12-31-00, total of all 11-31-XX 
accounts branch to system.
    (ii) Yard operations, account 12-32-00, total of all 11-32-XX

    (v) Administrative support, account 12-35-00, total of all 11-35-XX 
accounts branch to system.
    (d) General administrative. (1) Fringe benefits, account 12-61-00, 
shall be assigned to the branch on the ratio that the total branch 
salaries and wages in all 11-61-XX accounts bear to the system total 
salaries and wages in all 11-61-XX accounts.
    (2) [Reserved]

[[Page 367]]

    (e) The railroad shall be entitled to recover the impact of 
inflation on on-branch costs that occur during the period between the 
calendar year which is used for developing subsidy year unit costs and 
the 12 month period covered by the subsidy agreement. Calendar year used 
in this section shall mean the January 1, to December 31, period used to 
develop unit costs that are applied to the subsidy year operations.
    (1) The updating procedures described in paragraphs (e)(1)(A), 
(e)(1)(B) and (e)(1)(C), of this section, shall be applied to the 
applicable categories of total on-branch costs as provided in 
Sec. 1155.8(b) and (c). The on-branch updated costs shall be calculated 
as follows:
    (A) The increase in fuel costs shall be determined by multiplying 
the on-branch costs for Locomotive Fuel-Materials, [account 21-31-67 
plus account 21-32-67] by the Fuel Cost Update Ratio, [Section 
1155.7(n)(5)(ii)(E)(3), minus one].
    (B) The increase in the Electric Power Costs shall be determined by: 
Multiplying the on-branch costs for Electric Power Purchased or 
Produced-Materials, and Purchased Services [accounts, 21-31-68, 21-32-
68, 41-31-68 and 41-32-68] by the Electric Power Cost Update Ratio, 
[Section 1155.7(n)(5)(ii)(F)(3), minus one].
    (C) The increase in materials and supplies cost shall be determined 
by multiplying the on-branch materials and supplies costs, [the sum of 
accounts: Engine Crews-Materials (21-31-56); plus Train Crews-Materials 
(21-31-57); plus Train Inspection and Lubrication-Materials (21-31-62); 
plus Locomotive Repairs and Maintenance-Materials (21-21-41); plus 
Servicing Locomotive-Materials--(21-31-69); plus Switch Crews-Materials 
(21-32-64); plus Yard Operations: Servicing of Locomotives-Material (21-
32-69)] by the Materials and Supplies costs Update Ratio, [Section 
1155.7(n)(5)(ii)(G)(3), minus one].
    (2) The railroad shall recalculate on-branch car-day and car-mile 
costs as described in Sec. 1155.7(g) to reflect inflation occurring in 
Materials-Freight Cars-Repairs and Maintenance Account (21-22-42) for 
the period between the calendar year used for developing subsidy year 
unit costs and the 12-month period covered by the subsidy agreement.
    (A) The increase in freight car repairs and maintenance costs shall 
be determined by multiplying the on-branch costs for these materials 
[Account 21-22-42--Materials-Freight Cars-Repairs and Maintenance] by 
the Materials and Supplies Cost Update Ratio [section 
1155.7(n)(5)(ii)(G)(3)].
    (B) The amount in paragraph (e)(1)(A) is substituted for Account 21-
22-42--Freight Train Car-Repair and Maintenance calculated in 
Sec. 1155.7(g). Then, the total freight train car costs per car-day and 
car-mile are recalculated. The recalculated car-day and car-mile costs 
are then applied to the appropriate service units incurred during the 
subsidy year, using the procedure described in Sec. 1155.7(g).
    (C) The railroad shall calculate the net increase in freight train 
car costs by subtracting the on-branch freight train car costs, as 
provided in Sec. 1155.7(G), from the adjusted amount described in 
paragraph (e)(2)(B).
    (3) The net inflationary impact developed for a on-branch costs 
described in paragraphs (e)(1)(A), (e)(1)(B), (e)(1)(C) and (e)(2)(C) 
shall be included in the railroad's year-end Financial Status Report as 
provided in Sec. 1155.5(a).

Sec. 1155.9  Return on the value of rail properties.

    (a) Valuation of rail properties. The value of the rail properties 
on a branch shall be determined in accordance with the following:
    (1) Only the following properties on a branch may be considered:
    (i) Those that are used and useful to provide the rail services 
requested by the person offering a subsidy.
    (ii) In the absence of a request for specific services by that 
person, those properties that are used and useful to provide the rail 
service performed on the branch at the time the final system plan became 
effective, or if no service was being performed at that time, the

[[Page 368]]

services that were last performed on the branch.
    (2) The value of the properties shall be their net liquidation value 
for their highest and best use, consistent with applicable zoning and 
land use regulations, determined by computing their current market value 
for other than rail transportation purposes, less all costs of 
dismantling, and disposition of improvements necessary to make the 
remaining property available for its highest and best use.
    (3) If the railroad and person offering a subsidy cannot, within a 
period of time that either of them considers reasonable after the 
beginning of negotiations for the payment of the subsidy, agree on the 
properties that are used and useful or the net liquidation value, or 
both, the one that considers that a reasonable period of time has 
elapsed may notify the other of its intention to have the matter 
arbitrated. Each of the parties shall then appoint a representative and 
the representatives shall select an arbitrator or arbitrators mutually 
acceptable to them. The decision of the arbitrator or arbitrators shall 
be final.
    (4) If either party fails to appoint a representative within five 
days after receiving notice from the other party of its representative, 
or if the appointed representatives fail, within five days after the 
last one of them is appointed, to agree upon a mutually acceptable 
arbitrator or arbitrators, either party may submit the matter for 
arbitration to the American Arbitration Association pursuant to its 
commercial arbitration rules, and the decision of its arbitrator or 
arbitrators shall be final.
    (5) In considering the value of properties under this section, the 
arbitrator or arbitrators shall consider, among other factors, any bona 
fide offer for the properties, or a part thereof, recent sales of 
adjoining or similar properties, any available appraisals, by a 
reputable appraiser, of the properties, or a part thereof.
    (6) If the person offering a subsidy is a public body, each meeting 
of an arbitrator or arbitrators with the parties for the purpose of 
receiving information or evidence or to hear arguments or views shall be 
open to the public. Any interested member of the public may file written 
views, argument, or information with the arbitrator or arbitrators at 
any time within three days after the closing of the sessions that are 
open to the public.
    (b) Reasonable return on the value of the properties. The reasonable 
return on the value of rail properties, as determined under 
Sec. 1155.9(a) shall be the interest rate that is equal to the publicly 
quoted yield, to maturity or earliest call date, on the first business 
day of the month in which the subsidy agreement is entered into, for 
U.S. Treasury bonds or notes maturing or having an earliest call date 
approximately coterminous with the end of the subsidy period. United 
States Treasury bonds, redeemable at par before call or maturity for the 
sole purpose of applying the proceeds to payment of Federal estate 
taxes, and Treasury notes Series EA or EO shall be excluded from 
consideration for this purpose.

<R05>
Sec. 1156.1  Scope of rules in this part.

    The rules in this part govern the procedures for the submission of 
costs and revenues to be followed by carriers subject to the 
jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of 
chapter 105, subtitle IV, title 49, U.S. Code, which are directed by the 
Commission to perform service over the lines of other carriers under the 
provisions of 49 U.S.C. 11125 (formerly 49 U.S.C. 1(16)(b)). The 
Commission's report in Regional Rail Reorg. Act--Submission of Cost 
Data, 348 I.C.C. 251 (1975), should be used by directed carriers for 
guidance in the preparation of the cost form. The report and its 
appendix set forth the Commission's policy as to the costs and revenues, 
incurred in or attributable to the conduct of directed operations, are 
allowable for inclusion in the cost form. Only such allowable costs and 
revenues will be considered by the Commission in its computation of 
payments due to the directed carrier under the provisions of section 
11125.


<R05>
Sec. 1156.2  Cost form and certification.

    The expenses and revenues incurred in the conduct of directed 
service shall be recorded in accordance with the cost form and 
instructions below:

                        Instructions to Cost Form

    1. Enter in column (7) the expenses directly assignable to the 
directed traffic moved. This includes wages, rentals and other expenses 
paid or incurred by the applicant and chargeable only to the directed 
traffic.
    2. Enter in column (8) the portion of common expenses allocable to 
the directed traffic. Common expenses are those expenses paid or 
incurred for the movement of the directed traffic which are common or 
jointly incurred for the movement of other traffic.

[[Page 370]]

All expenses should be assigned directly wherever possible. Expenses not 
directly assignable should be apportioned on the basis of the factor 
suggested in column (10) or if necessary, on the basis of a more readily 
available and equitable factor, if such use is justified to the 
Commission. The relationship of the carriers' own revenues and the 
directed traffic revenues is an acceptance apportionment factor in cases 
where there are no other available apportionment factors.
    3. Enter in column (9) the total of columns (7) and (8).
    4. The cost of rehabilitation of the line necessary to permit 
operation should be shown in the way and structures accounts. 
Expenditures for substantial improvements shall require authorization by 
the Commission.
    5. Expenses included in lines 53, 54, 55, 131, 140, 159, 169, 176, 
183, 190, 249, and 262 should be identified on a separate sheet.

\1\Profit is based on 6% of total revenues (line 268). A profit from actual operations above 6% of total revenues may be retained by the directed       
  carrier and no amount for profit will be paid by the Federal Government. Should a profit of less than 6% be earned, the difference between 6% and that
  % will be paid.                                                                                                                                       
\2\Total expenses in line 265 divided by the total days of the directed operation. Multiply these expenses by a factor of 15 (days) to represent the lag
  between cash receipts and cash payments.                                                                                                              
\3\The amount borrowed should not exceed the permissible limits established in the Ex Parte No. 293 (Sub No. 3) report, unless specifically approved by 
  the Commission.                                                                                                                                       
\4\Apply the average prime rate (per annum) in effect at New York City to line 275, or the prime rate (per annum) in effect at New York City on the date
  of the loan agreement to line 276, whichever is greater. However, the interest allowed on amounts actually borrowed shall not exceed the amount of    
  interest charged on the loan, if less than the applicable prime rate.

<R05>
Sec. 1156.3  Optional Cash Funding Procedures.

    (a) The directed carrier may elect to obtain cash funding from the 
Commission following the procedure set forth below. The funding 
procedure is separated into three phases. The first is designed to meet 
the directed carrier's immediate requirements to institute service. The 
second is an interim accounting and adjustment under which any serious 
cash flow problems will be remedied. The third phase is the final 
accounting after completion of the service and computation of the total 
account reimbursable.

All reports filed should refer to the appropriate ICC account numbers. 
The records of the directed carrier relating to the directed service 
will be subject to continuing audit by the Commission.
    (b) Initial Funding. (1) The initial funding is intended to cover 
the immediate deficit to be incurred through cash expenditures that must 
be made before compensating revenues can be generated. Permissible costs 
which might require lead funding include:
    (i) Payroll costs necessary for assignment of crews;
    (ii) Immediate maintenance of way or line repairs necessary to make 
a line operational or in compliance with safety standards;
    (iii) Fuel and supplies;
    (iv) Immediate rental or maintenance costs for equipment to be used 
(other than rental payments to the defaulting carrier);
    (v) That portion of overhead allocable to developing the initial 
operation plan; and
    (vi) Any other immediate cash requirements.
    (2) To enable the Commission to determine initial cash requirements, 
the directed carrier is required to submit the following items.
    (i) A brief description of its initial operating plan for the 
directed service, outlining the frequency and schedule of service 
planned, the personnel and equipment to be utilized, the crew change and 
interchange points to be observed, any immediate maintenance and repair 
work required, and its fuel and supply needs.
    (ii) A statement of its immediate cash requirements, with any 
supporting evidence deemed necessary.
    (iii) A statement of the forecasted costs and revenues attributable 
to the directed service for the 60 day period with appropriate 
explanatory notes.

These are to be submitted as soon as possible, but not later than 15 
days after the issuance of the directed service order. After the 
Commission has determined the initial cash requirements (and within 30 
days after the directed carrier's submission), it will certify to the 
Treasury Department that this amount is immediately payable.
    (c) Interim Accounting. The interim accounting procedure consists of 
a report filed by the directed carrier at the

[[Page 382]]

end of each 30 day period following institution of the directed service. 
In addition, the carrier may file a report whenever it is experiencing 
severe cash flow difficulties and desires additional interim funding. 
The interim reports must contain:
    (1) A statement of any revisions to the operating plan.
    (2) An unaudited cash flow statement for the period since its last 
report, and an explanation of any requests for additional cash.
    (3) An unaudited statement of costs and revenues attributable to the 
directed service since its institution, and a statement of the 
forecasted costs and revenues for the remainder of the directed service 
period.

Within 30 days after receipt of an interim financing request with 
supporting data, the Commission will certify to the Treasury Department 
the amount to be paid the directed carrier.
    (d) Final Accounting. (1) The final accounting report, to be filed 
within 180 days after completion of the directed service, should conform 
to the requirements of Sec. 1156.2 of this part. Any monies paid under 
the optional cash funding procedures must be deducted from the amount to 
be reimbursed (line 279). Also, the base for computation of allowable 
interest (line 277) must be reduced by the amount paid.
    (2) After auditing the claim, the Commission will determine the 
allowable reimbursement. It will certify to the Treasury Department that 
the directed carrier be paid that amount by which the allowable 
reimbursement exceeds the amount paid. Should the amount paid exceed the 
allowable reimbursement, the difference will be due and payable by the 
directed carrier to the Commission within 30 days. It not paid within 
the 30-day period, the amount due will then begin to accrue interest at 
the prevailing prime rate.

<R05>
Sec. 1157.2  Purpose and scope.

    (a) Section 304(e)(1), as amended, of the 3R Act requires Conrail 
(or a profitable railroad) to provide commuter rail service for a period 
of 180 days commencing April 1, 1976, on all rail properties over which 
a railroad in reorganization in the Northeast and Midwest Region, or a 
person leased, operated, or controlled by such a railroad, was providing 
service as of that date regardless of whether or not the properties were 
designated in the Final System Plan of the United States Railway 
Association as rail properties over which rail service is required to be 
operated.
    (b) Section 304(c)(2)(A) and section 304(e)(4) of the 3R Act, as 
amended, provide that no commuter rail service may be discontinued, and 
no rail properties may be abandoned, if a subsidizer offers financial 
assistance in the form of a rail service continuation payment which is 
designed to cover the difference between the avoidable costs of 
providing commuter rail service on the rail properties and the revenues 
attributable to such properties, together with a reasonable return on 
the value of the properties.

[[Page 384]]

    (c) Section 205(d)(6) of the 3R Act, as amended, authorizes RSPO to 
determine and publish Standards for defining (1) the ``revenue 
attributable to the rail properties'', (2) the ``avoidable cost of 
providing service'', and (3) a ``reasonable return on value'', as those 
phrases are used in section 304 of the 3R Act, as amended.
    (d) Section 205(d)(5) of the 3R Act, as amended, directs RSPO to 
determine and publish Standards for the computation of subsidies for 
commuter rail service (except passenger service compensation disputes 
subject to the jurisdiction of the ICC) which are consistent with the 
compensation principles described in the Final System Plan and which 
avoid cross subsidization among commuter, intercity, and freight rail 
services.
    (e) These regulations set forth a method for establishing an 
estimated subsidy payment, which will enable a prospective subsidizer to 
formulate a subsidy offer within the context of section 304 of the 3R 
Act, as amended, and provide a basis for subsidy payment pending the 
negotiation of a subsidy agreement. When an agreement is concluded, 
subsequent payments shall be based on the negotiated subsidy. The final 
payment shall be adjusted to reflect the actual revenues derived, 
avoidable costs incurred and value of the properties used in the subsidy 
period.
    (f) Section 304(e)(4)(C) of the 3R Act, as amended, provides that 
the Commuter Standards published as 49 CFR part 1157, Standards For 
Determining Commuter Rail Service Continuation Subsidies under section 
205(d)(5)(A) and (6) of the 3R Act, as amended, shall apply to rail 
passenger service provided under an agreement or lease pursuant to 
sections 303(b)(2) or 304(c)(2)(B) of the 3R Act, as amended, when an 
offer is made for the continuation of rail passenger service beyond the 
period required by such agreement or lease.


<R05>
Sec. 1157.3  Subsidy agreement.

    (a) Notice of Intention. A prospective subsidizer shall notify the 
railroad of its intention to offer financial assistance for the 
continuation of commuter service no later than 40 days before the offer 
is to be tendered. The Notice shall specify:
    (1) All modifications in the fares to be charged and in the existing 
level of service, including changes in routes, schedules, train seating 
capacity, performance standards, equipment units, and such other 
dimensions of service as the subsidizer may specify;
    (2) The length of the subsidy period; and
    (3) The name and address of the prospective subsidizer.

A copy of the Notice shall be served concurrently on RSPO and the 
Secretary.
    (b) Subsidy Estimate. The railroad shall compute a subsidy estimate 
predicated on the information contained in the Notice and the revenues 
attributable, avoidable costs of providing service, and reasonable 
return on value for the based period in accordance with the methodology 
prescribed in Secs. 1157.6 through 1157.9 and in the format specified in 
appendix I to this part. The estimate shall be adjusted as necessary to 
allow for any actual or projected variations in service, e.g. seasonal 
fluctuations in traffic or extraordinary events affecting service 
levels. The bases of any adjustments shall be stated with particularity. 
The railroad's estimate and the general terms it proposes for an 
agreement shall be served on the prospective subsidizer (with copies to 
RSPO and the Secretary) as soon as possible but not later than 30 days 
after the Notice is received.
    (c) Offer of Financial Assistance. The prospective subsidizer must 
formulate an offer of subsidy predicated on the railroad's estimate, but 
may propose modifications which are consistent with these Standards. 
Subsidy offers must be served on the railroad (with copies to RSPO and 
the Secretary) not less than 60 days before the end of the subsidy 
period. The offer shall contain:
    (1) A subsidy estimate in the form prescribed in Appendix I to this 
part;
    (2) A resolution, authorization or other evidence that the 
prospective subsidizer has, or within a reasonable time will have, the 
authority to execute and fulfill an agreement to subsidize the service;

[[Page 385]]

    (3) Information demonstrating that the prospective subsidizer has, 
or within a reasonable time will have, the financial resources to 
subsidize the service and otherwise fulfill its contractual obligations; 
and
    (4) A subsidy payment for the first month of service.
    (d) Negotiations--(1) General. The railroad and the prospective 
subsidizer shall negotiate an initial subsidy agreement as soon as 
possible. The parties may agree in arm's-length negotiations to 
provisions which modify the Standards, subject to review of such 
modifications by RSPO. RSPO would not expect to disapprove variations 
from the Standards which are the product of arm's-length negotiations 
and which are shown to be reasonable in the light of the pertinent facts 
and circumstances. When an agreement has been reached, a copy shall be 
filed promptly with RSPO for its review.
    (2) Significant Use. Unless the parties agree otherwise, the 
subsidizer shall be deemed a significant user of the rail properties in 
the areas designated on the facilities utilization plan, and shall be 
assigned the directly identifiable and common costs, including base 
costs as applicable, of providing the commuter passenger service.
    (3) Insignificant Use. A minority user, who is proposing incidential 
use of rail properties in the designated area, may be assigned the 
directly identifiable costs incurred in providing the service, plus an 
allowance for overhead as negotiated by the parties. If the parties are 
unable to agree on an overhead allowance, the methodology for 
apportioning common costs specified in Sec. 1157.7 shall apply.
    (4) Mediation. Upon request of either party, RSPO will mediate 
disagreements concerning the facilities utilization plan, the manpower 
utilization plan, the subsidy agreement and the application of these 
Standards.
    (e) Subsidy Payments. The subsidizer shall make subsidy payments 
monthly in advance, based either upon the negotiated estimate, or in the 
absence of a subsidy agreement, upon the subsidizer's offer of financial 
assistance. The payment shall be determined by dividing the total 
subsidy by the number of months in the subsidy period. Interest on 
overdue subsidy payments shall accrue, at a rate of 100 basis points (1 
percentage point) above the prime rate currently quoted at a principal 
bank in the commuter service area, for such period as they remain unpaid 
and the railroad has not terminated the service. The final subsidy 
payment shall be adjusted retroactively within 60 days of the filing of 
the final Financial Status Report required by paragraph (f) of this 
section to reflect the actual revenues derived, avoidable costs incurred 
and value of the properties used in providing rail commuter service 
during the subsidy period. The railroad shall establish a system to 
collect the data necessary to make the adjustment. If the subsidizer is 
entitled to a refund, the railroad shall pay interest on the 
overpayment, at a rate of 100 basis points (1 percentage point) above 
the prime rate currently quoted at a principal bank in the commuter 
service area, accruing from the end of the subsidy period until the 
refund is made.
    (f) Financial Status Report. The railroad shall submit to the 
subsidizer and RSPO a Financial Status Report in the form prescribed in 
appendix II to this part within 60 days after the end of each three 
months of the subsidy period. Significant deviations from the subsidy 
estimate must be explained. Unless the parties otherwise agree, the 
second-to-last report shall be the basis for negotiating the subsequent 
subsidy agreement. The final report shall be the basis of the subsidy 
payment adjustment.

<R05>
Sec. 1157.4  Interpretations of the Standards.

    Parties desiring an interpretation of the Standards should file a 
written petition citing the section involved and setting forth their 
position and rationale. If the request arises from a dispute with other 
parties, the petitioner should identify those parties and serve each of 
them with a copy. Parties desiring to file a reply must do so within 10 
days of their receipt of the petition. RSPO will issue an 
interpretation, unless it concludes that the matter raised requires 
amendment of the Standards,

[[Page 386]]

in which case RSPO will institute a rulemaking proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 1157.5  Access to records, audit and inspection.

    (a) The subsidizer, RSPO, Conrail and the Secretary of 
Transportation shall have reasonable access to the records, accounts, 
working papers, and other documents and to the properties and equipment 
of any railroad or subsidizer which provides commuter passenger service 
or whose properties and equipment are used in providing commuter 
passenger service for the following purposes:
    (1) To verify the accuracy and completeness of the subsidy estimate, 
the facilities utilization plan, the manpower utilization plan, and the 
Financial Status Reports;
    (2) To audit the actual revenues attributable, costs incurred and 
service units maintained during the subsidy period;
    (3) To inspect the properties and equipment used in providing the 
commuter passenger service and to measure the performance of the 
railroad under the offer of financial assistance and the subsidy 
agreement; or
    (b) The properties and records described in paragraph (a) shall be 
made available for inspection and examination by the subsidizer, RSPO, 
Conrail or the Secretary of Transportation during regular business hours 
at a time and place mutually agreeable to the parties. The railroad or 
the subsidizer shall also reproduce such records, providing the 
requesting party pays the reasonable cost thereof.

<R05>
Sec. 1157.6  Revenues attributable to commuter rail service.

    The revenues attributable to commuter rail service shall be the 
total of the revenues, rentals and allowances assigned in accordance 
with this section. Where a third party controls revenues or rents 
attributable to the commuter service, the railroad shall credit the 
commuter service with the amounts of such revenues or rents credited to 
it by the third party, and shall use its best efforts to negotiate 
equitable apportionments. Revenues attributable to two or more commuter 
services shall be apportioned between them on the basis of car-miles 
operated under the respective offers of financial assistance or subsidy 
agreements. The revenues, rentals and allowances assigned shall be 
derived from the following accounts.
    (a) Revenue Accounts. (1) Account 101--Freight (Mail portion) 
Account 102--Passenger; Account 103--Passenger Related; Account 104--
Switching; Account 105--Water Transfers. The revenues assigned to these 
accounts shall be the actual revenues attributable to commuter service 
that are directly identified with the operation of commuter trains, 
excluding rail service continuation payments.
    (2) Account 110--Incidental. The revenues assigned to this account 
earned on commuter trains shall be credited directly to the commuter 
service. The commuter service portion of revenues generated at fixed 
facilities used in common with other services shall be determined from 
the relative passenger on-off counts (including pass riders) at those 
facilities. Special studies of on-off counts may be substituted for 
continuous records of such counts where desired. Any amounts included in 
this account from the sale of electric current or power shall be 
assigned to commuter service in accordance with Sec. 1157.7(f)(3)(v) if 
related to train operations and (Sec. 1157.7(f)(3)(ix)) if related to 
yard operations.
    (3) Account 121--Joint facility--Cr.; Account 122--Joint facility--
Dr. To the extent that the terms of joint facility agreements yield 
apportionments of revenues to commuter services, the amounts so yielded 
shall be credited or debited directly to the commuter service. If the 
terms of the agreements do not yield such apportionments, passenger on-
off counts (including pass riders) shall be the basis of apportionment 
at joint facilities where passengers are boarded or discharged; and at 
other facilities counts of cars handled as developed from special 
studies or continuous records shall be the basis of apportionment.
    (b) Rentals--Account 510--Miscellaneous rent income. The rentals 
assigned to this account which are attributable to

[[Page 387]]

commuter service shall be the actual amount derived from the rental of 
commuter service equipment or other property including property owned by 
the subsidizer, Conrail, Amtrak or other parties.
    (c) Pass Rider Allowance. Attributable revenues of the commuter 
service shall be credited with an allowance for passengers using passes 
or reduced fare tickets issued by the railroad (or predecessor 
companies). The parties may continue existing practices for crediting 
such allowances. In the absence of an agreement, the amount of such 
credit shall be determined on the basis of currently applicable fares 
charged revenue commuter passengers.
    (d) Conversion chart for Revenue Accounts.

Sec. 1157.7  Avoidable costs of providing service.

    (a) Assignment of costs. To the maximum extent practicable, the 
directly identifiable and common costs for each designated area shall be 
developed from a facilities utilization plan and a manpower utilization 
plan. The base costs shall be assigned to the dominant user. The 
facilities and manpower utilization plans, developed on the basis of 
dominant and minority user(s), are to be completed with the assistance 
of available and appropriate cost and accounting records such as time 
sheets, material requisitions, charge cards, vouchers, and the like. 
[All accounts shall be separated between labor and material (non-labor) 
charges.] Otherwise, costs may be assigned to the minority service in a 
manner agreed to by the parties. The parties may rely on historical 
data; conduct special studies; develop their own apportionment formulae 
based on use; or agree on a combination of these methods. Upon request 
of either party, RSPO will mediate disputes concerning the proper 
methodology for assigning costs. Any costs which are not assigned under 
the foregoing procedure shall be assigned in accordance with the 
methodology prescribed in paragraph (e) and (f) of this section, subject 
to the condition that either party may request a special study. The 
requesting party will be responsible for designing the study and 
obtaining the other party's approval of the design. The results of the 
study will be binding on both parties unless they mutually agree to 
disregard the results. Where commuter service is not the dominant user 
the avoidable costs common to two or more commuter services shall be 
apportioned between them on the basis of car-miles operated under the 
respective offers of financial assistance or subsidy agreements. In 
assigning costs to the minority user(s) it is understood that the 
amounts charged to a particular function shall include both the directly 
attributable expenses and the minority user's portion of the common 
expenses for that function. Also, the assignment of common costs 
associated with some supervision of overhead functions that relate to 
both dominant user and minority user(s) activities requires the 
inclusion of the applicable dominant user account in the apportionment 
base.
    (b) Facilities Utilization Plan. The parties shall develop a 
facilities utilization plan which shall identify the dominant and 
minority user(s). The facilities utilization plan shall identify and 
itemize the road and equipment properties used by the minority user(s) 
and assign to each property or group of properties the agreed percentage 
of use devoted to the minority user(s). In the event that there is only 
one service being operated, the facilities utilization plan shall 
identify only those properties used and useful to that service. The plan 
shall identify those road properties which are avoidable upon 
discontinuance of the minority user(s) service for the purposes of 
determining road depreciation, retirement and dismantling charges 
[Sec. 1157.7(e) through (f)] and value of road properties 
[Sec. 1157.8(b) and (c)]. The roadway properties and facilities should 
be divided

[[Page 388]]

into areas or segments consisting of stretches of property where 
operations or use remain fairly constant and pinpointing those places 
where the operations or use change (e.g., number of tracks change, 
diverging or entering branch lines and other similar changes). 
Properties and equipment normally covered in a facilities utilization 
plan include: Trackage; signal system; electrification system; 
interlocking plants; bridges and drawbridges; stations and platforms; 
rail-highway crossings; yards; power plants; shops; enginehouses and 
servicing facilities; storehouses; land; rolling stock; and other 
facilities or equipment. Source data normally include equipment rosters, 
track diagrams or maps of the properties in the above categories, and 
usage measures for each class of facility and equipment by specific 
facility or segment (e.g., track density charts, trains sheets, 
timetables, blocking records, yarding programs, station workloads, etc.) 
to determine the percentage of use of facilities or equipment in 
providing the minority service(s).
    (c) Manpower Utilization Plan. The parties shall also develop a 
manpower utilization plan separated between designated areas in which 
the commuter authority is the dominant user and designated areas in 
which the commuter authority is the minority user. Where the commuter 
service is the dominant user, the plan shall identify the labor forces 
used in providing both the commuter service and any minority service(s). 
The plan shall list all persons employed according to job title, work 
location, account and percentage of time devoted to dominant and 
minority service(s) duties. Where the commuter service is the minority 
user the plan shall identify the labor forces used in providing the 
commuter service. The plan shall list the persons employed according to 
the job title, work location, account and percentage of time devoted to 
commuter service duties.
    (d) Special studies. All special studies shall be conducted jointly 
by the railroad and the subsidizer. The length and frequency of the 
studies and the standardized measurement procedures utilized in the 
studies shall be negotiated by the parties. In the event of impasse, 
either party may submit the dispute to RSPO for resolution and its 
decision shall be final. The cost of studies which are prescribed by 
these Standards or which the parties voluntarily agree to perform shall 
be attributed to the commuter service. The cost of studies performed at 
the request of only one party shall be borne exclusively by that party 
and shall not be attributed to the commuter service.

\1\These costs may include the actual expenses incurred in administering the subsidy program. There shall be no 
  apportionment of common costs charged to these accounts.                                                      
\2\In those situations where the commuter service is the dominant user, the minority user(s) shall be assigned  
  any charges to these accounts on an actual basis.                                                             
\3\The minority user(s) shall pay for units of shop and powerplant machinery which could be disposed of if the  
  minority service were discontinued.                                                                           
\4\On line segments which are owned by a state, local or regional transportation authority, the minority user(s)
  shall be charged with those property taxes including in lieu of tax payments which would not be incurred in   
  the absence of the minority service(s).

    (f) Apportionment Rules For Assigning Common Costs to Commuter 
Service. The accounts specified under Sec. 1157.7(e) which have an 
assignment basis other than ``Actual'' shall be apportioned according to 
the rules contained in this section.
    (1) Maintenance of Way and Structures--(i) Repair and Maintenance-
Switching. The common costs assigned to these accounts shall be 
apportioned on the ratio of the commuter service cars dispatched in the 
designated area to the total cars dispatched in the designated area.
    (ii) Repair and Maintenance--Running. For a designated area, the 
common costs assigned to these accounts shall be apportioned on the 
ratio of the commuter service Speed Factored Gross Tons (SFGT) for the 
designated area to the total SFGT for all traffic in the designated 
area. Where the commuter service is the minority user, the commuter 
service SFGT shall be derived by subtracting the SFGT for freight and/or 
intercity passenger from the total SFGT for all traffic. Where the 
commuter service is the dominant user, the commuter service SFGT shall 
be derived as if the commuter service was

[[Page 395]]

the only service; the SFGT shall be calculated in accordance with the 
formula set forth in appendix III.
    (iii) Station and Office Buildings. The common costs assigned to 
these accounts shall be first apportioned on the ratio of total square 
feet devoted to passenger service to the total square feet used in the 
facility. The passenger portion shall then be apportioned on the ratio 
of the commuter service on-off passenger count (including pass riders) 
in the designated area to the total on-off passenger count (including

    (vi) Fringe Benefits--Other Equipment. Fringe benefits shall be 
separated between pensions and Health and Welfare benefits with a 
further separation between running, switching and other. The costs 
assigned to these accounts for pensions shall be the actual costs that 
are directly attributable to commuter service. Health and Welfare 
benefits shall be assigned to commuter service on the ratio of the 
commuter service amounts in the respective salary and wage accounts to 
the railroad's system total for these accounts. Expenses for 
entertainment facilities for personal use shall only be included in 
Health and Welfare benefits costs where it can be clearly demonstrated 
that the cost was commuter service related.
    (vii) Other. Equipment retirements shall be assigned to commuter 
service on an actual basis. The balance of the common costs assigned to 
these accounts shall be apportioned on the ratio of the amounts assigned 
to commuter service to the railroad's total in the designated area for 
the following accounts:

XX-23-43

    (3) Transportation--(i) Engine Crews; Train Crews. These accounts 
shall be separated between salary and wages and train supplies and 
expenses. The salary and wage portion shall be assigned to commuter 
service on an actual basis. The common costs assigned to these accounts 
for train supplies and expenses shall be apportioned on the ratio of 
commuter cars dispatched in the designated area to the railroad's total 
cars dispatched in the designated area. Commuter cars shall include 
passenger cars and motor cars.
    (ii) Dispatching trains. The common costs assigned to these accounts 
shall be apportioned on the ratio of the commuter train hours in the 
designated area to the total train hours in the designated area.
    (iii) Operating Signals and Interlockers; Operating Drawbridges; 
Highway Crossing Protection. The common costs assigned to these accounts 
shall be apportioned on the ratio of the number of commuter service 
train movements through these facilities to the total of all train 
movements through these facilities.
    (iv) Train Inspection and Lubrication. The common costs assigned to 
these accounts shall be apportioned on the

[[Page 398]]

ratio of commuter cars dispatched in the designated area to the 
railroad's total cars dispatched in the designated area. Commuter cars 
shall include passenger cars and motor cars.
    (v) Electric Power Purchased/Produced for Motive Power. The cost of 
kilowatt hours consumed for commuter service shall be based on the 
kilowatt hours developed for commuter service in Sec. 1157.7(f)(1)(v) 
weighed to reflect the peak period power demands, i.e., time of day and 
volume of power demanded. A special study may be conducted to develop 
the peak power demand factor.
    (vi) Servicing Locomotives. The common costs assigned to these 
accounts shall be apportioned on the ratio of the total locomotive units 
(road) serviced in commuter service in the designated area to the 
railroad's total locomotive units (road) serviced in the designated 
area.
    (vii) Freight Lost or Damaged--Solely Related; Clearing Wrecks; 
Other Casualties and Insurance. The minority user shall be responsible 
for any costs incurred under these accounts resulting from the operation 
of the minority service. The dominant user is responsible only for those 
costs incurred under these accounts resulting from an incident that 
solely involves the operation of the dominant service. The railroad 
shall, if the subsidizer agrees, establish a reserve for the purpose of 
holding the subsidizer harmless from any liabilities under these 
accounts arising out of the operation of commuter services. Where the 
commuter service is the minority user, the costs assigned to these 
accounts for commuter service insurance shall be determined by 
ascertaining from the railroad's underwriters:
    (A) The difference in the current premium if commuter service were 
not operated and
    (B) The additional premium required to hold the railroad and the 
subsidizers harmless from any liability.

Such amounts shall be apportioned between the several commuter services 
operated by the railroad either on the basis of the relative passenger-
miles (including pass riders) or on the basis of the relative passenger 
revenues (including pass rider allowances). Where the commuter service 
is the dominant user, the costs assigned to these accounts for commuter 
service insurance shall be determined by ascertaining from the 
railroad's underwriters the premium if the commuter service were 
operated as the sole user of the properties involved.
    (viii) Fringe Benefits. Fringe benefits shall be separated between 
pensions and Health and Welfare benefits with a further separation 
between running, switching and other. The costs assigned to these 
accounts for pensions shall be the actual costs that are directly 
attributable to commuter service. Health and Welfare benefits shall be 
assigned to commuter service on the ratio of the commuter service 
amounts in the respective salary and wage accounts to the railroad's 
system total for these accounts. Expenses for entertainment facility for 
personal use shall only be included in Health and Welfare benefit costs 
where it can be clearly demonstrated that the cost was commuter service 
related.
    (ix) Switch Crews; Controlling Operations; Yard and Terminal 
Clerical: Operating Switches, Signals, Retarders, and Humps; Locomotive 
Fuel; Electric Power Purchased/Produced For Motive Power; Servicing 
Locomotives. A special study shall be conducted to determine the ratio 
of the commuter service (diesel, electric) yard locomotive unit hours in 
the designated area to the railroad's total (diesel, electric) yard 
locomotive unit hours in the designated area. The common costs assigned 
to these accounts shall be the amounts in the railroad's accounts for 
the designated area multiplied by the ratio determined from the study. 
For this purpose, the term ``locomotive'' shall include motor cars. In 
conducting such a study, the railroad should recognize the variances of: 
(A) Weekend versus weekday demand; (B) required yard crew manning to 
perform the switching services for various users; and (C) the effect of 
peak service on yard manning.
    (x) Employees Performing Clerical and Accounting Functions; 
Communication System Operations. (A) The common costs assigned to these 
accounts, exclusive of material, shall be subdivided into 4 categories:
    (1) Ticket sales and service;
    (2) Other station costs;

[[Page 399]]

    (3) Station master; and
    (4) Mail and baggage.
    (B) The common costs in these subaccounts, exclusive of material, 
shall be apportioned on the ratio of commuter service units in the 
designated area to the total units in the designated area for the 
respective units:
    (1) Weighted ticket sales;
    (2) Passenger on-off count (including pass riders);
    (3) Trains stopping at stations in the designated area; and
    (4) Units of mail and baggage handled.

The common material costs assigned to these accounts shall be 
apportioned on the ratio of the commuter service amounts in these 
accounts exclusive of material determined above to the railroad's total 
for these accounts in the designated area.
    (xi) Administration. The common costs assigned to these accounts 
shall be apportioned on the ratio of the commuter service amounts in all 
other transportation accounts in each subcategory except Fringe Benefits 
and Communication Systems Operations to the railroad's total for these 
accounts (including the applicable freight accounts) in the designated 
area.
    (xii) Communication System Operations. The common costs assigned to 
these accounts shall be apportioned on the ratio of the total commuter 
service amounts in the Administration accounts section 
(Sec. 1157.7(f)(3)(xi)) assigned to commuter service to the railroad's 
total for these accounts (including the applicable freight accounts) in 
the designated area.
    (4) General and Administrative--Fringe Benefits. Fringe benefits 
shall be separated between pensions and Health and Welfare benefits with 
a further separation between running, switching and other. The costs 
assigned to these accounts for pensions shall be the actual costs that 
are directly attributable to commuter service. Health and Welfare 
benefits shall be assigned to commuter service on the ratio of the 
commuter service amounts in the respective salary and wage accounts to 
the railroad's system total for these accounts. Expenses for 
entertainment facilities for personal use shall only be included in 
Health and Welfare benefit costs where it can be clearly demonstrated 
that the cost was commuter service related.
    (g) Performance Standards--Penalties and Incentives. The subsidy 
agreements may include reasonable provisions as agreed by the parties 
for penalties for service inferior to stipulated performance standards 
and incentive payments for superior performance. Penalties withheld from 
subsidy payments by the subsidizer under such agreements shall be 
treated as reductions of avoidable costs and incentive payments shall be 
treated as additions to avoidable costs.

Sec. 1157.8  Valuation of rail properties.

    The value of rail properties on which a reasonable return is allowed 
shall consist of:
    (a) The net book value of equipment furnished by the contracting 
carrier for commuter service, after deduction of accrued depreciation; 
and
    (b) The value of rail properties on which a reasonable return is 
allowed when the commuter service is the minority user shall consist of 
the net book value of those roadway and structures properties which are 
used in commuter service and could be disposed of if the commuter 
service were discontinued. The net book value shall include the net 
liquidation value of the properties as of April 1, 1976, determined for 
their highest and best use for other than rail transportation purposes, 
plus the value of additions and betterments completed after that date 
for commuter service. From this amount is subtracted any depreciation 
accrued from that date and all costs of modifying remaining properties 
so that non-commuter operations can be continued over them. It shall not 
include the value of properties owned by public bodies; or of properties 
owned by the trustees of debtor estates if such properties are entitled 
to a return computed under Sec. 1155.9;
    (c) When the commuter service is the dominant user, it shall be 
entitled to a return on the values of properties and equipment which 
could be disposed of if the minority service(s) were discontinued. The 
value applied to each line

[[Page 400]]

segment shall be the acquisition price paid by the commuter authority to 
Conrail, plus the value of additions and betterments after acquisition 
for the minority service, less depreciation accrued from the time of 
acquisition. From this amount is subtracted all costs of modifying 
remaining properties so that commuter operations can be continued over 
them.
    (d) If the book values of road or equipment property are adjusted 
upward or downward as a result of final orders of the special court, 
such adjusted values shall be reflected in future subsidy payments, but 
without retroactive effect.

Sec. 1157.9  Reasonable return on the value of the properties.

    The reasonable return shall be 7.5 percent per annum on the sum of 
the appropriate elements of the investment base computed in accordance 
with Sec. 1157.8. When the commuter authority is the owner, the 7.5 
percent per annum return represents a charge to the other user(s).

Sec. 1157.10  Additional rail passenger service.

    (a) As used in this section, the term ``additional rail passenger 
service'' means rail passenger service other than rail passenger service 
provided pursuant to sections 304(e)(2) and (4) of the 3R Act, as 
amended. It includes extended or expanded service and modified routings, 
which is to be provided over rail properties conveyed to Conrail 
pursuant to Section 303(b)(1) of the 3R Act, as amended, or over rail 
properties contiguous to properties conveyed to Amtrak, or any other 
rail properties contiguous to properties to which a State (or local or 
regional transportation authority) has obtained access.
    (b) If a State (or a local or regional transportation authority in 
the region offers to provide payment for the provision of additional 
rail passenger service, Conrail shall undertake to provide the 
additional service consistent with the discontinuance provisions 
contained in section 304(e)(2) of the 3R Act, as amended.

service shall be made in accordance with section 304(c)(2)(A) of the 3R 
Act, as amended, and pursuant to Secs. 1157.6-1157.9 of these 
regulations. The offer shall be designed to avoid any additional costs 
to Conrail arising from the construction or modification of capital 
facilities or from any additional operating delays or costs arising from 
the absence of such construction or modification.
    (d) The State (or local or regional transportation authority) shall 
demonstrate that it has acquired, leased, or otherwise obtained access 
to all rail properties other than those designated for conveyance to 
Amtrak pursuant to section 206(c)(1)(C) and 206(c)(1)(D) of the 3R Act, 
as amended, and to Conrail pursuant to section 303(b)(1) of the 3R Act, 
as amended, necessary to provide the additional rail passenger service. 
The State shall also demonstrate that it has completed or will complete 
prior to the inception of the additional rail passenger service, all 
capital improvements necessary to avoid significant costs which cannot 
be avoided by improved scheduling or other means on other existing rail 
service, including rail freight service. Assurance is required that the 
additional service will not detract from the level and quality of 
existing rail passenger and freight service.
    (e) Conrail shall not be required to operate additional rail 
passenger service over rail properties leased or acquired from or owned 
or leased by a profitable railroad in the region.

GTP=Passenger traffic gross tons (in millions) per track mile per year.
N=Number of tracks per route mile.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ In calculating total SFGT, the value of N shall reflect the 
total number of tracks presently in place. Any tracks constituting 
present excess capacity shall be included in this value of N.
    Where the commuter authority is the minority user the value of N, 
used in calculating SFGT for freight and/or intercity passenger service, 
shall reflect the total number of tracks less the number of tracks (if 
any) which could be eliminated if commuter service were discontinued. 
Any tracks constituting present excess capacity shall be included in the 
value of N when computing SFGT for freight and/or intercity passenger.
    Where the commuter authority is the dominant user, the value of N 
shall reflect the total number of tracks less the number of tracks (if

<R05>
Sec. 1160.4  Types of applications.

    (a) Fitness applications. Motor property applications and certain 
types of motor passenger applications require only the finding that the 
applicant is fit, willing and able to perform the involved operations 
and to comply with all applicable statutory and regulatory provisions. 
These applications can be opposed only on the grounds that applicant is 
not fit [e.g., is not in compliance with applicable financial 
responsibility and safety fitness requirements]. These applications are:
    (1) Motor common and contract carrier of property (except household 
goods) , Mexican motor property carriers that perform private carriage 
and transport exempt items, and motor contract carrier of passengers 
transportation.
    (2) Motor carrier brokerage of general commodities (except household 
goods).
    (3) Certain types of motor passenger applications as described in 
Form OP-1 (P).
    (b) Motor passenger ``public interest'' applications as described in 
Form OP-1 (P).
    (c) Intrastate motor passenger applications under 49 U.S.C. 
10922(c)(2)(A) as described in Form OP-1, Schedule B.
    (d) Motor common carrier of household goods applications, including 
Mexican carrier applicants. These applications require a finding that:
    (1) The applicant is fit, willing, and able to provide the involved 
transportation and to comply with all applicable statutory and 
regulatory provisions; and
    (2) The service proposed will serve a useful public purpose, 
responsive to a public demand or need.
    (e) Motor contract carrier of household goods, water contract 
carrier, household goods property broker, and household goods freight 
forwarder applications. These applications require a finding that:
    (1) The applicant is fit, willing, and able to provide the involved 
transportation and to comply with all applicable statutory and 
regulatory provisions; and
    (2) The transportation to be provided will be consistent with the 
public interest and the national transportation policy of 49 U.S.C. 
10101.
    (f) Water common carrier applications. These applications require a 
finding that:
    (1) The applicant is fit, willing, and able to provide the involved 
transportation and to comply with all applicable statutory and 
regulatory provisions; and
    (2) The transportation to be provided is or will be required by 
present or future public convenience and necessity.
    (g) Temporary authority (TA) for motor and water carriers. These 
applications require a finding that there is or soon will be an 
immediate transportation need that cannot be met by existing carrier 
service.


[[Page 405]]


    Note: In view of the expedited time frames established in this part 
for processing requests for permanent authority, applications for TA 
will be entertained only in exceptional circumstances (i.e., natural 
disasters or national emergencies) when evidence of immediate service 
need can be specifically documented in a narrative supplement appended 
to Form OP-1 for motor property carriers, Form OP-1MX for Mexican 
property carriers, Form OP-1(P) for motor passenger carriers, and Form 
OP-1(W) for water carriers. TA applications must be filed with the 
Regional Office which has jurisdiction over the area in which 
applicant's headquarters are located. Initial determinations of TA 
applications will be made by a Regional Motor Carrier Board.

    Source: 47 FR 49590, Nov. 1, 1982, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1166.1  Applicability.

    The rules in this part provide special procedures by which water 
common carriers subject to the Commission's jurisdiction under 
subchapter III of chapter 105 of title 49 of the United States Code 
operating over a given waterway may extend their operations over newly

and necessity covering extended operations over a newly opened section 
of a waterway will be issued without proof of public convenience and 
necessity.

transportation of passengers or property over the portion of the 
waterway embraced in the application, and in no event later than the 
date on which the extended operations are instituted.

PART 1167--COMPENSATED INTERCORPORATE HAULING--Table of Contents

<R05>


Sec.
1167.1  Applicability.
1167.2  Notification.
1167.3  Change in participation.

    Authority: 49 U.S.C. 10321 and 10524; 5 U.S.C. 559.

    Source: 55 FR 11204, Mar. 27, 1990, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1167.1  Applicability.

    Compensated transportation service by a member of a corporate family 
for other members of the same family (Compensated Intercorporate Hauling 
or CIH) is exempt from Interstate Commerce Commission regulation if 
proper notice is given. To qualify for the exemption, the participants 
must be members of a corporate family in which the parent owns, either 
directly or indirectly, a 100 percent interest in the subsidiaries. 
However, no corporation operating chiefly as a for-hire carrier may use 
an affiliate operating under the exemption of 49 U.S.C.

[[Page 408]]

10524(b) to transport freight tendered to it as a carrier.


<R05>
Sec. 1167.2  Notification.

    (a) General requirements. The corporate parent seeking to initiate 
CIH must submit a Federal Register notice as follows:

    Notice of Intent to Engage in Compensated Intercorporate Hauling 
                               Operations

    This is to provide notice as required by 49 U.S.C. 10524(b)(1) that 
the named corporations intend to provide or use compensated 
intercorporate hauling operations as authorized in 49 U.S.C. 10524(b).
    1. Parent corporation and address of principal office:
    2. Wholly owned subsidiaries which will participate in the 
operations, and State(s) of incorporation:

    (b) Affidavit and declaration. The notice shall include the 
following affidavit and declaration (which need not be notarized) by a 
person legally qualified to act for the parent:

    I, ____________, affirm that ____________________ is a corporation 
which directly or indirectly owns a 100 percent interest in the 
subsidiaries participating in compensated intercorporate hauling under 
49 U.S.C. 10524(b), listed in the attached notice.
    I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United 
States that the foregoing is true.
_______________________________________________________________________
    (Signature and date)

    (c) To whom notice sent. The original and one copy of the notice of 
intent to engage in CIH shall be sent to the Commission in an envelope 
marked: ``CIH Notice.'' The Secretary's Office will issue an 
acknowledgment indicating whether the submission is in order, and giving 
a projected publication date. CIH operations may commence as soon as the 
required notice is placed in the mails or, if hand-delivered, upon 
receipt at the Commission's office.
    (d) Cover letter requirement. Where the office that has prepared a 
notice for a corporate family differs from the one executing the notice, 
that office shall be identified in a cover letter attached to the 
tendered notice.
    (e) Miscellaneous. The filing of a CIH notice does not initiate a 
proceeding before the Commission. Publication of a notice is a 
ministerial function and does not indicate Commission investigation or 
affirmation of the representations appearing in the notice concerning 
corporate affiliation nor does it create a right of protest.
    (f) Fees. All required filings shall include the appropriate fee. 
See 49 CFR part 1002.

[55 FR 11204, Mar. 27, 1990, as amended at 55 FR 47338, Nov. 13, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 1167.3  Change in participation.

    (a) If the parent intends that an additional subsidiary participate 
in CIH, it shall file an updated notice.
    (b) Whenever the corporate parent's interest in a subsidiary 
participating in CIH becomes less than 100 percent, operations under 49 
U.S.C. 10524(b) by or for that subsidiary shall be discontinued and the 
parent shall file an updated notice within 10 days.
    (c) Updated notices shall be submitted in the format required by 
Sec. 1167.3(a), and will be published in the Federal Register.
    (d) An updated notice need not be filed where an action by a 
corporate family affects the status of a member participating in CIH, 
but the scope of the operations remains unchanged--e.g., absorption of a 
subsidiary into a parent resulting in extinction of its separate 
corporate status. However, name changes require an updated notice.

specified operations provided that applicant has demonstrated compliance 
with 49 CFR 1044 (designation of process agent). If applicant has not 
complied with this requirement, the Commission will issue a notice 
stating that a certificate of registration will be issued upon such 
compliance. No certificate of registration shall be issued prior to 
compliance.
    (c) If the Department of Transportation intervenes under 49 CFR 
1171.3(d), the proceeding will be decided by the Commission. If the 
Commission grants all or part of the application, it will issue a 
certificate in accordance with the procedure described in 49 CFR 
1171.6(b)(2).

assessed only one fee. A lease and agreement (Philadelphia Plan) shall 
be similarly treated.
    (d) Be accompanied by a letter of transmittal requesting the 
recording of the document. For a sample of a letter, see Sec. 1177.4 
Documents submitted concurrently under the same recordation number may 
be included in a single transmittal letter. Otherwise, each document

vessels; type of equipment; description as contained in the United 
States Coast Guard certificate of enrollment; number of each type of 
equipment; and any identifying marks such as the name or initial of the 
lessee, mortgagee, or vendee.
    (5) Parties to the agreement, as follows:
    (i) Conditional sale-vendor, purchaser, guarantor.
    (ii) Mortgage--mortgagor, mortgagee, guarantor.

[[Page 414]]

    (iii) Equipment Trust--vendor, trustee, lessor, lessee, guarantor of 
lease.
    (iv) Lease--lessee, lessor, guarantor.

    (7) The amount of the enclosed fee.
    (8) A short summary (1 or 2 sentences) of the type of document and a 
very brief description of the equipment and identifying numbers. This 
summary will be entered into the index as an aid to researching the 
encumbrances to title. (For a sample of a summary, see Sec. 1177.4).
    (9) The letter must be signed by an executive officer of one of the 
parties having knowledge of the matters described in the letter, or 
their attorney or representative in fact.

    Note: If the document is a mortgage or deed of trust which contains 
a ``hereafter acquired'' or similar clause, the following statement may 
be included in the letter of transmittal in lieu of the equipment 
description above:

    ``Included in the property covered by the aforesaid mortgage (or 
deed of trust) are (here identify generally the equipment such as 
``barges, tow boats, or other vessels, railroad cars, locomotives and 
other rolling stock'') intended for use related to interstate commerce, 
or interests therein, owned by (name of mortgagor) at the date of said 
mortgage or thereafter acquired by it or its successors as owners of the 
water carriers or the lines of railway covered by the mortgage.''

When such a mortgage or deed of trust is filed, it is not necessary to 
refile the document whenever additional rolling stock is acquired in 
order to perfect the lien of the document upon the addition of vessels 
or rolling stock.

Sec. 1177.5  Administrative procedure.

    (a) At the time of filing of a document with the Commission for 
recordation, a consecutive number will be stamped upon the original 
document and upon the copies or the counterparts, with the date and hour 
of the filing. A notation acknowledging that the document has been filed 
pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 11303 will be made. The original document, along 
with the notation, will be returned to the party named in the 
transmittal letter and a copy or counterpart will be retained by the 
Commission. For a secondary document, the number assigned will be the 
recordation number of the primary document plus the next available 
letter suffix.
    (b) The Commission will maintain an index for public use as required 
by 49 U.S.C 11303(b). There will be an index of parties to documents 
recorded at the Commission in alphabetical order by the party's name. If 
requested by the letter of transmittal, this index will also be amended 
to reflect an assignment under the name of the party other than the 
assignor or assignee to the document. There will also be an index of 
documents by number, which will list secondary documents referenced to 
the primary ones. The indexes will contain the pertinent information 
furnished by the parties in the transmittal letter.
    (c) The Commission cannot judge the validity of documents, nor judge 
the status of encumbrances to property as reflected by documents 
recorded at the Commission. The public is welcome to research the 
records or use an agent or attorney to do so, provided that Commission 
rules concerning handling of the documents are respected.
    (d) The public should note that filing documents with the Commission 
is discretionary and encumbrances exist which are not on file with the 
Commission.

Sec. 1180.0  Scope and purpose.

    These regulations set out the information to be filed and the 
procedures to be followed in control, merger, acquisition, lease, 
trackage rights, and any other consolidation transaction involving more 
than one railroad that is initiated under 49 U.S.C. 11343. Section 
1180.2 separates these transactions into four types: Major, significant, 
minor, and

[[Page 416]]

exempt. The informational requirements for these types of transactions 
differ. Before an application is filed, the designation of type of 
transaction may be clarified or certain of the information required may 
be waived upon petition to the Commission. This procedure is explained 
in Sec. 1180.4. The required contents of an application are set out in 
Secs. 1180.6 (general information supporting the transaction), 1180.7 
(competitive and market information), 1180.8 (operational information) 
and 1180.9 (financial data). A major application must contain the 
information required in Secs. 1180.6(a), 1180.6(b), 1180.7, 1180.8(a), 
and 1180.9. A significant application must contain the information 
required in Secs. 1180.6(a), 1180.6(c), 1180.7, and 1180.8(a). A minor 
application must contain the information required in Secs. 1180.6(a) and 
1180.8(b). Procedures (including time limits, filing requirements, 
participation requirements, and other matters) are contained in 
Sec. 1180.4. Index I lists all exhibits and indicates the type of 
application for which the exhibit is required. Index II is a table of 
contents of this subpart. All applicants must comply with the 
Commission's Rules of General Applicability, 49 CFR parts 1100-1129, 
unless otherwise specified. These regulations may be cited as the

Sec. 1180.1  General policy statement for merger or control of at least two Class I railroads.

    (a) General. The Interstate Commerce Commission encourages private 
industry initiative that leads to the rationalization of the nation's 
rail facilities and reduction of its excess capacity. One means of 
accomplishing these ends is rail consolidation. However, the Commission 
does not favor consolidations through the exercise of managerial and 
financial control if the controlling entity does not assume full 
responsibility for carrying out the controlled carrier's common carrier 
obligation to provide adequate service upon reasonable demand. 
Furthermore, the Commission does not favor consolidations that 
substantially reduce the transport alternatives available to shippers 
unless there are substantial and demonstrable benefits to the 
transaction that cannot be achieved in a less anticompetitive fashion. 
Our analysis of the competitive impacts of a consolidation is especially 
critical in light of the Congressionally mandated commitment to give 
railroads greater freedom to price without regulatory interference.
    (b) Consolidation criteria. The Commission's consideration of the 
merger or control of at least two class I railroads is governed by the 
criteria prescribed in 49 U.S.C. 11344 and by the rail transportation 
policy set forth in 49 U.S.C. 10101a.
    (1) Section 11344 directs the Commission to approve consolidations 
which are consistent with the public interest. In examining a proposed 
transaction, the Commission must consider, at a minimum:
    (i) The effect on the adequacy of transportation to the public;
    (ii) The effect of including, or failing to include, other rail 
carriers in the area involved in the proposed transaction;
    (iii) The total fixed charges that would result;
    (iv) The interest of affected carrier employees; and
    (v) The effect on competition among rail carriers in the affected 
region.
    (2) The Commission must also consider the impact of any transaction 
on the quality of the human environment and the conservation of energy 
resources.
    (c) Public interest considerations. In determining whether a 
transaction is in the public interest, the Commission performs a 
balancing test. It weighs the potential benefits to applicants and the 
public against the potential harm to the public. The Commission will 
consider whether the benefits claimed by applicants could be realized by 
means other than the proposed consolidation that would result in less 
potential harm to the public.
    (1) Potential benefits. Both the consolidated carrier and the public 
can benefit from a consolidation if the result is a financially sound 
competitor better able to provide adequate service on demand. This 
beneficial result can

[[Page 417]]

occur if the consolidated carrier is able to realize operating 
efficiencies and increased marketing opportunities. Since consolidations 
can lead to a reduction in redundant facilities and thereby to an 
increase in traffic density on underused lines, operating efficiencies 
may be realized. Furthermore, consolidations are the only feasible way 
for rail carriers to enter many new markets other than by contractual 
arrangement, such as for joint use of rail facilities or run-through 
trains. In some markets where there is sufficient existing rail capacity 
the construction of new rail line is prohibitively expensive and does 
not represent a feasible means of entry into the market.
    (2) Potential harm. There are two potential results from 
consolidations which would ill serve the public--reduction of 
competition and harm to essential services. In analyzing these impacts, 
we must consider, but are not limited by, the policies embodied in 
antitrust laws.
    (i) Reduction of competition. If two carriers serving the same 
market consolidate, the result would be the elimination of the 
competition between the two. Even if the consolidating carriers do not 
serve the same market, there may be a lessening of potential competition 
in other markets. While the reduction in the number of competitors 
serving a market is not in itself harmful, a lessening of competition 
resulting from the elimination of a competitor may be contrary to the 
public interest. The Commission recognizes that rail carriers face not 
only intramodal competition, but also intermodal competition from motor 
and water carriers. The Commission's competitive analysis depends on the 
relevant market(s). In some markets the Commission's focus will be on 
the preservation of effective intermodal competition, while in other 
markets (such as long-haul movements of bulk commodities) effective 
intramodal competition may also be important.
    (ii) Harm to essential service. Consolidations often result in 
shifts of market patterns. Sometimes the carrier losing its share of the 
market may not be able to withstand the loss of traffic. In assessing 
the probable impacts, the Commission's concern is the preservation of 
essential services, not the survival of particular carriers. A service 
is essential if there is a sufficient public need for the service and 
adequate alternative transportation is not available.
    (d) Conditions. (1) The Commission has broad authority to impose 
conditions on consolidations, including those that might be useful in 
ameliorating potential anticompetitive effects of a consolidation. 
However, the Commission recognizes that conditions may lessen the 
benefits of a consolidation to both the carrier and the public. 
Therefore, the Commission will not normally impose conditions on a 
consolidation to protect a carrier unless essential services are 
affected and the condition: (i) Is shown to be related to the impact of 
the consolidation; (ii) is designed to enable shippers to receive 
adequate service; (iii) would not pose unreasonable operating or other 
problems for the consolidated carrier; and (iv) would not frustrate the 
ability of the consolidated carrier to obtain the anticipated public 
benefits. Moreover, the Commission believes that indemnification is 
ordinarily not an appropriate remedy in consolidation proceedings. 
Indemnification conditions can be anticompetitive by requiring the 
consolidated carrier to subsidize carriers who are no longer able to 
compete efficiently in the marketplace.
    (2) As of July 1, 1982, Conditions previously imposed are revoked 
unless the parties to specific consolidation proceedings demonstrate a 
public interest in continuing the Conditions in those proceedings.
    (e) Inclusion of other carriers. The Commission will consider 
requiring inclusion of another carrier as a condition to approval only 
where there is no other reasonable alternative for providing essential 
services, the facilities fit operationally into the new system, and 
inclusion can be accomplished without endangering the operational or 
financial success of the new company.
    (f) Labor protection. The Commission is required to provide 
applicants' employees affected by a consolidation with adequate 
protection. Similarly situated employees on the applicants' system 
should be given equal protection. Therefore, absent a negotiated

[[Page 418]]

agreement, the Commission will provide for protection at the level 
mandated by law (49 U.S.C. 11347), unless it can be shown that because 
of unusual circumstances more stringent protection is necessary to 
provide employees with a fair and equitable arrangement. The Commission 
will review negotiated agreements to assure fair and equitable treatment 
of affected employees.
    (g) Cumulative impacts and crossover effects. The Commission 
recognizes that events can occur during its consideration of a 
consolidation that can have an effect on various of the concerned 
parties. However, the Commission is mindful of the need to meet its 
statutory deadlines and make timely administratively final decisions. 
Therefore, the Commission will not reopen pending proceedings in order 
to assess the impact of potential or hypothetical combinations or 
transactions. The proper forum for considering cumulative impacts and 
crossover effects is in a later proceeding. In this manner, 
consideration will be limited to the impacts of transactions which have 
already been approved and are, therefore, reasonably certain to occur. 
Furthermore, the Commission will have the benefit of its findings from 
the prior proceeding to identify more precisely the impacts of that 
transaction. Proceedings will remain manageable in scope and size, 
statutory time limits will be met, and all parties will be assured of 
timely, administratively final decisions.
    (h) Public participation. To assure a fully developed record on the 
impacts of a proposed railroad consolidation, the Commission encourages 
public participation from Federal, State, and local government 
departments and agencies, affected shippers and carriers, and other 
interested persons.

Sec. 1180.2  Types of transactions.

    Transactions proposed under 49 U.S.C. 11343 involving more than one 
common carrier by railroad are of four types: Major, significant, minor, 
and exempt.
    (a) A major transaction is a control or merger involving two or more 
class I railroads.
    (b) A significant transaction is a transaction not involving the 
control or merger of two or more class I railroads that is of regional 
or national transportation significance as that phrase is used in 49 
U.S.C. 11345(a)(2) and (c). A transaction not involving the control or 
merger of two or more class I railroads is not significant if a 
determination can be made either:
    (1) That the transaction clearly will not have any anticompetitive 
effects, or
    (2) That any anticompetitive effects of the transaction will clearly 
be outweighed by the transaction's anticipated contribution to the 
public interest in meeting significant transportation needs.
    A transaction not involving the control or merger of two or more 
class I railroads is significant if neither such determination can 
clearly be made.
    (c) A minor transaction is one which involves more than one railroad 
and which is not a major, significant, or exempt transaction.
    (d) A transaction is exempt if it is within one of the seven 
categories described below. The Commission has found that its prior 
review and approval of these transactions is not necessary to carry out 
the rail transportation policy of 49 U.S.C. 10101a; and is of limited 
scope or unnecessary to protect shippers from market abuse. See 49 
U.S.C. 10505. A notice must be filed to use one of these class 
exemptions. The procedures are set out in Sec. 1180.4(g). These class 
exemptions do not relieve a carrier of its statutory obligation to 
protect the interests of employees. See 49 U.S.C. 10505(g)(2) and 11347. 
The enumeration of the following categories of transactions as exempt 
does not preclude a carrier from seeking an exemption of specific 
transactions not falling into these categories.
    (1) Acquisition of a line of railroad which would not constitute a 
major market extension where the Commission has found that the public 
convenience and necessity permit abandonment.
    (2) Acquisition or continuance in control of a nonconnecting carrier 
or one

[[Page 419]]

of its lines where (i) the railroads would not connect with each other 
or any railroads in their corporate family, (ii) the acquisition or 
continuance in control is not part of a series of anticipated 
transactions that would connect the railroads with each other or any 
railroad in their corporate family, and (iii) the transaction does not 
involve a class I carrier.
    (3) Transactions within a corporate family that do not result in 
adverse changes in service levels, significant operational changes, or a 
change in the competitive balance with carriers outside the corporate 
family.
    (4) Renewal of leases and any other matters where the Commission has 
previously authorized the transaction, and only an extension in time is 
involved.
    (5) Joint projects involving the relocation of a line of railroad 
which does not disrupt service to shippers.
    (6) Reincorporation in a different State.
    (7) Acquisition of trackage rights and renewal of trackage rights by 
a rail carrier over lines owned or operated by any other rail carrier or 
carriers that are: (i) based on written agreements, and (ii) not filed 
or sought in responsive applications in rail consolidation proceedings.

Sec. 1180.3  Definitions.

    (a) Applicant. The parties initiating a transaction. Parties who are 
considered applicants, but for whom the information normally required of 
an applicant need not be submitted, are (1) in minor trackage rights 
applications, the transferor and (2) in responsive applications, a 
primary applicant.
    (b) Applicant carriers. Applicant, all carriers related to the 
applicant, and all other carriers involved in the transaction. This does 
not include carriers who are involved in an existing trackage rights 
agreement with applicants.
    (c) Major market extension. A major market extension is a 
transaction which may significantly increase competition by extending 
service into a new market, expanding service in a currently served 
market when another carrier concurrently contracts its service to that 
market as part of the same transaction, or providing significantly more 
efficient and effective competitive service to a market presently being 
served. Criteria which can be used to determine if a railroad is 
proposing to provide a more competitive service to a currently served 
area include: (1) Creating a shorter route; (2) providing enhanced 
service capabilities (speed is not the only factor); (3) entering an 
interchange or market generating more than 5,000 cars per year or 5 
percent of applicant's traffic; (4) filing the application as a 
condition of relief to a pending proceeding; and (5) permitting a 
carrier to become more competitive (extending its length of haul) See. 
Burlington Northern, Inc.--Control & Merger--St. L., 354 I.C.C. 616, 617 
(1978).
    (d) Petition for clarification. A request that the Commission 
clarify the applicability of any part of these regulations to a 
particular situation or explain the type of material needed to comply 
with these regulations.
    (e) Petition for waiver. A request that the Commission either 
dispense with material required by the regulations, or accept material 
in place of that required by these regulations.
    (f) Primary application. A proposal for approval filed under 49 
U.S.C. 11343 which begins a new proceeding and is not proposed either as 
a condition to or as an alternative to Commission approval of another 
pending application.
    (g) Railroad. Any common carrier by railroad as defined in 49 U.S.C. 
10102(18)-(19).
    (h) Responsive applications. Applications filed in response to a 
primary application seeking affirmative relief either as a condition to 
or in lieu of the approval of the primary application. Responsive 
applications include inconsistent applications, inclusion applications, 
and any other affirmative relief that requires an application to be 
filed with the Commission (such as trackage rights, purchases, 
construction, operation, pooling, terminal operations, abandonment, 
etc.).
    (i) Transferee. The transferee is:
    (1) The acquiring corporation in a control proceeding,

[[Page 420]]

    (2) The surviving corporation in a merger,
    (3) The resulting corporation in a consolidation,
    (4) The leasee in a lease,
    (5) The purchaser in an acquisition, and
    (6) The grantee of trackage rights in a trackage rights proceeding.
    (j) Transferor. The transferor is:
    (1) The corporation acquired in a control proceeding,

    (b) Prefiling notification. (1) Between 3 to 6 months prior to the 
proposed filing of an application in a major transaction, and 2 to 4 
months prior to the proposed filing of an application in a significant 
transaction, applicant shall file a notice with the Commission. The 
notice shall:
    (i) Briefly describe the transaction,
    (ii) Indicate the year to be used for the impact analyses,
    (iii) Indicate the approximate filing date of the application, and
    (iv) Indicate why the transaction is major or significant.
    (2) The Commission will publish a notice in the Federal Register 
within 30 days of receipt of the applicant's notice. The publication 
shall contain:
    (i) A brief description of the transaction,
    (ii) The year to be used for the impact analysis,
    (iii) The approximate filing date,
    (iv) A determination that the transaction is major, significant, or 
minor, and
    (v) A statement of any additional information which must be filed 
with the application in order for the application to be considered 
complete.
    (3) A prefiling notice may be amended to indicate a change in the 
anticipated filing date.
    (c) Application. (1) The fees for filing applications or notices 
under these procedures are set forth in 49 CFR 1002.2. There is no 
filing fee for a directly related application filed by a party that 
filed the primary application.
    (2) Filing requirements.
    (i) The original of all applications shall be signed in ink by the 
applicant, if an individual; by all partners, if a partnership; and if a 
corporation, association, or other similar form of organization, by its 
president, or such other executive officer having knowledge of the 
matters therein contained and duly designated for that purpose by the 
applicant. Applications shall be made under oath and shall contain an 
appropriate certification (if a corporation, by its secretary) showing 
that the affiant is duly authorized to verify and file the application. 
Any person controlling an applicant shall also sign the application.
    (ii) The application shall be filed with Secretary, Interstate 
Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423.
    (iii) Each copy of the application shall conform in all respects to 
the original and shall be complete in itself except that the signature 
in the copies may be stamped or typed and the notarial seal may be 
omitted. In like manner, where certified copies of documents are filed 
with the application,

[[Page 421]]

conformed copies thereof, showing certification in stamped or 
typewritten form, will be sufficient to accompany the additional copies 
of the application.
    (iv) All applications required to be filed with the Commission or 
served on designated persons shall include all exhibits, except as 
otherwise specifically noted. Information from other documents may be 
incorporated by reference in the application. However, the documents 
must have been filed with the Commission within three years prior to 
filing of the application, the information must be up to date, and 
applicant must be prepared to supply copies of this information to 
interested persons on specific request.
    (v) The applicant shall submit such additional information to 
support its application as the Commission may require.
    (vi) Applicant shall file concurrently all directly related 
applications, e.g., those seeking authority to construct or abandon rail 
lines, to issue securities, control motor carriers, obtain terminal 
operations, acquire trackage rights, et cetera.
    (vii) The application shall contain a certificate of service 
indicating that all persons designated in Sec. 1180.4(c)(5) have been 
served with a copy of the application.
    (3) In a major or significant transaction, and in all responsive 
applications, all of the direct testimony of applicants, in the form of 
verified statements, shall be filed and served with each application.
    (4) The application and all exhibits shall be considered part of the 
evidentiary record upon acceptance. Any portion of an application and 
exhibits will remain subject to motions to strike. However, no motion 
need be made to have the application and exhibits admitted to the 
evidentiary record. If a major or significant transaction is designated 
for oral hearing the presiding Administrative Law Judge shall have 
discretion in extraordinary circumstances to allow for the presentation 
of oral or written direct testimony not previously submitted with the 
application.
    (5) Service. The applicant shall serve a conformed copy of an 
application filed under these procedures by first-class mail upon:
    (i) The Governor (or Executive Officer), Public Service Commission, 
and the Department of Transportation of each State in which any part of 
the properties of the applicant carriers involved in the proposed 
transaction is situated;
    (ii) The Secretary of the United States Department of Transportation 
(Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel, Federal Railroad Administration, 
Room 5101, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590).
    (iii) The Attorney General of the United States;
    (iv) The Federal Trade Commission; and
    (v) In major or significant transactions, all persons requesting a 
copy after the prefiling notice is published in the Federal Register.

sequence as the information is requested in these procedures, and shall 
be numbered to correspond to the numbering in the procedures.
    (ii) If any material required in the application would lend itself 
to being placed in an appendix, this should be done. The appendix and 
application shall be tabulated and cross-referenced in an index for ease 
in locating and referring to the information. The appendixes shall be in 
the same sequence as the information required by these procedures. If 
certain information required in the application is not applicable, 
provide an explanation. The application should be bound, and it may be 
bound in more than one volume. If an application is more than one 
volume, the cover of each volume should be in a different color. The 
pages in each volume shall begin with 1, and be sequentially numbered.
    (iii) The Commission's Office of the Secretary will provide informal 
opinions and interpretations, which are not binding on the Commission, 
regarding the format of or information to be included in the 
application.
    (iv) All filing, service, or other requirements of these procedures 
must be complied with when filing the application. Copies of the 
application filed with the Commission shall be marked

[[Page 422]]

in red ``Railroad Consolidation Application'' on the transmittal 
envelope or package.
    (v) The application shall conform to the typographical 
specifications of Sec. 1104.2.
    (7) Acceptance or rejection of an application.
    (i) The Commission shall accept a complete application no later than 
30 days after the application is filed with the Commission by publishing 
a notice in the Federal Register. A complete application contains all 
information for all applicant carriers required by these procedures, 
except as modified by advance waiver. The publication shall indicate the 
applicable time limits for processing the application. (These are the 
time limits of 49 U.S.C. 11345(b) for a major transaction, 49 U.S.C. 
11345(c) for a significant transaction, and 49 U.S.C. 11345(d) for a 
minor transaction.)
    (ii) The Commission shall reject an incomplete application by 
serving a decision no later than 30 days after the application is filed 
with the Commission. The decision shall explain specifically why the 
application was incomplete. A revised application may be submitted, 
incorporating portions of the prior application by reference. The 
resubmission or refiling of an application shall be considered a de novo 
filing for the purpose of computation of the time periods, provided that 
the resubmitted application is accepted as complete.
    (8) The application must present a prima facie case. Applicants can 
fail to meet their burden of proof and thus not present a prima facie 
case either by (i) disclosing facts that, even if construed in their 
most favorable light, are insufficient to support a finding that the 
proposal is consistent with the public interest, or by (ii) disclosing 
facts that affirmatively demonstrate that the proposal is not in the 
public interest. See Ex Parte No. 282 (Sub-No. 3A), Railroad 
Consolidation Procedures Expedited Processing, 363 I.C.C. 767 (1980).
    (d) Response to application. (1) Written comments.
    (i) Time to file. (A) Written comments on a major transaction must 
be filed no later than 45 days after an application is accepted.
    (B) Written comments on significant or minor transactions must be 
filed within 30 days of the application's acceptance.
    (ii) Service. Written comments shall be concurrently served by 
first-class mail on:
    (A) The applicants (at each address given in the application),
    (B) The United States Secretary of Transportation,
    (C) The Attorney General of the United States, and
    (D) All parties of record within 10 days of service of the service 
list by the Commission.
    (iii) Contents. Written comments must contain:
    (A) The docket number and title of the proceeding.
    (B) The name, address, and telephone number of the commenting party 
and its representative upon whom service shall be made.
    (C) The commenting party's position (in support, opposition, or 
undetermined).
    (D) If the commenting party intends to participate formally in a 
proceeding or merely comment upon the proposal.
    (E) If desired, a request for an oral hearing with reasons 
supporting this request. The request must indicate the disputed material 
facts that can only be resolved at a hearing.
    (F) A list of all information sought to be discovered from applicant 
carriers.
    (G) A detailed statement of the issues in major and significant 
transactions reflecting the relevant underlying statutory criteria, 
policy statement (for major transactions), and antitrust policy which 
the Commission must consider in the proceeding.
    (H) An initial list of specific protective conditions sought by 
nonrailroads in major and significant transactions.
    (I) The following information by railroads filing written comments 
in major, and significant transactions:
    (1) Any existing preferential solicitation agreements.
    (2) A list of all run-through train operations.
    (3) An initial list of specific protective conditions sought and a 
statement concerning whether the commenting railroad intends to file 
responsive applications, along with a description of

[[Page 423]]

the proposed transactions. This will be considered a prefiling notice 
without which the Commission will not entertain responsive applications.
    (iv) Party. All persons who file timely written comments shall be a 
party of record if they so indicate in their comments. In this event, no 
petition for leave to intervene need be filed.
    (2) The Secretary of Transportation and Attorney General of the 
United States shall file written comments with the Commission within 60 
days of the date of acceptance of the application in a major 
transaction. For significant and minor transactions these comments are 
due within 45 days of the date of acceptance of the application. These 
comments shall comply with paragraphs (d)(1)(ii) and (d)(1)(iii) of this 
section as to service and contents.
    (3) A second list of protective conditions shall be filed with the 
Commission within 75 days of acceptance of the application in a major 
transaction, and within 60 days of acceptance of the application in a 
significant transaction. It shall be concurrently served by first-class 
mail on all parties of record. The second list of protective conditions 
shall modify the first list based upon changing conditions, such as 
protective conditions sought by other parties to the proceeding. Parties 
to the proceeding shall not be permitted to seek any protective 
conditions not contained in the second list of protective conditions. 
This does not preclude refinements in conditions sought, particularly 
when stipulations to conditions are reached.
    (4) Responsive applications.
    (i) All responsive applications in major transactions shall be filed 
90 days, and in significant transactions 60 days, after acceptance of 
the primary application. No responsive applications shall be permitted 
to minor transactions.
    (ii) Responsive applications which are not major are presumed to be 
significant transactions.
    (iii) Responsive applications shall comply as fully as possible with 
appropriate Commission regulations. Extensions of time for filing are 
not permitted. The filing of an incomplete application, coupled with an 
extension of time to complete the application, may be permitted if 
authorized by the Commission in advance.
    (iv) Any petitions for waiver, clarification, extension of time, or 
for leave to file an incomplete application, or to rebut the presumption 
of a significant transaction, must be filed in advance of the filing of 
the responsive application (at least 45 days in advance in major 
transactions and 30 days in significant transactions).
    (v) Each responsive application filed and accepted (if required) is 
considered consolidated with the primary application.
    (e) Evidentiary proceeding. (1) The Commission may order an oral 
public hearing, a hearing by written submissions, or another kind of 
evidentiary proceeding. The determination will generally be made on the 
basis of the needs indicated by the written comments.
    (2) The evidentiary proceeding will be completed:
    (i) In 24 months (after the primary application is accepted) for a 
major transaction,
    (ii) In 180 days for a significant transaction, and
    (iii) In 105 days for a minor transaction;
    (3) A final decision on the primary application and on all 
consolidated cases will be issued;
    (i) In 180 days (after the conclusion of the evidentiary proceeding) 
for a major transaction,
    (ii) In 90 days for a significant transaction, and
    (iii) In 45 days for a minor transaction.
    (4) The Secretary of Transportation may propose modifications to any

U.S.C. 10901, and 49 CFR part 1175, for securities.
    (2)(i) To qualify for an exemption under Sec. 1180.2(d)(7) 
(acquisition or renewal of trackage rights agreements), in addition to 
the notice, the railroad must file a caption summary suitable for 
publication in the Federal Register. The caption summary must be in the 
following form:

                     Interstate Commerce Commission

                           Notice of Exemption

                           Finance Docket No.

    (1)--Trackage Rights--(2)
    (2) (3) to grant (4) trackage rights to (1) between (5). The 
trackage rights will be effective on (6).
    This notice is filed under Sec. 1180.2(d)(7). Petitions to revoke 
the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The 
filing of a petition to revoke will not stay the transaction.
    Dated:
    By the Commission.
James H. Bayne,
Secretary.

    The following key identifies the information symbolized in the 
summary.
    (1) Name of the tenant railroad.
    (2) Name of the landlord railroad.

applicants shall submit analyses of the impacts of the proposed 
transaction--both adverse and beneficial--on inter- and intramodal 
competition for freight surface transportation in the regions affected 
by the transaction and on the provision of essential services by 
applicants and other carriers. An impact analysis should include 
underlying data, a study of the implications of that data, and a 
description of the resulting likely effects of the transaction on 
transportation alternatives available to the shipping public. Each 
aspect of the analysis should specifically address significant impacts 
as they relate to the statutory criteria (49 U.S.C. 11344(b) or (d), 
essential services, and competition). The Commission may identify 
particular markets and issues that it believes warrant further study. If 
appropriate, the Commission will also indicate the format of such 
analyses. Applicants must address markets and issues identified by the 
Commission, but also any others they consider relevant. Specific 
regulations on impact analyses are not provided so that parties will 
have the greatest leeway to develop the best evidence on the impacts of 
each individual transaction. General guidelines follow:
    (a) Applicants shall prepare analyses of the anticipated effects of 
the transaction on traffic patterns, market concentrations, or 
transportation alternatives available to the shipping public.

[[Page 428]]

    (b) Applicants (and any other party submitting such analyses) must 
demonstrate both the relevancy of the market and issues analyzed and the 
validity of the methodology. All underlying assumptions must be clearly 
stated.
    (c) Supporting data may (but need not) include: Current and 
projected traffic flows; data underlying sales forecasts or marketing 
goals; interchange data; market share analysis; diversion studies; and/
or shipper surveys. It is important to note that these types of studies 
are neither limiting nor all inclusive. The parties must provide 
supporting data, but are free to choose the type(s) and format.
    (d) Analyses should reflect the consolidated company's marketing 
plan and existing and potential competitive alternatives (inter- as well 
intramodal). They can address:
    (1) City pairs, interregional movements, movements through a point, 
or other factors;
    (2) A particular commodity, group of commodities, or other commodity 
factor that will be significantly affected by the transaction; or
    (3) Other effects of the transaction (such as on a particular type 
of service offered).

described in the summary.
    (4) A description of the effect of any deferred maintenance or 
delayed capital improvements on any road or equipment properties 
involved, the schedule for eliminating such deferrals, details of 
general system rehabilitation including rehabilitation relating to the 
transaction (including proposed yard and terminal modifications), and 
how these activities will lead to the service improvements or operating 
economies anticipated from the transaction.
    (5) Density charts (exhibit 14). Gross ton-mile traffic density 
charts shall be filed for applicant carriers containing a map 
geographically showing those lines handling 1 million gross ton-miles 
per mile road or more per year and respective densities, expressed in 
gross ton-miles per year, in each direction, in segments of such lines 
between major freight yards and terminals, including major intramodal 
and intermodal interchange points, using the corporate or political 
subdivision name of the points shown as well as the railroad station 
name. The mileage of each segment of line shall be provided, and should 
be shown on the chart. Data shown in the density chart shall be for the 
latest available full calendar year preceding the filing of the

    Authority: 5 U.S.C. 553, and 49 U.S.C. 10321 and 10926.

    Source: 53 FR 4852, Feb. 18, 1988, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1181.0  Scope of rules.

    These rules define the procedures that enable motor passenger and 
property carriers, water carriers, property brokers, and household goods 
freight forwarders to obtain approval from the Interstate Commerce 
Commission to merge, transfer, or lease their operating rights in 
financial transactions not subject to 49 U.S.C. 11343. Transactions 
covered by these rules are governed by 49 U.S.C. 10321 and 10926. The 
filing fee is set forth at 49 CFR 1002.2(f)(25).


<R05>
Sec. 1181.1  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:
    (a) Transfer. Transfers include all transactions (i.e., the sale or 
lease of interstate operating rights,\1\ or the merger of two or more 
carriers or a carrier into a noncarrier) subject to 49 U.S.C. 10926, as 
well as the sale of property brokers' licenses under 49 U.S.C. 10321.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The execution of a chattel mortgage, deed of trust, or other 
similar document does not constitute a transfer or require the 
Commission's approval. However, a foreclosure for the purpose of 
transferring an operating right to satisfy a judgment or claim against 
the record holder may not be effected without approval of the 
Commission.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Operating rights. Operating rights include:
    (1) Certificates and permits issued to motor and water carriers;
    (2) Permits issued to household goods freight forwarders;
    (3) Licenses issued to property brokers; and
    (4) Certificates of Registration issued to motor carriers. The term 
also includes authority held by virtue of the gateway elimination 
regulations published in the Federal Register as letter-notices.
    (c) Certificate of registration. The evidence of a motor carrier's 
right to engage in interstate or foreign commerce within a single State 
is established by a corresponding State certificate.
    (d) Person. An individual, partnership, corporation, company, 
association, or other form of business, or a trustee, receiver, 
assignee, or personal representative of any of these.
    (e) Record holder. The person shown on the records of the Commission 
as the legal owner of the operating rights.
    (f) Control. A relationship between persons that includes actual 
control, legal control, and the power to exercise control, through or by 
common directors, officers, stockholders, a voting trust, a holding or 
investment company, or any other means.
    (g) Category 1 transfers. Transactions in which the person to whom 
the operating rights would be transferred is not an ICC carrier and is 
not affiliated with any ICC carrier.
    (h) Category 2 transfers. Transactions in which the person to whom 
the operating rights would be transferred is an ICC carrier and/or is 
affiliated with an ICC carrier.


<R05>
Sec. 1181.2  Applications.

    (a) Procedural requirements. (1) At least 10 days before 
consummation, an original and two copies of a properly completed Form 
OP-FC-1 and any attachments (see paragraph (b)(1)(viii) of this section) 
must be filed with the Office of the Secretary, Applications and Fees 
Unit, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. The original 
must show that an additional copy has been furnished to the Commission's 
Regional Director for the Region(s) in which the applicants' 
headquarters are located. The nonrefundable filing fee prescribed by 49 
CFR 1002.2(f)(25) must accompany the application.

[[Page 432]]

    (2) At any time after the expiration of the 10-day waiting period, 
applicants may consummate the transaction, subject to the subsequent 
approval of the application by the Commission, as described below. The 
transferee may commence operations under the rights acquired from the 
transferor upon its compliance with the Commission's regulations 
governing insurance, tariffs (if applicable), and process agents. See 49 
CFR parts 1043, 1312 and 1044, respectively. In addition, contract 
carriers must comply with the Commission's regulations concerning 
contracts at 49 CFR part 1053. In the alternative, applicants may wait 
until the Commission has issued a decision on their application before 
transferring the operating rights. If the transferee wants the 
transferor's operating authority to be reissued in its name, it should 
furnish the Commission with a statement executed by both transferor and 
transferee indicating that the transaction has been consummated. 
Authority will not be reissued until after the Commission has approved 
the transaction.
    (b) Information required. (1) In category 1 and category 2 
transfers, applicants must furnish the following information:
    (i) Full name, address, and signatures of the transferee and 
transferor.
    (ii) A copy of that portion of the transferor's operating authority 
involved in the transfer proceeding.
    (iii) A short summary of the essential terms of the transaction.
    (iv) If relevant, the status of proceedings for the transfer of 
State certificate(s) corresponding to the Certificates of Registration 
being transferred.
    (v) A statement as to whether the transfer will or will not 
significantly affect the quality of the human environment.
    (vi) Certification by transferor and transferee of their current 
respective safety ratings by the United States Department of 
Transportation (i.e., satisfactory, conditional, unsatisfactory, or 
unrated).
    (vii) Certification by the transferee that it has sufficient 
insurance coverage under 49 U.S.C. 10927 for the service it intends to 
provide.
    (viii) Information to demonstrate that the proposed transaction is 
consistent with the national transportation policy and satisfies the 
criteria for approval set forth at Sec. 1181.4 of this part. (Such 
information may be appended to the application form and, if provided, 
would be embraced by the oath and verification contained on that form.)
    (ix) If motor carrier operating rights are being transferred, 
certification by the transferee that it is not domiciled in Mexico nor 
owned or controlled by persons of that country.
    (2) Category 2 applicants must also submit the following additional 
information:
    (i) Name(s) of the carrier(s), if any, with which the transferee is 
affiliated.
    (ii) Aggregate revenues of the transferor, transferee, and their 
carrier affiliates from interstate transportation sources for a 1-year 
period ending not earlier than 6 months before the date of the agreement 
of the parties concerning the transaction. If revenues exceed $2 
million, the transfer may be subject to 49 U.S.C. 11343 rather than 
these rules.

[53 FR 4852, Feb. 18, 1988, as amended at 54 FR 35343, Aug. 25, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 1181.3  Notice.

    The Commission will give notice of approved transfer applications 
through publication in the ICC Register.


<R05>
Sec. 1181.4  Commission action and criteria for approval.

    A transfer will be approved under this section if:
    (a) The transaction is not subject to 49 U.S.C. 11343; and
    (b) The transaction is consistent with the public interest; however,
    (c) If the transferor or transferee has an ``Unsatisfactory'' safety 
fitness rating from DOT, the transfer may be denied. If an application 
is denied, the Commission will set forth the basis for its action in a 
decision or letter notice. If parties with ``Unsatisfactory'' safety 
fitness ratings consummate a transaction pursuant to the 10-day rule at 
Sec. 1181.2 of this part prior to the notification of Commission action, 
they do so at their own risk and subject to any conditions we may impose 
subsequently. Transactions that have been consummated but later are 
denied by

[[Page 433]]

the Commission are null and void and must be rescinded. Similarly, if 
applications contain false or misleading information, they are void ab 
initio.

[53 FR 4852, Feb. 18, 1988, as amended at 56 FR 46735, Sept. 16, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 1181.5  Responsive pleadings.

    (a) Protests must be filed within 20 days after the date of 
publication of an approved transfer application in the ICC Register. 
Protests received prior to the notice will be rejected. Applicants may 
respond within 20 days after the due date of protests. Petitions for 
reconsideration of decisions denying applications must be filed within 
20 days after the date of service of such decisions.
    (b) Protests and petitions for reconsideration must be filed with 
the Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce 
Commission, Washington, DC 20423, and be served on appropriate parties.


<R05>
Sec. 1181.6  Procedures for changing the name or business form of a motor or water carrier, household goods freight forwarder, or property broker.

    (a) Scope. These procedures (and not the transfer rules at 49 CFR 
parts 1181, 1182, 1183 and 1186) apply in the following circumstances:
    (1) A change in the form of a business, such as the incorporation of 
a partnership or sole proprietorship;
    (2) A change in the legal name of a corporation or partnership or 
change in the trade name or assumed name of any entity;
    (3) A transfer of operating rights from a deceased or incapacitated 
spouse to the other spouse;
    (4) A reincorporation and merger for the purpose of effecting a name 
change;
    (5) An amalgamation or consolidation of a carrier and a noncarrier 
into a new carrier having a different name from either of the 
predecessor entities; and
    (6) A change in the State of incorporation accomplished by 
dissolving the corporation in one State and reincorporating in another 
State.
    (b) Procedures. To accomplish these changes, a letter must be sent 
to the Office of the Secretary, Applications and Fees Unit, Interstate 
Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. The envelope should be marked 
``NAME CHANGE''. The applicant must provide:
    (1) The docket number(s) and name of the carrier requesting the 
change;
    (2) A copy of the articles of incorporation and the State 
certificate reflecting the incorporation;
    (3) The name(s) of the owner(s) of the stock and the distribution of 
the shares;
    (4) The names of the officers and directors of the corporation; and
    (5) A statement that there is no change in the ownership, 
management, or control of the business. When this procedure is being 
used to transfer operating rights from a deceased or incapacitated 
spouse to the other spouse, documentation that the other spouse has the 
legal right to effect such change must be included with the request. The 
fee for filing a name change request is in 49 CFR 1002.2(f)(11).

    The request must demonstrate that this procedure is necessary to 
resolve the specific issues giving rise to the request. If the 
Commission finds, whether on its own motion or that of a party, that the 
record requires supplementation, a decision will be issued indicating 
the additional information required and the time frames within such 
information must be submitted.


<R05>

    The following findings are made for applications to consolidate, 
purchase, merge, lease operating rights and properties, or acquire 
control of motor passenger carriers or water carriers under 49 U.S.C. 
11343-11344:

    We find, with the exception of those applications involving 
impediments (e.g., jurisdictional problems, unresolved fitness 
questions, or questions involving possible unlawful control) that each 
applicant has demonstrated, in accordance with the applicable provisions 
of 49 U.S.C. 11321, 11343, 11344, and 11349, and with the Commission's 
rules and regulations, that the proposed transaction should be 
authorized as stated. This finding shall not be deemed to exist where 
the application is opposed. Except where specifically noted, this 
decision is neither a major Federal action significantly affecting the 
quality of the human environment nor a major regulatory action under the 
Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975.

Sec. 1184.1  Scope and purpose.

    This statement of policy on motor carrier pooling applications 
implements section 20 of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 [Pub. L. No. 96-
296, 94 Stat. 793]. The Act's provisions are now contained at 49 U.S.C. 
11342(b).


<R05>
Sec. 1184.2  Contents of a pooling application.

    A pooling application filed under 49 U.S.C. 11342(b) should include 
the following information:
    (a) An identification of all the carriers who are parties to the 
pooling agreement;
    (b) A general description of the transaction;
    (c) A specific description of the operating authorities sought to be 
pooled;
    (d) The basis to establish that the agreement is a genuine pooling 
arrangement (as opposed to a lease or interline arrangement);
    (e) A description of what applicants consider to be the relevant 
transportation markets affected by the proposed agreement;
    (f) The competitive routing and service alternatives that would 
remain if

[[Page 438]]

the agreement is approved, to the best of applicant's knowledge;
    (g) If there is a lessening of such alternatives, an estimate of the 
public benefits that will accrue from approval, or new competition that 
will arise, which would offset such lessening;
    (h) A narrative assessment of how the pooling arrangement will 
affect present and future competition in the area, including a 
description of the projected volume of traffic, the revenues, and the 
commodities which will be subject to the pooling agreement;
    (i) Certification that rates set for traffic moving under the 
agreement do not violate the restrictions on collective ratemaking 
contained in 49 U.S.C. Subtitle IV and Commission regulations;
    (j) A narrative statement as to the relative transportation 
importance of the pooling agreement as it would affect the public and 
the national transportation system;
    (k) If any known non-pooling carriers authorized to transport the 
subject traffic are not included in the pooling arrangement explain why, 
and explain whether inclusion would enhance or restrain competition;
    (l) A statement of the energy and environmental effects of the 
agreement, if any; and
    (m) Certification by applicant, or its representatives, that the 
representations made in the application are, to the best of applicant's 
knowledge and belief, true and complete.

As appendices, applicants must submit: (1) A copy of the pooling 
agreement; (2) a copy of the specific operating authority of each 
carrier which is the subject of the pooling agreement; and (3) a caption 
summary (for Federal Register publication) of the pooling transaction 
sought to be approved.

<R05>
Sec. 1184.3  Processing pooling applications.

    After the pooling application is received (not less than 50 days 
before the effective date specified in the pooling agreement), the 
Commission will either reject it or determine initially whether the 
pooling agreement is of major transportation importance and whether 
there is a substantial likelihood that the pooling agreement will unduly 
restrain competition. If neither of these two factors is present, the 
application will be granted without further hearing. Where either factor 
is found to exist, the application will be published in the Federal 
Register using the caption summary filed with the application, and a 
hearing will be scheduled (normally to receive written verified 
statements) to consider the issues further. In this second phase of the 
proceeding, the Commission will consider whether the pooling agreement 
would be in the interest of better service to the public or of economy 
of operation and whether it will unduly restrain competition.

Sec. 1185.1  Scope of exemption.

    (a) Subject to the exception in paragraph (c) of this section, 
``interlocking directorates,'' as defined in paragraph (b) of this 
section, are exempt from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 
11322(a).
    (b) An ``interlocking directorate'' exists whenever an individual 
holds the position of officer (as defined in Sec. 1185.3) or director of 
one carrier and assumes the position of officer or director of another 
carrier.
    (c) The exemption in paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to 
those interlocking directorates sought where the individual is already 
an officer or a director of a Class I railroad and seeks to become an 
officer or director of another class I railroad. An application

Sec. 1185.6   Contents of application.

    Each application shall state the following:
    (a) The full name, occupation, business address, place of residence, 
and postoffice address of the applicant.
    (b) A specification of every carrier of which the applicant holds 
stock, bonds, or notes, individually, as trustee, or otherwise; and the 
amount of and accurately describe the securities, owned or held by him, 
of each carrier for which he seeks authority to act. Whenever it is 
contemplated that the applicant will represent on the board of directors 
of any carrier securities other than those owned by him, the application 
shall describe such securities, state the character of representation, 
the name of the beneficial owner or owners, and the general nature of 
the business conducted by such owner or owners.
    (c) Each and every position with any carrier:
    Which is held by the applicant at the time of the application; and 
which he seeks authority to hold, together with the date and manner of 
his election or appointment thereto and, if he has entered upon the 
performance of his duties in any such position, the nature of the duties 
so performed and the date when he first entered upon their performance. 
(A decision authorizing a person to hold the position of director of a 
carrier will be construed as sufficient to authorize him to serve also 
as chairman of its board of directors or as a member or chairman of any 
committee or committees of such board; and, therefore, when authority is 
sought to hold the position of director, the applicant need not request 
authority to serve in any of such other capacities.)
    (d) As to each carrier covered by the requested authorization, 
whether it is an operating carrier, a lessor company, or any other 
corporation organized for the purpose of engaging in transportation by 
railroad subject to the act. If any such carrier neither operates nor 
owns any railroad, transportation by which is subject to the act, there 
shall be filed with the application, as a part thereof, a copy of such 
carrier's charter or certificate or articles of incorporation, with 
amendments to date. When such copy has once been filed with the 
Commission, reference thereto, with amendments, if any, will suffice.
    (e) Thereafter a full statement of pertinent facts relative to any 
carrier which does not make annual reports to the Commission, 
authorization for a position with which is sought.
    (f) Full information as to the relationship, operating, financial, 
competitive, or otherwise, existing between the

[[Page 440]]

carriers covered by the requested authorization.
    (g) Specify every corporation--industrial, financial, or 
miscellaneous--of which the applicant is an officer or director, and the 
general character of the business conducted by such corporation.
    (h) The reasons, fully, why the granting of the authority sought 
will not affect adversely either public or private interests.
    (i) Whether or not any other application for authority has been made 
in behalf of the applicant and, if so, shall show the date and finance 
docket number thereof, by who made, and the action thereon, if any.
    (j) When application has been made in behalf of any person, a 
subsequent application by him need not repeat any statement contained in 
the previous application but may incorporate the same by appropriate 
reference.

him pursuant to the foregoing regulations in this part a request for a 
decision authorizing him to hold generally, in addition to the positions 
so specifically authorized, a directorship or any office or offices with 
the first-mentioned carrier and all companies subsidiary thereto or 
affiliated therewith, or the properties of which are operated or used by 
the carrier, either separately or jointly, with other carriers. Like 
general authority may be applied for by the first-mentioned carrier in 
behalf of any person or persons to whom such specific authority has 
heretofore been granted: Provided, That such general authority may not 
be applied for by such carrier when the person for whom authority is 
desired holds a position or positions with any carrier or carriers not 
subsidiary to or not affiliated with the first-mentioned carrier, or the 
properties of which are not operated or used by the first-mentioned 
carrier, either separately or jointly with other carriers. Every carrier 
application shall be verified by an executive officer having knowledge 
of the facts.

affected by an exempt transaction or transaction proposed for exemption 
may file a complaint with the Commission any time after the Notice of 
Exemption is filed. A copy of the complaint must be served on the 
parties to the transaction. The parties may file an answer with the 
Commission and upon complaint within 10 days after receipt of the

    (1) The docket number of the corresponding Notice of Exemption (if 
available at the time) and the names of the participants in the 
transaction;
    (2) Names of the employees alleged to be affected by the transaction 
and the nature and scope of harm;

appropriate remedy for the particular harm suffered; and
    (5) (Optional) A request for suspension or revocation of the 
exemption, accompanied by information showing why suspension or 
revocation of exemption is necessary.
    (b) Anticompetitive complaints. Any party may file a complaint with 
the Commission within 30 days after the Notice of Exemption is published 
alleging that the transaction is potentially anticompetitive. A copy of 
the complaint must be served on the parties to the transaction. The 
parties may respond by filing an answer with the Commission and upon 
complainant within 10 days after the due date of the complaint. The

Sec. 1186.9  Safety fitness.

    The Commission will consider the DOT safety fitness rating of the 
parties in transactions where operating authority is purchased or 
merged. All parties to the transaction must certify their current safety 
fitness ratings in their Notice of Exemption. If either party has an 
``Unsatisfactory'' safety fitness rating from DOT, the exemption may be 
disapproved. If parties with ``Unsatisfactory'' safety fitness ratings 
consummate a transaction 60 days after publication of the Notice of 
Exemption but prior to notification of Commission action, they do so at 
their own risk and subject to any conditions we may impose subsequently. 
If a Notice of Exemption contains false or misleading information, the 
exemption is void ab initio.

<R05>
Sec. 1187.1  Applications governed by these rules.

    These rules govern the handling of applications filed for temporary 
authority to operate motor property carrier, motor passenger carrier, 
and water carrier properties sought to be acquired in separately filed 
applications or petitions for exemption under:
    (a) 49 U.S.C. 11343-11344 (for authority to consolidate, purchase, 
merge, or lease operating rights and properties of, or to acquire 
control of, motor property carriers, motor passenger carriers, and water 
carriers); or
    (b) 49 U.S.C. 10926 (for the transfer of certificates and permits of 
motor property carriers, motor passenger carriers, and water carriers).


<R05>
Sec. 1187.2  Procedure used generally.

    Since the basis for filing applications for temporary authority 
under these rules is to prevent destruction of or injury to motor 
carrier or water carrier properties sought to be acquired under 49 
U.S.C. 11343-11344 or 10926, these rules are designed to permit the 
Commission to decide expeditiously temporary authority applications. The 
Commission has no obligation to give public notice of applications filed 
under these rules for temporary authority. Cases are decided without 
hearing or other formal proceeding. However, the rules do permit the 
Commission, when feasible, to publish notice of temporary authority 
applications, and such applications may be opposed.


<R05>
Sec. 1187.3  Applications.

          unifications.
1188.2  Deduction of revenues from sources other than regulated 
          transportation.

    Authority: 5 U.S.C. 559 and 49 U.S.C. 10321, 11341, 11343, 11344, 
and 11345a.

    Source: 54 FR 35346, Aug. 25, 1989, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1188.1  Computation of gross operating revenues of carriers involved in unifications.

    In proceedings involving consolidation, merger, or acquisition of 
control of motor carriers under 49 U.S.C. 11343, the aggregate gross 
operating revenues of carriers attributable to transportation from the 
use of their respective operating rights subject to subchapter II of 
chapter 105 of the Act shall be deemed to have exceeded $2 million for 
the period of 12 consecutive months ending not more than six months 
preceding the date of the agreement of the parties covering the 
transaction, within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 11343(d)(1), unless 
otherwise shown, under each of the following circumstances:
    (a) At the end of the preceding calendar year the carriers involved 
in the transaction filed reports with the Commission, as required by 49 
U.S.C. 11145, showing annual gross operating revenues from motor carrier 
operations totaling more than $2 million, and none of the carriers has 
sold or otherwise disposed of any portion of its operating rights 
subsequent to the end of the preceding calendar year;
    (b) A carrier involved in the transaction filed a quarterly report 
or reports for subsequent quarters, and a reasonable estimate of its 
annual gross operating revenues and the reported annual gross operating 
revenues of the other carriers involved in the transaction for the 
preceding calendar year aggregates more than $2 million; or
    (c) A reasonable estimate of:

[[Page 445]]

    (1) The annual gross operating revenues of any carrier which sold or 
otherwise disposed of any portion of its operating rights or which began 
new operations or extended existing operations subsequent to the end of 
the preceding calendar year; and
    (2) The reported annual gross operating revenues of the other 
carriers involved in the transaction for the preceding calendar year 
aggregates more than $2 million.


<R05>
Sec. 1188.2  Deduction of revenues from sources other than regulated transportation.

    (a) In determining whether a proposed transaction is subject to the 
provisions of 49 U.S.C. 11343, applicant motor carriers and their 
affiliate motor carriers must select the same 12-month period and 
indicate the 12-month period selected, as provided in Sec. 1188.1, and 
must disclose the gross revenues received by each such carrier during 
the critical period selected and the revenues derived from sources other 
than transportation subject to subchapter II of chapter 105 of the Act. 
Such latter revenues may be deducted from the gross revenues for the 
purpose of determining jurisdiction.
    (b) Applicants shall show the amounts which they claim should be 
deducted, the sources from which the revenues were derived, and the 
circumstances under which transportation performed is claimed not to 
have been subject to subchapter II of chapter 105 of the Act, in 
transfer proceedings under 49 CFR part 1181 or in support of a motion 
for dismissal of proceedings under 49 CFR part 1182 or 1186.
    (c) Applicants shall not be required to show that the revenues 
computed under Sec. 1188.1 were dervived from transportation subject to 
subchapter II of chapter 105 of the Act.
