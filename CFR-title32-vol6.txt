                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 1997), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

    Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552.

    Source: 59 FR 50835, Oct. 6, 1994, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 806.0  Purpose.

    This part implements Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5400.7, 
13 May 1988, DoD Freedom of Information Act Program; and DoD Regulation 
5400.7-R, 3 October 1990, DoD Freedom of Information Act Program, 10 May 
1991, with Change 1 (32 CFR Parts 285 and 286). It provides guidance for 
making records public and for the Air Force Freedom of Information Act 
(FOIA) Program. It tells how to process FOIA requests and tells the 
public how to request copies of Air Force records using the FOIA (Title 
5, United States Code, Section 552, as amended). It outlines the 
requirements for For Official Use (FOUO) material. If this part 
conflicts with other Air Force publications, it takes precedence over 
those that deal with making records public.


<R05>
Sec. 806.1  General guidance.

    The Air Force discloses its records in its possession and control to 
the public, except those records exempt under the FOIA which, if 
released, would cause an identifiable harm. Make discretionary 
disclosures of exempt information whenever possible. (Discretionary 
releases are generally not appropriate for exemptions 1, 3, 4, 6, and 
7(C)). A discretionary release to one requester will prevent withholding 
the same record if someone else requests it. Answer all requests for 
information and records promptly. Handle requests in a customer-friendly 
manner. Get misrouted FOIA requests to the FOIA Office immediately. Do 
not withhold a record simply because it might suggest administrative 
error or inefficiency or cause embarrassment. Do not deny a request just 
because the record is stored in a computer.


<R05>
Sec. 806.2  Responsibilities.

    (a) The Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Air Force 
(SAF/AA) takes overall responsibility for making sure the Air Force 
complies with the FOIA.
    (b) The Office of the General Counsel to the Secretary of the Air 
Force (SAF/GSA) makes final decisions on appeals.
    (c) The Director of Information management (SAF/AAI), through the 
Access Programs Office of the Administrative Communications and Records 
Management Division, SAF/AAIQ:
    (1) Administers procedures described in this part.
    (2) Submits required reports to the Office of the Assistant to the 
Secretary of Defense (Public Affairs).
    (3) Provides guidance and instructions to major commands (MAJCOM) 
and field operating agencies (FOA).
    (d) MAJCOM and FOA commanders implement this part in their commands 
and agencies.
    (e) FOIA managers:

[[Page 10]]

    (1) Control and process FOIA requests.
    (2) Obtain recommendations from the office of primary responsibility 
(OPR) for records.
    (3) Provide a reading room for inspecting, copying and giving copies 
of records to requesters.
    (4) Provide training.
    (5) Review publications to make sure they comply with this part.
    (6) Conduct periodic program reviews.
    (7) Approve or deny fee waivers.
    (8) Assess and collect fees.
    (9) Send extension notices to requesters.
    (10) Submit required reports.
    (11) Make final determinations on ``no records'' responses.
    (f) OPRs:
    (1) Coordinate the release or denial with the offices of collateral 
responsibility (OCR) and with the Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) and FOIA 
office on proposed denials.
    (2) Provide requested records.
    (3) Help the disclosure authority determine whether to release 
record; and act as declassification authority when appropriate.

    (g) Disclosure authorities determine whether to release records and 
provide them to the FOIA office.

    (h) Initial denial authorities:

    (1) Make final decisions to deny records.

    (2) Tell requesters the nature of records or information denied, 
exemption supporting the denial with reason, and appeal procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 806.3  Material not covered by the FOIA.

    (a) Objects or articles, such as structures, furniture, vehicles, 
and equipment, whatever their historical value or value as evidence.

    (b) Administrative tools for creating, storing, and retrieving 
records, if not created or used as sources of information about 
organizations, policies, functions, decisions, or procedures of DoD. 
Normally computer software, including source code, object code, and 
listings of source and object codes, regardless of medium, are not 
agency records. This does not include the supported data that is 
processed and produced by such software an that in some instances may be 
stored with the software.

    (c) Personal notes of an individual not subject to agency creation 
or retention requirements, created and maintained primarily for the 
convenience of an agency employee, and not distributed to other agency 
employees for their official use.

    (d) Information stored in a computer for which there is no existing 
computer program for retrieval of the requested information.
    (e) If other procedures for processing requests for material not 
covered by FOIA exist:
    (1) Log the request and refer the request outside of the FOIA to the 
proper office.
    (2) Acknowledge the requester's letter, tell the individual where 
you referred the request, and that the material is not a record under 
the FOIA.
    (f) If no alternative release procedures exist, process the request 
under FOIA by advising the requester that materials are not agency 
records and give the requester appeal rights.


<R05>
Sec. 806.4  FOIA requests.

    (a) Under FOIA, members of the public, including foreign citizens, 
military and civilian personnel acting as private citizens, 
organizations and businesses, and individual members of the Congress, 
for themselves or constituents, may request records in writing. Federal 
agencies or fugitives from the law cannot make FOIA requests.
    (b) Requesters should not use Government equipment, supplies, 
stationery, postage, telephones, or official mail channels to make FOIA 
requests. FOIA managers will process such requests and tell requesters 
that using government resources to make FOIA requests is not an 
authorized official use.


<R05>
Sec. 806.5  Submitting FOIA requests.

    Submit written requests that reasonably describe the desired records 
and include a statement on fees. Address letters to the FOIA office of 
the activity that has the record. List other addressees to save time.

[[Page 11]]


<R05>
Sec. 806.6  Processing requests under FOIA and Privacy Act (PA).

    Process requests under the Act that gives the most information. If 
the requester cites both Acts, address each in the reply.


<R05>
Sec. 806.7  Describing records.

    The requester is responsible for identifying the desired record. He 
or she should sufficiently describe the record to help locate it with a 
reasonable amount of effort. Generally a reasonable description contains 
enough information for an organized, nonrandom search. Offices must make 
reasonable efforts to find the records described. This means searching 
all activities and locations most likely to have the records, including 
staged or retired records. If the description is unclear, ask for more 
specific information. When possible, tell the requester what information 
would help.


<R05>
Sec. 806.8  Creating a record.

    (a) The Air Force is not required to create, compile, or obtain a 
record from outside the Air Force to fulfill a request. You may want to 
create a new record when it would be a more useful response to the 
requester or is less burdensome for the agency than providing an 
existing record and the requester agrees. Do not charge the requester 
more for creating a record than you would charge for the existing 
record.
    (b) Apply a standard of reasonableness for electronic data when 
there is a question on whether you are creating, programming, or 
formatting a record. If you can respond with a ``business as usual'' 
approach, process the request, otherwise offer the requester appeal 
rights.


<R05>
Sec. 806.9  Special disclosure procedures.

    Some instructions have disclosure procedures for certain types of 
records. Refer to those instructions for specific disclosure procedures 
when you process FOIA requests. The only reason to deny a request is a 
FOIA exemption.
    (a) Process FOIA requests from foreign citizens, foreign 
governments, their representatives, or international commands under this 
part, and coordinate with your foreign disclosure office. If the command 
has no foreign disclosure office, refer the request to SAF/AAIS (FOIA) 
for SAF/IAD coordination through the MAJCOM FOIA office.
    (b) If requests from foreign government officials do not cite the 
FOIA, refer them to your foreign disclosure office and notify the 
requester.
    (c) If you have a non-U.S. Government record, coordinate with the 
record's originator before releasing it (see Sec. 806.10(e)(1). This 
includes records created by foreign governments and organizations like 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and North American 
Aerospace Defense (NORAD). Coordinate release of foreign government 
records with the U.S. Department of State through the MAJCOM FOIA 
office. Coordinate release or denial of Letters of Offer and Acceptance 
(LOA) and SAF/IA through SAF/AAIS (FOIA).


<R05>
Sec. 806.10  FOIA exemptions.

    Denial authorities may withhold records or information when an 
identifiable harm would result by disclosure, and the records are exempt 
under 5 U.S.C. 552(b).
    (a) Exemption 1--Classified Records. Records properly and currently 
classified in the interest of national defense or foreign policy, as 
authorized by executive order and implementing instructions. Apply this 
exemption when disclosing information by itself or in the context of 
other information that could reasonably be expected to damage national 
security.
    (1) To make a sound decision, review the record paragraph by 
paragraph for releasable information. Review all unclassified parts 
before release to see if they are exempt. Before releasing a reviewed 
and declassified document, draw a single black line through all the 
classification markings, so they are still legible and stamp the 
document ``Unclassified.'' Review material, if appropriate, to determine 
if it should be classified, even though it was not classified when 
requested. AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management (formerly 
AFRs 205-1 and 205-43), tells how to classify and declassify records. 
Check to see if information from foreign sources is classified. Delete 
exempt parts of records and disclose the rest if it does not distort

[[Page 12]]

meaning and you can reasonably assume that a skillful, knowledgeable 
person could not reconstruct the information deleted. Denial letters 
must say that unauthorized disclosure of such information could 
reasonably be expected to cause damage to national security and cite the 
appropriate executive order paragraph(s) as authority for 
classification. When denying a whole classified record, release all 
unclassified parts that would cause no identifiable harm. Coordinate 
with the local information security specialist when invoking this 
exemption for consistency of classification policy and procedures.
    (2) When simply knowing whether a record exists or not reveals 
classified information, use the ``Glomar'' (refusal to confirm or deny) 
response. Apply it consistently, not only when a record exists but also 
when a record does not exist. Otherwise, the pattern of using a ``no 
record'' response when a record does not exist, and a ``refusal to 
confirm or deny'' when a record does exist will disclose exempt 
information. Cite the FOIA exemption when you use the ``Glomar'' 
response.
    (b) Exemption 2--Internal Personnel Rules and Practices. Exempt 
information falls in two categories:
    (1) ``High'' 2 protects records which, if disclosed, would 
substantially hinder the effective performance of a significant function 
of the DoD by risking circumvention of a statute or Air Force 
instruction or policy.
    (2) ``Low'' 2 is for trivial internal administrative matters of no 
genuine public interest and the process of releasing such records would 
constitute an unwarranted administrative burden. You can only use the 
``low'' 2 exemption before fully processing the requested records. 
Otherwise, you may eliminate the administrative burden justification.
    (c) Exemption 3--Other Statutes. Records of matters that a statute 
specifically exempts from disclosure by terms that permit no discretion 
on the issue of withholding or according to defined standards for 
withholding or referring to particular types of matters we must 
withhold. When using this exemption, cite both exemption 3 and the 
specific statute.
    (d) Exemption 4--Confidential Commercial Information. Records with 
trade secrets and commercial or financial information submitted by a 
person or entity outside the Federal Government on a privileged or 
confidential basis that, if released, is likely to cause substantial 
competitive harm to the submitter of the information or impair the 
government's future ability to obtain necessary information. Examples of 
exempt information follow:
    (1) Trade secrets that are commercially valuable plans, formulas, 
processes, or devices used for making, preparing, compounding, or 
processing trade commodities and are the product of innovation or 
substantial effort and were given in confidence.
    (2) Commercial or financial information given in confidence, in 
connection with loans, bids, contracts, or proposals; or privileged 
information, such as trade secrets, inventions, discoveries, or other 
proprietary data.
    (3) Statistical data and commercial or financial information 
concerning contract performance, income, profits, losses, and 
expenditures, offered and given in confidence by a contractor or 
potential contractor.
    (4) Personal statements made during inspections, investigations, or 
audits, if such statements are given in confidence by the individual and 
kept confidential, because they reveal trade secrets or commercial or 
financial information normally considered confidential or privileged.
    (5) Financial data private employers provide in confidence for local 
wage surveys, used to set and adjust pay schedules for prevailing wage 
rate employees of the DoD.
    (6) Scientific and manufacturing processes or developments 
concerning technical or scientific data or other information submitted 
with a research grant application or with a report during research.
    (7) Computer software qualifying as a record under this part that is 
copyrighted under the Copyright Act of 1976 (17 U.S.C. 106), the 
disclosure of which would adversely affect its market value.
    (8) Technical or scientific data a contractor or subcontractor 
developed entirely with private funds and technical

[[Page 13]]

or scientific data developed with both Federal and private funds, which 
the contractor or subcontractor legally owns per 10 U.S.C. 2320-2321 and 
DoD Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), chapter 2 of 48 
CFR 227.4. You may withhold technical data developed entirely with 
Federal funds under Exemption 3 if the data meets the criteria of 10 
U.S.C. 130.
    (e) Before releasing information submitted from outside the Air 
Force:
    (1) Write to the submitter of the data for views on releasability 
and include appendix b with your letter.
    (2) Tell the requester that we must give the submitter of the data 
the opportunity to comment before the Air Force decides whether to 
release the information.
    (3) Give the submitter a reasonable period of time (no more than 30 
calendar days) to object to release and provide justification.
    (4) If the submitter does not respond, write that you have not 
received a reply, tell the submitter of the decision to release with the 
reason and give the expected release date (at least 2 weeks from the 
date of your letter).
    (5) If the submitter objects, but the Air Force disclosure authority 
considers the records releasable, tell the submitter before releasing 
the data. Include in the letter a brief explanation and a release date 
at least 2 weeks from the date of the letter.
    (f) Exemption 5--Inter- or Intra-Agency Records. Intra-agency or 
inter-agency memoranda or letters that, according to recognized legal 
privileges are not routinely released to a party in litigation with the 
Air Force or DoD. If such a record or part of such a record would be 
made available routinely through the discovery process in the course of 
litigation with the agency, release it. In the discovery process, 
litigants get from each other information relevant to issues in a trial 
or hearing. if the information is only made available through the 
discovery process by special court order, then it is exempt. Release 
factual records or parts unless the information is privileged or 
otherwise exempt. Generally, release a direction or order from a 
superior to a subordinate, though contained in an internal 
communication, if it forms policy guidance or a decision, but is not a 
discussion of preliminary or other matters that would compromise 
decision making. Consult your SJA about whether Exemption 5 material 
would be routinely available through the discovery process. Here are 
examples of exempt information.
    (1) The deliberative process privilege--those parts of records with 
internal advice, opinions, evaluations, or recommendations that reveal 
Air Force or DoD deliberations.
    (2) Those nonfactual parts of Air Force personnel evaluations of 
contractors and their products.
    (3) Advance information of a speculative, tentative, or evaluative 
nature on such matters as proposals to buy, lease, or otherwise acquire 
and dispose of materials, real estate, facilities, or functions, if such 
information gives private personal interests an unfair competitive 
advantage or impedes legitimate governmental functions. Generally, you 
cannot use this privilege to withhold factual information. However, you 
may withhold facts when they are so interconnected with deliberative 
information that disclosing facts necessarily discloses the Air Force's 
deliberative process or when facts and deliberative information are so 
interconnected that separating them would be uninformative or redundant.
    (4) Official reports of inspection, audits, investigations, or 
surveys on safety, security, or internal management, administration, or 
operation of the Air Force.
    (5) The attorney work product privilege--records an attorney 
prepares, or supervises the preparation of, in contemplating or 
preparing for administrative proceedings or litigation.
    (6) The attorney-client privilege--confidential communication 
between an attorney and client. For example, a commander expresses 
concerns in confidence to his or her judge advocate and asks for a legal 
opinion. The legal opinion and everything the commander tells the judge 
advocate in confidence qualify.
    (7) Unlike deliberative process privilege, you may withhold both 
facts and opinions in attorney work product or privileged 
communications.

[[Page 14]]

    (8) Trade secrets or other confidential research, development, or 
commercial information the Air Force or DoD owns, whose premature 
release probably would affect the Air Force's or DoD's negotiating 
position or other commercial interests.
    (9) Computer software qualifying as a record under this part which 
is deliberative in nature, if its release would inhibit decisionmaking. 
In this case, closely examine the use of the software to ensure its 
deliberative nature.
    (10) Planning, programming, and budget information involving defense 
planning and resource allocation.
    (g) Exemption 6--Invasion of Personal Privacy. Personnel, medical, 
and similar personal information in other files whose release to the 
public clearly invades personal privacy. To decide whether to release 
personal information, balance the privacy interest against what its 
release would tell the public about how the Air Force functions or about 
the conduct of an Air Force functions or about the conduct of any Air 
force employee (the public interest). Withhold records only when the 
privacy interest exceeds the public interest. Do not use this exemption 
to protect a deceased person's privacy, but you may use it to protect 
the privacy of the deceased person's family in rare instances. Generally 
let a person (or their representative) see their own personnel, medical, 
or similar files and withhold information from the subject only using 5 
U.S.C. 552a, The Privacy Act of 1974 (see part 806b of this chapter).
    (1) Withhold names and duty addresses of personnel serving overseas 
or in sensitive or routinely deployable units. Routinely deployable 
units normally leave their permanent home stations on a periodic or 
rotating basis for peacetime operations or for scheduled training 
exercises conducted outside the United States or U.S. territories on a 
routine basis. Units based in the United States for a long time, such as 
those in extensive training or maintenance activities, do not quality 
during that period. Units designated for deployment or contingency plans 
not yet executed and units that seldom leave the United States or U.S. 
territories (e.g., annually or semiannually) are not routinely 
deployable units. However, units alerted for deployment outside the 
United States or U.S. territories during actual execution of a 
contingency plan or in support of a crisis operation qualify. The way 
the Air Force deploys units makes it difficult to determine when a unit 
that has part of its personnel deployed becomes eligible for denial. The 
Air Force any consider a unit deployed on a routine basis or deployed 
fully overseas when 30 percent of its personnel has been either alerted 
or actually deployed. In this context, alerted means that a unit has 
received an official written warning of an impending operational mission 
outside the United States or U.S. territories.
    (2) Sensitive units are primarily involved in training for special 
activities or classified missions, including, for example, intelligence-
gathering units that collect, handle, dispose of, or store classified 
information and materials, as well as units that train or advise foreign 
personnel.
    (3) Each MAJCOM and FOA will establish a system and OPR(s) to 
identify units in their command qualifying for this exemption. 
Appropriate OPRs could include Directors of Operations, Plans, and 
Programs, and Personnel. The resulting list of nonreleasable units will 
be reviewed and updated in January and July and provided to the MAJCOM 
or FOA FOIA office. This listing will be in ASCII format on a 3\1/2\ or 
5\1/4\ inch floppy disk (double sided, high density), which contains the 
unit's eight-position personnel accounting symbol (PAS) code, with 1 pas 
code per line (record) (8-byte record). The MAJCOM or FOA FOIA manager 
will forward an electronic copy of the list of nonreleasonable units to 
AFMPC/RMI to be included in the personnel data system. The MAJCOM and 
AFMPC FOIA offices will use it to determine releasable lists of names 
and duty addresses.
    (h) Exemption 7--Investigative Records. Records or information 
gathered for law enforcement purposes but only when releasing these 
records would probably:
    (1) Interfere with enforcement proceedings.

[[Page 15]]

    (2) Deprive a person of the right to a fair trial or an impartial 
judgment.
    (3) Invade personal privacy unnecessarily.
    (4) Identify a confidential source, including a state, local, or 
foreign agency or authority or any private institution that gives 
confidential information.
    (5) Disclose information from a confidential source and obtained by 
a criminal law enforcement authority in a criminal investigation or by 
an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence 
investigation.
    (6) Disclose methods for law enforcement investigation or 
prosecutions.
    (7) Disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or 
prosecutions if the release would probably encourage circumvention of 
the law.
    (8) Endanger an individual's life or physical safety.
    (i) You may use this exemption to prevent disclosure of documents 
not originally created for, but later gathered for law enforcement 
purposes.
    (j) Exemption 8--Financial Institutions. Those records contained in 
or related to examination, operation, or condition reports prepared by, 
on the behalf of, or for the use of, an agency that regulates or 
supervises financial institutions.
    (k) Exemption 9--Wells. Records with geological and geophysical 
information and data, including maps, concerning wells.


<R05>
Sec. 806.11  FOIA exclusions.

    (a) Under two limited situations, requests for law enforcement 
records are not subject to disclosure under FOIA:
    (1) Requests for law enforcement records when the investigation 
involves a possible criminal violation, the subject is unaware of the 
investigation, and disclosing the record's existence could interfere 
with enforcement.
    (2) Requests for informant records a criminal law enforcement agency 
keeps under the informant's name or personal identifier made by a third 
party using the informant's name or personal identifier, but only when 
the informant's status as an informant has not been officially 
confirmed.
    (b) In these cases, do not use denial procedures; instead, say you 
found no records. Coordinate with the SJA on these cases. When you write 
to the requester, do not give the statutory citation for the exclusion 
nor state your reliance on an exclusion.


<R05>
Sec. 806.12  Denials.

    Only denial authorities may withhold information. Denial authority 
level is at the deputy chiefs of staff and chiefs of comparable offices 
or higher at HQ USAF, and MAJCOM and FOA commanders. These officials may 
name an additional official as a denial authority. Send SAF/AAIQ a 
letter with the position titles only. Only the Administrative Assistant 
to the Secretary of the Air Force can approve a request for more than 
one additional denial authority. Send those requests, with 
justification, to SAF/AAIQ.
    (a) When denying information, delete only the exempt parts of a 
record, release what remains, and let the requester know that you are 
providing all reasonably segregable, releasable parts of the record. 
Clearly show the requester where you deleted information.
    (b) Denial letters must include the reason for the denial and cite 
the statutory exemption. Only authorized denial authorities sign denial 
letters. FOIA managers may sign ``no records'' responses. Denial letters 
and ``no records'' responses must also include an appeal paragraph that:
    (1) Tells the requester to address appeals to the Secretary of the 
Air Force, through the FOIA office of the activity that issued the 
denial or ``no records'' response.
    (2) Tells the requester to appeal within 60 calendar days from the 
date of the letter and to include reasons for reconsideration.
    (3) Asks the requester to attach a copy of the response.


<R05>
Sec. 806.13  Freedom of Information Act annual report.

    (a) MAJCOM and FOA FOIA managers submit a calendar-year report on 
3\1/2\- or 5\1/4\-inch disk using the FOIA System. Send the report by 10 
January to SAF/AAIQ. The report control symbol (RCS) is DD-PA(A)1365.

[[Page 16]]

    (b) SAF/AAIQ submits the report to the Office of the Assistant to 
the Secretary of Defense (Public Affairs) Directorate for Freedom of 
Information and Security Review on DD Form 2564, Annual Report--Freedom 
of Information Act.


<R05>
Sec. 806.14  Host-tenant relationship.

    (a) The host base FOIA manager logs, processes, and reports FOIA 
requests for tenant units. The host base FOIA office refers all 
recommended denials and ``no records'' appeals to the tenant MAJCOM FOIA 
manager.
    (b) This host-tenant relationship does not apply to disclosure 
authorities for specialized records, such as the Air Force Audit Agency 
and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations.


<R05>
Sec. 806.15  Processing FOIA requests.

    All FOIA offices use the FOIA system to track and manage FOIA 
requests. AFM 4-196 is the FOIA System End Users Manual.
    (a) After receiving a FOIA request, the FOIA manager:
    (1) Records the date and time of receiving the request, logs the 
request in the FOIA system and sets a suspense date. For more than 10 
FOIA requests, sets up a first-in, first-out system to process the 
requests in the order received.
    (2) Considers a request received when the FOIA office responsible 
for processing the request receives it; and when the requester states a 
willingness to pay fees set for his or her category (see Sec. 806.17), 
has paid past FOIA debts, and has reasonably described the requested 
records.
    (3) Determines the fee according to the requester's category, writes 
to requesters who have not made arrangements to pay for the information 
and whose fees are more than $15, telling them the category and cost of 
the request.
    (4) Answers fee waiver requests before processing. Asks for more 
justification, if needed to make a good decision. Do not consider this 
notice a denial.
    (5) Attaches DD Form 2086, Record of Freedom of Information (FOI) 
Processing Cost, or DD 2086-1, Record of Freedom of Information (FOI) 
Processing Cost for Technical Data, to each request. The OPR must 
complete and return this form to the FOIA office. These forms give the 
fees for charging, if any, and processing costs you use to prepare the 
FOIA annual report.
    (6) Writes the requester to acknowledge receipt of the request if 
the date or postmark (whichever is later) is more than 10 workdays ago 
and informs the requester of any unusual problems.
    (7) Tells the requester if the record is not sufficiently described 
and asks for more information. If possible, offers to help the requester 
identify the requested records and tells what kind of information makes 
searching for a record easier.
    (8) Sends the request to the OPR who searches for the record and 
decides whether to release it.
    (9) Sends classified records with no OPR or functional equivalent to 
SAF/AAIS, through the MAJCOM or FOA FOIA office, for HQ USAF/SP review. 
Telephones SAF/AAIS before sending the records.
    (10) Tells the requester in a letter sent within 10 workdays after 
receiving the request of the final decision to release or deny the 
records.
    (11) When answering requests for lists of names and duty addresses, 
tells requesters as early as possible about the mass mailing 
restrictions outlined in AFI 37-125, Official Mail, Small Parcel and 
Distribution Management (formerly AFR 4-50).
    (12) Grants 10 additional workdays for one or more of three reasons:
    (i) All or part of the requested records are not at the installation 
processing the request.
    (ii) Fulfilling the request means collecting and reviewing an 
enormous number of records.
    (iii) Other Air Fore activities or other agencies need to be 
involved in deciding whether to release the records.
    (13) Sends the requester a letter within 10 workdays, giving the 
reason for the delay and a date (within 20 workdays after receiving the 
request) when the requester can expect a final decision.
    (14) Records extensions and reasons for them in the FOIA system.

[[Page 17]]

    (15) Coordinates with the public affairs office if the requested 
records are potentially newsworthy or if the news media sent the 
request.
    (16) Sends releasable records to requesters with a bill (if 
appropriate).
    (17) Sends a request the OPR wants to deny through the MAJCOM or FOA 
FOIA office to the denial authority for a decision. The package must 
include:
    (i) The request.
    (ii) A copy of the requested records.
    (iii) The OPR's and SJA's written recommendations.
    (iv) The exemption cited.
    (v) The reason for denial.
    (b) The OPR locates the information and recommends its release. In 
cases where several OPRs have functional responsibility for the 
information, the primary OPR is the one responsible for most of the 
information in the document. The OPR:
    (1) Works with the offices of collateral responsibility (OCR) inside 
and outside the Air Force, considers the opinions and information they 
provide, and makes the final release decision.
    (2) Forwards records that need coordination with other Air Force 
functional areas and outside agencies to the MAJCOM or FOA FOIA office, 
which sends them to the appropriate FOI office for review and return for 
final decision.
    (3) Answers each functional request and follows FOIA denial 
procedures for records withheld.


<R05>
Sec. 806.16  Referrals.

    A FOIA manager refers requests to another FOIA office after 
consulting with them when the request asks for records or information 
originated by someone other than the activity receiving the request or 
when an OPR finds records in a search that belong to another activity.
    (a) Refer FOIA requesters to sources that can provide unaltered 
publications and processed documents, such as maps, charts, regulations, 
and manuals to the public, with or without charge. For example, people 
can obtain documents published in the Federal Register without using the 
FOIA. The National Technical Information Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal 
Road, Springfield, VA 22161, sells current Air Force standard numbered 
(departmental) publications, but does not stock superseded, obsolete, 
rescinded, classified, FOUO, limited (L), or ``X'' distribution Air 
Force publications. FOIA requests for these publications go through 
normal FOIA channels to the OPR for a release recommendation.
    (b) Usually, tell the requester about the referral, identify the 
record referred as security permits, and tell the requester to expect an 
answer from the agency or activity receiving the referral.
    (c) If a request would involve many referrals, tell the requester 
where to address the request; don't refer it yourself.
    (d) Before releasing records or information originated with the 
National Security Council (NSC) or the White House, refer them through 
the Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense (Public Affairs) 
Directorate for Freedom of Information (OATSD[PA]DFOISR), Washington DC 
20301. The OATSD(PA) will consult with them and reply back to you.
    (e) The General Accounting Office (GAO) is outside the Executive 
Branch and not subject to the FOIA. However, if the FOIA manager 
receives a FOIA request directly from the public or referred from GAO 
for GAO documents that contain Air Force or DoD information, process the 
request under FOIA.

Sec. 806.17  Categorizing requesters.

    (a) Requesters' fees depend on which group they belong to:
    (1) Category 1: Commercial. Requesters pay all search, review, and 
duplication. To decide who belongs in this category find out how these 
requesters will use the requested documents. If you are unsure how the 
requester plans to use the records or the request itself does not 
clearly state plans, seek additional information before you categorize 
the request.
    (2) Category 2: Educational or Noncommercial Scientific Institution 
or News Media. Requesters get the first 100 copies free and pay for 
additional copies. These requesters do not pay search or review charges. 
Requesters who use requested records to write and spread

[[Page 18]]

news are not considered commercial requesters.
    (3) Category 3: Others. Requesters get the first 2 hours of search 
and the first 100 copies free. These requesters do not pay review 
charges.
    (b) Analyze each request to categorize the requester. If you think 
the requester's category differs from what the requester claims, ask the 
individual for more justification and say you cannot begin searching for 
records until you have agreed on the category. If the requester does not 
send the FOIA manager more justification in reasonable time (normally, 
30 calendar days), the manager makes a final decision and notifies the 
requester of the decision and of the right to appeal it.
    (c) Tell requesters that you cannot begin to answer their requests 
until they state they will pay the costs set for their category.


<R05>
Sec. 806.18  Fee assessment.

    The FOIA limits charges to search, review, and duplication based on 
the requester's category.
    (a) Estimate fees if the requester asks. Do not charge an amount 
more than the estimate or the amount the requester agrees to unless the 
requester first agrees to pay more.
    (b) Search time includes all time spent looking for records to 
respond to a request. Personnel must search efficiently to minimize both 
the Air Force's and the requester's costs. Search efforts must be 
thorough and include all locations and activities most likely to have 
the requested records. Searches may include retired or staged records. 
Time spent reviewing documents to decide whether statutory exemptions 
apply counts as review time, not search time. For computer searches, 
determine the first 2 free hours against the salary scale of the person 
operating the computer.
    (1) FOIA managers may charge for search time for the appropriate 
category (and review time for commercial requesters only), if the 
requester agreed in advance to pay, even if:
    (i) A search does not uncover the requested records.
    (ii) The records found are entirely exempt from disclosure.
    (2) When estimated search charges exceed $25, tell the requester the 
estimated fees, unless the requester has already indicated a willingness 
to pay fees as high as the estimate. When feasible, offer the requester 
the opportunity to restate the request so that the search costs less.
    (c) Review is the process of examining documents to determine if one 
or more of the statutory exemptions allows withholding. It also includes 
the time it takes to excise information. Review does not include time 
spent resolving general legal or policy issues on exemptions. FOIA 
managers may only assess commercial requesters for initial review. This 
does not include reviews at the appeal stage for exemptions already 
applied, but it may include review to apply an exemption not previously 
cited.
    (d) Requesters pay only for copies of the records they actually 
receive. Copies may be on paper, microfiche, audiovisual, or machine-
readable magnetic tape or disk, among other media. FOIA managers must 
try hard to ensure copies are clear. If you cannot possibly provide a 
clear copy, tell the requester that the copy is the best available and 
that he or she can make an appointment to review the master copy. For 
copies of computer tapes and audiovisual material, charge the actual 
copying cost, including the operator's time.
    (e) Before beginning or continuing work on a request, FOIA managers 
may require advance payment from requesters:
    (1) Who have not paid fees on time (usually within 30 calendar days) 
in the past.
    (2) Whose estimated fees are over $250, unless the requester always 
pays promptly. In that case, give the requester an estimate and ask the 
requester to ensure full payment.
    (f) If the requester has always paid promptly, the FOIA manager 
sends the records and requests payment at the same time.
    (g) If a requester has not paid on time in the past, FOIA managers 
may ask the requester to:
    (1) Pay (or show proof of payment of) outstanding bills, plus 
interest, for past FOIA requests. Consult 31 U.S.C.

[[Page 19]]

3717 for interest rates and coordinate with your accounting and finance 
office.
    (2) Pay estimated fees in advance.
    (h) If a requester has no payment history, or has not paid on time 
in the past, FOIA managers may ask the requester to pay after processing 
the request but before sending the records.
    (i) When employees with different hourly rates search for 
information for an ``Other'' (Category 3) requester, waive the cost of 
the most expensive 2 hours of search. Requesters receive the first 2 
hours search (Category 3 requesters only) and the first 100 pages of 
duplication (Categories 2 and 3) free only once per request. If you 
complete your work and refer the request to another FOI office for 
action, tell that FOI office how much time you spent searching and how 
many pages you copied for the requester.


<R05>
Sec. 806.19  Aggregating requests.

    A requester may make many requests at once, each seeking parts of a 
document or documents, just to avoid paying fees. When a requester or a 
group of requesters breaks a request into many requests to avoid paying, 
the FOIA manager may combine the requests and charge accordingly. Before 
combining requests, be sure you have solid evidence that the requesters 
are trying to avoid fees. Do not combine one requester's multiple 
requests on unrelated subjects. Contact SAF/AAIQ before taking action.


<R05>
Sec. 806.20  Fee waivers.

    (a) Waive fees for requesters of all categories when:
    (1) FOIA costs total $15 or less.
    (2) A record is created voluntarily to save the cost of supplying 
many records.
    (3) A record previously withheld is released at small cost (e.g., 
$15 to $30).
    (4) Releasing the information is likely to contribute significantly 
to public understanding of the operations or activities of the DoD and 
is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
    (b) A waiver in the public interest establishes the two basic 
requirements below. Both must be met before you waive or reduce fees. 
Use the following six factors. Begin with the first four factors to 
determine ``public interest'' and then use the two remaining factors to 
decide if release ``is not primarily in the commercial interest of the 
requester.''
    (1) Requirement 1. Is releasing the information in the public 
interest business it will probably contribute significantly to public 
understanding of the government's operations or activities?
    (i) Factor 1--Subject of the Request. Analyze whether the subject 
matter will significantly contribute to the public understanding of DoD 
operations or activities. Requests made for records in DoD's possession 
originated by nongovernment organizations for their intrinsic content 
rather than informative value will likely not contribute to public 
understanding of DoD operations or activities. Press clippings, magazine 
articles, or records expressing an opinion or concern from a member of 
the public regarding a DoD activity are such records. Releasing older 
records may be relevant to current DoD activities, so do not discount it 
under this factor simply because it is old. For example, a requester 
might want historical records to study how a certain current DoD policy 
evolved. Review these requests closely, comparing the requester's stated 
purpose for the records and the potential for public understanding of 
DoD operations and activities.
    (ii) Factor 2--Informative Value. Closely analyze a record's 
substantive contents to determine whether disclosure is meaningful, and 
will inform the public on DoD operations or activities. While the 
subject of a request may contain information concerning DoD operations 
or activities it may not always help people understand these operations 
or activities. One example is a heavily edited record, containing only 
random words, fragmented sentences, or paragraph headings. Another 
example is information already in the public domain.
    (iii) Factor 3--General Public Will Understand the Subject Better. 
Will the records' release inform, or have the potential to inform, the 
public or just the requester or a few interested persons? Knowing the 
requester's identity is essential to determine whether he or she

[[Page 20]]

plans to, and knows how to, communicate information to the public. Plans 
to write a book, research a subject, work on a doctoral dissertation, or 
indigency are not reason enough to waive fees. The requester must tell 
how he or she plans to disclose the information to the general public. 
You may ask requesters for their qualifications, the nature of their 
research, the purpose of requesting information, and their plans for 
making information public.
    (iv) Factor 4--Significance of Public Understanding. Balance the 
relative significance or impact of the disclosure against the level of 
public knowledge or understanding that exists before disclosure. Records 
released on a subject of wide public interest should contain previously 
unknown facts that increase public knowledge. They should not duplicate 
what the general public already knows. Determining the significance of 
information requires objective judgment. Take care to determine whether 
disclosure will probably lead to significant public understanding of the 
issue. Do not judge whether the information is important enough to be 
public.
    (2) Requirement 2. Does disclosure of the information primarily mean 
profit for the requester?
    (i) Factor 5--Commercial Interest. If you determine the requester 
will use the records to make a profit, then decide if it's primary, as 
opposed to a personal or noncommercial interest. In addition to profit-
making organizations, individuals, and other organizations may have a 
commercial interest in certain records. When you have difficulty 
deciding whether a request is commercial in nature, the requester's 
identity and the circumstances of the request may help. You may write to 
the requester and ask for more details.
    (ii) Factor 6--Primary Interest. After you have determined the 
requester's commercial interest, decide if it is primary. Commercial 
interests are primary only if the requester's profit clearly overrides a 
personal or nonprofit interest. You must decide whether the commercial 
interest outweighs any benefit to the public as a result of disclosure. 
Waive or reduce fees when the public gains more than the requester. If 
the requester's commercial interest is greater than the public interest, 
do not waive or reduce fees even if public interest is significant. As 
business organizations, news organizations have a commercial interest; 
however, you can assume that their primary interest is giving the 
general public news. Scholars writing books or engaging in other 
academic research, may profit, either directly or indirectly (through 
the institution they represent); however, such work is primarily done 
for educational purposes. Usually you would not assess scholars fees. 
Assume that brokers or others who compile government information for 
marketing use the information for profit.
    (iii) Decide each fee waiver case by case. When you have doubts 
about waiving or charging a fee, favor the requester.


<R05>
Sec. 806.21  Transferring fees to accounting and finance offices.

    The Treasurer of the United States has two accounts for FOIA 
receipts. Use account 3210, Sales of Publications and Reproductions, 
Freedom of Information Act, for depositing fees for publications and 
forms described in Federal Account Symbols and titles. Use receipt 
account 3210, Fees and Other Charges for Services, Freedom of 
Information Act, to deposit fees for searching for, copying, and 
reviewing records to provide information not in existing publications or 
forms. Add your disbursing office's prefix to the account numbers. 
Deposit all FOIA receipts in these accounts except those from 
industrially funded and nonappropriated funded activities. Deposit these 
receipts in the applicable fund.


<R05>
Sec. 806.22  Fee rates.

    (a) These fees apply only to FOIA requests. Part 813 of this 
chapter, Schedule of Fees for Copying, Certifying and Searching Records 
and Other Documentary Material, contains the fee schedule for non-FOIA 
services. Refer to Part 806B of this chapter for guidance on fees for PA 
requests.
    (b) Search and review:
    (1) Clerical (E9 and GS-8 and below)--$12 an hour.
    (2) Professional (01-06 and GS-9-GS/GM-15)--$25 an hour.

[[Page 21]]

    (3) Executive (07 and GS-16/ES1 and above)--$45 an hour.
    (c) Computer search fees are based on direct costs of the central 
processing unit, input-output devices, and memory capacity of the actual 
computer configuration. Also include the salary scale (equal to hourly 
rates above) for the computer operator or programmer who planned and 
carried out the search.
    (d) Duplication:
    (1) Preprinted material--$.02 per page.
    (2) Office copies--$.15 per page.
    (3) Microfiche--$.25 per page.
    (4) Computer copies (tapes or printouts)--actual cost of duplicating 
the tape or printout, including operator's time and tape cost.
    (e) Copying cost for audiovisual documents is the actual cost of 
reproducing the material, including the wage of the person doing the 
work. Audiovisual materials given to a requester need not be 
reproducible.
    (f) Special Services. Includes certifying that records are true 
copies and sending records by express mail. You may recover their costs 
if the requester clearly asks for and agrees to pay for them.


<R05>
Sec. 806.23  Technical data.

    Technical data does not include computer software or data used for 
contract administration, such as financial and management information. 
If the FOIA requires, release technical data (not including critical 
technology with military or space application) after the requester pays 
all reasonable costs for search, duplication, and review.


<R05>
Sec. 806.24  Technical data fee rates.

    (a) Clerical search and review--$13.25 an hour. Minimum charge--
$8.30. Professionals and executives--set rate before beginning at actual 
hourly rate. Minimum charge is \1/2\ of hourly rate.
    (b) Copying rates depend on the type of record. If this list does 
include the product, use the fair market value.
    (1) Aerial photographs, specifications, permits, charts, blueprints, 
and other technical documents--$2.50 each.
    (2) Microfilmed engineering data aperture cards (silver duplicate 
negatives)--$.75 per card.
    (3) Silver duplicate negatives, keypunched and verified--$.85 per 
card.
    (4) Diazo duplicate negatives--$.65 per card.

image--$.10.
    (11) Typewritten pages--$3.50 each.
    (12) Certification and validation with seal--$5.20.
    (13) Hand-drawn plots and sketches--$12 an hour or less.
    (14) Fee Waivers for Technical Data. Waive the fees if they are more 
than regular FOIA fee rates if a citizen or a US corporation asks and 
certifies the need for technical data to submit (or assess its ability 
to submit) an offer to supply the United States or its contractor with a 
product related to the technical data. You may ask the citizen or 
corporation for a deposit of not more than what fulfilling the request 
costs. When the citizen or coporation submits the offer, refund the 
deposit. Also waive charges:
    (15) If a requester needs technical data to meet the terms of an 
international agreement.
    (16) If you decide, using regular FOIA fee waiver guidance, that a 
waiver is in the interest of the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 806.25  Appeals.

    Requesters may appeal denials of records, category determinations, 
fee waiver requests, and ``no records'' determinations by writing to the 
Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, within 60 calendar days after 
the date of the denial letter. A requester who sends the appeal after 60 
calendar days, should explain the reason for the delay.
    (a) Requesters who appeal have exhausted all administrative remedies 
within the Department of the Air Force and The Office of the General 
Counsel to the Secretary of the Air Force (SAF/GC) makes a final 
decision. Requesters must address all appeals to

[[Page 22]]

the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, through the MAJCOM or FOA 
FOIA office that denied the request. Requesters should attach a copy of 
the denial letter to their appeal and give their reasons for appealing.
    (b) After coordinating with the local SJA (and the OPR, if 
appropriate), MAJCOM and FOA FOIA offices send all appeals, including 
late submissions, to Air Force Legal Services Agency (AFLSA/JACL) for 
determination, unless they have reconsidered and approved the request. 
MAJCOM and FOA FOIA offices give appeals priority. They do not have 20 
workdays to process an appeal.
    (c) Requesters must appeal denials involving Office of Personnel 
Management's controlled civilian personnel records to the Office of the 
General Counsel, Office of Personnel Management, 1900 E Street NW, 
Washington DC 20415.
    (d) When sending appeals to AFLSA/JACL, attach:
    (1) The original appeal letter and envelope.
    (2) The initial request and any attachments.
    (3) The denial letter, with an index of the denied material, if 
applicable.
    (4) Copies of all records you have already provided; or if the 
records are massive (Several cubic feet) and AFLSA/JACL agrees, an index 
or description of released records.
    (5) Copies of all administrative processing documents, including 
extension letters and opinions and recommendations about the request.
    (6) Copy of the denied record or denied portions of it marked to 
show what you withheld. If the records are massive and AFLSA/JACL 
agrees, you may substitute a detailed description of the documents.
    (7) A point-by-point discussion of factual and legal arguments the 
requester's appeal contains and, proof that the denial authority 
considered and rejected these arguments and why.
    (8) An explanation of the decisionmaking process for intraagency 
documents denied under the deliberative process privilege and how the 
denied material fits into that process.
    (e) Assemble appeal packages:
    (1) Arrange attachments in the order listed in paragraph (d) of this 
section. Use tabbed dividers to separate attachments.
    (2) List all attachments in your cover letter.
    (3) Include the name of the person to contact and a phone number.
    (f) AFLSA/JACL sends the appeal of the Office of the General 
Counsel, who makes a final determination. The law requires a final 
decision within 20 workdays after receipt of the appeal letter. The 20 
days begins when the denial authority's FOIA office receives the appeal. 
The time limit includes processing actions by all levels. If a final 
determination cannot be made within 20 days, AFLSA/JACL writes to the 
requester to acknowledge the appeals' receipt and to explain the delay. 
If SAF/GC upholds the denial, in whole or in part, SAF/GC tells the 
requester, explains reasons for the denial, and tells the requester 
about judicial review rights. If SAF/GC grants the appeal, that office 
tells the requester in writing and releases, or directs the release of, 
the record.
    (g) For ``no records'' determinations, search again, if warranted, 
or verify the first search. Include in the package you send to AFLSAS/
JACL any letters that show you systematically tried to find records. 
Tell, for example, what areas or offices you search for how you 
conducted the search--manually, by computer, by telephone, etc.
    (h) For appeals to denials of fee waiver requests, fully account for 
actual and estimated costs with a copy of the DD 2086 or DD Form 2086-1.


<R05>
Sec. 806.26  For Official Use Only (FOUO).

    FOUO is not a classification. Information marked FOUO must meet the 
criteria for exemptions 2 through 9, or you cannot withhold it. Do not 
consider or mark any other records FOUO.
    (a) Originators mark records when they create them to call attention 
to FOUO content. An FOUO marking does not mean you must withhold a 
record under the FOIA. You still need to review a requested record. 
Examine records with and without markings to identify information that 
needs protection and is exempt from public release

[[Page 23]]

or to decide whether discretionary release is appropriate.
    (1) Information in a technical document that requires a distribution 
statement per AFI 61-204, Controlling the Distribution of Classified and 
Unclassified Scientific and Technical Information (formerly AFR 80-30), 
must show that statement. The originator may also mark the information 
FOUO, if appropriate.
    (2) Mark an unclassified document containing FOUO information ``For 
Official Use Only'' at the bottom, on the outside of the front cover (if 
any), on each page containing FOUO information, on the back page, and on 
the outside of the back cover (if any).
    (3) In unclassified documents, the originator may also mark 
individual paragraphs that contain FOUO information to alert users and 
assist in review.
    (4) In a classified document, mark:
    (i) An individual paragraph that contains FOUO, but not classified 
information, by placing ``(FOUO)'' at the beginning of the paragraph.
    (ii) The top and bottom of each page that has both FOUO and 
classified information, with the highest security classification of 
information on that page.
    (iii) ``FOUO'' at the bottom of each page that has FOUO but not 
classified information.
    (5) If a classified document also contains FOUO information or if 
the classified material becomes FOUO when declassified, place the 
following statement on the bottom of the cover or the first page, under 
the classification marking: If declassified, review the document to make 
sure material is not FOUO and not exempt under this part before public 
release.
    (6) Mark other records, such as computer printouts, photographs, 
films, tapes, or slides,``For Official Use Only'' or ``FOUO'' so the 
receiver or viewer knows the record contains FOUO information.
    (7) Mark FOUO material sent to authorized persons outside the DoD 
with an explanation typed or stamped on the document:

    This document contains information EXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE 
UNDER THE FOIA. Exemption(s) . . . . . . applies (apply). (Further 
distribution is prohibited without the approval of (enter OPR)).

    (b) DoD components, officials of DoD components, and authorized DoD 
contractors, consultants, and grantees send FOUO information to each 
other to conduct official DoD business. Tell recipients the status of 
such information, and send the material in a way that prevents 
unauthorized public disclosure. Make sure documents that transmit FOUO 
material call attention to any FOUO attachments. Normally, you may send 
FOUO records over facsimile equipment. To prevent unauthorized 
disclosure, consider attaching special cover sheets (i.e., AF Form 3227, 
Privacy Act Cover Sheet, for Privacy Act information), the location of 
sending and receiving machines, and whether authorized personnel are 
around to receive FOUO information. FOUO information may be passed to 
officials in other departments and agencies of the executive and 
judicial branches to fulfill a government function. Mark the records 
``For Official Use Only,'' and tell the recipient the information is 
exempt from public disclosure under the FOIA and whether it needs 
special handling. If the records are subject to the PA, refer to Part 
806b of this chapter for PA disclosure policies.
    (c) AFI 90-401, Air Force Relations With Congress (formerly AFR 11-
7), governs the release of FOUO information to members of the Congress 
and AFI 65-401, Air Force Relations With the General Accounting Office 
(formerly AFR 11-8), governs its release to the General Accounting 
Office (GAO). Review records before releasing to see if the information 
warrants FOUO status. If not, remove FOUO markings. If the material 
still warrants FOUO status, mark the records FOUO and explain the 
appropriate exemption and marking to the recipient.
    (d) When you use the US Postal Service, package records with FOUO 
information so their contents are safe. If FOUO information is not 
combined with classified information, individuals may send FOUO 
information by First Class Mail or Parcel Post. Bulky shipments, such as 
FOUO directives or testing materials, that qualify under postal 
regulations may be sent by Fourth Class Mail.

[[Page 24]]

    (e) Mark each part of a message that contains FOUO information. 
Unclassified messages containing FOUO information must show the 
abbreviation ``FOUO'' before the text begins.
    (f) To safeguard FOUO records during normal duty hours, place them 
in an out-of-sight location if people who do not work for the government 
come into the work area. After normal duty hours, store FOUO records to 
prevent unauthorized access. File them with other unclassified records 
in unlocked files or desks, etc., if the Government or a Government 
contractor provides normal internal building security. When there is no 
internal security, locked buildings or rooms usually provide adequate 
after-hours protection. For additional protection, store FOUO material 
in locked containers such as file cabinets, desks, or bookcases.
    (g) When a record is no longer FOUO, remove the markings or indicate 
on the document the markings no longer apply. Try to tell everyone who 
has the records that their status has changed.
    (h) Destroy FOUO materials by tearing them up so no one can put them 
back together and throwing them into trash containers. When the 
information needs more protection, local authorities may use other 
methods. However, balance the expense of extra protection against the 
degree of sensitivity of the FOUO information in the records. You may 
recycle FOUO material. Safeguard the FOUO documents or information until 
recycling to prevent unauthorized disclosure. Recycling contracts must 
include agreements on how to protect and destroy FOUO and PA materials.
    (i) Unauthorized disclosure of FOUO records is not an unauthorized 
disclosure of classified information. Air Force personnel must act to 
protect FOUO records under their control from unauthorized disclosure. 
When unauthorized persons gain access to these records, administrators 
find out who is responsible and take disciplinary action where 
appropriate. Unauthorized disclosure of FOUO information containing PA 
information may also result in civil or criminal sanctions against 
individuals or the Air Force. Tell the originating organization when its 
records are improperly disclosed.

it does not reveal a person's conduct in their job.
    Records--The products of data compilation, such as all books, 
papers, maps, and photographs, machine readable materials or other 
documentary materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, 
made or received by an agency of the U.S. Government in connection with 
the transaction of public business and in the agency's possession and 
control at the time it receives the request. Records such as notes, 
working papers, and drafts kept as historical evidence of actions are 
subject to the FOIA, and may be exempt from release under 5 U.S.C. 
552(b)(5) if an identifiable harm exists by their release. Computer 
software rarely qualifies as an agency record. Evaluate each case. Two 
examples of software as a record are:
    a. Data embedded in the software cannot be extracted without the 
software.
    b. Software that reveals information about DoD organization, 
policies, functions, decisions, or procedures, such as computer models 
used to forecast budget outlays, to calculate retirement system costs, 
or to optimize models on travel costs.
    Search--To look for a requested record or a specific section of a 
record. You can search over the telephone, manually, or with computer 
searches.
    Statutory Time Limits--The 10 workdays after receiving the request 
to tell the requester whether the records are released or denied. This 
term also covers the additional 10-workday extension allowed for reasons 
in Sec. 806.15(a)(12). The 10 days begin when the FOIA manager receives 
a properly filed request with a reasonable description of the requested 
records and with the requester's stated willingness to pay fees or fees 
paid. If the requester disagrees with his or her category or wants fees 
reduced or waived, the 10 days begin after resolving these issues.
    Technical Data--Information (including computer software 
documentation) that is scientific or technical in nature and recorded on 
any medium.

 Appendix B to Part 806--Requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) (Send With 
                          Letter to Submitters)

    (a) The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requires Federal agencies 
to provide their records, except those specifically exempted, for the 
public to inspect and copy.
    (b) Section (b) of the Act lists nine exemptions that are the only 
basis for withholding records from the public.
    (c) In this case, the fourth exemption, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), may 
apply to records or information the Air Force maintains. Under this 
exemption, agencies may withhold trade secrets and commercial or 
financial information they obtained from a person or organization 
outside the government which is privileged or confidential.
    (d) This generally includes information provided and received with 
the understanding that it will be kept privileged or confidential.
    (e) Commercial or financial matter is ``confidential'' and exempt if 
its release will probably:
    (1) Impair the Government's ability to obtain necessary information 
in the future.
    (2) Substantially harm the source's competitive position or impair 
some other legitimate Government interest.
    (f) The exemption may be used to help the source when public 
disclosure will probably cause substantial harm to its competitive 
position. Examples of information that may qualify for this exemption 
include:
    (1) Commercial or financial information received in confidence with 
loans, bids, contracts, or proposals, as well as other information 
received in confidence or privileged, such as trade secrets, inventions, 
discoveries, or other proprietary data.
    (2) Statistical data and commercial or financial information 
concerning contract performance, income, profits, losses, and 
expenditures, offered and received in confidence from a contractor or 
potential contractor.
    (3) Personal statements given during inspections, investigations, or 
audits, received and kept in confidence because they reveal trade 
secrets or commercial or financial information, normally considered 
confidential or privileged.
    (4) Financial data that private employers give in confidence for 
local wage surveys used to set and adjust pay schedules for the 
prevailing wage rate of DoD employees.
    (5) Information about scientific and manufacturing processes or 
developments that is technical or scientific or other information 
submitted with a research grant application, or with a report while 
research is in progress.
    (6) Technical or scientific data a contractor or subcontractor 
develops entirely at private expense, and technical or scientific data 
developed partly with Federal funds and partly with private funds, in 
which the contractor or subcontractor retains legitimate proprietary 
interests per 10 U.S.C. 2320-2321 and 48 CFR 227.4.
    (7) Computer software copyrighted under the Copyright Act of 1976 
(17 U.S.C. 106), the

[[Page 26]]

disclosure of which would adversely impact its potential market value.
    (g) If release of the subject material would prejudice your 
commercial interests, give detailed written reasons that identify the 
specific information and the competitive harm it will cause to you, your 
organization, or your business. The Act requires we provide any 
reasonably segregable part of a record after deleting exempt parts. So, 
tell us if deleting key words or phrases would adequately protect your 
interests.
    (h) If you do not prove the probability of substantial harm to your 
competitive position or other commercial interests, we may be required 
to release the information. Records qualify for protections case by 
case.

    (7) Provide a review of decisions that deny individuals access to or 
amendment of their records.


<R05>
Sec. 806b.2  Violation penalties.

    An individual may file a civil suit against the Air Force for 
failing to comply with the Privacy Act. The courts may find an 
individual offender guilty of a misdemeanor and fine that individual

    (a) Willfully maintaining a system of records that doesn't meet the 
public notice requirements.
    (b) Disclosing information from a system of records to someone not 
entitled to the information.
    (c) Obtaining someone else's records under false pretenses.


<R05>
Sec. 806b.3  Personal notes.

    If you keep personal notes on individuals to use as memory aids to 
supervise or perform other official functions, and do not share them 
with others, and an Air Force directive does not require their 
maintenance, the Privacy Act does not apply.


<R05>
Sec. 806b.4  Responsibilities.

    (a) The Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Air Force 
(SAF/AA) manages the entire program.
    (b) The Office of the General Counsel to the Secretary of the Air

<R04>
      Subpart B--Obtaining Law Enforcement Records and Promises of 
                             Confidentiality


<R05>
Sec. 806b.5  Obtaining law enforcement records.

    The Commander AFOSI; the Chief, Air Force Security Police Agency 
(AFSPA); MAJCOM, FOA, and base chiefs of security police; AFOSI 
detachment commanders; and designees of those offices may ask another 
agency for records for law enforcement under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(7). The 
requesting office must indicate in writing the specific part of the 
record desired and identify the law enforcement activity asking for the 
record.


<R05>
Sec. 806b.6  Promising confidentiality.

    Record promises of confidentiality to exempt from disclosure any 
`confidential' information under subsections (k)(2), (k)(5), or (k)(7) 
of the Privacy Act.


<R04>
               Subpart C--Collecting Personal Information


<R05>
Sec.  806b.7  How to collect personal information.

    Collect personal information directly from the subject of the record 
when possible. You may ask third parties when:
    (a) You must verify information.
    (b) You want opinions or evaluations.
    (c) You can't contact the subject.
    (d) The subject asks you.


<R05>
Sec. 806b.8  When to give Privacy Act statements (PAS).

    (a) Give a PAS orally or in writing:
    (1) To anyone from whom you are collecting personal information that 
will be put in a system of records.
    (2) Whenever you ask someone for his or her Social Security Number 
(SSN).
    Note: Do this regardless of how you collect or record the answers. 
You may display a sign in areas where people routinely furnish this kind 
of information. Give a copy of the PAS if asked. Do not ask the person 
to sign the PAS.
    (3) A PAS must include four items:
    (i) Authority: The legal authority, that is, the United States Code 
or Executive Order authorizing the program the system supports.
    (ii) Purpose: The reason you are collecting the information.
    (iii) Routine Uses: A list of where and why the information will be 
disclosed outside DoD.
    (iv) Disclosure: Voluntary or Mandatory. (Use Mandatory only when 
disclosure is required by law and the individual will be penalized for 
not providing information.) Include any consequences of nondisclosure in 
nonthreatening language.


<R05>
Sec. 806b.9  Requesting the social security number (SSN).

    (a) Do not deny people a legal right, benefit, or privilege for 
refusing to give their SSNs unless the law requires disclosure, or a law 
or regulation adopted before January 1, 1975, required the SSN and the 
Air Force uses it to verify a person's identity in a system of records 
established before that date. When you ask for an SSN to create a 
record, tell the individual:

[[Page 29]]

    (1) The statute, regulation, or rule authorizing you to ask for the 
SSN.
    (2) The uses that will be made of the SSN.
    (3) If he or she is legally obligated to provide the SSN.
    (b) The Air Force requests an individual's SSN and provides the 
individual information required by law when anyone enters military 
service or becomes an Air Force civilian employee. The Air Force uses 
the SSN as a service or employment number to reference the individual's 
official records. When you ask someone for an SSN as identification (ID) 
to retrieve an existing record, you do not have to restate this 
information.
    (c) Executive Order 9397, November 22, 1943, authorizes using the 
SSN as a personal identifier. This order is not adequate authority to 
collect an SSN to create a record. When law does not require disclosing 
the SSN or when the system of records was created after January 1, 1975, 
you may ask for the SSN, but the individual does not have to disclose 
it. If the individual refuses to respond, use alternative means of 
identifying records.
    (d) SSNs are personal and unique to each individual. Protect them as 
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO). Do not disclose them to anyone without an 
official need to know.


<R04>
             Subpart D--Giving Access to Privacy Act Records


<R05>
Sec. 806b.10  Making a request for access.

    Persons or their designated representatives may ask for a copy of 
their records in a system of records. Requesters need not state why they 
want access to their records. Verify the identity of the requester to 
avoid unauthorized disclosures. How you verify identity will depend on 
the sensitivity of the requested records. Persons without access to 
notary services may use an unsworn declaration in the following format: 
`I declare under penalty of perjury (if outside the United States, add 
`under the laws of the United States of America') that the foregoing is 
true and correct. Executed on (date). (Signature).'


<R05>
Sec. 806b.11  Processing a request for access.

    Consider a request from an individual for his or her own records in 
a system of records under both the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and 
the Privacy Act regardless of the Act cited. The requester need not cite 
any Act. Process the request under whichever Act gives the most 
information. When necessary, tell the requester under which Act you 
processed the request and why.

    (a) Requesters should describe the records they want. They do not 
have to name a system of records number, but they should at least name a 
type of record or functional area. For requests that ask for `all 
records about me,' ask for more information and tell the person how to 
review the Air Force systems of records published in the Federal 
Register or in AFDIR 37-144 \1\, `Privacy Act Systems of Record' 
(formerly AFR 4-36).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Copies may be obtained at cost from the National Technical 
Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Requesters should not use government equipment, supplies, 
stationery, postage, telephones, or official mail channels for making 
Privacy Act requests. Privacy Act Officers and system managers process 
such requests but tell requesters that using government resources to 
make Privacy Act requests is not authorized.
    (c) Tell the requester if a record exists and how to review the 
record. If possible, respond to requests within 10 workdays of receiving 
them. If you cannot answer the request in 10 workdays, send a letter 
explaining why and give an approximate completion date no more than 20 
workdays after the first office received the request.
    (d) Show or give a copy of the record to the requester within 30 
workdays of receiving the request unless the system is exempt and the 
Air Force lists the exemption in appendix C of this part; or published 
as a final rule in the Federal Register. Give information in a form the 
requester can understand.
    (e) If the requester wants another person present during the record 
review, the system manager may ask for

[[Page 30]]

written consent to authorize discussing the record with another person 
present.


<R05>
Sec. 806b.12  Fees.

    Give the first 100 pages free, and charge only reproduction costs 
for the remainder. Copies cost $.15 per page; microfiche costs $.25 per 
fiche. Charge the fee for the first 100 pages if records show that the 
Air Force already responded to a request for the same records at no 
charge. Do not charge fees:
    (a) When the requester can get the record without charge under 
another publication (for example, medical records).
    (b) For search.
    (c) For reproducing a document for the convenience of the Air Force.
    (d) For reproducing a record so the requester can review it.


<R05>
Sec. 806b.13  Denying or limiting access.

    Process access denials within five workdays after you receive a 
request for access. When you may not release a record, send a copy of 
the request, the record, and why you recommend denying access (including 
the applicable exemption) to the denial authority through the Staff 
Judge Advocate (SJA) and the Privacy Act officer. The SJA gives a 
written legal opinion on the denial. The MAJCOM or FOA Privacy Act 
officer reviews the file, gets written advice from the SJA and the 
functional office of primary responsibility (OPR), and makes a 
recommendation to the denial authority. The denial authority sends the 
requester a letter with the decision. If the denial authority grants 
access, release the record. If the denial authority refuses access, tell 
the requester why and explain pertinent appeal rights.

    (a) Before you deny a request for access to a record, make sure 
that:
    (1) The system has an SAF approved exemption.
    (2) The exemption covers each document.
    (3) Nonexempt parts are segregated.

    (b) You may refuse to give out medical records if a physician 
believes that doing so could harm the person's mental or physical 
health. You have these options:
    (1) Ask the requester to get a letter from a physician to whom you 
can send the records. Include a letter explaining to the physician that 
giving the records directly to the individual could be harmful.
    (2) Offer the services of a military physician other than one who 
provided treatment if naming the physician poses a hardship on the 
individual.

    (c) Do not delete third-party information from a record when the 
subject requests access, except as noted in Sec. 806b.13(d), unless the 
Air Force covers the record with an established exemption (appendix C of 
this part). Presume that all information in a file pertains to the 
subject of the file.
    (d) Do not release third-party personal data (such as SSN and home 
address). This action is not a denial.
    (e) Withhold records compiled in connection with a civil action or 
other proceeding including any action where the Air Force expects 
judicial or administrative adjudicatory proceedings. This exemption does 
not cover criminal actions. Do not release attorney work products 
prepared before, during, or after the action or proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 806b.14  Denial authorities.

    These officials or a designee may deny access or amendment of 
records. Send a letter to SAF/AAIA with the position titles of 
designees. You must get SAF/AA approval before delegating this authority 
to a lower level. Send requests for waiver with justification to SAF/
AAIA. Authorities are:
    (a) DCSs and chiefs of comparable offices or higher level at SAF or 
HQ USAF.
    (b) MAJCOM or FOA commanders.
    (c) HQ USAF/DPCP, Pentagon, Washington, DC 20330-5060 (for civilian 
personnel records).
    (d) Commander, Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), 
Washington, DC 20332-6001 (for AFOSI records).


<R04>
                     Subpart E--Amending the Record


<R05>
Sec. 806b.15  Amendment reasons.

    Individuals may ask to have their records amended to make them 
accurate, timely, relevant, or complete.

[[Page 31]]

System managers routinely correct a record if the requester can show 
that it is factually wrong.


<R05>
Sec. 806b.16  Responding to amendment requests.

    (a) Anyone may request minor corrections orally. Requests for more 
serious modifications should be in writing.
    (b) After verifying the identity of the requester, make the change, 
notify all known recipients of the record, and inform the individual.
    (c) Acknowledge requests within 10 workdays of receipt. Give an 
expected completion date unless you complete the change within that 
time. Final decisions must take no longer than 30 workdays.


<R05>
Sec. 806b.17  Approving or denying a record amendment.

    The Air Force does not usually amend a record when the change is 
based on opinion, interpretation, or subjective official judgment. This 
action constitutes a denial, and requesters may appeal. If the system 
manager decides not to amend or partially amend the record, send a copy 
of the request, the record, and the recommended denial reasons to the 
denial authority through the SJA and the Privacy Act officer. SJAs will 
include a legal opinion.
    (a) The MAJCOM or FOA Privacy Act officer reviews the proposed 
denial, gets a legal opinion from the SJA and written advice from the 
functional OPR, and makes a recommendation to the denial authority.
    (b) The denial authority sends the requester a letter with the 
decision. If the denial authority approves the request, amend the record 
and notify all previous recipients that it has been changed. If the 
authority denies the request, give the requester the statutory 
authority, reason, and pertinent appeal rights.


<R05>
Sec. 806b.18  Seeking review of unfavorable agency determinations.

    Requesters should pursue record corrections of subjective matters 
and opinions through proper channels to the Civilian Personnel Office 
using grievance procedures or the Air Force Board for Correction of 
Military Records (AFBCMR). Record correction requests denied by the 
AFBCMR are not subject to further consideration under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 806b.19  Appeal procedures.

    (a) Individuals may request a denial review by writing to the 
Secretary of the Air Force through the denial authority within 60 
calendar days after receiving a denial letter. The denial authority 
promptly sends a complete appeal package to SAF/AAIA, including:
    (1) Original appeal letter.
    (2) Initial request.
    (3) Initial denial.
    (4) Copy of the record.
    (5) Any internal records or coordination actions relating to the 
denial.
    (6) Denial authority's comments on the appellant's arguments.
    (7) Legal reviews.

    (b) If the denial authority reverses an earlier denial and grants 
access or amendment, notify the requester immediately.
    (c) SAF/AAIA reviews the denial and forwards to SAF/GCA for legal 
review or staffing to grant or deny the appeal. SAF/GCA tells the 
requester the final Air Force decision and explains judicial review 
rights.
    (d) The requester may file a concise statement of disagreement with 
the system manager if SAF/GCA denies the request to amend the record. 
SAF/GCA explains the requester's rights when they issue the final appeal 
decision.

    (1) The records should clearly show that a statement of disagreement 
is filed with the record or separately.
    (2) The disputed part of the record must show that the requester 
filed a statement of disagreement.
    (3) Give copies of the statement of disagreement to the record's 
previous recipients. Inform subsequent record users about the dispute 
and give them a copy of the statement with the record.
    (4) The system manager may include a brief summary of the reasons 
for not amending the record. Limit the summary to the reasons SAF/GCA 
gave to the individual. The summary is part of the individual's record, 
but it is not subject to amendment procedures.

<R05>
Sec. 806b.20  Contents of Privacy Act case files.

    Do not keep copies of disputed records in this file. Use the file 
solely for statistics and to process requests. Do not use the case files 
to make any kind of determination about an individual. Document reasons 
for untimely responses. These files include:

    (a) Requests from and replies to individuals on whether a system has 
records about them.
    (b) Requests for access or amendment.
    (c) Approvals, denials, appeals, and final review actions.
    (d) Coordination actions and related papers.


<R04>
                  Subpart F--Privacy Act Notifications


<R05>
Sec. 806b.21  When to include a Privacy Act warning statement in publications.

    Include a Privacy Act Warning Statement in each Air Force 
publication that requires collecting or keeping personal information in 
a system of records. Also include the warning statement when 
publications direct collection of the SSN from the individual. The 
warning statement will cite legal authority and the system of records 
number and title. You can use the following warning statement: `This 
part requires collecting and maintaining information protected by the 
Privacy Act of 1974 authorized by (U.S.C. citation and or Executive 
Order number). System of records notice (number and title) applies.'


<R05>
Sec. 806b.22  Publishing system notices.

    The Air Force must publish notices in the Federal Register of new, 
amended, and deleted systems to inform the public of what records the 
Air Force keeps and give them an opportunity to comment. The Privacy Act 
also requires submission of new or significantly altered systems to the 
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and both houses of the Congress 
before publication in the Federal Register. This includes:

    (a) Starting a new system.
    (b) Instituting significant changes to an existing system.
    (c) Sending out data collection forms or instructions.
    (d) Issuing a request for proposal or invitation for bid to support 
a new system.


<R05>
Sec. 806b.23  Timing of notices.

    At least 120 days before the effective start date, system managers 
must send the system notice to SAF/AAIA on a 5 1/4 or 3 1/2-inch disk in 
Wordstar (ASCII text file) or Microsoft Word, with a paper copy 
highlighting any changes through the MAJCOM or FOA Privacy Act Officer. 
See Appendix B of this part for a sample system notice.


<R04>
             Subpart G--Protecting and Disposing of Records


<R05>
Sec. 806b.24  Protecting records.

    Protect information according to its sensitivity level. Consider the 
personal sensitivity of the information and the risk of loss or 
alteration. Most information in systems of records is FOR OFFICIAL USE 
ONLY (FOUO). Refer to AFI 37-131 \2\, `Air Force Freedom of Information 
Act Program,' for protection methods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ See footnote 1 to section 806b.11, of this part.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 806b.25  Balancing protection.

    Balance additional protection against risk and cost. AF Form 3227, 
`Privacy Act Cover Sheet', is available for use with Privacy Act 
material. For example, a password may be enough protection for an 
automated system with a log-on protocol. Classified computer systems or 
those with established audit and password systems are obviously less 
vulnerable than unprotected files or word processors in offices that are 
periodically empty. Follow AFI 33-202 \3\, `The Air Force Computer 
Security Program,' for procedures on safeguarding personal information 
in automated records.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See footnote 1 to section 806b.11, of this part.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 33]]


<R05>
Sec. 806b.26  Disposing of records.

    You may use the following methods to dispose of records protected by 
the Privacy Act according to records retention schedules:

    (a) Destroy by any method that prevents compromise, such as tearing, 
burning, or shredding, so long as the personal data is not recognizable 
and beyond reconstruction.
    (b) Degauss or overwrite magnetic tapes or other magnetic medium.
    (c) Dispose of paper products through the Defense Reutilization and 
Marketing Office (DRMO) or through activities who manage a base-wide 
recycling program. The recycling sales contract must contain a clause 
requiring the contractor to safeguard privacy material until its 
destruction and to pulp, macerate, shred, or otherwise completely 
destroy the records. Originators must safeguard Privacy Act material 
until it is transferred to the recycling contractor. A federal employee 
or, if authorized, a contractor employee must witness the destruction. 
This transfer does not require a disclosure accounting.


<R04>
                    Subpart H--Privacy Act Exemptions


<R05>
Sec. 806b.27  Requesting an exemption.

    A system manager who believes that a system needs an exemption from 
some or all of the requirements of the Privacy Act should send a request 
to SAF/AAIA through the MAJCOM or FOA Privacy Act Officer. The request 
should detail the reasons for the exemption and the section of the Act 
that allows the exemption. SAF/AAIA gets approval for the request 
through SAF/AA and the Defense Privacy Office.


<R05>
Sec. 806b.28  Exemption types.

    (a) A general exemption frees a system from most parts of the 
Privacy Act.
    (b) A specific exemption frees a system from only a few parts of the 
Privacy Act.


<R05>
Sec. 806b.29  Authorizing exemptions.

    Only SAF/AA can exempt systems of records from any part of the 
Privacy Act. Denial authorities can withhold records using these 
exemptions only if SAF/AA previously approved and published an exemption 
for the system in the Federal Register. Appendix C of this part lists 
the systems of records that have approved exemptions.


<R05>
Sec. 806b.30  Approved exemptions.

    Approved exemptions exist under 5 U.S.C. 552a for:
    (a) Certain systems of records used by activities whose principal 
function is criminal law enforcement (subsection (j)(2)).
    (b) Classified information in any system of records (subsection 
(k)(1)).
    (c) Law enforcement records (other than those covered by subsection 
(j)(2)). The Air Force must allow an individual access to any record 
that is used to deny rights, privileges or benefits to which he or she 
would otherwise be entitled by federal law or for which he or she would 
otherwise be eligible as a result of the maintenance of the information 
(unless doing so would reveal a confidential source) (subsection 
(k)(2)).
    (d) Statistical records required by law. Data is for statistical use 
only and may not be used to decide individuals' rights, benefits, or 
entitlements (subsection (k)(4)).
    (e) Data to determine suitability, eligibility, or qualifications 
for federal service or contracts, or access to classified information if 
access would reveal a confidential source (subsection (k)(5)).
    (f) Qualification tests for appointment or promotion in the federal 
service if access to this information would compromise the objectivity 
of the tests (subsection (k)(6)).
    (g) Information which the Armed Forces uses to evaluate potential 
for promotion if access to this information would reveal a confidential 
source (subsection (k)(7)).

<R04>
             Subpart I--Disclosing Records to Third Parties


<R05>
Sec. 806b.31  Disclosure considerations.

    Before releasing personal information to third parties, consider the 
consequences, check accuracy, and make sure that no law or directive 
bans disclosure. You can release personal information to third parties 
when the subject agrees orally or in writing. Air Force members consent 
to releasing their home telephone number and address when they sign and 
check the `Do Consent' block on the AF Form 624, `Base/Unit Locator and 
PSC Directory' (see AFI 37-129 \4\, `Base and Unit Personnel Locators 
and Postal Directories').

    \4\ See footnote 1 to section 806b.11, of this part.

    (a) Before including personal information such as home addresses, 
home phones, and similar information on social rosters or directories, 
ask for written consent statements. Otherwise, do not include the 
information.
    (b) You must get written consent before releasing any of these items 
of information:
    (1) Marital status.
    (2) Number and sex of dependents.
    (3) Gross salary of military personnel (see Sec. 806b.32 for 
releasable pay information).
    (4) Civilian educational degrees and major areas of study.
    (5) School and year of graduation.
    (6) Home of record.
    (7) Home address and phone.
    (8) Age and date of birth.
    (9) Present or future assignments for overseas or for routinely 
deployable or sensitive units.
    (10) Office and unit address and duty phone for overseas or for 
routinely deployable or sensitive units.


<R05>
Sec. 806b.32  Disclosing information for which consent is not required.

    You don't need consent before releasing any of these items:
    (a) Information releasable under the FOIA.
    (b) Information for use within the Department of Defense by 
officials or employees with a need to know.
    (c) Name.
    (d) Rank.
    (e) Grade.
    (f) Air Force specialty code (AFSC).
    (g) Pay (including base pay, special pay, all allowances except 
Basic Allowance for Quarters (BAQ) and Variable Housing Allowance 
(VHA)).
    (h) Gross salary for civilians.
    (i) Past duty assignments.
    (j) Present and future approved and announced stateside assignments.
    (k) Position title.
    (l) Office, unit address, and duty phone number.
    (m) Date of rank.
    (n) Entered on active duty (EAD) date.
    (o) Pay date.
    (p) Source of commission.
    (q) Professional military education.
    (r) Promotion sequence number.
    (s) Military awards and decorations.
    (t) Duty status of active, retired, or reserve.
    (u) Active duty official attendance at technical, scientific, or 
professional meetings.
    (v) Biographies and photos of key personnel.


<R05>
Sec. 806b.33  Disclosing other information.

    Use these guidelines to decide whether to release information:
    (a) Would the subject have a reasonable expectation of privacy in 
the information requested?
    (b) Would disclosing the information benefit the general public? The 
Air Force considers information as meeting the public interest standard 
if it reveals anything regarding the operations or activities of the 
agency, or performance of its statutory duties.
    (c) Balance the public interest against the individual's probable 
loss of privacy. Do not consider the requester's purpose, circumstances, 
or proposed use.


<R05>
Sec. 806b.34  Agencies or individuals to whom the Air Force may release privacy information.

    The Air Force may release information without consent to these 
individuals or agencies:
    (a) Agencies outside the Department of Defense for a Routine Use 
published in the Federal Register. The purpose

[[Page 35]]

of the disclosure must be compatible with the purpose in the Routine 
Use. When initially collecting the information from the subject, the 
Routine Uses block in the Privacy Act Statement must name the agencies 
and reason.
    (b) The Bureau of the Census to plan or carry out a census or survey 
under 13 U.S.C. 8.
    (c) A recipient for statistical research or reporting. The recipient 
must give advanced written assurance that the information is for 
statistical purposes only.
    Note: No one may use any part of the record to decide on 
individuals' rights, benefits, or entitlements. You must release records 
in a format that makes it impossible to identify the real subjects.
    (d) The Archivist of the United States and the National Archives and 
Records Administration (NARA) to evaluate records for permanent 
retention. Records stored in Federal Records Centers remain under Air 
Force control.
    (e) A federal, state, or local agency (other than the Department of 
Defense) for civil or criminal law enforcement. The head of the agency 
or a designee must send a written request to the system manager 
specifying the record or part needed and the law enforcement purpose. 
The system manager may also disclose a record to a law enforcement 
agency if the agency suspects a criminal violation. This disclosure is a 
Routine Use for all Air Force systems of records and is published in the 
Federal Register.
    (f) An individual or agency that needs the information for 
compelling health or safety reasons. The affected individual need not be 
the record subject.
    (g) The Congress, a congressional committee, or a subcommittee, for 
matters within their jurisdictions.
    (h) A congressional office acting for the record subject. A 
published, blanket Routine Use permits this disclosure. If the material 
for release is sensitive, get a release statement.
    (i) The Comptroller General or an authorized representative of the 
General Accounting Office on business.
    (j) A court order of a court of competent jurisdiction, signed by a 
judge.
    (k) A consumer credit agency according to the Debt Collections Act 
when a published system notice lists this disclosure as a Routine Use.
    (l) A contractor operating a system of records under an Air Force 
contract. Records maintained by the contractor for the management of 
contractor employees are not subject to the Privacy Act.


<R05>
Sec. 806b.35  Disclosing the medical records of minors.

    Air Force personnel may disclose the medical records of minors to 
their parents or legal guardians. The laws of each state define the age 
of majority.
    (a) The Air Force must obey state laws protecting medical records of 
drug or alcohol abuse treatment, abortion, and birth control. If you 
manage medical records, learn the local laws and coordinate proposed 
local policies with the servicing SJA.
    (b) Outside the United States (overseas), the age of majority is 18. 
Unless parents or guardians have a court order granting access or the 
minor's written consent, they will not have access to minor's medical 
records overseas when the minor sought or consented to treatment between 
the ages of 15 and 17 in a program where regulation or statute provides 
confidentiality of records and he or she asked for confidentiality.


<R05>
Sec. 806b.36  Disclosure accountings.

    System managers must keep an accurate record of all disclosures made 
from any system of records except disclosures to DoD personnel for 
official use or disclosures under the FOIA. System managers may use AF 
Form 771, `Accounting of Disclosures'.
    (a) System managers may file the accounting record any way they want 
as long as they give it to the subject on request, send corrected or 
disputed information to previous record recipients, explain any 
disclosures, and provide an audit trail for reviews. Include in each 
accounting:

    (1) Release date.
    (2) Description of information.
    (3) Reason for release.
    (4) Name and address of recipient.
    (b) Some exempt systems let you withhold the accounting record from 
the subject.
    (c) You may withhold information about disclosure accountings for 
law

[[Page 36]]

enforcement purposes at the law enforcement agency's request.


<R05>
Sec. 806b.37  Computer matching.

    Computer matching programs electronically compare records from two 
or more automated systems which may include the Department of Defense, 
another federal agency, or a state or other local government. A system 
manager proposing a match that could result in an adverse action against 
a federal employee must meet these requirements of the Privacy Act:
    (a) Prepare a written agreement between participants.
    (1) Secure approval of the Defense Data Integrity Board.
    (2) Publish a matching notice in the Federal Register before 
matching begins.
    (3) Ensure full investigation and due process.
    (4) Act on the information, as necessary.
    (b) The Privacy Act applies to matching programs that use records 
from:
    (1) Federal personnel or payroll systems.
    (2) Federal benefit programs where matching:
    (i) Determines federal benefit eligibility,
    (ii) Checks on compliance with benefit program requirements,
    (iii) Recovers improper payments or delinquent debts from current or 
former beneficiaries.
    (c) Matches used for statistics, pilot programs, law enforcement, 
tax administration, routine administration, background checks and 
foreign counterintelligence, and internal matching that won't cause any 
adverse action are exempt from Privacy Act matching requirements.
    (d) Any activity that expects to participate in a matching program 
must contact SAF/AAIA immediately. System managers must prepare a notice 
for publication in the Federal Register with a Routine Use that allows 
disclosing the information for use in a matching program. Send the 
proposed system notice to SAF/AAIA. Allow 180 days for processing 
requests for a new matching program.
    (e) Record subjects must receive prior notice of a match. The best 
way to do this is to include notice in the Privacy Act Statement on 
forms used in applying for benefits. Coordinate computer matching 
statements on forms with SAF/AAIA through the MAJCOM Privacy Act 
Officer.


<R04>
                           Subpart J--Training


<R05>
Sec. 806b.38  Who needs training.

    The Privacy Act requires training for all persons involved in the 
design, development, operation and maintenance of any system of records. 
Some persons may need more specialized training. They include 
information managers, supervisors, and individuals working with medical, 
financial, security, and personnel records.


<R05>
Sec. 806b.39  Training tools.

    Helpful aids include:
    (a) AFH 37-146 \5\, `Privacy Act Training', a self-paced course.

    (b) `The Privacy Act of 1974,' a 32-minute film developed by the 
Defense Privacy Office. Consult your local audiovisual library.
    (c) `A Manager's Overview, What You Need to Know About the Privacy 
Act'. Contact SAF/AAIA for copies.

    Note: Formal school training groups that develop or modify blocks of 
instruction must send the material to SAF/AAIA for coordination.


<R04>
                    Subpart K--Privacy Act Reporting


<R05>
Sec. 806b.40  Privacy Act Report (RCS: DD-DA&M(A)1379).

    (ii) Authority-5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7).
    (iii) Reasons-Subsection (c)(3) because making the disclosure 
accounting available to the individual may compromise express promises 
of confidentiality by revealing details about the report and identify 
other record sources, which may result in circumvention of the access 
exemption.
    Subsection (d) because individual disclosure compromises express 
promises of confidentiality conferred to protect the integrity of the 
promotion rating system.
    Subsection (e)(4)(H) because of and to the extent that portions of 
this record system are exempt from the individual access provisions of 
subsection (d).

    (i) Exemption. This system is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d); 
(e)(4)(G), (H), and (I); and (f), but only to the extent that disclosure 
would reveal the identity of a confidential source.
    (ii) Authority. 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7).
    (iii) Reasons. To protect the integrity of information used in the 
Reserve Initial Brigadier General Screening Board, the release of which 
would compromise the selection process.

    (10) System identification and name: F035 AF MP P, General Officer 
Personnel Data System.
    (i) Exemption-Air Force General Officer Promotion and Effectiveness 
Reports with close out dates on or before January 31, 1991, may be 
exempt from subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d); (e)(4)(H); and (f).
    (ii) Authority-5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7).
    (iii) Reason-Subsection (c)(3) because making the disclosure 
accounting available to the individual may compromise express promises 
of confidentiality by revealing details about the report and identify 
other record sources, which may result in circumvention of the access 
exemption.

[[Page 41]]

    Subsection (d) because individual disclosure compromises express 
promises of confidentiality conferred to protect the integrity of the 
promotion rating system.
    Subsection (e)(4)(H) because of and to the extent that portions of 
this record system are exempt from the individual access provisions of 
subsection (d).
    Subsection (f) because of and to the extent that portions of this 
record system are exempt from the individual access provisions of 
subsection (d).
    (11) System identifier and name: F035 MPC L, Historical Airman 
Promotion Master Test File.
    (i) Exemption. This system is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d); 
(e)(4) (G), (H), and (I); and (f).
    (ii) Authority. 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6).
    (iii) Reasons. To protect the integrity, objectivity, and equity of 
the promotion testing system by keeping test questions and answers in 
confidence.

    (12) System identifier and name: F120 AF IG B, Inspector General 
Records.
    (i) Exemption. This system is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d); 
(e)(4) (G), (H), and (I); and (f). However, if a person is denied any 
right, privilege, or benefit, he or she would otherwise be entitled to 
as a result of keeping this material, it must be released, unless doing 
so would reveal the identity of a confidential source.
    (ii) Authority. 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2).
    (iii) Reasons. Granting individuals access to information collected 
while an Inspector General inquiry is in progress could interfere with 
the just, thorough, and timely resolution of the complaint or inquiry 
and could possibly enable individuals to conceal wrong doing or mislead 
the inquiring officer. Disclosure might also subject sources, witnesses, 
and their families to harassment or intimidation.
    (13) System identifier and name: F124 AFOSI B, Investigative 
Applicant Processing Records.
    (i) Exemption. This system is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d);

    (ii) Authority. 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5).
    (iii) Reasons. To protect those who gave information in confidence 
during Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) applicant 
inquiries. Fear of harassment could cause sources not to make frank and 
open responses about applicant qualifications. This could compromise the 
integrity of the AFOSI personnel program that relies on selecting only 
qualified people.

    (14) System identifier and name: F035 AFB B, Master Cadet Personnel 
Record (Active/Historical).
    (i) Exemptions. Parts of these systems are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 
552a(d), (e)(4)(H), and (f), but only to the extent that they would 
reveal the identity of a confidential source.
    (ii) Authority. 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7).
    (iii) Reasons. To maintain the candor and integrity of comments 
needed to evaluate a cadet for commissioning in the Air Force.

    (15) System identifier and name: F205 AFISA A, Sensitive 
Compartmented Information Personnel Records.
    (i) Exemption. This system is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(3); (d); 
(e)(4) (G), (H), and (I); and (f), but only to the extent that 
disclosure would reveal the identity of a confidential source.
    (ii) Authority. 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and (k)(5).
    (iii) Reasons. To protect the identity of sources to whom proper 
promises of confidentiality have been made during investigations. 
Without these promises, sources will often be unwilling to provide 
information essential in adjudicating access in a fair and impartial 
manner.

    (16) F124 AFA, Security and Related Investigative Records.
    (i) Exemption. This system is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d);

    (ii) Authority. 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5).
    (iii) Reasons. To protect the identity of those who give information 
in confidence for personnel security and related investigations. Fear of 
harassment could cause sources to refuse to give this information in the 
frank and open way needed to pinpoint those areas in an investigation 
that should be expanded to resolve charges of questionable conduct.

    (17) System identifier and name: F205 AFSCO A, Special Security Case 
Files.
    (i) Exemption. This system is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d),

    (ii) Authority. 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5).
    (iii) Reasons. To protect the identity of those who give information 
in confidence for personnel security and related investigations. Fear of

frank and open way needed to pinpoint those areas in an investigation 
that should be expanded to resolve charges of questionable conduct.

    (18) System identifier and name: F205 AF SP A, Special Security 
Files.
    (i) Exemption. This system is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d); 
(e)(4) (G), (H), and (I); and (f), but only to the extent that 
disclosure would reveal the identity of a confidential source.
    (ii) Authority. 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5).

[[Page 42]]

    (ii) Reasons. To protect the identity of those who give information 
in confidence for personnel security and related investigations. Fear of 
harassment could cause them to refuse to give this information in the 
frank and open way needed to pinpoint areas in an investigation that 
should be expanded to resolve charges of questionable conduct.

    (19) System identifier and name: F035 AF MP R, Applications for 
Appointment and Extended Active Duty Files.
    (i) Exemption. Parts of this system of records are exempt from 5 
U.S.C. 552a(d), but only to the extent that disclosure would reveal the 
identity of a confidential source.
    (ii) Authority.5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5).
    (iii)Reasons. To protect the identity of confidential sources who 
furnish information necessary to make determinations about the 
qualifications, eligibility, and suitability of health care 
professionals who apply for Reserve of the Air Force appointment or 
interservice transfer to the Air Force.
    (20) System identifier and name: F111 AF JA B, Courts-Martial and 
Article 15 Records.
    (i) Exemption. Portions of this system of records may be exempt 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) from the following subsection of 5 
U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (c)(4), (d), (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3), (e)(4)(G), (H) 
and (I), (e)(5), (e)(8), (f), and (g).
    (ii) Exemption. Portions of this system of records may be exempt 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) from the following subsection of 5 
U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), and (f).
    (iii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and (k)(2).
    (iv) Reason: (1) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of the 
disclosure accounting, for disclosures pursuant to the routine uses 
published for this system, would permit the subject of a criminal 
investigation or matter under investigation to obtain valuable 
information concerning the nature of that investigation which will 
present a serious impediment to law enforcement.
    (2) From subsection (c)(4) because an exemption is being claimed for 
subsection (d), this subsection will not be applicable.
    (3) From subsection (d) because access to the records contained in 
this system would inform the subject of a criminal investigation of the 
existence of that investigation, provide the subject of the 
investigation with information that might enable him to avoid detection 
or apprehension, and would present a serious impediment to law 
enforcement.
    (4) From subsection (e)(1) because in the course of criminal 
investigations information is often obtained concerning the violation of 
laws or civil obligations of others not relating to an active case or 
matter. In the interests of effective law enforcement, it is necessary 
that this information be retained since it can aid in establishing 
patterns of activity and provide valuable leads for other agencies and 
future cases that may be brought.
    (5) From subsection (e)(2) because in a criminal investigation the 
requirement that information be collected to the greatest extent 
possible from the subject individual would present a serious impediment 
to law enforcement in that the subject of the investigation would be 
placed on notice of the existence of the investigation and would 
therefore be able to avoid detection.
    (6) From subsection (e)(3) because the requirement that individuals 
supplying information be provided with a form stating the requirements 
of subsection (e)(3) would constitute a serious impediment to law 
enforcement in that it could compromise the existence of a confidential 
investigation, reveal the identity of confidential sources of 
information and endanger the life and physical safety of confidential 
informants.
    (7) From subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H) because this system of 
records is exempt from individual access pursuant to subsections (j) and 
(k) of the Privacy Act of 1974.
    (8) From subsection (e)(4)(I) because the identity of specific 
sources must be withheld in order to protect the confidentiality of the 
sources of criminal and other law enforcement information. This 
exemption is further necessary to protect the privacy and physical 
safety of witnesses and informants.
    (9) From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection of information 
for law enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in advance 
what information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. With the 
passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may 
acquire new significance as further investigation brings new details to 
light and the accuracy of such

[[Page 43]]

information can only be determined in a court of law. The restrictions 
of subsection (e)(5) would restrict the ability of trained investigators 
and intelligence analysts to exercise their judgment in reporting on 
investigations and impede the development of intelligence necessary for 
effective law enforcement.
    (10) From subsection (e)(8) because the individual notice 
requirements of subsection (e)(8) could present a serious impediment to 
law enforcement as this could interfere with the ability to issue search 
authorizations and could reveal investigative techniques and procedures.
    (11) From subsection (f) because this system of records has been 
exempted from the access provisions of subsection (d).
    (12) From subsection (g) because this system of records is compiled 
for law enforcement purposes and has been exempted from the access 
provisions of subsections (d) and (f).
    (13) Consistent with the legislative purpose of the Privacy Act of 
1974, the Department of the Air Force will grant access to nonexempt 
material in the records being maintained. Disclosure will be governed by 
the Department of the Air Force's Privacy Regulation, but will be 
limited to the extent that the identity of confidential sources will not 
be compromised; subjects of an investigation of an actual or potential 
criminal violation will not be alerted to the investigation; the 
physical safety of witnesses, informants and law enforcement personnel 
will not be endangered, the privacy of third parties will not be 
violated; and that the disclosure would not otherwise impede effective 
law enforcement. Whenever possible, information of the above nature will 
be deleted from the requested documents and the balance made available. 
The controlling principle behind this limited access is to allow 
disclosures except those indicated above. The decisions to release 
information from these systems will be made on a case-by-case basis.

    (a) Unaltered Air Force publications and forms will be made 
available to the public with or without charge, subject to the 
requirements of this part. Base Chiefs of Information Management will 
set up procedures to meet these needs and will make available Master 
Publications Libraries for public use according to AFR 4-61. They will 
also advise requesters that these libraries are available, since in many 
cases this will satisfy their needs and reduce workloads in processing 
sales requests. If the item is on sale by the Superintendent of 
Documents, GPO, refer the request to that outlet. Refer general public 
requests for Air Force administrative publications and forms to the 
National Technical Information Service (NTIS), Defense Publication 
Section, US Department of Commerce, 4285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, 
VA 22161-0001.
    (b) The Air Force does not consider these unaltered publications and 
forms as records, within the meaning of the Freedom of Information Act 
(FOIA), as outlined in 5 U.S.C. 552 and implemented by part 806 of this 
chapter. Refer requests that invoke the FOIA to the chief, base 
information management, for processing.
    (c) Units will process requests under the Foreign Military Sales 
Program (FMS) as specified in AFR 4-71, chapter 11.
    (d) Units will send requests from foreign governments, their 
representatives, or international organizations to the MAJCOM foreign 
disclosure policy

office and to HQ USAF/CVAII, Washington DC 20330-5000. Also send 
information copies of such requests to the base public affairs office. 
Commands will supplement this requirement to include policies pertaining 
to those items for which they have authority to release.
    (e) Units will return a request for non-Air Force items to the 
requester for submission to appropriate agency.


<R05>
Sec. 807.2  Charges for publications and forms.

    (a) The Air Force applies charges to all requests unless 
specifically excluded.
    (b) The Air Force applies charges according to part 813, Schedule of 
Fees for Copying, Certifying, and Searching Records and Other 
Documentary Material. Additional guidance is in part 812, User Charges, 
including specific exclusion from charges as listed in Sec. 812.5. As 
indicated, the list of exclusions is not all inclusive and 
recommendations for additional exclusions are sent to the office of 
primary responsibility for part 812 of this chapter.
    (c) When a contractor requires publications and forms to perform a 
contract, the Air Force furnishes them without charge, if the government 
contracting officer approves these requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 807.3  Requests for classified material, For Official Use Only material, accountable forms, storage safeguard forms, Limited (L) distribution items, and 
          items with restrictive distribution caveats.

    (a) Classified material. The unit receiving the requests should tell 
the requester that the Air Force cannot authorize the material for 
release because it is currently and properly classified in the interest 
of national security as authority by Executive Order, and must be 
protected from unauthorized disclosure.
    (b) For Official Use Only (FOUO) material. The office of primary

<R05>
Sec. 809a.0  Purpose.

    This part prescribes the commanders' responsibilities for enforcing 
order at and in the vicinity of installations under their jurisdiction. 
It provides guidance for the use of Air Force resources in controlling 
civil disturbances and in supporting disaster relief operations. This 
part applies to installations in the continental United States and will 
be used to the maximum extent possible in the overseas commands, the 
States of Alaska and Hawaii, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the 
territories and possessions of the United States. Instructions issued by 
the appropriate unified commander, status of forces agreements, and 
other international agreements provide more definitive guidance for the 
overseas commands. Nothing in this part should be construed as 
authorizing or requiring security police units to collect and maintain 
information concerning persons or organizations having no affiliation 
with the Air Force.

<R04>
   Subpart A--Enforcement of Order at or Near Air Force Installations


<R05>
Sec. 809a.1  Military responsibility and authority.

    (a) Air Force installation commanders are responsible for protecting 
personnel and property under their jurisdictions and for maintaining 
order on installations, to insure the uninterrupted and successful 
accomplishment of the Air Force mission.
    (b) Each commander is authorized to grant or deny access to his 
installations, and to exclude or remove persons whose presence is 
unauthorized. In excluding or removing persons from the installation, he 
must not act in an arbitrary or capricious manner. His action must be 
reasonable in relation to his responsibility to protect and to preserve 
order on the installation and to safeguard persons and property thereon. 
As far as practicable, he should prescribe by regulation the rules and 
conditions governing access to his installation.

[37 FR 18728, Sept. 15, 1972]


<R05>
Sec. 809a.2  Civil responsibility and authority.

    Local civil authorities are primarily responsible for maintaining 
order outside the perimeter of an installation. If assistance from civil 
authorities is insufficient, and the installation commander believes 
that the employment of Air Force resources is essential, he should send 
a request for instructions and a report of the circumstances to Hq USAF 
per Joint Chiefs of Staff

[[Page 46]]

(JCS) Pub. 6, Volume V, U.S. Air Force Reporting Instruction, June 1970. 
Unless an emergency involves imminent danger to personnel or property 
under the commander's jurisdiction, he is not authorized to act before 
instructions are received.

[33 FR 4462, Mar. 13, 1968, as amended at 37 FR 18728, Sept. 15, 1972]


<R05>
Sec. 809a.3  Unauthorized entry to installations.

    Removal of violators: If unauthorized entry occurs, the violators 
may be apprehended, ordered to leave, and escorted off the installation 
by personnel carefully selected for such duties. The complete and proper 
identification of violators, including the taking of photographs, must 
be accomplished. Violators who reenter an installation--after having 
been removed from it or having been ordered, by an officer or person in 
command or charge, not to reenter--may be prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. 
1382. If prosecution for subsequent reentry is contemplated, the order 
not to reenter should be in writing so as to be easily susceptible of 
proof. Commanders are cautioned that only civil law enforcement 
authorities have the power to arrest and prosecute for unauthorized 
entry of government property.

[33 FR 4462, Mar. 13, 1968, as amended at 37 FR 18728, Sept. 15, 1972]


<R05>
Sec. 809a.4  Use of Government facilities.

    Commanders are prohibited from authorizing demonstrations for 
partisan political purposes but other demonstrations may or may not be 
authorized only in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3e, AFR 
35-15. They are not to volunteer public statements on demonstrations or 
possible demonstrations.

                              and Disasters


<R05>
Sec. 809a.5  Definitions.

    (a) Emergencies. These are conditions which affect public welfare 
and occur as a result of enemy attack, insurrection, civil disturbances, 
earthquake, fire, flood, or other public disasters which endanger life 
and property or disrupt the usual process of government. The term 
``emergency'' includes any or all of the conditions explained in this 
section.
    (b) Civil defense emergency.  This is a disaster situation resulting 
from devastation created by an enemy attack and requiring emergency 
operations during and following attack. It may also be proclaimed by 
appropriate authority in anticipation of an attack.
    (c) Civil disturbances.  These are goup acts of violence or disorder 
prejudicial to public law and order including those which follow a major 
disaster. They include riots, acts of violence, insurrections, unlawful 
obstructions or assemblages, or other disorders.
    (d) Major disaster. Any flood, fire, hurricane, or other catastrophe 
which, in the determination of the President, is or threatens to be of 
sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant disaster assistance by the 
Federal Government to supplement the efforts and available resources of 
the State and local governments in alleviating the damage, hardship, or 
suffering caused thereby.

[33 FR 4462, Mar. 13, 1968, as amended at 37 FR 18728, Sept. 15, 1972; 
37 FR 20243, Sept. 28, 1972]


<R05>
Sec. 809a.6  Base policies and laws.

    This subpart contains policies on the use of Air Force military 
personnel in civil disturbances and disasters. The more important laws 
concerning military aid to civil authorities are also summarized.
    (a) The Air Force gives military assistance to civil authorities in 
civil defense or civil disturbances and disasters only when such 
asistance is requested or directed. Commanders will not undertake such 
assistance without authority, unless the overruling demands of humanity 
compel immediate action to protect life and property and to restore 
order.
    (b) The military service having available resources nearest the 
affected area is responsible for providing initial assistance to civil 
authorities in emergencies. Subsequent operations are to be according to 
the mutual agreement between the senior service commanders concerned.

[[Page 47]]

    (c) The protection of life and property and the maintenance of law 
and order within the territorial jurisdiction of any State is the 
primary responsibility of State and local authorities. It is well-
established U.S. Government policy that intervention with military 
forces takes place only after State and local authorities have used 
their own forces and are unable to control the situation, or when they 
do not take appropriate action.

[33 FR 4462, Mar. 13, 1968]


<R05>
Sec. 809a.7  Conditions for use of Air Force resources.

    This part is not intended to extend Air Force responsibilities in 
emergencies to generate additional resources (manpower, materiel, 
facilities, etc.) requirements, or encourage participation in such 
operations at the expense of the Air Force primary mission. It is a 
guide for the employment of Air Force resources when:
    (a) A disaster or disturbance occcurs in areas in which the U.S. Air 
Force is the executive agent of the United States.
    (b) A disaster or disturbance occurs in areas that are remote from 
an Army installation but near an Air Force installation, thereby 
necessitating Air Force assumption of responsibility pending arrival of 
Army personnel.
    (c) The overriding demand of conditions resulting from a natural 
disaster compels immediate action to protect life and property and to 
restore order.

[33 FR 4462, Mar. 13, 1968, as amended at 37 FR 18728, Sept. 15, 1972]


<R05>
Sec. 809a.8  Military Commanders' responsibilities.

    (a) Civilians in the affected area will be informed of the rules of 
conduct and other restrictive measures to be enforced by the military. 
These will be announced by local proclamation or order, and will be 
given the widest publicity by all available media.
    (b) Persons not normally subject to military law, who are taken into 
custody by military forces incident to civil disturbances, will be 
turned over to the civil authorities as soon as possible.
    (c) Military forces will ordinarily exercise police powers 
previously inoperative in an affected area; restore and maintain order; 
maintain essential transportation and communication; and provide 
necessary relief measures.
    (d) U.S. Air Force civilian employees may be used, in any 
assignments in which they are capable and willing to serve. In planning 
for on-base contingencies of fires, floods, hurricanes, and other 
natural disasters, arrangements should be made for the identification 
and voluntary use of individual employees to the extent that the needs 
for their services are anticipated.

[33 FR 4462, Mar. 13, 1968, as amended at 37 FR 18728, Sept. 15, 1972]


<R04>
          Subpart C--Special Considerations for Overseas Areas


<R05>
Sec. 809a.9  General.

    The use of Air Force personnel in overseas areas poses unique 
problems inasmuch as their use is governed by national laws of the 
country concerned and by the terms of international pact or bilateral 
agreements to which the United States is signatory.

[37 FR 18729, Sept. 15, 1972]


<R05>
Sec. 809a.10  Requirements for supplements.

    The implementation of policies relating to overseas areas must 
conform to the pertinent terms of the status of forces agreement under 
which a U.S. Force may be stationed in the foreign host country 
concerned. Accordingly, major commands must prepare individual 
supplements to this part for each country in which they have units 
stationed. These supplements shall contain specific policy and guidance 
on the use of Air Force personnel. It is essential that each commander 
clearly understands the status of his installation or base, including 
that of all sub bases, annexes, housing areas, etc.

international organizations or their representatives.


<R05>
Sec. 811.4   Policy on the dissemination and sale of VI products.

    (a) Sale of VI material. Although copies of Air Force VI products 
may be sold, Air Force policy prohibits competition with commercial 
industry. When VI materials are sold outside the Federal Government, 
charges and fees must be assessed according to part 812.
    (b) Dissemination of VI material to state and local governments. 
Copies of VI materials that meet the requirements of this part may be 
loaned or sold to state and local governments, or any tax exempt 
organization under Title III of the 1968 Intergovernmental Cooperation 
Act. The requester must certify that the materials are not available 
from commercial sources. The Air Force Central Visual Information 
Library (AFCVIL), managed by 1352d Audiovisual Squadron, Norton AFB CA 
92409-5996, is the central source for loan of current, completed Air

sale. Reproductions of the original may be sold. HQ USAF/SCV may 
authorize the loan of copies or duplicates of original material for 
Federal Government use. SAF/PA may lend copies of original material to 
agencies outside the Federal Government and to the public.
    (1) DOD VI records centers use only government-owned VI material in 
servicing approved requests for dissemination and sale. The use of 
nongovernment VI material requires written permission from the owner.
    (2) Production of material for sale must not stop or slow official 
Air Force work or be used to justify facility expansion or additional 
manpower.

PART 811a--VISUAL INFORMATION DOCUMENTATION (VIDOC) PROGRAM--Table of Contents

<R05>


Sec.
811a.1  Purpose.
811a.2  Material sources for the VIDOC program.
811a.3  Disposition of VI documentation materials.

    Authority: 10 U.S.C. 8013.

    Source: 52 FR 48681, Dec. 24, 1987, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 811a.1  Purpose.

    This part establishes policy for the management of the Air Force 
visual information documentation (VIDOC) program. It implements 
Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5040.2 and describes how the 
program is accomplished. It applies to all Air Force personnel including 
United States Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard units and 
members. The term major command (MAJCOM), when used in this part 
includes separate operating agencies and direct reporting units. The Air 
Force VIDOC program:
    (a) Records, through visual information (VI) means (still 
photographs, motion pictures, video, audio tape, and so forth), imagery 
of significant Air Force events that document the employment, growth, 
progress, and exercise of Air Force resources during peacetime and in 
combat.
    (b) Collects and preserves visual imagery of significant Air Force 
events with known or potential historical or archival value.
    (c) Ensures imagery which depicts the prime mission, support 
activities, and significant events of key Air Force organizations is 
available. VIDOC imagery or products are used for many purposes, at all 
levels, in the Air Force. Examples are:
    (1) Immediate use. Documentation used to help analyze and evaluate 
concepts and results of deployments, contingencies, tests, exercises, 
and so forth, during peacetime and in combat to support Air Force, DOD, 
and national objectives. VIDOC provides source material for slides, 
motion picture clips, video tapes, multimedia products, and so forth; 
used for training, management, information, and briefing purposes. In 
wartime, products are used to support theater commanders psychological 
operations objectives, operational briefings, status reports, public 
affairs requirements, collateral intelligence, and the historical 
record.
    (2) Future use. VIDOC materials with long-term or permanent value 
are retained in DOD central record centers, the National Air and Space 
Museum, and the National Archives. These make up the pictorial records 
of development, growth, and progress of air power and provide a 
continued resource for VI productions and other media presentations.


<R05>
Sec. 811a.2  Material sources for the VIDOC program.

    (a) The primary sources of VI documentation materials are:
    (1) Aerospace Audiovisual Service (AAVS) documentation crews, both 
ground and aerial, whose primary mission is to acquire Air Force imagery 
in peacetime and in combat.
    (2) Base VI support centers (VISC).
    (3) Optical instrumentation and engineering imagery of Air Force 
research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) projects, including 
that material originated by defense and aerospace contractors.
    (4) Armament delivery recording (ADR) imagery.
    (b) Although the imagery may not originate from a documentation 
requirement, when properly processed, indexed, and stored, it serves as 
a valuable source of VI documentation.


<R05>
Sec. 811a.3  Disposition of VI documentation materials.

    (a) VI materials generated or acquired by Air Force members, 
employees, or contractors in conducting official duties are the property 
of the United States Air Force. Personal use of VI material for sale or 
any other reason not directly related to an official Air Force activity 
is prohibited. Any deviation from this policy must be approved by HQ 
USAF/SCV. This policy also applies when Air Force members or employees, 
by choice or agreement, occasionally use personally owned equipment or 
supplies in conducting official duties.

[[Page 56]]

    (b) Photographs, motion picture films, transparencies, video tapes, 
audio recordings, and other VI products are subject to safeguards and 
release requirements when released outside the Department of Defense 
(see part 806 and part 837 of this chapter).

    Note: This part is derived from Air Force Regulation 117-8, 1 June 
1983.

    Part 806 of this chapter states the basic policies and instructions 
governing the disclosure of records and tells members of the public what 
they must do to inspect or obtain copies of the material referenced 
herein.


<R04>
                     Subpart A--General Information


<R05>
Sec. 812.0  Purpose.

    This part prescribes general policy for developing an equitable and 
uniform system of charges for special services and for selling or 
leasing property to persons or organizations outside DOD and outside the 
Federal Government; states the scope of user charges activities; 
furnishes guidelines and requirements for determining amounts of user 
charges, disposing of receipts, and accounting control of revenue from 
such charges. It implements DOD Instruction 7230.7, 15 August 1978, and 
DOD Instruction 7730.53, 23 December 1982. This part applies to all Air 
Force activities providing special benefits to non-DOD and non-
Government recipients.


<R05>
Sec. 812.1  Policy.

    Air Force activities should not compete with available commercial 
facilities in providing special benefits or in selling or leasing 
property to recipients outside DOD or outside the Federal Government. 
However, impose a reasonable charge when authorized special benefits are 
provided that:
    (a) Enable the recipient to obtain more immediate or substantial 
gain or values (which may or may not be measurable in monetary terms) 
than those accruing to the general public, or
    (b) Are performed at the request of the recipient and are above and 
beyond the services regularly received by or available without charge to 
the general public.


<R05>
Sec. 812.2  Responsibilities assigned.

    Responsibility for initiating and developing schedules of charges 
and fees consistent with the policies in this part rests with:
    (a) HQ USAF for common types of assistance furnished on a 
department-wide basis (these schedules are in Air Force functional area 
directives).
    (b) Major commands for types of assistance peculiar to their 
respective commands.
    (c) Each activity concern for items or types of assistance furnished 
for which standard fees are not prescribed by higher authority. Each 
activity:
    (1) Identifies the benefits or services covered by this part.
    (2) Determines the extent of the special benefits provided.
    (3) Determines cost or fair market value.
    (4) Establishes the charges.


<R05>
Sec. 812.3  Non-user charge transactions.

    The provisions of this part do not cover or apply to the areas 
listed below. This does not necessarily mean charges are not made in 
these areas but, if made, they are determined

[[Page 57]]

under the provisions of other Air Force directives and are not 
considered user charges. Charges for services furnished non-Government 
audiovisual media, for example, are made under AFR 190-16. Similarily, 
charges for Armed Forces participation in public events are governed by 
AFR 190-5, Field Press Censorship. Additional non-user charge areas 
include:
    (a) Morale, welfare, and recreation services to military personnel 
and civilian employees.
    (b) Sale or disposal of surplus property under approved programs.
    (c) Services furnished the general public relating to or furthering 
the Air Force recruiting program.
    (d) Any services furnished representatives of public information 
media or the general public in the interest of public understanding of 
the Air Force.
    (e) Any records made available to the public under the Freedom of 
Information Act.
    (f) Any requests for release of Air Force-developed computer 
programs to non-Government customers.
    (g) Foreign military sales of materiel and services.


<R05>
Sec. 812.4  Waived or reduced charges.

    In general, charges may be waived or reduced when:
    (a) Payment of the full cost or fee by a State or local government 
or by a nonprofit group would not be in the interest of the program. See 
subpart B for types of services and conditions under which services may 
be provided.
    (b) Furnishing the service without charge is an appropriate courtesy 
to a foreign country or international organization, or comparable fees 
are set on a reciprocal basis with a foreign country.
    (c) The incremental cost of collecting the fees would be an unduly 
large part of the receipts from the activity.


<R05>
Sec. 812.5  User charge exclusions.

    Although of a user charge nature, the following are considered 
exempt from the requirement to assess a charge. The list is not all-
inclusive. Refer recommendations for additional exclusions to the office 
of primary responsibility (OPR) for this directive.
    (a) Any services requested by members of the armed forces when the 
document or information requested is required by such personnel in their 
capacity as members of the armed forces of the United States.
    (b) Any services requested by members of the armed forces who are in 
a casualty status, or by their next-of-kin or legal representative, and 
requests for information from any source relating to a casualty.
    (c) The address of record of an active duty member or former member 
of the armed forces, when it can be furnished informally through local 
directory (locator) reference, when requested by a member of the armed 
forces, a relative, or legal representative of a member of the armed 
forces, or the address of record requested by any source, when the 
address is required for the purpose of paying monies or forwarding 
property to a member or former member of the armed forces.
    (d) Any services requested by or on behalf of a member or former 
member of the armed forces or, if deceased, their next of kin or legal 
representative pertaining to requests for:
    (1) Information required to obtain financial benefits regardless of 
the terms of separation from the service;
    (2) Document showing membership and military record in the armed 
forces if discharged or release was under honorable conditions except as 
provided in Sec. 812.5(d)(1) and (4);
    (3) Information relating to a decoration or award or information 
required for memorialization purposes;
    (4) Review or change in type of discharge or correction of records;
    (5) Personal documents, for example, birth certificates, when such 
documents were required to be furnished by the individual.
    (e) Services which are furnished free in accordance with statutes or 
executive orders.
    (f) Information from or copies of medical and dental records and/or

    (k) Any services requested by a nonprofit orgnization which is 
carrying on a function related to or furthering an objective of the 
Federal Government or in the interest of public health and welfare.
    (l) Any services requested by an individual or corporation which is 
carrying on a function related to or furthering an objective of the 
Federal Government, when the cost of such services would be charageable 
directly to a Federal Government contract or grant held by the 
individual or corporation.
    (m) Any services requested by donors with respect to their gifts.
    (n) Requests for services which are occasional and incidental 
(including any request from a resident of a foreign country), of a type

must include:
    (1) A statement that the organization is listed as a composite check 
recipient in the current U.S. Treasury Bureau of Accounts, Financial 
Organizations Directory.
    (2) A statement that the individual whose address is requested has

    (3) The financial organization's account number for the individual.
    (s) Any services rendered in response to requests for classification 
review of DOD classified records, submitted under Executive Order 11652,

carrying to completion an appeal from a denial of declassification after 
such review.
    (t) Any services of a humanitarian nature performed in certain 
emergency situations such as: life-saving transportation for non-US 
Armed Forces patients, search and rescue operations, and airlift of 
personnel and supplies to a site of disaster. This does not mean inter- 
and intra-Governmental agreements to recover all or part of costs should 
not be negotiated. Rather, it means the recipient or beneficiary is not 
assessed a user charge.


<R05>
Sec. 812.6  Charges for special services.

    (a) Establishing Fees. Establish user charge fees for special 
services on the basis of total costs or fair market value, whichever is 
higher, and not by the value of the services to the recipient. When 
applicable, determine fair market value in accordance with commercial 
rates in the local geographical area by referring to public pricing 
information, trade association information, market surveys, and other 
available information; do not conduct surveys solely for this purpose. 
Whenever feasible, establish and publish rates

[[Page 59]]

and fees in advance to facilitate uniformity of charges. Review rate and 
fee schedules annually or whenever significant changes in costs occur. 
Primary user charge rate and fee schedules are contained in 32 CFR part 
813, Schedule of Fees for Copying, Certifying and Searching Records and 
Other Documentary Material, and 32 CFR part 811, Sale or Release of 
Audiovisual Documentation.
    (b) Determining Costs. Determine or estimate costs from the best 
available records in the activity. Use existing cost systems; however, 
do not establish cost accounting systems solely to determine user 
charges. The following direct and indirect costs are included within the 
definition and determination of total costs:
    (1) Civilian salaries or wages and associated Air Force share of 
fringe expenses. Use predetermined rates in AFR 173-10, paragraph 2-33, 
as the basis for assessing charges.
    (2) Military personnel costs and associated Air Force share of 
fringe expenses. The rates to be charged and the basis for charging DOD, 
non-DOD Federal, and non-Federal agencies are in AFR 177-101, General 
Accounting and Financial System at Base Level, chapter 33.
    (3) Costa for materials, supplies, travel, communications, 
utilities, equipment and property rental, and maintenance of property 
and equipment.
    (4) An asset use charge at 4 percent of direct costs to cover 
depreciation and interest on investment in DOD owned fixed assets.
    (5) Costs of research, and of establishing standards and regulations 
when directly associated with the service performed.
    (6) An administrative surcharge at 3 percent of total costs 
Sec. 812.6(b)(1) through (5) to cover general and administrative costs.


<R05>
Sec. 812.7  Charges for lease or sale of property.

    When Federally owned property or resources are leased or sold, 
assess a rental cost or sales price based on a determination of fair 
market value. Determine fair market value by applying sound business 
management principles in accordance with comparable commercial 
practices. Charges need not be limited to recovery of costs; they may 
produce net revenues to the Government.
    (a) Sale of Material. In the absence of a known market value, 
determine the fair value for sale of material on the basis of an 
aggregate of the:
    (1) Standard price of the item carried in inventory (or at a reduced 
price when so authorized for sale within DOD).
    (2) Accessorial and administrative costs provide in AFR 172-5, 
Reimbursement for Accessorial and Administrative Costs.
    (b) Lease or Rental of Property. Fair market value for lease or 
rental of property is normally determined according to commercial rates 
for similar property in the local geographical area.
    (1) In cases involving lease or rental of military equipment, where 
there is no commercial counterpart, base fair market value on a 
computation of an annual rent made up of the sum of annual depreciation 
and interest on investment. Determine amount of interest on investment 
by applying a 10 percent interest factor to the net book value 
(acquisition cost plus additions less depreciation) of the asset. Add 
the cost of support, including general and administrative expenses, if 
support is furnished.
    (2) In determining the fair market value of property to be leased, 
consider the degree lessee assumes risk of loss or damage to the 
property and holds the Government harmless against claims or liability 
by the lessee or third parties.


<R05>
Sec. 812.8  Processing collections.

    (a) Dispose of receipts per existing instructions.
    (b) Normally, collect charges and fees in advance or at the time 
service is rendered. However, when multiple requests for services are 
received on a continuing basis from reliable requesters, services may be 
performed on an account receivable basis (that is, recording an account 
receivable when the service is provided, with subsequent billing of the 
organization requesting the service).

[[Page 60]]

    (c) Normally, deposit fees and charges collected to the appropriate 
receipt account. However, when authorized by law or Air Force 
directives, deposit fees and charges collected to the credit of the 
appropriation or fund responsible for the principle financial support of 
the services. Deposit collections in excess of recovery of full costs to 
the appropriate receipt account. Deposit collections for utilities and 
services in connection with the lease of property to the appropriation 
or fund responsible for financing the operations of the equipment and 
facility.


<R05>
Sec. 812.9  Accounting and control.

    (a) Activities providing special benefits or leasing and selling 
property must make sure user charges imposed are in accordance with this 
directive. Request revisions, through appropriate OPR channels, when 
rate and fee schedules included in functional area regulations do not 
appear adequate in view of current experience. When charges are 
determined locally, give special attention to ensure compliance with 
this part.
    (b) Activities generating user charge transactions furnish the 
accounting and finance office (AFO) all pertinent information necessary 
to voucher, collect, and otherwise account for each user charge being 
imposed. AFOs or their designees verify the accuracy and completeness of 
documentation supporting each user charge transaction. AFOs or designees 
also periodically review records, documentation, and procedures to 
ensure compliance with this part. An effective working relationship must 
be maintained between the AFO and activities generating user charge 
transactions.

not the governments of the political subdivisions of a State.
    (b) The terms political subdivision or local government means a 
local unit of government, including specifically a county, municipality, 
city, town, township, or a school or other special district created by 
or under State law, or combinations of any of these.
    (c) Specialized or technical services means statistical and other 
studies and compilations, development projects, technical test and

<R04>
                           Subpart A--General


<R05>
Sec. 818.0  Purpose.

    This part establishes Air Force policy governing alleged delinquent 
financial obligations. It outlines procedures for processing claims of 
this nature. It implements 32 CFR parts 43, 43a and 81. It applies to 
all active Air Force installations and members and US Air Force Reserve 
(USAFR) units and members. This part does not apply to Air National 
Guard (ANG) units and members. This part is affected by the Privacy Act 
of 1974. System of Records Notice F030MPCB--Indebtedness, Nonsupport, 
Paternity, applies.


<R05>
Sec. 818.1  Air Force policy.

    Air Force members are expected to pay their financial obligations in 
a proper and timely manner. For the purpose of this part, financial 
obligations are divided into two categories: Personal indebtedness, and 
dependent support. As a general rule, the Air Force has no legal 
authority to require its members or their family members to

[[Page 63]]

pay personal financial obligations. Enforcement is a matter for civil 
authorities. However, the Air Force can, under certain conditions, 
divert part of a member's pay for debts owed to the United States or any 
of its instrumentalities (see Sec. 818.11) or to satisfy delinquent 
child support and alimony payments (see Secs. 818.15 and 818.16). 
Administrative or disciplinary action may be taken against Air Force 
members in cases of continued financial irresponsibility. Such action is 
taken to improve discipline and maintain the standards of conduct 
expected of Air Force personnel, but cannot be used to enforce private 
civil obligations.


<R05>
Sec. 818.2  Explanation of terms.

    (a) A proper and timely manner. A manner which, under the 
circumstances, does not discredit the Air Force.
    (b) Financial obligation. A legal obligation acknowledged by the 
member in which there is no reasonable dispute as to the facts, or one 
reduced to judgment. The judgment must conform to the Soldiers' and 
Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, as amended (50 U.S.C. app. 501, 
(1970)), if applicable.
    (c) Claimant or complainant. Any business or person seeking help in 
obtaining settlement of an alleged financial obligation or making a 
claim of delinquency concerning such matters.
    (d) Creditor. Any person or business that extends or offers credit, 
or to whom or to which a debt is owed. This term includes lending 
institutions (such as centralized charge systems) which, although not a 
party to the original transaction, seek help in obtaining settlement.
    (e) Debt collector. Any person or agency whose business is primarily 
the collection of debts owed to another person or business.
    (f) Dependent. Spouse and unmarried children--includes stepchildren, 
adopted children, and illegitimate children dependent on the military 
member. It may include others duly constituted (see DOD Military Pay and 
Allowances Entitlements Manual and AFR 30-20, Issue and control of 
Identification (ID) Cards).


<R05>
Sec. 818.3  Responsibilities.

    Specific responsibilities for ensuring Air Force standards are met:
    (a) Major commands (MAJCOM), separate operating agencies (SOA), and 
direct reporting units (DRU) monitor and provide guidance to subordinate 
units, as required, to ensure compliance with established procedures.
    (b) Initial active duty indoctrination sites ensure that a 
comprehensive block of instruction on personal financial management is 
included in teaching guides or course curriculums, as appropriate. This 
instruction should emphasize the Air Force policy regarding personal 
indebtedness and dependent support (Sec. 818.1) and the merits and 
benefits of the PFMP and the BRP. (See Sec. 818.5(b)(2) (i) and (ii).
    (c) Installation commanders:
    (1) Develop appropriate guidance to assure compliance with 
prescribed procedures.
    (2) Coordinate on all responses to high-level, executive, and 
congressional inquiries.
    (d) Chiefs, CBPO:
    (1) Through the CBPO Special Actions Unit, process all complaints 
according to this part.
    (2) Upon request, provide UIF policy guidance to the unit commander.
    (3) Coordinate on all responses to high level, executive, and 
congressional inquiries.
    (e) Unit commanders:
    (1) Implement required procedures at the unit level.
    (2) Review all the available facts surrounding a complaint of 
personal indebtedness, or of nonsupport or inadequate support of 
dependents, and initiate appropriate action.
    (3) Ensure complainants are provided a prompt reply that explains 
Air Force policy. At the unit commander's discretion, the first sergeant 
may respond to initial complaints. Second and subsequent inquiries 
require a reply by the unit commander.
    (4) Advise members of the requirement to meet their financial and 
dependent support obligations and inform them that failure to do so 
damages their reputation and affects the public image of all Air Force 
personnel. At the unit commander's discretion the

[[Page 64]]

first sergeant may provide initial counseling to enlisted members. 
Second and subsequent inquiries require counseling by the unit 
commander.
    (5) Refer personnel who have evidenced financial irresponsibility to 
the local PFMP manager for counseling on a mandatory but confidential 
basis.
    (6) Coordinate on all responses to high-level, executive, and 
congressional inquiries that pertain to personnel assigned to the unit.
    (7) Consider administrative or disciplinary action against members 
in cases of continued financial irresponsibility, fraud, deceit, 
criminal conduct, or failure to support dependents. Consult the staff 
judge advocate for guidance.
    (f) Air Force members:
    (1) Are expected to pay their just financial obligations in a proper 
and timely manner.
    (2) Are expected to provide regular and adequate support to their 
dependents.
    (3) Maintain reasonable contact with their creditors and dependents 
to minimize Air Force involvement.
    (g) PFMP managers:
    (1) Establish a consultant function to assist personnel in financial 
management matters, or other subjects as deemed appropriate to the needs 
of the local base population.
    (2) Advise commanders regarding Air Force policy.
    (h) Staff judge advocates:
    (1) Advise commanders on the application of Air Force policy on 
individual cases. Include advice on administrative or disciplinary 
action that may be appropriate in cases involving continued financial 
irresponsibility, fraud, deceit, criminal conduct, or failure to support 
dependents, including arrearages.
    (2) Provide guidance concerning federal, state, and local laws 
(e.g., bankruptcy, garnishment, wage earner plans, the Truth in Lending 
Act (Pub. L. 90-321), Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (Pub. L. 95-
109), The Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, as amended, 
etc.).
    (3) Coordinate on all responses to high-level, executive, and 
congressional inquiries.
    (i) Family support centers serve as a source of information, 
counseling, and referral for family members in need of support and 
financial management assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 818.4   Review of complaints.

    Complaints received regarding personal indebtedness or nonsupport of 
dependents should first be forwarded to the consolidated base personnel 
office (CBPO) Special Actions Unit to ensure that they pertain to an Air 
Force member. Also, indebtedness complaints should be reviewed by the 
staff judge advocate's office to ensure that they meet the general 
policies and requirements for acceptance (see Secs. 818.7 and 818.8).
    (a) The CBPO Special Actions Unit forwards processable cases to the 
unit commander for action, or:
    (1) If the member has been reassigned, forwards the case to the 
current CBPO Special Actions Unit and advises the complainant of 
referral.
    (2) If member has separated with no further military status or has 
retired, advises the complainant accordingly and indicates they are 
unable to assist because the individual is no longer under Air Force 
jurisdiction.
    (3) If the member has been released from active duty, forwards the 
case to Headquarters Air Reserve Personnel Center, Special Actions 
Branch (HQ ARPC/DPAS), Denver CO 80280-5000, and advises the complainant 
of the referral.
    (b) Indebtedness complaints that do not meet processing requirements 
are returned to the complainant with an explanation of the reason or 
reasons for return.
    (c) For dependent nonsupport or inadequate support cases forwarded 
by HQ AFMPC/DPMASC, the commander must furnish the following information 
in the reply to that office (if negative, so state):
    (1) Requirement of court order or decree, if applicable, and degree 
of compliance by the member.
    (2) Date, amount, and method of prior support payments.
    (3) Proposed date, amount, and method (for instance, money order, 
personal check, allotment, and, if by allotment, the effective date of 
first payroll deduction, and so forth) of future support

[[Page 65]]

payments (primary and arrearages, if any).
    (4) If drawing basic allowance for quarters (BAQ), the amount 
received, type (for instance, with dependents or without dependents), 
and basis for receipt (wife, child or children in custody of ex-wife, 
and so forth).
    (5) Action taken or projected to be taken to comply with 
Sec. 818.14, where appropriate, regarding the BAQ.


<R05>
Sec. 818.5   Processing of complaints.

    Any complaint that meets the requirements of this part will be 
processed. Processed means that the commander shall, within 15 calendar 
days of receipt of a complaint:
    (a) Review all available facts surrounding the transaction or 
forming the basis for the complaint, including the member's legal rights 
and counterclaims. Assess the actions of the member as they apply to Air 
Force policy in these situations by reviewing the requirements of the 
credit agreement, court order, separation agreement, or other documents 
and actions taken by the member to resolve the matter, and the financial 
status of the member.
    (b) Advise the member of Air Force policy appropriate to the 
complaint--that personal debts are expected to be paid in a proper and 
timely manner or that Air Force members are expected to provide regular 
and adequate support for their dependents. Also, explain what the member 
should do to comply with that policy.
    (1) Legal counseling services are available regarding indebtedness 
and dependent support agreements.
    (2) Financial counseling and assistance services are available 
through the Personal Financial Management Program (PFMP) or the Budget 
Restructuring Program (BRP).
    (i) PFMP is designed to assist personnel in analyzing personal 
financial problem areas, developing budgets, formulating debt-
liquidation plans, obtaining consumer protection, improving checkbook 
maintenance, and buying on credit. (See AFR 170-32, Personal Financial 
Management Program (PFMP))
    (ii) BRP is a coordinated approach between the PFMP manager, 
Headquarters Air Force Aid Society (AFAS) and the installation 
commander, whereby members who are undergoing financial difficulties may 
obtain a loan. BRP loans are made to deserving members in selected cases 
where long-term debt problems are such that budget restructuring is 
essential if the member is to function effectively in the Air Force 
environment.
    (iii) Counseling services may also be available from the onbase 
military banking facility or credit union.
    (c) Advise the complainant of Air Force policy that applies to the 
situation. Responses to dependent support complaints will include, when 
appropriate, a copy of the factsheet describing the legal process 
procedures that may be taken against the Air Force (Sec. 818.20 and 
818.21). Form letters are not permitted.
    (1) The Air Force does not arbitrate disputed cases, admit or deny 
validity of the complaint, or confirm the liability of its members.
    (2) Under no circumstances will the response indicate whether or not 
administrative or disciplinary action has been taken against the member 
as a result of the complaint.
    (3) Replies should be courteous and responsive to the complaint. The 
commander is not an intermediary and that impression should not be given 
in the reply.
    (4) Commanders must actively monitor complaints until they are 
resolved. The Air Force cannot tolerate financial irresponsibility, 
neglect, dishonesty, or evasiveness. Failure to liquidate personal 
financial obligations promptly and honorably or to provide regular and 
adequate financial support to dependents could necessitate 
administrative or disciplinary action. If the commander decides the 
complaint reflects adversely on the member, the administrative or 
disciplinary action should be made a part of the unfavorable information 
file (UIF) according to AFR 35-32 (Unfavorable Information Files, 
Control Rosters, Administrative Reprimands and Admonitions) or the unit 
assigned personnel information file (UAPIF) according to AFR 35-44 
(Military Personnel Records Systems).

[[Page 66]]


<R05>
Sec. 818.6  High-level inquiries (AFR 11-7, Air Force Relations with Congress).

    Replies to high-level, executive, and congressional inquiries should 
be coordinated through the installation commander, the staff judge 
advocate, director of personnel, and inspector general. As a minimum, 
replies should state Air Force policy (Sec. 818.1), and a summary of the 
position taken by the member, if applicable. For inquiries requiring 
response to HQ AFMPC Congressional Inquiries Section (DPMRPH2), include 
that information required by Sec. 818.4(c), as appropriate, in addition 
to:
    (a) Whether or not the member agrees to release of information 
protected by the Privacy Act of 1974. (See part 806b of this chapter)
    (b) Name of unit commander, address, and base telephone number.


<R04>
                    Subpart B--Personal Indebtedness


<R05>
Sec. 818.7  General policies.

    (a) Members are expected to pay their financial obligations in a 
proper and timely manner. Claims of indebtedness, including returned 
checks, if properly supported, are processed as prescribed in 
Sec. 818.5.
    (b) Inform claimants, desiring to contact a military member about 
indebtedness, that they may obtain the member's military address by 
writing to the HQ AFMPC Research, Locator Fees Section (HQ AFMPC/
DPMD003), Northeast Office Place, 9504 IH 35 North, San Antonio TX 
78233-6636. Usually, a research fee of $3.50 is charged for this 
service. For those cases where an address is not releasable, HQ AFMPC/
DPMD003 provides mail forwarding service at no additional cost.
    (c) The processing of complaints will not be extended to those:
    (1) Who have not made a bona fide effort to collect the debt 
directly from the military member through personal contact, 
correspondence, or other means.
    (2) Whose claims are patently false and misleading, or are in 
violation of state laws concerning usury and debt collection practices 
(Sec. 818.4).
    (3) Whose claims are obviously exorbitant (Sec. 818.4).
    (d) Some states have enacted laws that prohibit creditors from 
contacting a debtor's employer with respect to indebtedness or 
communicating facts concerning indebtedness to any employer unless 
certain conditions are met. The conditions that must be met to remove 
this prohibition are generally such things as reduction of a debt to 
judgment and obtaining written permission of the debtor.
    (1) At Air Force installations in states having such laws, the 
processing of debt complaints will not be extended to those creditors 
who are not in compliance with the state law. Commanders may advise 
creditors that this rule has been established because it is the general 
policy of the Air Force to comply with state law when that law does not 
infringe upon military interests.
    (2) This policy will govern even though the creditor is not licensed 
to do business in the state where the debtor is located.
    (e) Under Pub. L. 95-109, contact by a debt collector with third 
parties for the purpose of aiding debt collection is prohibited without 
the prior consent of the debtor, given directly to the debt collector, 
or without a court order. Creditors are generally exempt from Pub. L. 
95-109 when they collect on their own behalf.
    (f) Denial of privileges:
    (1) If a claimant, having been notified of the requirements of this 
part, refuses or repeatedly fails to comply with its provisions; or a 
claimant, regardless of the merits of the claim, clearly has shown that 
an attempt is being made to make unreasonable use of the processing 
privilege, the CBPO Special Actions Unit documents the case, provides 
comments and recommendations, and submits the documentation through 
command channels to HQ AFMPC/DPMASC.
    (2) Cases involving usurious, fraudulent, misleading, or deceptive 
business practices are reported to the Armed Forces Disciplinary Control 
Board according to AFR 125-11 (Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Boards 
and Off-Installation Military Enforcement Services), as well as HQ 
AFMPC/DPMASC if it appears that Air Force-wide action is appropriate.

[[Page 67]]


<R05>
Sec. 818.8  General requirements for acceptance of complaints.

    Requirements in this section do not apply to claims by Federal, 
State, or Municipal governments, including foreign, nor to those 
creditors not otherwise subject to Federal Reserve Board (FRB) 
Regulation Z (12 CFR part 226, Secs. 226.3, 226.9 (1978)).
    (a) Full disclosure and standards of fairness. The Truth in Lending 
Act (Pub. L. 90-321) prescribes the general disclosure requirements that 
must be met by those offering or extending consumer credit. It also 
prescribes the specific disclosure requirements for both open-end and 
installment credit transactions.
    (1) In place of government requirements, state regulations apply to 
credit transactions if the FRB determines that the state regulations 
impose substantially similar requirements and provide adequate 
enforcement measures.
    (2) Commanders should seek advice from their local staff judge 
advocate to determine whether federal or state laws and regulations 
apply.
    (b) Certificates of compliance: (1) Creditors subject to FRB 
regulation Z, and assignees claiming thereunder, must provide an 
executed copy of the Certificate of Compliance with their request for 
assistance. They must also include a copy of the general and specific 
disclosures provided the member as required by Pub. L. 90-321.
    (2) Creditors not subject to FRB Regulation Z (for example, public 
utility companies, grocery stores, and so forth) must include a 
certification that their request contains neither interest, finance 
charges, nor other fees in excess of that permitted by the laws of the 
state in which the obligation was incurred.
    (3) Foreign-owned companies having debt complaints against a member 
must provide a true copy of the terms of the debt, translated into 
English, and certification of their subscription to the Standards of 
Fairness.
    (c) Evidence of prior actions. Such evidence should include 
photostatic, file, or other duplicated copies, or documentary proof (for 
example, chronological account activity listings, notarized personal 
statements, postal documentation, and so forth) showing that every 
effort has been made to obtain payment by direct contact with the 
member.


<R05>
Sec. 818.9  Dishonored checks and similar instruments.

    Every check, draft, or order for the payment of money drawn on any 
bank or other depository carries with it the representation of payment 
in full when presented. If dishonored, checks and similar instruments 
are considered to be evidence of personal indebtedness until redeemed or 
the member asserts a valid defense to payment. The procedures in 
Sec. 818.5 apply, and commanders should counsel members on Air Force 
policy regarding personal indebtedness. Although redeemed:
    (a) Administrative or disciplinary action may be appropriate where 
criminal conduct is evident. The commander should consult the staff 
judge advocate to determine whether action under the Uniform Code of 
Military Justice (UCMJ) or other administrative action is appropriate.
    (b) Repeated cases of dishonored checks may serve as the basis for 
administrative action, to include letters of reprimand, UIF entries, 
overstamping identification cards to reflect the denial of check cashing 
privileges (AFR 30-20, Issue and Control of Identification (ID) Cards), 
or administrative separation. The commander should consult the staff 
judge advocate on the appropriateness of administrative action.

    Note: These provisions are not appropriate for dishonored checks 
issued by a military dependent unless the staff judge advocate 
determines that the member may be held personally liable based on a 
review of the circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 818.10  Bankruptcy.

    Air Force policy is one of strict neutrality. No adverse action may 
be taken against a member of the Air Force for either filing a petition 
or because of a discharge in bankruptcy. Underlying facts may involve 
mismanagement of personal affairs or dishonorable failure to pay just 
debts and could form a basis for adverse action against a member of the 
Air Force, but neither filing a petition (for bankruptcy or for

[[Page 68]]

payments out of future earnings) nor a discharge in bankruptcy can, of 
themselves, be considered ``mismanagement'' or ``dishonorable.''
    (a) Commanders should consult with the servicing staff judge 
advocate before considering any administrative or disciplinary action 
against a member for conduct associated with a bankruptcy petition.
    (b) Further, the staff judge advocate should be consulted when 
providing financial counseling for members considering bankruptcy.
    (c) The Air Force recognizes and complies with decrees in bankruptcy 
cases.


<R05>
Sec. 818.11  Involuntary deductions for personal indebtedness.

    Federal law (5 U.S.C. 5514 and 37 U.S.C. 1007(c)) authorizes the Air 
Force Accounting and Finance Center (AFAFC) to satisfy a military 
member's personal indebtedness to the Air Force and other Department of 
Defense (DOD) Components, federal agencies, and nonappropriated funds 
instrumentalities by involuntary salary offset or administrative offset 
(AFR 170-30, Debt Collecting). In addition, the AFAFC is authorized to 
garnish the wages of Air Force members to satisfy personal indebtedness 
for the enforcement of child support and alimony payments under certain 
conditions (Secs. 818.15 and 818.16).


<R04>
                      Subpart C--Dependent Support


<R05>
Sec. 818.12  General policies.

    Members are expected to pay their financial obligations in a proper 
and timely manner. Dependent support, direct or in-kind, is a primary 
element of an individual's personal financial obligations. Failure to 
provide adequate dependent support, including the failure to make up 
arrears in support, is the proper subject of command consideration for 
disciplinary or administrative action.
    (a) Air Force members are expected to comply with the financial 
support provisions of a court order or written support agreement. If the 
validity of either is questioned by the member, the issue must be 
resolved by the parties or through the civil courts. The Air Force does 
not arbitrate such disputes. Written agreements include such things as 
separation agreements, property settlement agreements, and 
correspondence in which the amount of support has been agreed to by the 
parties concerned.
    (b) Air Force members are expected to provide adequate support for 
dependents in the absence of a court order or written support agreement. 
The amount of support is generally based on the dependent's needs (for 
example, food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and so forth) and the 
ability of the member to pay. Each Air Force member is expected to 
provide support in an amount, or kind, bearing a reasonable relation to 
the needs of the dependents and the ability of the member to meet those 
needs.
    (1) The Air Force has no legal authority to arbitrate the amount of 
support to be provided or to unilaterally deduct money from a member's 
pay to ensure dependent support.
    (2) Commanders must assess the actions of the member with respect to 
their ability to pay and compliance with Air Force policy.
    (i) For example, an individual who purchases a new car for personal 
use and then claims an inability to provide dependent support because of 
financial constraints ordinarily would not be viewed as being in 
compliance with Air Force policy.
    (ii) Further, an individual who acknowledges an existing obligation 
and initiates an allotment for future support but does not provide for 
past periods of nonsupport ordinarily would not be viewed as being in 
compliance with Air Force policy.
    (3) Commanders must assess the member's compliance with Air Force 
policy when a family is separated either by choice or due to an 
assignment action (for example, member volunteers for a dependent-
restricted overseas area, elects to serve an unaccompanied tour, early 
returns dependents from an overseas area, is absent as a result of 
lengthy temporary duty, and so forth).
    (c) Examples of in-kind support includes such things as making the 
mortgage or rent payments on a home occupied by the dependents, making 
the payments on an automobile being used

[[Page 69]]

by the dependents, paying medical bills, paying for school tuition, and 
so forth.
    (d) Dependents, including ex-spouses on behalf of a member's 
dependent child or children, are entitled to military legal counseling 
services and are encouraged to seek such advice when needed.
    (e) The member's obligation to support a child or children is not 
affected by desertion or other misconduct on the part of the spouse or 
ex-spouse.
    (f) Members are expected to initiate changes of address for support 
allotments and process appropriate applications for issue or renewal of 
dependent identification cards in a timely manner when requested to do 
so by or on behalf of dependents.


<R05>
Sec. 818.13  Proof of support.

    Generally, proof of dependent support is not required. However, on 
receipt of a complaint of nonsupport or inadequate support from, or on 
behalf of, a dependent for whom the member is receiving basic allowance 
for quarters (BAQ), proof of support is required.


<R05>
Sec. 818.14  Basic Allowance for Quarters (BAQ).

    Under the DOD Military Pay and Allowances Entitlements Manual 
(DODPM), paragraph 30236, BAQ is not payable on behalf of a dependent 
whom a member refuses to support. Failure to support a dependent on 
whose behalf BAQ is being received requires recoupment for periods of 
nonsupport. Members should be informed of this provision and be advised 
that refusal or failure to support dependents requires administrative 
termination of BAQ entitlement at the with dependents rate.
    (a) BAQ termination at the with dependents rate does not relieve a 
member of responsibility for providing dependent support.
    (b) Commanders must assess the member's compliance with Air Force 
policy in those situations where the member would not otherwise be 
authorized the BAQ entitlement. For example, member is residing in 
government quarters and has no other dependents.


<R05>
Sec. 818.15  Garnishment.

    Federal law authorizes legal process against the Air Force only for 
the enforcement of child support and alimony payments according to state 
law. Service of legal process must be accomplished by certified or 
registered mail, return receipt requested, or by personal service. The 
Commander, Air Force Accounting and Finance Center, Attention: JA, 
Denver CO 80279-5000, telephone (303) 370-7524, is the agent designated 
to accept legal process within the Air Force for active duty, Reserve, 
and retired military members.
    (a) Legal process is defined as any writ, order, summons, or other 
similar process in the nature of garnishment issued by:
    (1) A court of competent jurisdiction within any state, territory, 
or possession of the United States; or
    (2) A court of competent jurisdiction in any foreign country with 
which the United States has entered into an agreement that requires the 
United States to honor such process; or
    (3) An authorized official pursuant to an order of such court of 
competent jurisdiction or pursuant to state or local law. (See 42 U.S.C. 
659, 662.)
    (b) Process directed for garnishment must demonstrate, either on its 
face or by accompanying documentation, that collection is sought only 
for child support or alimony or both. The process must also show the 
member's Social Security number and whether the member is active duty, 
Reserve, or retired.
    (c) If the validity of a court's order is questioned by the member 
concerned, the issue must be resolved by the parties or in court by the 
member or his or her private attorney. The Air Force has no authority to 
resolve such disputes.


<R05>
Sec. 818.16  Statutory allotments.

    An active duty member's pay and allowances are subject to a 
mandatory allotment to satisfy child or child and spousal support 
obligations where payments are in arrears for at least 2 months.
    (a) A statutory allotment, pursuant to federal law, may be 
accomplished by the Air Force Accounting and Finance Center upon their 
being furnished a

[[Page 70]]

written notice from a court or state agency with responsibility for 
administering child support programs under title IV-D of the Social 
Security Act.
    (b) The notice and the following documents or information must be 
served on the Commander, Air Force Accounting and Finance Center, 
Attention: JA, Denver CO 80279-5000:
    (1) A statement that the person signing is an agent or an attorney 
of the state having a title IV-D plan who has the duty or authority 
under such plan to seek to recover amounts owed by a member as child or 
child and spousal support or a notice from a state court or any agent of 
the court who has authority to issue an order against a member for the 
support of a child.
    (2) The service member's full name and Social Security number.
    (3) A recently certified copy of the order awarding support must be 
included with the notice and a statement that the support payments are 
in arrears at least 2 months.
    (4) A court order showing the amount of the arrears and specifying 
that payments be made to liquidate such arrears.
    (5) The total amount of the allotment (the amount to be paid for 
current support and the amount to be paid each month towards arrears 
must be specified), the date or dates that the current support should 
terminate (for each child), and the name and address of the payee.


<R05>
Sec. 818.17  Paternity claims.

    The Air Force does not judge paternity claims against its personnel. 
Paternity must be established either by admission, or by judicial order 
or decree of paternity, or child support duly ordered by a United States 
or foreign court of competent jurisdiction.
    (a) Allegations of paternity against active duty members will be 
transmitted to the member concerned through his unit commander. The unit 
commander will:
    (1) If paternity is denied, inform the claimant accordingly and 
advise of Air Force policy regarding paternity claims.
    (2) Once paternity is established, advise the member of his moral 
and legal obligations as well as his legal rights in the matter. The 
member will be encouraged to render the necessary financial support to 
the child and take any other action considered proper under the 
circumstances. Advise the claimant of Air Force policy as it relates to 
support of dependents and the position taken by the member, if the 
member elects to take one.
    (3) On receipt of a communication from a judge of a civilian court, 
including a court summons or a judicial order, concerning the member's 
availability to appear at an adoption hearing where it is alleged that 
he is the father of an illegitimate child, provide a reply that:
    (i) Due to military requirements, the member cannot be granted leave 
to attend any court hearing until (date), or
    (ii) A request by the member for leave to attend an adoption hearing 
on (date), if made, would be approved, or
    (iii) The member has stated in a sworn written statement (forward a 
copy with response) that he is not the natural parent of the child, and 
that only a court of competent jurisdiction can judge the matter, or
    (iv) Due to the member's unavailability caused by a specific reason, 
a completely responsive answer cannot be made.
    (v) Inform member of the inquiry and the response. Also, member 
should be urged to obtain legal assistance (including an explanation of 
the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, if appropriate).
    (b) If the member has been released from active duty, the unit 
commander forwards the inquiry to HQ ARPC/DPAS, Denver CO 80280-5000. 
Advise complainant of the referral.
    (1) HQ ARPC/DPAS, on receipt of an allegation of paternity, provides 
an appropriate response to the claimant as set forth for members on 
active duty under paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section.
    (2) Communications from a judge of a civilian court, including a 
court summons or judicial order, concerning the availability of 
personnel to appear at an adoption hearing where it is alleged that the 
member not on active duty is the father of an illegitimate child, shall 
receive a reply that such person is not on active duty. A copy of the

[[Page 71]]

communication and the reply is forwarded to the named individual.
    (3) When requested by a judge of a civilian court, the member's 
address may be furnished if the request is supported by a:
    (i) Certified copy of either a judicial order or decree of paternity 
or support duly rendered against the member by a United States or 
foreign court of competent jurisdiction; or
    (ii) Document that establishes that the member has made an official 
admission or statement acknowledging paternity or responsibility for 
support of a child before a court of competent jurisdiction, 
administrative or executive agency, or official authorized to receive 
it; or
    (iii) Court summons, judicial order, or similar document of a court 
within the United States in a case concerning the adoption of an 
illegitimate child wherein the member is alleged to be the father.
    (4) The address may also be furnished if the claimant, with the 
corroboration of a physician's affidavit, alleges and explains an 
unusual medical situation that makes it essential to obtain information 
from the alleged father to protect the physical health of either the 
prospective mother or the unborn child.
    (c) If the member has been separated with no further military status 
or retired, the unit commander advises the claimant:
    (1) Of the date of discharge. Indicate that you are unable to assist 
because the individual is no longer under Air Force jurisdiction. Also, 
advise that the Air Force assumes no responsibility for the whereabouts 
of individuals no longer under its jurisdiction.
    (2) In addition, the last known address of the former member may be 
furnished the requester under the same conditions as set forth for 
members not on active duty under paragraph (b) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 818.20   Garnishment of pay of Air Force members and employees only for child support or alimony obligations.

    (a) This section is for general guidance. For more specific 
information, refer to the United States Code (42 U.S.C. 659, 661, 662; 
15 U.S.C. 1673), the Code of Federal Regulations (5 CFR part 581), and 
applicable State law.
    (b) Federal law authorizes legal process against the United States 
Air Force only for the enforcement of child support and alimony 
obligations of members and employees in accordance with State law. This 
includes active duty, Reserve, Air National Guard (ANG), and retired 
military members, and civilian employees of the United States Air Force. 
See 42 U.S.C. 659.
    (c) Legal process is defied as any writ, order, summons, or other 
similar process in the nature of garnishment directed to the US Air 
Force which is issued by:
    (1) A court of competent jurisdiction within any State, territory, 
or possession of the United States;
    (2) A court of competent jurisdiction in any foreign country with 
which the United States has entered into an agreement that requires the 
United States to honor such process; or
    (3) An authorized official pursuant to an order of such court of 
competent jurisdiction or pursuant to State or local law. See 42 U.S.C. 
659, 662.
    (d) Child support is the legal obligation of an individual to 
provide periodic payments of funds for the support and maintenance of a 
child, subject to, and in accordance with, State law.
    (e) Alimony is defined as the obligation of an individual to provide 
periodic payments for the support and maintenance of the spouse (or 
former spouse) including separate maintenance, alimony pendente lite, 
maintenance, and spousal support. The definition of alimony expressly 
excludes payments or transfers of property made in compliance with any 
community property settlement, equitable distribution of property, or 
other division of property between spouses. See 42 U.S.C. 662 (b) and 
(c).
    (f) Attorney's fees, interest, and court costs are within the 
definition of child support and alimony when, and to

[[Page 72]]

the extent, they are recoverable pursuant to a decree, order, or 
judgment issued in accordance with applicable State law by a court of 
competent jurisdiction.
    (g) State law is to be followed when processing garnishment requests 
(as to jurisdiction and competency of courts, procedures, exemptions, 
and the operation of garnishment or similar process). However, State law 
as it applies to service of process and exemptions from garnishment and 
similar process may be affected by Federal law. See 42 U.S.C. 659(b) and 
15 U.S.C. 1673(b).
    (h) Unless an otherwise lesser amount is specified by State law, 
Federal law provides a limit of 50 percent on the amount that is subject 
to garnishment for a person supporting a second family (a spouse or 
dependent child), and 60 percent for a person who is not. The 
percentages are increased by an additional 5 percent in each situation 
if there are outstanding arrearages more than 12 weeks old.
    (i) A Federal employee's pay subject to garnishment includes wages, 
salary bonuses, incentive pay, retired pay, or disability retirement 
pay. (The United States will exclude debts owed to the United States; 
Federal, State and local income tax withholding; Social Security 
withholdings (FICA); deductions for health insurance premiums; normal 
retirement contributions; normal government life insurance premiums; 
fines and forfeitures ordered by court-martial; Retired Serviceman's 
Family Protection Plan; and Survivor Benefit Plan.) See 42 U.S.C. 662(g) 
and 5 CFR 581.105.
    (j) Process directed to the Commander, AFAFC/JA, must demonstrate, 
either on its face or by accompanying documentation, that collection is 
sought only for child support or alimony or both. The process must also 
show the social security number and whether the member is retired, 
Reserve, ANG, active duty, or civilian employee. (If the employee is a 
civilian, the name of the base where the civilian is employed should 
also be provided.)
    (k) In order to process the request efficiently, these documents 
should be provided:
    (1) If the process does not reflect that it has been brought to 
enforce an obligation of support, a certified copy of the order, 
judgment, or decree that originally established the obligation to 
support (5 CFR 581.202(c));
    (2) A copy of any pleading requesting reduction of delinquent 
amounts to a judgment amount, and a copy of any order resulting 
therefrom;
    (3) Any pleading, affidavit, or application requesting garnishment 
process; and
    (4) The supporting execution, if any.

Documentation will vary depending on State law.
    (l) The law directs the Federal government to answer garnishment or 
similar process within 30 days (or within such longer period as may be 
prescribed by applicable State law) after date of service. See 42 U.S.C. 
659(d).
    (m) Service of legal process must be accomplished by certified or 
registered mail, return receipt requested, or by personal service. Any 
documents served in any other manner will be returned without action. 
The following agents have been designated to accept legal process within 
the Air Force:
    (1) Active duty, reserve, Air National Guard (ANG), and retired 
military members, and civilian employees of appropriated fund 
activities: Commander, Air Force Accounting and Finance Center,

Sec. 818.21  Statutory allotments.

    (a) On 3 September 1982, the President signed into law section 
172(a) of Pub. L. 97-248 (codified at 42 U.S.C. 665, effective 1 October 
1982) which allows mandatory allotments from an active duty member's pay 
and allowances to satisfy child or child and spousal support 
obligations. (Alimony or spousal

[[Page 73]]

support alone does not qualify under this law).
    (b) A spouse or former spouse may obtain an allotment for child 
support or child and spousal support in cases where payments are in 
arrears for at least 2 months.
    (c) This act provides that no more than 50 percent of a member's pay 
and allowances are subject to be allotted from a member who is 
supporting a second family and no more than 60 percent from a member who 
is not. The percentages are increased by 5 percent in each situation 
where there are outstanding arrearages which are 12 or more weeks past 
due. Pay and allowances and exclusions are defined in the DOD 
regulations.
    (d) After the Air Force member is notified and given an opportunity 
to be counseled, the allotment will be established in the next available 
month following 30 days after notice is made on the Air Force member. 
The payments will be made at the end of the month in which the allotment 
was established.
    (e) An allotment, pursuant to this statute, may be accomplished by 
furnishing the Air Force Accounting and Finance Center a written notice 
from a court or state agency administering child support programs under 
title IV-D of the Social Security Act. This notice must be signed and 
must contain the following information:
    (1) A statement that the person signing is an agent or an attorney 
of the State having a IV-D plan who has the duty or authority under such 
plan to seek to recover amounts owed by a service member as child or 
child and spousal support or a notice from a state court or any agent of 
the court which has authority to issue an order against a service member 
for the support of a child.
    (2) The service member's full name and social security number.
    (3) A recently certified copy of the order awarding support must be 
included with the notice.
    (4) A statement that the support payments are in arrears at least 
two months.
    (5) A court order showing the amount of the arrears and specifying 
that payments be made to liquidate such arrears.
    (6) The total amount of the allotment. (Specify the amount to be 
paid for current support and the amount to be paid each month toward 
arrears.)
    (7) The dates that the current support should terminate (for each 
child).
    (8) Name and address of payee.
    (f) The notice and documents must be served on the following: 
Commander, AFAFC, Attn: JA, Denver CO 80279-5000.

<R05>
Sec. 841.0  Purpose.

    This regulation prescribes the policies, administrative 
requirements, procedures, terms, and conditions for licensing of rights 
in federally owned patents and patent applications vested in the United 
States of America in the custody of the Department of the Air Force. It 
is consistent with General Services Administration Licensing of

invention.


<R05>
Sec. 841.1  Air Force policy.

    Federally owned inventions in the custody of the Department of the 
Air Force normally will best serve the public interest when they are 
developed to the point of practical application and made available to 
the public in the shortest possible time. Nonexclusive, partially 
exclusive, or exclusive licenses for the practice of these inventions 
may be granted to applicants who agree to develop and/or market the 
inventions. All Air Force inventions normally will be made available for 
the granting of licenses to responsible applicants.


<R05>
Sec. 841.2  Execution of licenses.

    Nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive licenses will be 
executed on behalf of the Department of the Air Force by the Secretary 
or by anyone to whom this authority is delegated.


<R05>
Sec. 841.3  Delegation of authority.

    The administration of this part is delegated to The Judge Advocate 
General, who may redelegate the administration of this part to the 
Chief, Patents Division, Office of The Judge Advocate General. All 
communications received in any Air Force activity requesting information 
regarding the licensing of a Government invention will be acknowledged 
and sent without further action directly to HQ USAF/JACP, Washington DC 
20324.


<R05>
Sec. 841.4  Definitions.

    (a) Air Force invention means an invention, plant, or design which 
is covered by a patent or patent application in the United States, or a 
patent, patent application, plant variety protection, or other form of 
protection in a foreign country, title to which has been assigned to or 
otherwise vested in the United States Government and in

[[Page 75]]

the custody of the Department of the Air Force.
    (b) Small business firm means a small business concern as defined in 
section 2 of Pub. L. 85-536 (15 U.S.C. 632) and implementing regulations 
of the Administrator of the Small Business Administration.
    (c) Practical Application means to manufacture in the case of a 
composition or product, to practice in the case of a process or method, 
or to operate in the case of a machine or system; and in each case, 
under such conditions as to establish that the invention is being 
utilized and that its benefits are to the extent permitted by law or 
Government regulations available to the public on reasonable terms.
    (d) United States means the United States of America, its 
territories and possessions, the District of Columbia, and the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.


<R05>
Sec. 841.5  Royalties.

    (a) Royalties may or may not be charged under nonexclusive licenses 
granted to US citizens and US corporations on Government inventions; 
however, the Department of the Air Force may require other 
considerations when a royalty is not charged.
    (b) Normally, an exclusive or partially exclusive license on an Air 
Force invention will contain a royalty provision and/or other

                                Licenses


<R05>
Sec. 841.6  Restrictions and conditions.

    The following restrictions and conditions apply to all licenses 
granted under this part:
    (a) Restrictions: (1) A license may be granted only if the applicant 
has supplied the Air Force with a satisfactory plan for development or 
marketing of the invention, or both, and with information about the 
applicant's capability to fulfill the plan.
    (2) A license granting rights to use or sell under an Air Force 
invention in the United States shall normally be granted only to a 
licensee who agrees that any product embodying the invention or produced 
through the use of the invention will be manufactured substantially in 
the United States.
    (b) Conditions. Licenses shall contain such terms and conditions as 
the Air Force determines are appropriate for the protection of the 
interests of the Federal Government and the public and are not in 
conflict with law or this part. The following terms and conditions apply 
to any license:
    (1) The duration of the license shall be for a period specified in 
the license agreement, unless sooner terminated according to provisions 
therein.
    (2) The license may be granted for all or less than all fields of 
use of the invention or in specified geographical areas, or both.
    (3) The license may extend to subsidiaries of the licensee or other 
parties if provided for in the license but shall be nonassignable 
without approval of the Air Force, except to the successor of that part 
of the licensee's business to which the invention pertains.
    (4) The license may provide the licensee the right to grant 
sublicenses under the license, subject to the approval of the Air Force. 
Each sublicense shall make reference to the license, including the 
rights retained by the Government, and a copy of each sublicense shall 
be furnished to the Air Force.
    (5) The license shall require the licensee to carry out the plan for 
development or marketing of the invention, or both, to bring the 
invention to practical application within a period specified in the 
license, and to continue to make the benefits of the invention 
reasonably accessible to the public.
    (6) The license shall require the licensee to report, at least 
annually, on the utilization or efforts at obtaining utilization that 
are made by the licensee, with particular reference to the plan 
submitted.
    (7) Licenses may be royalty-free or for royalties or other 
consideration.
    (8) When the licensee agrees that any products embodying the 
invention or produced through use of the invention will be manufactured 
substantially in the United States, the license shall recite such 
agreement.
    (9) The license shall provide for the right of the Air Force to 
terminate the license, in whole or in part, if:

[[Page 76]]

    (i) The Air Force determines that the licensee is not executing the 
plan submitted with its requests for a license and the licensee cannot 
otherwise demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Air Force that it has 
taken or can be expected to take within a reasonable time effective 
steps to achieve practical application of the invention;
    (ii) The Air Force determines that such action is necessary to meet 
requirements for public use specified by Federal regulations issued 
after the date of the license and such requirements are not reasonably 
satisfied by the licensee;
    (iii) The licensee has willfully made a false statement of or 
willfully omitted a material fact in the license application or in any 
report required by the license agreement; or
    (iv) The licensee commits a substantial breach of a covenant or 
agreement contained in the license.
    (10) The license may be modified or terminated consistent with this 
part upon mutual agreement of the Air Force and the licensee.
    (11) Nothing relating to the grant of a license, nor the grant 
itself, shall be construed to confer upon any person, any immunity from 
or defense under the antitrust laws or from a charge of patent misuse, 
and the acquisition and use of rights pursuant to this subpart shall not 
be immunized from the operation of state or Federal law by reason of the 
source of the grant.
    (12) The license shall contain a provision that the government makes 
no representation or warranty as to the validity of any licensed patent 
or patent application, or of the scope of any of the claims contained 
therein, or that the exercise of the license will not result in the 
infringement of any other patent and that the Government assumes no 
liability whatsoever resulting from the exercise of the license.


<R05>
Sec. 841.7  Nonexclusive licenses.

    Each Air Force invention normally will be made available for the 
granting of nonexclusive licenses, subject to the provisions of any 
other license, including those in Sec. 841.8, and subject to the 
following condition: the nonexclusive license may also provide that, 
after termination of a period specified in the license agreement, the 
Air Force may restrict the license to the fields of use or geographic 
areas, or both, in which the licensee has brought the invention to 
practical application and continues to make the benefits of the 
invention reasonably accessible to the public. However, such restriction 
shall be made only in order to grant an exclusive or partially exclusive 
license according to this part.


<R05>
Sec. 841.8  Exclusive and partially exclusive licenses.

    Each Government invention may be made available for the granting of 
an exclusive or partially exclusive license subject to the following 
restrictions and conditions:
    (a) Restrictions. Exclusive or partially exclusive licenses may be 
granted on federally owned inventions as follows:
    (1) Three months after notice of the invention's availability has 
been announced in the Federal Register; or
    (2) Without such notice where the Air Force determines that 
expeditious granting of such a license will best serve the interest of 
the Federal Government and the public; and
    (3) In either situation specified in paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of 
this section only if:
    (i) Notice of a prospective license, identifying the invention and 
the prospective licensee, has been published in the Federal Register, 
providing opportunity for filing written objections within a 60-day 
period;
    (ii) After expiration of the 60-day period and consideration of any 
written objections received during the period, the Air Force makes the 
determinations required by Sec. 841.15 favorably to the applicant; and
    (iii) The Air Force has given first preference to any small business 
firms submitting plans that are determined by the agency to be within 
the capabilities of the firms and as equally likely, if executed, to 
bring the invention to practical application as any plans submitted by 
applicants that are not small business firms.
    (b) Conditions. In addition to the provisions of Sec. 841.6, the 
following terms and conditions apply to domestic exclusive and partially 
exclusive licenses:

[[Page 77]]

    (1) The license shall be subject to the irrevocable royalty-free 
right of the Government of the United States to practice and have 
practiced the invention on behalf of the United States and on behalf of 
any foreign government or international organization pursuant to any 
existing or future treaty or agreement with the United States.
    (2) The license shall reserve to the Air Force the right to require 
the licensee to grant sublicenses to responsible applicants, on 
reasonable terms, when necessary to fulfill health or safety needs.
    (3) The license shall be subject to any licenses in force at the 
time of the grant of the exclusive or partially exclusive license.
    (4) The license may grant the licensee the right of enforcement of 
the licensed patent pursuant to the provisions of 35 U.S.C. 29, as 
determined appropriate in the public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 841.9  Additional licenses.

    Nothing in this part will preclude the Air Force from granting 
licenses for Air Force inventions which are the result of an authorized 
exchange of rights in the settlement of patent disputes. The following 
exemplify circumstances wherein such licenses may be granted:
    (a) In consideration of the settlement of an interference;
    (b) In consideration of a release of a claim of infringement; or
    (c) In exchange for or as part of the consideration for a license 
under adversely held patents.


<R05>
Sec. 841.10  Foreign licenses.

    (a) Exclusive or partially exclusive licenses may be granted on an 
Air Force invention covered by a foreign patent, patent application, or 
other form of protection, provided that:
    (1) Notice of a prospective license identifying the invention and 
prospective licensee has been published in the Federal Register, 
providing opportunity for filing written objections within a 60-day 
period and following consideration of such objections;
    (2) The Air Force has considered whether the interests of the 
Federal Government or United States industry in foreign commerce will be 
enhanced; and
    (3) The Air Force has not determined that the grant of such license 
will tend substantially to lessen competition or result in undue 
concentration in any section of the United States in any line of 
commerce to which the technology to be licensed relates, or to create or 
maintain other situations inconsistent with antitrust laws.
    (b) In addition to the provisions of Sec. 841.6, the following terms 
and conditions apply to foreign exclusive and partially exclusive 
licenses:
    (1) The license shall be subject to the irrevocable, royalty-free 
right of the United States Government to practice and have practiced the 
invention on behalf of any foreign government or international 
organization pursuant to any existing or future treaty or agreement with 
the United States.
    (2) The license shall be subject to any licenses in force at the 
time of the grant of the exclusive license.
    (3) The license may grant the licensee the right to take any 
suitable and necessary action to protect the licensed property on behalf 
of the United States Government.

    File a claim at the base legal office of the unit or installation at 
or nearest to where the accident or incident occurred. If the accident 
or incident occurred in a foreign country where no Air Force unit is 
located, file the claim with the Defense Attache (DATT) or Military 
Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) personnel authorized to receive claims 
(DIAM 100-1 and AFR 400-45). In a foreign country where a claimant is 
unable to obtain adequate assistance in filing a claim, the claimant may 
contact the nearest Air Force SJA. The SJA then advises HQ USAF/JACC 
thorugh claims channels of action taken and states why the DATT or MAAG 
was unable to adequately assist the claimant.


<R05>
Sec. 842.5  Claims forms.

    Any signed written demand on the Air Force for a sum certain is 
sufficient to file a claim. The claimant should use these forms when 
filing a claim:
    (a) Claim processed under the Military Personnel and Civilian 
Employees' Claims Act. Use AF Form 180, Claim For Loss of or Damage To 
Personal Property Incident To Service, or DD Forms 1842, Claim for 
Personal Property Against the United States, and 1844, Schedule of 
Property and Claim Analysis Chart, to file the claim.

Death.


<R05>
Sec. 842.6  Signature on the claim form.

    (a) Claim filed by an individaul. (1) A married woman signs her 
name, for example, Mary A. Doe, rather than Mrs. John Doe.
    (2) An authorized agent signing for a claimant shows, after the 
signature, the title or capacity and attaches evidence of authority to 
present a claim on behalf of the claimant as agent, executor, 
administrator, parent, guardian, or other representative; for example, 
John Doe by Richard Roe, Attorney in Fact. A copy of a current and valid 
power of attorney, court order, or other legal document is sufficient 
evidence of the agent's authority.
    (b) Claim with joint interest. Where a joint ownership or interest 
in real property exists, all joint owners must sign the claim form. This 
includes a husband and wife signing a claim if the claim is for property 
damage. However, only the military member or civilian employee signs the 
claim form for a claim under the Military Personnel and Civilian 
Employees' Claims Act.
    (c) Claim filed by a corporation. (1) A corporate officer signing 
the form must show title or capacity and affix the corporate seal (if 
any) to the claim form.

legally entitled to do so under applicable local law may file a claim 
for a minor's personal injury.
    (3) The executor or administrator of the decedent's estate or any 
other person legally entitled to do so under applicable local law may 
file a claim based on an individual's death.
    (c) Subrogation. The subrogor (insured) and the subrogee (insurer) 
may file a claim jointly or individually. Pay a fully subrogated claim 
only to the subrogee. A joint claim must be asserted in the names of and 
signed by the real parties in interest. Make payment by sending a joint 
check to the subrogee, made payable to the subroger and subrogee. If 
separate claims are filed, make payment by check issued to each claimant 
to the extent of each undisputed interest.


<R05>
Sec. 842.8  Insured claimants.

    Insured claimants must make a detailed disclosure of their insurance

<R05>
Sec. 842.9  Splitting a claim.

    (a) A claim includes all damages accruing to a claimant by reason of 
an accident or incident. For example, when the same claimant has a claim 
for property damage and personal injury arising out of the same 
incident, each claim represents only a part of a single claim or cause 
of action. Even if local law permits filing a separate

[[Page 84]]

claim for property damage and for personal injury, do not settle or pay 
a separate or split claim without the advance approval of HQ USAF/JACC.
    (b) Filing for an advance payment, and subsequently filing a claim, 
does not constitute splitting a claim.
    (c) Process the claim of a subrogor (insured) and subrogee (insurer) 
for damages arising out of the same incident as a single claim where 
permitted. If either claim or the combined claim exceeds, or is expected 
to exceed, settlement limits, send it to the next higher settlement 
authority. Do not split subrogated claims to avoid settlement limits.

experiences personal hardship due to extensive property damage or loss. 
Examples where partial payments are appropriate include fires and sunken 
transport ships. Partial payments are made in this manner:
    (a) If a claim for only part of the loss is submitted and is readily 
provable, pay it up to the amount of the settlement authority. (The 
claimant may later amend the claim for the remainder of the loss.) If 
the total payable amount of the claim exceeds the payment limits of the 
settlement authority, send it with recommendations through claims 
channels to the proper settlement authority.

the settlement authority, pay a partial payment within the limits of 
settlement authority and send the claim, with recommendations, through 
claims channels to the proper settlement authority.

it accrues. It accrues when the claimant discovered or reasonably should 
have discovered the full extent of the property damage or loss. For 
transportation losses, the claim usually accrues on the date of 
delivery.
    (b) To compute the statutory period, the incident date is excluded 
and the day the claim was filed is included.
    (c) Consider a claim filed after the statute has run if both of the 
following are present:
    (1) The United States is at war or in an armed conflict when the 
claim accrues, or the United States enters a war or armed conflict after 
the claim accrues. Congress or the President establishes the beginning 
and end of war or armed conflict. A claimant may not file a claim more

subpart O).
    (h) Military personnel of foreign governments.


<R05>
Sec. 842.30  General provisions.

    Payable claims must be for:
    (a) Personal property which is reasonable or useful under the 
circumstances of military service.
    (b) Loss, damage, destruction, confiscation, or forced abandonment 
which is incident to service.
    (c) Losses that are not collectable from any other source, including

    (d) Property that is owned by the claimants, their immediate 
families, or borrowed for their use.
    (e) Losses occurring without the claimants' negligence.


<R05>
Sec. 842.31  Claims payable.

    Claims may be paid for:
    (a) Transportation or storage loss: (1) Pay for property damage or 
loss incident to:
    (i) Transportation under orders, whether it was in the possession of 
the government, carrier, storage warehouse, or other government 
contractor. This includes Do-It-Yourself (DITY) moves.
    (ii) Travel under orders, including temporary duty (TDY).
    (iii) Travel on a space available basis on a military aircraft, 
vessel, or vehicle.
    (2) Pay for property essential to everyday use, if the claimant has 
replaced the items that he or she reported as missing. Essential items 
may be paid for even if someone locates the property before the claimant 
files the claim.
    (b) Losses at quarters and other authorized places--(1) In the 
United States (including U.S. territories and possessions). Pay for 
personal property damage or loss, to include food spoilage, which is 
caused by fire, explosion, theft, vandalism, typhoon, hurricane, unusual 
occurrences or power outages which last for an extended period of time. 
The claimant must be free of negligence.
    (i) Claims for damage or loss caused by other acts of god are not 
paid except in those instances where the geographic area has been 
declared to be a federal disaster area or HQ USAF/JACC has determined 
that payment is appropriate because the severity of the act of god was 
truly extraordinary.
    (ii) In some areas, extreme weather, such as severe lightning 
storms, hail, or high winds, occur routinely. Damage claims from these 
storms are normally not paid. Failure to take reasonable care in 
protecting property from such known hazards may be negligence. These 
types of claims would include pitted windshields, dents, chipped paint 
on vehicles, and lightning damage to television sets, stereos, computer 
components, video recorders, and other electrical appliances.
    (2) Outside the United States. Pay for personal property damage or 
loss, to include food spoilage, which is caused by fire, explosion, 
theft, vandalism, acts of god, unusual occurrences, or power outages 
which last for an extended period of time. The claimant must be free of 
negligence. The SJA must make an affirmative determination that the act 
of god or unusual occurrence was truly extraordinary.
    (c) Privately owned vehicles (POV). Pay for damage to or loss of 
POVs caused by government negligence under subpart F or K. Pay under 
this subpart for damage or loss incident to:
    (1) Theft of POVs or their contents, or vandalism to parked POVs:
    (i) Anywhere on a military installation.
    (ii) At offbase quarters overseas.
    (iii) At other authorized places.
    (2) Government shipment:
    (i) To or from oversea areas incident to PCS.
    (ii) On a space available reimbursable basis.
    (iii) As a replacement vehicle under the provisions of the Joint 
Travel Regulations (JTR).
    (3) Authorized use for government duty other than PCS moves. The 
owner must have specific advance permission of the appropriate 
supervisor or official. Adequate proof of the permission

[[Page 90]]

and of nonavailability of official transportation must be provided prior 
to paying such claims. Claims arising while the claimant is deviating 
from the principal route or purpose of the trip should not be paid, but 
claims occurring after the claimant returns to the route or purpose 
should be paid. Travel between quarters and place of duty, including 
parking, is not authorized use for government duty.
    (4) Paint spray, smokestack emission, and other similar operations 
by the Air Force on a military installation caused by a contractor's 
negligence. (Process the claim under subpart F or K, if government 
negligence causes such losses.) If a contractor's operation caused the 
damage:
    (i) Refer the claim first to the contractor for settlement.
    (ii) Settle the claim under this subpart if the contractor does not 
pay it or excessively delays payment, and assert a claim against the 
contractor.
    (d) Damage to mobile or manufactured homes and contents in shipment. 
Pay such claims if there is no evidence of structural or mechanical 
failure for which the manufacturer is responsible.
    (e) Borrowed property. Pay for loss or damage to property claimants 
borrow for their use. Either the borrower or lender, if proper 
claimants, may file a claim. Do not pay for property borrowed to 
accommodate the lender, i.e., such as to avoid weight or baggage 
restrictions in travel.
    (f) Marine or aircraft incident. Pay claims of crewmembers and 
passengers who are in duty or leave status at the time of the incident. 
Payable items include jettisoned baggage, clothing worn at the time of 
an incident, and reasonable amounts of money, jewelry, and other 
personal items.
    (g) Combat losses. Pay for personal property losses, whether or not 
the United States was involved, due to:
    (1) Enemy action.
    (2) Action to prevent capture and confiscation.
    (3) Combat activities.
    (h) Civil activity losses. Pay for losses resulting from a 
claimant's acts to:
    (1) Quell a civil disturbance.
    (2) Assist during a public disaster.
    (3) Save human life.
    (4) Save government property.
    (i) Confiscated property. Pay for losses when:
    (1) A foreign government unjustly confiscates property.
    (2) An unjust change or application of foreign law forces surrender 
or abandonmnet of property.
    (j) Clothing and accessories worn on the person. Pay claims for 
damage to eyeglasses, hearing aids, and dentures the government did not 
supply, when the damage results from actions beyond the normal risks 
associated with daily living and working. Claimants assume the risk of 
normal wear and tear, and their negligence bars payment of the claim.
    (k) Money losses. Pay claims for loss of money when the losses are 
due to theft from quarters, other authorized places, or from the person, 
if the claimant was required to be in the area and could not avoid the 
theft by due care. As a general rule, $200.00 is reasonable to have in 
quarters, and $100.00 is reasonable to have on the person unless:
    (1) The money was in a bona fide coin collection.
    (2) The claimant can justify possession of the money for a PCS move, 
extended TDY, vacation, extensive shopping trip, or similar 
circumstances. The claimant must show a good reason why the money had 
not been deposited in a bank or converted into travelers checks or a 
money order.
    (3) Local commercial facilities are not available or because US 
personnel do not generally use such facilities.


<R05>
Sec. 842.32  Claims not payable.

    A claim is not payable if:
    (a) It is not incident to the claimant's service.
    (b) The loss or damage is caused in whole or in part by the 
negligence or wrongful act of the claimant, the claimant's spouse, 
agent, or employee.
    (c) It is a subrogation or assigned claim.
    (d) The loss is recovered or recoverable from an insurer or other 
source. When a loss is recovered or is recoverable:
    (1) The amount payable by insurance should be deducted if an insurer 
denied a claim because a claimant failed to report the loss or to file a 
timely claim under the policy. The claim should be

[[Page 91]]

paid if the settlement authority determines the claimant had good cause 
for not filing with the insurer, or
    (2) The amount which the Air Force cannot recover from a carrier 
because the claimant failed to give timely notice of loss or damage 
should be subtracted from the settlement unless the claimant shows good 
cause for failure to give notice.
    (e) It is intangible property including bank books, promissory 
notes, stock certificates, bonds, baggage checks, insurance policies, 
checks, money orders, travelers checks and credit cards.
    (f) It is government property, including issued clothing items 
carried on an individual issue supply account. (Clothing not carried on 
an individual issue supply account which is stolen or clothing lost or 
damaged in transit may be considered as a payable item when claimed.)
    (g) It is enemy property.
    (h) It is a loss within the United States at offbase quarters the 
government did not provide.
    (i) It is damage to real property.
    (j) It is an appraisal fee, unless the settlement authority requires 
one to adjudicate the claim. HQ USAF/JACC must authorize payment for an 
appraisal fee of more than $100.
    (k) It is property acquired or shipped for persons other than the 
claimant or the claimant's immediate family; however, a claim for 
property acquired for bona fide gifts may be paid.
    (l) It is an article held for sale, resale, or used primarily in a 
private business.
    (m) It is an item acquired, possessed, shipped, or stored in 
violation of any U.S. Armed Force directive or regulation. This includes 
an automobile for which a member fails to comply with base registration 
or insurance regulations. A claim must not be paid if one or more of 
these factors exist:
    (1) The loss was the type the regulation or directive intended to 
prevent.
    (2) The violation was willful or in defiance of authority, rather 
than minor or technical in nature.
    (3) The violation either undermined discipline or adversely affected 
command welfare.
    (n) It is an item fraudulently claimed. Deny payment for an item 
when investigation shows the claimant has intentionally falsified the 
value, condition, extent of damage, or repair cost of it. The claim file 
must show clear intent to defraud. A mere mistake is not a fraud.
    (o) It is for charges for labor performed by the owner or immediate 
family member.
    (p) It is for financial loss due to changed or cancelled orders.
    (q) It is for expenses of enroute repair of a mobile or manufactured 
home.

    (s) It is an attorney or agent fee.
    (t) It is the cost of preparing a claim, other than estimate fees.

    (w) It is a personal property insurance premium.
    (x) It is a claim for a thesis or other similar papers, except for 
the cost of materials.
    (y) It is damage to, or loss of a rental vehicle which TDY or PCS 
orders authorized. These claims may be payable through Accounting and 
Finance as a travel expense.
    (z) It is a cost to relocate a telephone or mobile or manufactured 
home due to a government ordered quarters move. The member submits such 
claims to the commander directing the move for payment from other 
Operation and Maintenance (O&M) funds.
    (aa) It is for damage to or loss of property stored at the owner's 
expense unless the claimant's duty made storage necessary.
    (bb) It is for damage to clothing and accessories caused by routine 
wrinkles.
    (cc) It is hit-and-run damage to POVs.
    (dd) It is for damage to clothing and accessories caused by contact 
with office furniture or getting in or out of a government vehicle 
unless the damage was caused by an unknown defect.


<R05>
Sec. 842.33  Reconsideration of a claim.

    A claimant may request reconsideration of an initial settlement or 
denial

[[Page 92]]

of a claim. The claimant sends the request in writing, to the settlement 
authority within a reasonable time following the initial settlement or 
denial. Sixty days is considered a reasonable time, but the settlement 
authority may waive the time limit for good cause.
    (a) The original settlement authority reviews the reconsideration 
request. The settlement authority sends the entire claim file with 
recommendations and supporting rationale to the next higher settlement 
authority if all relief the claimant requests is not granted.

administrative action on the claim.


<R05>
Sec. 842.34  Right of subrogation, indemnity, and contribution.

    The Air Force becomes subrogated to the rights of the claimant upon 
settling a claim. The Air Force has the rights of contribution and 
indemnity permitted by the law of the situs or under contract. The Air 
Force does not seek contribution or indemnity from US military personnel 
or civilian employees whose conduct in scope of employment gave rise to 
government liability.


<R05>
Sec. 842.35  Depreciation and maximum allowances.

    The military services have jointly established the ``Allowance List-
Depreciation Guide'' to determine values for most items and to limit 
payment for some categories of items.

based on the wording of 28 U.S.C. 2680. The remainder are based either 
on statute or court decisions. The interpretation of these exclusions is 
a Federal question decided under Federal law. Where State law differs

whether or not such statute or regulation is valid. Do not deny claims 
solely on this exception without the prior approval of HQ USAF/JACC.
    (b) Is based on the exercise or performance or the failure to 
exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a 
Federal agency or an employee of the government, whether or not the 
discretion involved is abused. Do not deny claims solely on this 
exception without the prior approval of HQ USAF/JACC.

    (6) Military Personnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act.


<R05>
Sec. 842.51   Applicable law.

    This paragraph provides the existing law governing liability, 
measurement of liability and the effects of settlement upon awards.
    (a) Extent of liability. Where the claim arises is important in 
determining the extent of liability.
    (1) When a claim arises in the United States, the law of the place 
where the act or omission occurred governs liability. The settlement 
authority considers the local law on such issues as dangerous 
instrumentalities, assumption of risk, res ipsa loquitur, last clear 
chance, discovered peril, and comparative and contributory negligence. 
Absolute liability is never imposed.
    (2) Claims in foreign countries. (i) In claims arising in a foreign 
country, where the claim is for personal injury, death, or damage to or 
loss of real or personal property caused by an act or omission alleged 
to be negligent, wrongful, or otherwise involving fault of military 
personnel or civilian officers or employees of the United States acting 
within the scope of their employment, liability or the United States is 
determined according to general principles of tort law common to the 
majority of American jurisdictions, as evidenced by Federal case law and 
standard legal publications, except as to the principle of absolute 
liability.
    (ii) The law of the foreign country governing the legal effect of 
contributory or comparative negligence by the claimant will be applied 
in determining the relative merits of the claim. In the unusual 
situation where foreign law governing contributory or comparative 
negligence does not exist, use traditional rules of contributory 
negligence. Foreign rules and regulations governing the operation of 
motor vehicles (rules of the road) are applied to the extent those rules 
are not specifically superseded or preempted by United States military 
traffic regulations.
    (3) When adjudicating claims based upon negligence, the principle of 
absolute liability is not applicable, even though otherwise prescribed 
by applicable local law.
    (4) The meaning and construction of the MCA is a Federal question to 
be determined by Federal law.
    (b) General information: (1) The measure of daages in claims arising 
in the United States or its possessions is determined according to the 
law of the place where the act or omission occurred. The measure of 
damages in claims arising overseas is determined according to general 
principles of American tort law.
    (2) Apportion damages against the United States in the same manner 
as they are apportioned in suites against private persons if local law 
applies comparative negligence.
    (3) Do not deduct proceeds from private insurance policies except to 
the extent allowed by local law. However, proceeds are deducted if the 
policy was paid for by the United States.
    (4) Deduct compensation and benefits from the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, or monetary value received from any U.S. Government associated 
source from the damages which may be awarded. Deduct sick and annual 
leave payments if local law allows.
    (5) Do not approve:

[[Page 99]]

    (i) Punitive damages.
    (ii) Cost of medical or hospital services furnished at U.S. expense.
    (iii) Cost of burial expenses paid by the United States.
    (c) Settlement by insurer or joint tort-feasor. When settlement is 
made by an insurer or joint tort-feasor and an additional award is 
warranted, an award may be made if both of the following are present:
    (1) The United States is not protected by the release executed by 
the claimant.
    (2) The total amount received from such source is first deducted.


<R05>
Sec. 842.52   Appeal of final denials.

    (a) A claimant may appeal the final denial of the claim. The 
claimant sends the request, in writing, to the settlement authority 
within a reasonable time following the final denial. Sixty days is 
considered a reasonable time, but the settlement authority may waive the 
time limit for good cause.
    (b) Upon receipt of the appeal, the original settlement authority 
reviews the appeal.
    (c) Where the settlement authority does not reach a final agreement 
on an appealed claim, he or she sends the entire claim file to the next 
higher settlement authority, who is the appellate authority for that 
claim.
    (d) The decision of the appellate authority is the final 
administrative action on the claim.


<R05>
Sec. 842.53  Right of subrogation, indemnity, and contribution.

    The Air Force becomes subrogated to the rights of the claimant upon 
settling a claim. The Air Force has the rights of contribution and 
indemnity permitted by the law of the situs, or under contract. Do not 
seek contribution or indemnity from US military personnel or civilian 
employees whose conduct gave rise to government liability.


<R05>
Sec. 842.54  Attorney fees.

    In the settlement of any claim pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2733 and this 
subpart, attorney fees will not exceed 20 percent of any award provided 
that when a claim involves payment of an award over $1,000,000, attorney 
fees on that part of the award exceeding $1,000,000 may be determined by 
the Secretary of the Air Force. For the purposes of this paragraph, an 
award is deemed to be the cost to the United States of any trust or 
structured settlement, and not its future value.


<R04>
               Subpart G--Foreign Claims (10 U.S.C. 2734)


<R05>
Sec. 842.55  Scope of this subpart.

    (d) Settlement negotiations. A settlement authority may settle a 
claim in any sum within its settlement authority, regardless of the 
amount claimed. Send uncompromised claims in excess of the delegated 
authority through claims channels to the level with settlement 
authority. Unsuccessful negotiations at one level do not bind higher 
authority.
    (e) Special exceptions. Do not settle claims for medical malpractice 
without HQ USAF/JACC approval.

legally entitled to do so under applicable local law, for an

    (d) Authorized agents (including the claimant's attorney) must show 
their title or legal capacity and present evidence of authority to

<R05>
Sec. 842.62  Who are proper claimants.

    Claimants include inhabitants of a foreign country who are:
    (a) Foreign nationals.
    (b) US nationals, unless they reside there primarily because they 
are:
    (1) Employed directly by the United States.
    (2) Employed by a US civilian contractor to further performance of a 
contract with the United States.
    (3) Sponsored by or accompanying someone employed as described in 
Sec. 842.62(b) (1) or (2) of this part.
    (c) US corporations with a place of business in the country in which 
the claim arose.
    (d) Foreign governments and their political subdivisions, including

<R05>

    Persons who are not proper claimants include:
    (a) Insurers and other subrogees.
    (b) Dependents accompanying US military and US national civilian 
employees.
    (c) Foreign military personnel suffering property damage, personal 
injury, or death from a joint military mission with the United States or 
from conduct of a US military member or employee acting in the scope of 
employment unless an international agreement specifically provides for 
recovery.
    (d) Civilian employees of the United States, including local 
inhabitants, injured in the scope of their employment.
    (e) National governments and their political subdivisions engaging 
in war or armed conflict with the United States or its allies.
    (f) A national or nationally controlled corporation of a country 
engaging in war or armed conflict with the United States or its allies, 
unless the FCC or local military commander determines the claimant is 
friendly with the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 842.64  Payment criteria.

    The following criteria is considered before determining liability.
    (a) The incident causing the damage or injury must occur outside the 
United States. It must be caused by noncombatant activities of the US 
Armed Forces or by civilian employees or military members of the Armed 
Forces.
    (b) Negligence is not a prerequisite.
    (c) Scope of employment is considered in the following situations.
    (1) It is a prerequisite to US responsibility if the employee 
causing the damage or injury is a local inhabitant, a prisoner of war, 
or an interned enemy alien. These persons are ``employees'' within the 
meaning of the Foreign Claims Act (FCA) only when in the service of the 
United States. Ordinarily, a slight deviation as to time or place does 
not constitute a departure from the scope of employment. The purpose of 
the activity and whether it furthers the general interest of the United 
States is considered. If the claim arose from the operation or use of a 
US Armed Forces vehicle or other equipment by such a person, pay it 
provided local law imposes liability on the owner of the vehicle or 
other equipment in the circumstances involved.
    (2) It is immaterial when the claim arises from the acts or 
omissions of any US Armed Forces member or employee not listed in 
Sec. 842.64(c)(1) of this part. The Act imposes responsibility on the 
United States when it places a US citizen or non-US citizen employee in 
a position to cause the injury or damage. If the cause is a criminal act 
clearly outside the scope of employment, ordinarily pay the claim and 
consider disciplinary action against the offender.


<R05>
Sec. 842.65  Claims not payable.

    A claim is not payable when it:
    (a) Has been paid or denied by a competent tribunal under the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), 
or any similar SOFA or treaty.
    (b) Is purely contractual in nature.

[[Page 102]]

    (c) Is for attorney fees, punitive damages, a judgment or interest 
on a judgment, bail, or court costs.
    (d) Accrues from a private contractual relationship between US 
personnel and third parties about property leases, public utilities, 
hiring of domestic servants, and debts of any description. This claim is 
sent for action to the commander of the person concerned (see 32 CFR 
part 818).
    (e) Is based solely on compassionate grounds.

    Note: A Solatium payment is paid from O&M funds as an investigative 
expense.

    (f) Is a bastardy claim.
    (g) Is for patent or copyright infringement.
    (h) Is waived under an international agreement.
    (i) Is for rent, damage, or other payments involving regular 
acquisition, possession, and disposition of real property by or for the 
Air Force.
    (j) Is filed by a Communist country or its inhabitants, unless 
authorized by HQ USAF/JACC.
    (k) Is for real property taken by a continuing trespass.
    (l) Is for personal injury or death of a person covered by:
    (1) The Federal Employees' Compensation Act (5 U.S.C. 8101, et 
seq.).
    (2) The Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (33 U.S.C. 
901, et seq.).
    (3) A US contract or agreement providing employee benefits through 
insurance, local law, or custom, where the United States pays for them 
either directly or as part of the consideration under the contract. (See 
42 U.S.C. 1651 and 42 U.S.C. 1701.) The Judge Advocate General or Chief, 
Claims and Tort Litigation Staff, HQ USAF/JACC, may authorize an award 
where local benefits are not adequate. Local benefits are deducted from 
any award.
    (m) Results from an action by an enemy, or directly or indirectly 
from an act of the armed forces of the United States in combat, except 
that a claim may be allowed if it arises from an accident or malfunction 
incident to the operation of an aircraft of the armed forces of the 
United States, including its airborne ordnance, indirectly related to 
combat, and occurring while preparing for or going to, or returning from 
a combat mission.
    (n) Is based on negligence of a concessionaire or other independent 
contractor.
    (o) Arises out of personal activities of dependents, guests, 
servants, or pets of members and employees of the US Armed Forces. (This 
includes situations where local law imposes strict liability or where 
the head of a household is held vicariously liable for their 
negligence.)
    (p) Is the subject of litigation against the United States or its 
employees. This restriction does not apply to joint criminal/civil 
proceedings in a foreign court. Claims settlement may be authorized by 
HQ USAF/JACC in appropriate cases on request.
    (q) Is covered under US admiralty laws, unless authorized by The 
Judge Advocate General or Chief, Claims and Tort Litigation Staff.
    (r) Is one for which a foreign government is responsible under SOFA, 
treaty, or other agreement. However, HQ USAF/JACC may authorize payment 
of a claim where the foreign government refuses to recognize its legal 
responsibilities and the claimant has no other means of compensation.


<R05>
Sec. 842.66  Applicable law.

    This paragraph provides guidance to determine the applicable law for 
assessment of liability.
    (a) A claim is settled under the law and standards in effect in the 
country where the incident occurred. In calculating the amount of any 
lump sum award, the present value of any periodic payment upon which the 
award is based, is computed, unless the law of the place of occurrence 
prohibits it.
    (b) Contributory negligence committed by the claimant, claimant's 
agent, or employee is not used as a bar to recovery unless local law or 
custom requires it. If the comparative negligence doctrine is used, the 
percentage of negligence of each party is reflected in the apportionment 
of liability. The amount of damage sustained by both parties is 
apportioned according to local law.
    (c) The following principles of the collateral source doctrine are 
applied in settling a claim except where local law provides otherwise:

[[Page 103]]

    (1) Any sums the claimant recovers from collateral sources, 
including proceeds of property insurance the claimant paid for are not 
deducted from the claim except when those sums are from:
    (i) The US Government.
    (ii) A US military member or employee.
    (iii) A Joint tort-feasor.
    (iv) An Insurer of Sec. 842.66(c)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii), above.
    (2) Do not deduct insurance or any other payments where the US 
military member or employee would have to make reimbursement.


<R05>
Sec. 842.67  Reconsideration of final denials.

    This paragraph provides the procedures used to reconsider a final 
denial.
    (a) An FCC may reopen, reverse, or reconsider, in whole or in part, 
any claim it previously decided if the request for reconsideration is 
received in a reasonable time. Sixty days is considered a reasonable 
time, but the FCC may waive the time limit for good cause.
    (b) An FCC reconsiders the final action on a claim when there is:
    (1) New and material evidence concerning the claim.
    (2) Obvious error in facts or calculation of the original 
settlement.
    (3) Fraud or collusion in the original submission of the claim.
    (c) The FCC must state the reason for reconsideration in its 
opinion. A court decision is not in itself sufficient basis for 
reconsidering a claim, but the facts that resulted in the judgment may 
warrant reconsideration. The amount of a court judgment is not binding 
on a FCC's determination of damage, but the commission may consider the 
judgment as evidence of the local law on the subject.


<R05>
Sec. 842.68  Right of subrogation, indemnity, and contribution.

    The Air Force becomes subrogated to the rights of the claimant upon 
settling a claim. The Air Force has the rights of indemnity and

<R05>
Sec. 842.89  Statute of limitations.

    A claim must be presented in writing within 2 years after it 
accrues.
    (a) Federal, not state law, determines the time of accrual. A claim

in the claimed loss.
    (b) In computing the statutory time period, the day of the incident 
is excluded and the day the claim was filed is included.
    (c) The Air Force has 6 months to consider a properly filed claim, 
after which the claimant may file suit. The claimant's right to sue ends 
6 months from the date the final denial is mailed.
    (d) Properly asserted third party actions, as permitted under the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, may be brought against the United 
States without first filing a claim. In such instances those actions may 
start more than 2 years after the claim has accrued.

request, the claim file is sent to the next higher claims settlement 
authority for action.
    (b) A request for reconsideration must be filed in writing within 6 
months of the final denial and prior to initiation of a suit. A request 
for reconsideration starts a new 6-month period for the Air Force to 
consider the claim. The claimant may not sue during that period.

claim for property damage, injury or death by the ANG which accrued 
prior to 29 December 1981.

[[Page 110]]


<R05>
Sec. 842.101  Definitions.

    (a) Appeal. An appeal is a request by the claimant or claimant's 
authorized agent to reevaluate the final decision made on a claim. A 
request for reconsideration is considered as an appeal.
    (b) Air National Guard (ANG). The federally recognized Air National 
Guard of each state, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam.
    (c) ANG member. An ANG member is one who is performing duty under 32

entitled to pay from the United States or for which the member has 
waived pay from the United States.
    (d) ANG duty status--(1) Active federal service. ANG members may 
serve on active Federal duty under 10 U.S.C. to augment the active Air 
Force under certain circumstances or for certain types of duty or 
training (e.g., overseas training exercises and ANG alert duty). Duty 
under 10 U.S.C. does not fall under this subpart.
    (2) Federally funded duty. ANG members perform specified federally 
funded duty or training under 32 U.S.C. such as weekend drills, annual 
training, field exercises, range firing, military schooling, full time 
unit support, or recruiting duties. Duty under 32 U.S.C. falls under 
this subpart for noncombat activities.
    (3) State duty. State duty is duty not authorized by federal law but 
required by the governor of the state and paid for from state funds. 
Such duty includes civil emergencies (natural or other disasters), civil 
disturbances (riots and strikes), and transportation requirements for 
official state functions, public health, or safety. State duty does not 
fall under this subpart.
    (e) Compromise. A compromise is an agreed settlement based upon the 
facts, the law, and the application of the law to the facts.
    (f) Final denial. A final denial is a letter from the settlement 
authority to the claimant or authorized agent advising of the decision 
to deny the claim.
    (g) Noncombat activity. Noncombat activity is an act, other than 
combat, war or armed conflict, which is particularly military in 
character and has little parallel in the civilian community.
    (h) ANG technicians. An ANG technician is a Federal employee

authority to:
    (i) Settle a claim for $100,000 or less.

    (i) The Deputy Judge Advocate General.
    (ii) The Director of Civil Law.
    (iii) The Chief, Deputy Chief, and Branch Chiefs, Claims and Tort 
Litigation Staff.

all claims or limited to a single claim.

[[Page 111]]

    (c) Appellate authority. Upon appeal a settlement authority has the 
same authority to settle a claim as that specified above. However, no

Any superior settlement authority may reduce, withdraw, or restore 
delegated settlement authority.
    (e) Settlement negotiations. A settlement authority may settle a 
claim filed in any amount for a sum within the delegated settlement 
authority regardless of the amount claimed. Unsettled claims in excess 
of the delegated settlement authority are sent to the individual with

not bind higher authority.
    (f) Special exceptions. No authority below the level of HQ USAF/JACC 
may settle claims for:
    (1) Legal malpractice.
    (2) On the job personal injury or death of an employee of a 
government contractor or subcontractor.
    (3) Assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, abuse of

enforcement officer.


<R05>
Sec. 842.103  Filing a claim.

    This paragraph explains how to file a claim under the National Guard 
Claims Act.
    (a) How and when filed. A claim is filed when a federal military 
agency receives from a claimant or duly authorized agent a properly 
completed SF 95 or other written and signed demand for money damages in 
a sum certain. Claims belonging to another agency are promptly 
transferred to the correct agency.
    (b) Receipt of claims from State National Guard agencies. The Office 
of the State Adjutant General promptly sends claims it receives to the 
appropriate Air Force claims authority in whose geographic area the 
incident occurred. The report forwarded to the Air Force includes:
    (1) The date, place, and nature of the incident.
    (2) The names and organizations of ANG members involved, and the 
statutory duty status of the ANG members at the time of the incident 
(include copies of orders, if applicable).
    (3) A scope of employment statement from the supervisors of the ANG 
members involved.
    (4) The names of the claimants.
    (5) A brief description of any damage to private property, personal 
injuries, or death.
    (c) Claims investigations. (1) Upon receipt of a claim:
    (i) It is investigated by claims office personnel responsible for 
the geographic area where the incident causing the claim occurred.
    (ii) The investigative report includes a scope of employment 
statement and a copy of the orders authorizing the performance of duty 
by the ANG member.
    (2) The State Adjutants General designate an official or office as 
point of contact for Air Force claims personnel and furnish necessary 
personnel to assist the Air Force investigation, subject to the 
availability of funds and personnel.
    (d) Amending a claim. A claimant may amend a claim at any time prior 
to final action. To amend a claim the claimant or his or her authorized 
agent must submit a written, signed demand.

Sec. 842.105   Statute of limitations.

    A claim must be filed in writing within 2 years after it accrues.

accrues when the claimant discovers or reasonably should have discovered 
the existence of the act that resulted in the claimed loss.
    (b) In computing the statutory time period, the day of the incident 
is excluded and the day the claim was filed is included.
    (c) A claim filed after the statute has run is considered if the 
United States is at war or in an armed conflict when the claim accrues; 
or if the United States enters a war or armed conflict after the claim 
accrues, and good cause is shown. No claimant may file a claim

[[Page 112]]

more than 2 years after the good cause ceases to exist or the war or 
armed conflict ends. Congress or the President establishes the beginning 
and end of war or armed conflict.

<R05>
Sec. 842.111  Applicable law.

    (a) Extent of liability. The following rules apply to determine the 
extent of liability of a claim.

[[Page 114]]

    (1) Claims arising in the United States. The law of the place where 
the act or omission occurs governs liability. The local law on dangerous 
instrumentalities, assumption of risk, res ipsa loquitur, last clear 
chance, discovered peril, and comparative and contributory negligence 
are considered. Absolute liability is never imposed.
    (2) Claims arising in foreign countries. The general principles of 
tort law common to the majority of American jurisdictions as evidenced 
by Federal case law and standard legal publications, control liability, 
except that absolute liability is not imposed. However, the law of the 
place where the act or omission occurs governs the effect of the 
claimant's comparative or contributory negligence. Where applicable, 
rules of the road and similar locally prescribed standards of care are 
followed to determine fault.

    Note: ANG personnel ordered to foreign countries proceed under title 
10, U.S.C.; consequently, the National Guard Claims Act would not apply. 
However, there may be cases where ANG personnel are inadvertently in a 
foreign country while on title 32, U.S.C. orders.

    (b) Measure of damages. The following rules apply to the measurement 
of damages.
    (1) Normally, the law of the place where the act or omission occurs 
is applied. In claims arising in foreign countries, the measure of 
damages is determined in accordance with general principles of American 
tort law.
    (2) Damages in suits against private persons are apportioned if 
local law applies comparative negligence.
    (3) Proceeds from private insurance policies are not deducted except 
to the extent the policy was paid by the Government or is allowed by 
local law.
    (4) Compensation and benefits from any U.S. Government associated 
source are deducted. However, sick and annual leave payments are 
deducted only if allowed by local law.
    (5) The following are not payable:
    (i) Punitive damages.
    (ii) Cost of medical or hospital services furnished at U.S. expense.
    (iii) Cost of burial expenses paid by the United States, any 
territory or possession, any state, or the District of Columbia.
    (c) Settlement by insurer or joint tort-feasor. When settlement is 
made by an insurer or joint tort-feasor and an additional award is 
warranted, an award is made if:
    (1) The United States is not protected by the release executed by 
the claimant.
    (2) The total amount received from such source is first deducted.


<R05>
Sec. 842.112  Appeal of final denials.

    This paragraph explains the steps to take when a denial is appealed.
    (a) A claimant may appeal the final denial of the claim. The 
claimant sends the request, in writing, to the initial settlement 
authority within a reasonable time following the final denial. Sixty 
days is considered a reasonable time, but the time limit may be waived 
for good cause.
    (b) The initial settlement authority reviews the appeal.
    (c) Where the settlement authority does not reach a final agreement 
with the claimant on an appealed claim, the entire claim file is sent to 
the next higher settlement authority, who is the appellate authority for 
that claim.
    (d) The decision of the appellate authority is the final 
administrative action on the claim.


<R05>
Sec. 842.113  Government's right of subrogation, indemnity, and contribution.

    The Air Force becomes subrogated to the rights of the claimant upon 
settling a claim. The Air Force has the rights of contribution and 
indemnity permitted by the law of the situs or under contract. 
Contribution or indemnity is not sought from ANG members whose conduct 
gave rise to Government liability.


<R05>
Sec. 842.114  Attorney fees.

    In the settlement of any claim pursuant to 32 U.S.C. 715 and this 
subpart, attorney fees will not exceed 20 percent of any award. For the 
purposes of this paragraph, an award is deemed to be the cost to the 
United States at the time of purchase of a structured settlement, and 
not its future value.

[[Page 115]]


<R04>
        Subpart N--Hospital Recovery Claims (42 U.S.C. 2651-2653)

    This paragraph defines terms which are used within this subpart.
    (a) Base Staff Judge Advocate (SJA). The SJA of the base providing 
legal services to the Air Force medical facility which furnished initial 
medical care to the injured party is responsible for processing the 
hospital recovery claim. If an Air Force facility did not furnish the 
initial medical care, the SJA of the Air Force base within the claims

processing the claim.
    (b) Compromise. A mutually binding agreement where payment is made 
and accepted in an amount less than the full amount of the claim.

or disease as a result of the incident on which the claim is based. The 
injured party may be represented by a guardian, personal representative, 
estate, or survivor.

and medical appliances the US furnished or reimbursed other sources for 
providing.
    (e) Reasonable value of medical care. Either:
    (1) An amount determined by reference to rates set by the Director 
of the Office of Management and Budget for the value of necessary 
medical care in US medical facilities.
    (2) The actual cost of necessary care from other sources which was 
reimbursed by the United States.
    (f) Third party. An individual, partnership, business, corporation 
(including insurance carriers), which is indebted to the United States 
for medical care provided to an injured party. (In some cases, a state 
or foreign government can be the third party.)
    (g) Waiver. The voluntary relinquishment by the United States of the 
right to collect for medical care provided to an injured party.


<R05>
Sec. 842.117   Delegations of authority.

and to accept full payment on any claim.
    (b) Authority to assert a claim. Each settlement authority has 
authority to assert a claim in any amount for the reasonable value of 
medical care.
    (c) Redelegation of authority. A settlement authority may redelegate 
to a subordinate judge advocate or civilian attorney, in writing, his or 
her authority to assert, compromsie, or waive claims.
    (d) Authority to reduce, withdraw, and restore settlement authority. 
Any superior settlement authority may reduce, withdraw, or restore 
delegated authority.
    (e) Settlement negotiations. A settlement authority may settle a 
claim filed for an amount within the delegated settlement authority. 
Claims in excess of the delegated authority must be approved by the next 
higher settlement authority. Unsuccessful negotiations at one level do 
not bind higher authority.

    Note: Telephonic approvals, in the discretion of the higher 
settlement authority, are authorized.


[[Page 116]]


    (f) Special exceptions. Only the Department of Justice (DOJ) may 
approve claims involving:
    (1) Compromise or waiver of a claim for more than $40,000.
    (2) Settlement previously referred to DOJ.
    (3) Settlement where a third party files suit against the US or the

<R05>
Sec. 842.118   Assertable claims.

    A claim should be asserted when the Air Force has furnished or will 
furnish medical care in military health care facilities or when the Air 
Force is responsible for reimbursement to a private care provider and 
either of the following conditions are met:
    (a) Third party liability in tort exists for causing an injury or 
disease.
    (b) Local or foreign law permits the United States to recover or the 
United States is a third party beneficiary under uninsured motorist 
coverage, medical pay insurance coverage, worker's compensation, no-
fault statutes, or other statutes.
    A claim should only be asserted if the base SJA determines it merits 
assertion. Claims for $150 or less need not be asserted; they should be 
asserted only if the base SJA or designee determines the collection will 
not exceed the cost to collect, the third party offers payment and 
demands a release from the United States before paying damages to the 
injured party, or the United States asserts a property damage claim 
under subpart L arising out of the same incident.


<R05>
Sec. 842.119   Nonassertable claims.

    (a) The following are considered nonassertable claims and should not 
be asserted:
    (1) Claims against any department, agency, or instrumentality of the 
United States. ``Agency or instrumentality'' includes any self-insured 
nonappropriated fund activity whether revenue producing, welfare, or 
sundry. The term does not include private associations.
    (2) Claims for care furnished a veteran by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs (VA) for service connected disability. However, claims 
may be asserted for the reasonable value of medical care an Air Force 
member receives prior to his or her discharge and transfer to the VA 
facility.
    (3) Claims for care furnished a merchant seaman under 42 U.S.C. 249. 
A claim against the seaman's employer should not be filed.
    (b) Claims should not be asserted without HQ USAF/JACC's approval 
against:
    (1) Government contractors. In claims in which the United States 
must reimburse the contractor for a claim according to the terms of the 
contract, an investigation into the claim is sent to HQ USAF/JACC by the 
base SJA. The file should contain recommendations regarding assertion 
and include citations to the specific contract clauses involved.
    (2) Foreign governments. An investigation is made regarding any 
claim against foreign governments, their political subdivisions, armed 
forces members, or civilian employees. The claims files containing the 
investigation are sent to HQ USAF/JACC along with the base SJA's 
recommendations regarding assertion.
    (3) US personnel. Claims are not asserted against members of the 
uniformed services; employees of the US, its agencies or 
instrumentalities; or an individual who is a dependent of a service 
member or employee at the time of assertion unless liability insurance 
will pay the claim.
    (4) Manufacturers of products in products liability cases.


<R05>
Sec. 842.120  Asserting the claim.

    When asserting the claim, the base SJA will:
    (a) Assert it against the third parties whose liability is based in 
tort using an SF 96, Notice of Claim. Mail the original and one copy to 
each of the third parties and a copy to the third parties' insurers, if 
known.
    (b) Assert it against third parties or insurers whose liability is 
not based in tort using a formal letter written on Air Force stationery. 
The letter will include the facts and legal basis for liability. Bases 
for liability could include local foreign law, US status as a third 
party beneficiary under uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage, 
workers' compensation laws, and

[[Page 117]]

no fault statutes. The specific provision of the injured party's 
insurance contract should be cited where appropriate.
    (c) Mail all copies of the SF 96, or claim notice on Air Force 
letterhead:
    (1) By certified mail with return receipt requested in all claims in 
which the amount claimed is $5,000.00 or more or in which there is a 
substantial likelihood that the final amount claimed will be $5,000.00 
or more.
    (2) By regular or certified mail with return receipt requested at 
the SJA's discretion in cases in which the final amount claimed is less 
than $5,000.00, unless there is no response to the initial notice of 
claim within a reasonable period of time and a second notice of claim is 
required to be mailed. All second notices of claim and copies will be 
mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested.
    (d) Notify the injured parties promptly in writing that the United 
States will attempt to recover from the third parties the reasonable 
value of medical care furnished or to be furnished and that they:
    (1) Should seek advice from a legal assistance officer or civilian 
counsel and furnish the civilian counsel's name to the claims officer.

<R05>
Sec. 842.121  Referring a claim to the US Attorney.

    Only HQ USAF/JACC authorizes referral of a claim to the US Attorney. 
The base SJA ensures review of all claims not later than 2 years after 
the date of the incident. These unsettled claims are forwarded, with the 
base SJA's disposition recommendation, to HQ USAF/JACC.

    Note: On a case-by-case basis, HQ USAF/JACC will authorize referral 
of a case to the US Attorney by telephone.


<R05>
Sec. 842.122  Statute of limitations.

    The United States or the injured party on behalf of the United 
States must file suit within 3 years after an action accrues. This is 
usually 3 years after the initial treatment is provided in a federal 
medical facility or after the initial payment is made by CHAMPUS, 
whichever is first.


<R05>
Sec. 842.123  Recovery rates in government facilities.

    The Federal Register contains the rates set by the Office of 
Management and Budget, of which judges take judicial notice. HQ USAF/
JACC can provide certified copies of the Federal Register upon request. 
Apply the rates in effect at the time of care to claims.


<R05>
Sec. 842.124  Waiver and compromise of United States interest.

    Waivers and compromises of government claims can be made. This

the tort-feasor:
    (1) Cannot be located.
    (2) Is judgment proof.
    (3) Has refused to pay and the case is too weak for litigation.
    (b) Waiver can be made when collection causes undue hardhsip to the 
injured party. Ordinarily, factors such as the following should be 
considered:
    (1) Permanent disability or disfigurement.
    (2) Decreased earning power.
    (3) Out of pocket losses.
    (4) Financial status of injured party.
    (5) Pension rights.
    (6) Other government benefits to the injured party.
    (7) An offer of settlement from a third party which includes 
virtually all the thirty party's assets, although the amount is 
considerably less than the calculation of the injured party's damages.
    (c) A compromise can be made upon written request from the injured 
party

[[Page 118]]

or the injured party's legal representative when liability is 
questionable, the injured party received excessive treatment, or the 
litigation risks dictate, and either of the following occurs:
    (1) The injured party accepts less than the jury verdict expectancy. 
When this occurs, the Air Force should consider settling its claim in a 
ratio similar to that which the total sttlement bears to the jury 
verdict expectancy.
    (2) The government's claim is almost as large as, or is larger than, 
the assets available for settlement.


<R05>
Sec. 842.125  Reconsideration of a waiver for undue hardship.

    A settlement authority may reconsider its disapproval of a waiver or 
compromise, when either:
    (a) The injured party submits new evidence.
    (b) Errors exist in claim submission or settlement.


<R04>
                 Subpart O--Nonappropriated Fund Claims


<R05>
Sec. 842.126  Scope of this subpart.

    This subpart describes how to settle claims for and against the 
United States for property damage, personal injury, or death arising out 
of the operation of Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFIs).


<R05>
Sec. 842.127  Definitions.

    (a) Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES). The Army and Air 
Force Exchange Service is a joint command of the Army and Air Force, 
under the jurisdiction of the Chiefs of Staff of the Army and Air Force, 
which provides exchange and motion picture services to authorized 
patrons.
    (b) Morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR) activities. Air Force MWR 
activities are activities operated directly or by contract which provide 
programs to promote morale and well-being of the Air Force's military 
and civilian personnel and their dependents. They may be funded wholly 
with appropriated funds, primarily with nonappropriated funds (NAF), or 
with a combination of appropriated funds and NAFs.
    (c) Nonappropriated funds. Nonappropriated funds are funds generated 
by Department of Defense military and civilian personnel and their 
dependents and used to augment funds appropriated by the Congress to 
provide a comprehensive morale-building, welfare, religious, 
educational, and recreational program, designed to improve the well-
being of military and civilian personnel and their dependents.
    (d) Nonappropriated funds instrumentality. A nonappropriated fund 
instrumentality is a Federal government instrumentality established to 
generate and administer nonappropriated funds for programs and services 
contributing to the mental and physical well-being of personnel.


<R05>
Sec. 842.128  Delegations of authority.

    (a) Settlement authority: (1) Each individual has the same delegated 
authority to settle a claim for which NAFs may be liable as that 
specified for a similar type claim in each subpart of this part. The 
decision of the settlement authority is binding upon the NAFI.
    (2) The Judge Advocate General, in addition, has delegated authority 
to settle subparts F, G, and J type claims in any amount without 
referral to the Secretary of the Air Force or the General Accounting 
Office.
    (3) The Chief, Deputy Chief, and Branch Chiefs, Claims and Tort 
Litigation Staff, in addition, have delegated authority to settle 
subparts F, G, and J type claims for $100,000 or less without referral 
to the Secretary of the Air Force or the General Accounting Office.
    (b) Redelegation of authority. A settlement authority may redelegate 
settlement authority to a subordinate judge advocate or civilian 
attorney, in writing.
    (c) Appellate authority. Upon appeal, a settlement authority has the 
same authority specified in Sec. 842.128(a). The Judge Advocate General 
is the final appellate authority on subpart F type claims without right 
of further appeal to the Secretary of the Air Force. However, no 
appellate authority below The Judge Advocate General may deny an appeal 
of a claim it had previously denied.

[[Page 119]]

    (d) Authority to reduce, withdraw, and restore settlement authority. 
Any superior settlement authority may reduce, withdraw, or restore 
delegated authority.
    (e) Settlement negotiations. A settlement authority may settle a 
claim filed in any amount for a sum within its delegated authority. Send 
unsettled claims in excess of the delegated authority to the level with 
settlement authority. Unsuccessful negotiations at one level do not bind 
higher authority.


<R05>
Sec. 842.129  Settlement of claims against NAFIs.

    (a) This subpart does not establish legal theories for adjudication 
of claims. Refer to the appropriate subpart to decide whether a claim is 
payable (e.g., subpart D for personnel claims; subpart K for tort 
claims), then use the rules in this subpart to decide the appropriate 
funds for payment of any approved claim.
    (b) Claims arising from property damage to or loss from vehicles or 
loss of personal items stored in base MWR facilities will be evaluated 
under the normal rules applied by the appropriate subpart of this part, 
and paid using the rules in those subparts. Examples include 
recreational vehicles stored in authorized lots and used cars parked in 
onbase sales lots. One exception to this rule is the exclusion of 
personal items stolen from onbase gym lockers (discussed below).
    (1) If a NAF fee has been charged in connection with the use of the 
storage location, a determination must be made on the nature of the fee 
charged. If the fee does no more than reimburse NAF costs in 
administering or maintaining the storage location, subpart O of this 
part applies in addition to other appropriate subparts. If the fee is 
set to generate a profit for the NAFI involved or if it is collected in 
accordance with the terms of an agreement, express or implied, under 
which the NAFI represents that it will provide some degree of security 
or safeguarding of the property, the claim will be paid with NAF funds.
    (2) Normally, theft of items from gym lockers will be paid out of 
appropriated funds providing there is affirmative evidence of theft. 
Mysterious loss of property will not be paid and, in no case, will a 
claim be paid in excess of $250.


<R05>
Sec. 842.130  Payment of claims against NAFIs.

    Substantiated claims against NAFIs must not be paid solely from 
appropriated funds. Claims are sent for payment as set out in this 
subpart. Do not delay paying a claimant because doubt exists whether to 
use appropriated funds or NAFs. Pay the claim initially from 
appropriated funds and decide the correct funding source later.


<R05>
Sec. 842.131  Tort and tort type claims.

    (a) Claims within the scope of this subpart. Claims which are within 
the scope of this subpart are those arising out of the operation of an 
MWR activity and are caused by:
    (1) Civilian employees paid by a NAFI acting in the scope of their 
employment.
    (2) Military personnel or appropriated fund civilian employees 
performing part-time duties for a NAFI for which a NAFI is paying.
    (3) Negligent operation or condition of premises for which a NAFI is 
responsible.
    (4) Members or authorized users of NAFI property. Such claims are 
subject to this subpart if the individual is a member of an MWR 
membership association or an authorized user of NAFI property and the 
use is in accord with applicable rules.
    (b) Claims not within the scope of this subpart. Claims are not 
payable within the scope of this subpart if they arise out of the 
operation of an MWR activity supported by a NAFI and are caused by:
    (1) Military personnel or appropriated fund civilian employees 
performing assigned Air Force duties, even though they benefit a NAFI.
    (2) Negligent operation or condition of premises for which a NAFI is 
not responsible.


<R05>
Sec. 842.132  Claims by NAFI employees.

    Claims made by NAFI employees should be settled within the 
guidelines of this paragraph.

[[Page 120]]

    (a) Personal injury in performance of duty and workers' compensation 
claims. Claims for injuries arising out of performance of duty and 
workers' compensation claims are not within the scope of this subpart 
because the exclusive remedy is one of the following.
    (1) Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act. This Act applies 
to NAFI civilian employees in the United States, its territories and 
possessions, and US citizen and resident NAFI civilian employees abroad.
    (2) Local benefits for foreign national employees abroad.
    (3) Military benefits because the injury is incident to service for 
offduty military personnel.
    (b) Property loss or damage incident to NAFI employment. Claims for 
loss or damage to property incident to NAFI employment are settled under 
subpart D. Where appropriate, liability is computed, and initial demand 
is made upon the carrier, warehouse, or insurer, directing them to send 
further correspondence to the NAFI paying the claim.


<R05>
Sec. 842.133  Claims by customers, members, participants, or authorized users.

    (a) Customer complaints. Do not automatically adjudicate customer 
complaint claims until a determination is made that a valid claim 
exists. Complaints and personal property losses suffered by customers of 
MWR sales or service operations are normally not within the scope of 
this subpart. Customer complaints may not be claims at all. They may be 
no more than expressions of customer dissatisfactions. The activity 
manager is responsible for adjudicating and satisfying or otherwise 
disposing of a customer's complaint according to applicable NAFI 
regulations. Where possible, the activity manager resolves them by 
reimbursement, repair, or replacement in kind. However, if a complaint 
involving a claim cannot be satisfactorily settled under those 
procedures or includes a demand for consequential damage (such as for 
personal injury or property damage to other than the article purchased 
or serviced), process it as a tort claim.
    (b) Claims generated by concessionaires. Most concessionaires must 
have commercial insurance. Any unresolved claims or complaints against 
concessionaires or their insurers are sent to the appropriate 
contracting officers.


<R05>
Sec. 842.134  Claims in favor of NAFIs.

    (a) Tort claims. Use the procedures set forth in subpart J or L, as 
appropriate.
    (b) Contract claims. See AFR 176-9 or AFR 147-14, as appropriate.
    (c) Claims involving dishonored checks and debts to NAFIs. See AFR 
176-2 and 176-10 or AFR 147-14, as appropriate.
    (d) Third Party Workers' Compensation Claims. NAF employees are 
provided workers' compensation benefits under the Longshore and Harbor 
Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) (33 U.S.C. 901, et seq.) as extended 
by the Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities Act (5 U.S.C. 8171-8173). 
For injuries suffered by NAFI employees in the course and scope of their 
employment where third parties are responsible for the injuries, the 
employing NAFIs are entitled to recover from the responsible third 
parties for the compensation and medical benefits paid to the injured 
employees (33 U.S.C. 933). Third party claims are pursued on behalf of 
employing NAFIs by the servicing staff judge advocate. A NAFI also has 
the right of offset against an employee's pay amounts recovered directly 
by the employee from third parties as provided in the LHWCA.


<R05>
Sec. 842.135  Advance payments.

    The procedures set out in subpart Q should be used for advance 
payments. Do not delay paying a claimant because doubt exists whether to 
use appropriated funds or NAFIs. Pay the claim initially from 
appropriated claim funds and decide the correct funding source later.


<R05>
Sec. 842.136  Claim payments and deposits.

    Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, claims for payment (in 
two copies), collected funds for deposit, and international agreement 
bills for reimbursement should be sent as follows:

[[Page 121]]

    (a) AAFES: (1) Claims payable for more than $2500: HQ AAFES, 
Comptroller, Insurance Branch, P.O. Box 660202, Dallas, TX 75266-0202.
    (2) Claims payable for $2500 or less: AAFES Operations Center (OSC-
AC), 2727 LBJ Highway, Dallas TX 75266-0320.
    (b) Civilian base restaurants and civilian welfare NAFIs: (1) For 
more than $100: Army and Air Force Civilian Welfare Fund, Washington, DC 
20310.
    (2) For $100 or less: The local NAFI giving rise to the claim.
    (c) All other NAFIs: (1) For more than $50: HQ AFMPC/DPMSCI, 
Randolph AFB TX 78150-6001.
    (2) For $50 or less: The local NAFI giving rise to the claim.
    (d) International agreement claims, all NAFIs. When a receiving 
state pays a claim under an international agreement, the NAFI involved, 
upon receipt of an extract copy of the itemized bill, will forward 
payment of its pro rata share to the sending State office.

   Subpart P--Civil Air Patrol Claims (5 U.S.C. 8101(1)(B), 8102(a), 
         8116(c), 8141; 10 U.S.C. 9441, 9442; 36 U.S.C. 201-208)


<R05>
Sec. 842.137  Scope of this subpart.

    This subpart explains how to process certain administrative claims:
    (a) Against the United States for property damage, personal injury, 
or death, arising out of Air Force noncombat missions performed by the 
Civil Air Patrol (CAP), as well as certain other Air Force authorized 
missions performed by the CAP in support of the Federal government.
    (b) In favor of the United States for damage to US Government 
property caused by CAP members or third parties.


<R05>
Sec. 842.138  Definitions.

    (a) Civil Air Patrol (CAP). A federally chartered, non-profit 
corporation which was designated by Congress in 1948 as a volunteer 
civilian auxiliary of the Air Force.
    (b) Air Force noncombat mission. Although not defined in any 
statute, an Air Force noncombat mission is any mission for which the Air 
Force is tasked, by statute, regulation, or higher authority, which does 
not involve actual combat, combat operations or combat training. The Air 
Force, in lieu of using Air Force resources, can use the services of the 
Civil Air Patrol to fulfill these type missions. When performing an Air 
Force noncombat mission, the Civil Air Patrol is deemed to be an 
instrumentality of the United States. In order for a mission to be a 
noncombat mission of the Air Force under this part, it must either:
    (1) Have a special Air Force mission order assigned, and, the Air 
Force must exercise operational control over the mission.
    (2) Involve a peacetime mission the Air Force is tasked to perform 
by higher authority which requires the expenditure of Air Force 
resources to accomplish, and the Air Force specifically approves the 
mission as a noncombat mission, and assigns the mission to the Civil Air 
Patrol to perform.
    (c) CAP members. CAP members are private citizens who volunteer 
their time, services, and resources to accomplish CAP objectives and 
purposes. The two primary categories of members are:
    (1) Cadets. Youths, 13 years (or having satisfactorily completed the 
sixth grade) through 17 years of age, who meet such prerequisites as the 
CAP corporation may establish from time to time. Cadet status may be 
retained until age 21.
    (2) Seniors. Adults, 18 years of age or older (there is no maximum 
age), who meet such prerequisites as the CAP corporation may establish 
from time to time, and who have not retained cadet status.
    (d) Liaison officers. Active duty Air Force officers assigned to 
liaison duty at the national, regional, and wing (state) levels of CAP.


<R05>
Sec. 842.139  Delegations of authority.

    The appropriate subpart of this part under which the claim is being 
considered prescribes the authority to settle it.

[[Page 122]]


<R05>
Sec. 842.140  Proper claimants.

    (a) Anyone suffering property damage, personal injury, or death 
arising from an Air Force noncombat mission or other specified Air Force 
authorized mission performed by CAP, who is also a proper claimant under 
the appropriate subpart of this part.
    (b) The United States, for claims arising out of activities of CAP 
caused by negligent acts or omissions of CAP members or third parties.


<R05>
Sec. 842.141  Improper claimants.

    CAP members, 18 years of age or older, whose personal injury or 
death claim is subject to the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, are 
improper claimants. FECA is their exclusive remedy.


<R05>
Sec. 842.142   Claims payable.

    A claim is payable if all of the following are present:
    (a) It is for property damage, personal injury, or death.
    (b) It is proximately caused by a CAP member.
    (c) It arises from an Air Force noncombat mission performed by the 
CAP, or arises from an authorized mission performed by the CAP for which 
specific coverage under this subpart is granted by HQ USAF/JACC.
    (d) It is otherwise payable because it meets the provisions of an 
appropriate subpart of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 842.143  Claims not payable.

    A claim is not payable if it:
    (a) Is for use or depreciation of privately owned property, operated 
by CAP or its members on an Air Force noncombat mission, or other 
specified Air Force authorized mission.
    (b) Is for personal services or expenses incurred by CAP or its 
members while engaged in an Air Force noncombat mission, or other 
specified Air Force authorized mission.
    (c) Arises out of a CAP incident based solely on government 
ownership of property on loan to CAP.
    (d) Arises from a CAP activity not performed as a noncombat mission 
of the Air Force or as a specified Air Force authorized mission. These 
claims are sent to HQ CAP-USAF/JA for referral to CAP's private insurer, 
with a copy of the transmittal letter to HQ USAF/JACC.

    It tells how to make an advance payment before a claim is filed or 
finalized under the Military Claims, Foreign Claims and National Guard 
Claims Acts.


<R05>
Sec. 842.145  Delegation of authority.

    (a) The Secretary of the Air Force has authority to make an advance

Litigation Staff.
    (4) SJA of 9AF for CENTCOM, and the SJAs of PACAF and USAFE.
    (d) This authority may be redelegated either orally or in writing. 
Oral redelegations should be confirmed in writing as soon as practical.


<R05>
Sec. 842.146  Who may request.

    A proper claimant or authorized agent may request an advance 
payment.


<R05>
Sec. 842.147  When authorized.

    Make advance payments only where all of the following exist:
    (a) The potential claimant could file a valid claim for property 
damage or personal injury under the Military Claims, Foreign Claims, or 
National Guard Claims Acts.
    (b) The potential claimant has an immediate need amounting to a 
hardship for food, shelter, medical or burial expenses, or other 
necessities. In the case of a commercial enterprise, severe financial 
loss or backruptcy will result if the Air Force does not make an advance 
payment.
    (c) Other resources for such needs are not reasonably available.

[[Page 123]]

    (d) The potential claim equals or exceeds the amount of the advance 
payment.
    (e) The recipient signs as advance payment agreement.


<R05>

    Do not make an advance payment if the claim is payable under the:
    (a) Federal Tort Claims Act.
    (b) International Agreement Claims Act.
    (c) Military Personnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act. (Separate 
regulations issued under the Act provide for partial payments.)


<R05>
Sec. 842.149  Separate advance payment claims.

    Every person suffering injury or property loss may submit a separate 
request for an advance payment. For example, where the Air Force 
destroys a house containing a family of four, each family member may 
submit a separate request for and receive an advance payment of $100,000 
or less.


<R05>
Sec. 842.150  Liability for repayment.

    The claimant is liable for repayment. Deduct the advance payment 
from any award or judgment given to a claimant. Reimbursement from the 
claimant will be sought if the claimant does not file a claim or 
lawsuit.

    Source: 44 FR 75633, Dec. 21, 1979, unless otherwise noted.

    Note: This part is derived from chapter 2 of Air Force Regulation 
110-12, December 1, 1978.
    Part 806 of this chapter states the basic policies and instructions 
governing the disclosure of records and tells members of the public what 
they must do to inspect or obtain copies of the material referenced 
herein.


<R05>
Sec. 845.1  Purpose.

    This part establishes criteria and assigns responsibility for the 
provision of counsel, for the provision of bail, and for the payment of 
court costs and other necessary and reasonable expenses incident to 
representation in civil and criminal proceedings, including appellate 
proceedings, before foreign courts and foreign administrative agencies, 
which involve members of the Armed Forces, civilian personnel and 
dependents. Payment of fines is not authorized hereunder.


<R05>
Sec. 845.2  Statutory authority.

    10 U.S.C. 1037 provides authority for employment of counsel, and 
payment of counsel fees, court costs, bail, and other expenses incident 
to representation of persons subject to the Uniform Code of Military 
Justice before foreign tribunals. For personnel not subject to the 
Uniform Code of Military Justice, funds for similar expenses may be made 
available in cases of exceptional interest to the service concerned, 
upon prior application through the Judge Advocate General of the service 
concerned, to the appropriate service secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 845.3  Responsibility.

    (a) Requests for provision of counsel, provision of bail, or payment 
of expenses will ordinarily be made by the defendant or accused through 
appropriate channels to the officer exercising general court-martial 
jurisdiction over him. This officer shall determine whether the request 
meets the criteria prescribed herein and, based upon such determination, 
shall take final action approving or disapproving the request. Within 
their geographical areas of responsibility, major commands in the 
interest of obtaining prompt and effective legal service may appoint as 
approval authority, instead of the officer

[[Page 124]]

exercising general court-martial jurisdiction, any subordinate officer 
having responsibility in a particular country for personnel subject to 
foreign criminal jurisdiction.
    (b) Notwithstanding the criteria prescribed below, an officer 
exercising approved authority may, in his discretion, deny a request for 
the provision of counsel, provision of bail or payment of expenses, 
where the otherwise eligible requestor is in an absent without leave or 
deserter status at the time of the request, or otherwise is not then 
subject to United States military control, and there is no reasonable 
basis for the belief that the requestor will return to United States 
military control at the conclusion of the proceedings of service of an 
adjudged sentence, if any.


<R05>
Sec. 845.4  Criteria for the provision of counsel and payment of expenses in criminal cases.

    Requests for the provision of counsel and payment of expenses in 
criminal cases may be approved in pretrial, trial, appellate and 
posttrial proceedings in any one of the following criminal cases:
    (a) Where the act complained of occurred in the performance of 
official duty; or
    (b) Where the sentence which is normally imposed includes 
confinement, whether or not such sentence is suspended; or
    (c) Where capital punishment might be imposed; or
    (d) Where an appeal is made from any proceeding in which there 
appears to have been a denial of the substantial rights of the accused; 
or
    (e) Where conviction of the offense alleged could later form the 
basis for administrative discharge proceedings for misconduct as a 
result of civil court disposition; or
    (f) Where the case, although not within the criteria established in 
paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section, is considered to 
have significant impact upon the relations of US forces with the host 
country or is considered to involve any other particular US interest.


<R05>
Sec. 845.5  Provision of bail in criminal cases.

    Funds for the posting of bail or bond to secure the release of 
personnel from confinement by foreign authorities before, during, or 
after trial may be furnished in all criminal cases. Safeguards should be 
imposed to assure that at the conclusion of the proceedings or on the 
appearance of the defendant in court, the bail or bond will be refunded 
to the military authorities. Bail will be provided only to guarantee the 
presence of the defendant and will not be provided to guarantee the 
payment of fines or civil damages. Local US military authorities are 
expected to provide bail, in any case, only after other reasonable 
efforts have been made to secure release of pretrial custody to the US.


<R05>
Sec. 845.6  Criteria for the provision of counsel and payment of expenses in civil cases.

    Requests for provision of counsel and payment of expenses in civil 
cases may be granted in trial and appellate proceedings in either of the 
following civil cases:
    (a) Where the act complained of occurred in the performance of 
official duty; or
    (b) Where the case is considered to have a significant impact upon 
the relations of US forces with the host country or is considered to 
involve any other particular US interest. No funds shall be provided 
under this part in cases where the United States of America is in legal 
effect the defendant, without prior authorization of the Judge Advocate 
General.


<R05>
Sec. 845.7  Procedures for hiring counsel and obligating funds.

    (a) The selection of individual trial or appellate counsel will be 
made by the defendant. Such counsel shall represent the individual 
defendant and not the US Government. Selection shall be made from 
approved lists of attorneys who are qualified, competent and experienced 
in trial practice, and admitted for full practice, on their own account, 
before the courts of the foreign country involved. Normally, these lists 
will be coordinated with the local court or bar association, if any, and 
the appropriate US Diplomatic or Consular Mission and

[[Page 125]]

should include only those attorneys who are known or reputed, to comply 
with local attorney fee schedules or guides approved or suggested by 
local bar associations and should not exceed amounts paid under similar 
circumstances by nationals of the country where the trial is held. No 
fee may include any amount in payment for services other than those 
incident to representation before judicial and administrative agencies 
of the foreign country in the particular case for which the contract is 
made, and in no event may any contract include fees for representation 
in habeas corpus or related proceedings before tribunals of the United 
States. When appropriate and reasonable in the case, the payment of 
expenses, in addition to counsel fees, may include court costs, bail 
costs, charges for obtaining copies of records, printing and filing 
fees, interpreter fees, witness fees, and other necessary and reasonable 
expenses. Expenses will not include the payment of fines or civil 
damages, directly or indirectly.
    (b) Whenever possible, the officer responsible under Sec. 845.3 (or 
his designee), acting on behalf of the United States of America, shall 
enter into a written contract with the selected counsel. The contract 
will cover counsel fees, and, when appropriate, may cover other costs 
arising in defense of the case only in the court of first instance and 
will not include fees for representation on appeal. If the case is 
appealed to higher tribunals, supplemental agreements shall be executed 
for each appeal. A copy of the contractual agreement shall serve as the 
obligating document.
    (c) If, for example, because of unusual circumstances or local 
customs, it is not practicable to enter into a written contract as in 
paragraph (b) of this section, action will be taken to record the 
agreement reached between the officer responsible under Sec. 845.3 (or 
his designee) and the selected counsel. This requirement may be met by a 
letter of commission or letter of understanding, executed between the 
officer responsible under Sec. 845.3 (or his designee) and the selected 
counsel, or by a written request for legal services expressly or 
impliedly accepted by the selected counsel. Any such document shall 
contain, if possible, an agreed estimate of counsel fees and reasonable 
expenses and a statement that both fees and expenses will conform to 
those paid by local nationals under similar circumstances and will not 
exceed local fee schedules, if any. If this document does not include an 
agreed estimate of counsel fees and other reasonable expenses, an 
estimate will be provided by the contracting officer. A copy of the 
document, together with the estimate, will be furnished the accounting 
component and will serve as the commitment document for the reservation 
of funds.
    (d) The provision of counsel and payment of expenses under this part 
is not subject to the provisions of the Defense Acquisition Regulation 
(subchapter A, chapter I of this title). However, the contract clauses 
set forth in part 5, section VII, Defense Acquisition Regulation, may be 
used as a guide in contracting.
    (e) Because of the desirability of timely procedural action, it is 
suggested that there be designated, from among the judge advocates on 
the staffs of officers responsible under Sec. 845.3, contracting 
officers with contracting authority limited to agreements described in 
this section. The effect of this designation would be to combine within 
one office the duties of contracting officer and judge advocate.
    (f) Nothing in this part shall be construed as prohibiting the 
selection of qualified local counsel employed by the United States 
Government, if the serviceman freely selects such counsel.


<R05>
Sec. 845.8  Payment of counsel fees and other expenses.

    Payment of bills submitted by the selected counsel and other costs 
shall be made in accordance with the general provision of AFM 177-102 
(Commercial Transactions at Base Level), relating to payment of 
contractual obligations and pertinent disbursing regulations. All 
payments under these procedures will be in local currency. Acceptance of 
services procured under these procedures shall be certified to by the 
officer responsible under Sec. 845.3 (or his designee). Payments of bail 
may be made when authorized by such officers. Such authorization shall 
be in the form of a

[[Page 126]]

directing letter or message citing 10 U.S.C. 1037.


<R05>
Sec. 845.9  Appropriated funds chargeable.

    Authorized expenses incurred incident to implementation of the 
policies set forth in this part, including transportation and per diem 
expenses of trial observers, interpreters, and local counsel employees, 
shall be paid from appropriated funds of the service to which the 
defendant belongs. Payments shall be made from the appropriation current 
at time of payment, unless obligations for authorized costs have 
previously been established. Refunds shall be processed as appropriation 
refund. Such funds are chargeable to the base for operation and 
maintenance purposes (O&M or R&D, as applicable).


<R05>
Sec. 845.10  Reimbursement.

    No reimbursement will ordinarily be required from individuals with 
respect to payments made in their behalf under this part. However, prior 
to the posting of bail on behalf of a defendant, a signed agreement 
shall be secured from him wherein he agrees to remit the amount of such 
bail or permit the application of so much of his pay as may be necessary 
to reimburse the Government in the event that he willfully causes 
forfeiture of bail. In the event of such forfeiture, bail provided under 
this part shall be recovered from the defendant in accordance with that 
agreement. The agreement should include a statement that it does not 
prejudice the defendant's right to appeal to the Comptroller General of 
the United States and the courts after such payment or deduction has 
been made, if he considers the amount erroneous.


<R05>
Sec. 845.11  Correspondence.

    Judge advocates who advise officers responsible under Sec. 845.3 are 
authorized to correspond directly with each other and with the Judge 
Advocate General of the service concerned for advice with regard to 
payment of counsel fees and other expenses.

<R04>
                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 855.1  Policy.

    The Air Force establishes and uses its airfields to support the 
scope and level of operations necessary to carry out missions worldwide. 
The Congress funds airfields in response to Air Force requirements, but 
also specifies that civil aviation access is a national priority to be 
accommodated when it does not jeopardize an installation's military 
utility. The Air Force engages in dialogue with the civil aviation 
community and the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure mutual 
understanding of long-term needs for the national air transportation 
system and programmed military force structure requirements. To 
implement the national policy and to respond to requests for access, the 
Air Force must have policies that balance such requests with military 
needs. Civil aircraft access to Air Force airfields on foreign territory 
requires host nation approval.
    (a) The Air Force will manage two programs that are generally used 
to grant civil aircraft access to its airfields: civil aircraft landing 
permits and joint-use agreements. Other arrangements for access will be 
negotiated as required for specific purposes.
    (1) Normally, landing permits will be issued only for civil aircraft 
operating in support of official Government business. Other types of use 
may be authorized if justified by exceptional circumstances. Access will 
be granted on an equitable basis.
    (2) The Air Force will consider only proposals for joint use that do 
not compromise operations, security, readiness, safety, environment, and 
quality of life. Further, only proposals submitted by authorized local 
Government representatives eligible to sponsor a public airport will be 
given the comprehensive evaluation required to conclude a joint-use 
agreement.
    (3) Any aircraft operator with an inflight emergency may land at any

[[Page 128]]

Air Force airfield without prior authorization. An inflight emergency is 
defined as a situation that makes continued flight hazardous.
    (b) Air Force requirements will take precedence on Air Force 
airfields over all civil aircraft operations, whether they were 
previously authorized or not.
    (c) Civil aircraft use of Air Force airfields in the United States 
will be subject to Federal laws and regulations. Civil aircraft use of 
Air Force airfields in foreign countries will be subject to US Federal 
laws and regulations that have extraterritorial effect and to applicable 
international agreements with the country in which the Air Force 
installation is located.


<R05>
Sec. 855.2  Responsibilities.

    (a) As the program manager for joint use, the Civil Aviation Branch, 
Bases and Units Division, Directorate of Operations (HQ USAF/XOOBC), 
ensures that all impacts have been considered and addressed before 
forwarding a joint-use proposal or agreement to the Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for Installations (SAF/MII), who holds decision authority. All 
decisions are subject to the environmental impact analysis process as 
directed by the Environmental Planning Division, Directorate of 
Environment (HQ USAF/CEVP), and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for 
Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health (SAF/MIQ). The Air Force 
Real Estate Agency (AFREA/MI) handles the leases for Air Force-owned 
land or facilities that may be included in an agreement for joint use.
    (b) HQ USAF/XOOBC determines the level of decision authority for 
landing permits. It delegates decision authority for certain types of 
use to major commands and installation commanders.
    (c) HQ USAF/XOOBC makes the decisions on all requests for exceptions 
or waivers to this part and related Air Force instructions. The decision 
process includes consultation with other affected functional area 
managers when required. Potential impacts on current and future Air 
Force policies and operations strongly influence such decisions.
    (d) Major commands, direct reporting units, and field operating 
agencies may issue supplements to establish command-unique procedures 
permitted by and consistent with this part.


<R05>
Sec. 855.3  Applicability.

    This part applies to all regular United States Air Force (USAF), Air 
National Guard (ANG), and United States Air Force Reserve (USAFR) 
installations with airfields. This part also applies to civil aircraft 
use of Air Force ramps at civil airports hosting USAF, ANG, and USAFR 
units.


<R04>
                Subpart B--Civil Aircraft Landing Permits


<R05>
Sec. 855.4  Scope.

    Air Force airfields are available for use by civil aircraft so far 
as such use does not interfere with military operations or jeopardize 
the military utility of the installation. Access will be granted on an 
equitable basis. Air Force requirements take precedence over authorized 
civil aircraft use. This part carries the force of US law, and 
exceptions are not authorized without prior approval from the Civil 
Aviation Branch, Bases and Units Division, Directorate of Operations, 
(HQ USAF/XOOBC), 1480 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1480. 
Proposed exceptions or waivers are evaluated as to current and future 
impact on Air Force policy and operations.


<R05>
Sec. 855.5  Responsibilities and authorities.

    (a) The Air Force:
    (1) Determines whether civil aircraft use of Air Force airfields is 
compatible with current and planned military activities.
    (2) Normally authorizes civil aircraft use of Air Force airfields 
only in support of official Government business. If exceptional 
circumstances warrant, use for other purposes may be authorized.
    (3) Acts as clearing authority for civil aircraft use of Air Force 
airfields, subject to the laws and regulations of the US, or to 
applicable international agreements (e.g., status of forces agreements) 
with the country in which the Air Force installation is located.

[[Page 129]]

    (4) Reserves the right to suspend any operation that is inconsistent 
with national defense interests or deemed not in the best interests of 
the Air Force.
    (5) Will terminate authority to use an Air Force airfield if the:
    (i) User's liability insurance is canceled.
    (ii) User lands for other than the approved purpose of use or is 
otherwise in violation of this part or clearances and directives 
hereunder.
    (6) Will not authorize use of Air Force airfields:
    (i) In competition with civil airports by providing services or 
facilities that are already available in the private sector.

    Note: Use to conduct business with or for the US Government is not 
considered as competition with civil airports.

    (ii) Solely for the convenience of passengers or aircraft operator.
    (iii) Solely for transient aircraft servicing.
    (iv) By civil aircraft that do not meet US Department of 
Transportation operating and airworthiness standards.
    (v) That selectively promotes, benefits, or favors a specific 
commercial venture unless equitable consideration is available to all 
potential users in like circumstances.
    (vi) For unsolicited proposals in procuring Government business or 
contracts.
    (vii) Solely for customs-handling purposes.
    (viii) When the air traffic control tower and base operations are 
closed or when a runway is restricted from use by all aircraft.

    Note: Requests for waiver of this provision must address liability 
responsibility, emergency response, and security.

    (7) Will not authorize civil aircraft use of Air Force ramps located 
on civil airfields.

    Note: This section does not apply to use of aero club facilities 
located on Air Force land at civil airports, or civil aircraft chartered 
by US military departments and authorized use of terminal facilities and 
ground handling services on the Air Force ramp. Only the DD Form 2400, 
Civil Aircraft Certificate of Insurance, and DD Form 2402, Civil 
Aircraft Hold Harmless Agreement, are required for use of Air Force 
ramps on civil airfields.

    (b) Civil aircraft operators must:
    (1) Have an approved DD Form 2401, Civil Aircraft Landing Permit, 
before operating at Air Force airfields, except for emergency use and as 
indicated in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(2)(iii)(E) of this section, and , 
and Sec. 855.13(b)(1)(ii).
    (2) Ensure that pavement load-bearing capacity will support the 
aircraft to be operated at the Air Force airfield.
    (3) Ensure that aircraft to be operated at Air Force airfields are 
equipped with an operating two-way radio capable of communicating with 
the air traffic control tower.
    (4) Obtain final approval for landing from the installation 
commander or a designated representative (normally base operations) at 
least 24 hours prior to arrival.
    (5) Not assume that the landing clearance granted by an air traffic 
control tower facility is a substitute for either the approved civil 
aircraft landing permit or approval from the installation commander or a 
designated representative (normally base operations).
    (6) Obtain required diplomatic or overflight clearance before 
operating in foreign airspace.
    (7) Pay applicable costs and fees.
    (8) File a flight plan before departing the Air Force airfield.
    (c) The installation commander or a designated representative:
    (1) Exercises administrative and security control over both the 
aircraft and passengers while on the installation.
    (2) May require civil users to delay, reschedule, or reroute 
aircraft arrivals or departures to preclude interference with military 
activities.
    (3) Cooperates with customs, immigration, health, and other public 
authorities in connection with civil aircraft arrival and departure.
    (d) Decision Authority: The authority to grant civil aircraft use of 
Air Force airfields is vested in:
    (1) Directorate of Operations, Bases and Units Division, Civil 
Aviation Branch (HQ USAF/XOOBC). HQ USAF/XOOBC may act on any request 
for civil aircraft use of an Air Force airfield. Decision authority for 
the following will not be delegated below HQ USAF:

[[Page 130]]

    (i) Use of multiple Air Force airfields except as designated in 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (ii) Those designated as 2 under Approval Authority in Table 1 to 
this part.
    (iii) Any unusual or unique purpose of use not specifically 
addressed in this part.
    (2) Major Command, Field Operating Agency, Direct Reporting Unit, or 
Installation Commander. With the exception of those uses specifically 
delegated to another decision authority, major commands (MAJCOMs), field 
operating agencies (FOAs), direct reporting units (DRUs) and 
installation commanders or designated representatives have the authority 
to approve or disapprove civil aircraft landing permit applications (DD 
Forms 2400, Civil Aircraft Certificate of Insurance; 2401; Civil 
Aircraft Landing Permit, and 2402, Civil Aircraft Hold Harmless 
Agreement) at airfields for which they hold oversight responsibilities. 
Additionally, for expeditious handling of short notice requests, they 
may grant requests for one-time, official Government business flights 
that are in the best interest of the US Government and do not violate 
other provisions of this part. As a minimum, for one-time flights 
authorized under this section, the aircraft owner or operator must 
provide the decision authority with insurance verification and a 
completed DD Form 2402 before the aircraft operates into the Air Force 
airfield. Air Force authority to approve civil aircraft use of Air Force 
airfields on foreign soil may be limited. Commanders outside the US must 
be familiar with base rights agreements or other international 
agreements that may render inapplicable, in part or in whole, provisions 
of this part. Decision authority is delegated for specific purposes of 
use and or locations as follows:
    (i) Commander, 611th Air Operations Group (AOG). The Commander, 
611th AOG or a designated representative may approve commercial 
charters, on a case-by-case basis, at all Air Force airfields in Alaska, 
except Eielson and Elmendorf AFBs, if the purpose of the charter is to 
transport goods and or materials, such as an electric generator or 
construction materials for a community center, for the benefit of remote 
communities that do not have adequate civil airports.
    (ii) Commander, Air Mobility Command (AMC). The Commander, AMC or a 
designated representative may approve permits that grant landing rights 
at Air Force airfields worldwide in support of AMC contracts.
    (iii) US Defense Attache Office (USDAO). The USDAO, acting on behalf 
of HQ USAF/XOOBC, may grant a request for one-time landing rights at an 
Air Force airfield provided:
    (A) The request is for official Government business of either the US 
or the country to which the USDAO is accredited.
    (B) The Air Force airfield is located within the country to which 
the USDAO is accredited.
    (C) Approval will not violate any agreement with the host country.
    (D) The installation commander concurs.
    (E) The USDAO has a properly completed DD Form 2402 on file and has 
verified that the insurance coverage meets the requirements of Table 2 
to this part, before the aircraft operates into the Air Force airfield.


<R05>
Sec. 855.6  Aircraft exempt from the requirement for a civil aircraft landing permit.

    (a) Any aircraft owned by:
    (1) Any other US Government agency.
    (2) US Air Force aero clubs established as prescribed in AFI 34-117, 
Air Force Aero Club Program, and AFMAN 3-132, Air Force Aero Club 
Operations \1\.

    (b) Any civil aircraft under:
    (1) Lease or contractual agreement for exclusive US Government use 
on a long-term basis and operated on official business by or for a US 
Government agency; for example, the Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA), Department of the Interior, or Department of Energy.

    Note: The Government must hold liability responsibility for all 
damages or injury associated with operation of the aircraft.

    (2) Lease or contractual agreement to the Air Force for Air Force 
Civil Air Patrol (CAP) liaison purposes and operated by an Air Force CAP 
liaison officer on official Air Force business.
    (3) CAP control for a specific mission directed by the Air Force.

<R05>
Sec. 855.7  Conditions for use of Air Force airfields.

    The Air Force authorizes use of its airfields for a specific purpose 
by a named individual or company. The authorization cannot be 
transferred to a second or third party and does not extend to use for 
other purposes. An approved landing permit does not obligate the Air 
Force to provide supplies, equipment, or facilities other than the 
landing, taxiing, and parking areas. The aircraft crew and passengers 
are only authorized activities at the installation directly related to 
the purpose for which use is granted. All users are expected to submit 
their application (DD Forms 2400, 2401, and 2402) at least 30 days 
before intended use and, except for use as a weather alternate, CRAF 
alternate, or emergency landing site, must contact the appropriate 
installation commander or a designated representative for final landing 
approval at least 24 hours before arrival. Failure to comply with either 
time limit may result in denied landing rights.


<R05>
Sec. 855.8  Application procedures.

    To allow time for processing, the application (DD Forms 2400, 2401, 
and 2402) and a self-addressed, stamped envelope should be submitted at 
least 30 days before the date of the first intended landing. The 
verification required for each purpose of use must be included with the 
application. The name of the user must be the same on all forms. 
Original, hand scribed signatures, not facsimile elements, are required 
on all forms. Landing Permit Application Instructions are at attachment 
3 to this part. The user is responsible for reviewing this part and 
accurately completing the forms before submitting them to the approving 
authority.


<R05>
Sec. 855.9  Permit renewal.

    When a landing permit expires, DD Forms 2401 and 2400 must be 
resubmitted for continued use of Air Force airfields.

    Note: Corporations must resubmit the DD Form 2402 every five years.


<R05>
Sec. 855.10  Purpose of use.

    The purposes of use normally associated with civil aircraft 
operations at Air Force airfields are listed in Table 1. Requests for 
use for purposes other than those listed will be considered and may be 
approved if warranted by unique circumstances. A separate DD Form 2401 
is required for each purpose of use. (Users can have multiple DD

[[Page 132]]

Forms 2401 that are covered by a single DD Form 2400 and DD Form 2402.)


<R05>
Sec. 855.11  Insurance requirements.

    Applicants must provide proof of third-party liability insurance on 
a DD Form 2400, with the amounts stated in US dollars. The policy 
number, effective date, and expiration date are required. The statement 
``until canceled'' may be used in lieu of a specific expiration date. 
The geographic coverage must include the area where the Air Force 
airfield of proposed use is located. If several aircraft or aircraft 
types are included under the same policy, a statement such as ``all 
aircraft owned,'' ``all aircraft owned and or operated,'' ``all non-
owned aircraft,'' or ``all aircraft operated,'' may be used in lieu of 
aircraft registration numbers. To meet the insurance requirements, 
either split limit coverage for bodily injury (individuals outside the 
aircraft), property damage, and passengers, or a single limit coverage 
is required. The coverage will be at the expense of the user with an 
insurance company acceptable to the Air Force. Coverage must be current 
during the period the Air Force airfield will be used. The liability 
required is computed on the basis of aircraft maximum gross takeoff 
weight (MGTOW) and passenger or cargo configuration. Minimum coverage 
will not be less than the amount indicated in Table 2 to this part.
    (a) Any insurance presented as a single limit of liability or a 
combination of primary and excess coverage will be an amount equal to or 
greater than the each accident minimums indicated in Table 2 to this 
part for bodily injury (individuals outside the aircraft), property 
damage, and passengers.
    (b) The policy will specifically provide that:
    (1) The insurer waives any right of subrogation it may have against 
the US by reason of any payment made under the policy for injury, death, 
or property damage that might arise, out of or in connection with the 
insured's use of any Air Force airfield.
    (2) The insurance afforded by the policy applies to the liability 
assumed by the insured under DD Form 2402.
    (3) If the insurer or the insured cancels or reduces the amount of 
insurance afforded under the listed policy before the expiration date 
indicated on DD Form 2400, the insurer will send written notice of 
policy cancellation or coverage reduction to the Air Force approving 
authority at least 30 days before the effective date of the cancellation 
or reduction. The policy must state that any cancellation or reduction 
will not be effective until at least 30 days after such notice is sent.


<R05>
Sec. 855.12  Processing a permit application.

    Upon receipt of an application (DD Forms 2400, 2401, and 2402) for 
use of an Air Force airfield, the decision authority:
    (a) Determines the availability of the airfield and its capability 
to accommodate the purpose of use requested.
    (b) Determines the validity of the request and ensures all entries 
on DD Forms 2400, 2401, and 2402 are in conformance with this part.
    (c) Approves DD Form 2401 (with conditions or limitations noted) by 
completing all items in Section II--For Use by Approving Authority as 
follows:
    (1) Period of Use (Block 7): The ``From'' date will be either the 
first day of approved use or the first day of insurance coverage. The 
``From'' date cannot precede the first day of insurance coverage shown 
on the DD Form 2400. The ``Thru'' date is determined by the insurance 
expiration date and or the purpose of use. For example, the period of 
use for participants in an Air Force open house will be determined by 
both insurance coverage and open house dates. The permit would be issued 
only for the duration of the open house but must not precede or exceed 
the dates of insurance coverage. Many insurance policies terminate at 
noon on the expiration date. Therefore, if the insurance expiration is 
used to determine the permit expiration date, the landing permit will 
expire one day before the insurance expiration date shown on the DD Form 
2400. If the insurance expiration date either exceeds 2 years or is 
indefinite (for example, ``until canceled''), the landing permit will 
expire 2 years from the issue date or first day of coverage.

[[Page 133]]

    (2) Frequency of Use (Block 8) is normally ``as required'' but may 
be more specific, such as ``one time.''
    (3) Identification Number (Block 9): Installation commanders or a 
designated representative assign a permit number comprised of the last 
three letters of the installation's International Civil Aviation 
Organization identifier code, the last two digits of the calendar year, 
a number sequentially assigned, and the letter suffix that indicates the 
purpose of use (Table 1); for example, ADW 95-01C. MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs, 
and USDAOs use a three position organization abbreviation; such as AMC 
95-02K.
    (4) DD Form 2400 (Dated and Filed) (Block 11a): This block should 
contain the date from block 1 (Date Issued) on the DD Form 2400 and the

<R05>
Sec. 855.13  Civil fly-ins.

    (a) Civil aircraft operators may be invited to a specified Air Force 
airfield for:
    (1) A base open house to perform or provide a static display.
    (2) A flying safety seminar.
    (b) Civil fly-in procedures:
    (1) The installation commander or a designated representative:
    (i) Requests approval from the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU with an 
information copy to HQ USAF/XOOBC/XOOO and SAF/PAC.
    (ii) Ensures that DD Form 2402 is completed by each user.

    Note: DD Forms 2400 and 2401 are not required for fly-in 
participants if flying activity consists of a single landing and takeoff 
with no spectators other than flightline or other personnel required to 
support the aircraft operations.

    (2) The MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU ensures HQ USAF/XOOBC/XOOO and SAF/PAC 
are advised of the approval or disapproval for the fly-in.
    (3) Aerial performance by civil aircraft at an Air Force open house 
requires MAJCOM or FOA approval and an approved landing permit as 
specified in AFI 35-201, Community Relations <SUP>3</SUP>. Regardless of 
the aircraft's historic military significance, DD Forms 2400, 2401, and 
2402 must be submitted and approved before the performance. The permit 
can be approved at MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, or installation level. Use will be 
authorized only for the period of the event. Fly-in procedures do not 
apply to aircraft transporting passengers (revenue or non-revenue) for 
the purpose of attending the open house or demonstration flights 
associated with marketing a product.

<R05>
Sec. 855.14  Unauthorized landings.

    (a) Unauthorized landing procedures. The installation commander or a 
designated representative will identify an unauthorized landing as 
either an emergency landing, an inadvertent landing, or an intentional 
landing. An unauthorized landing may be designated as inadvertent or 
intentional whether or not the operator has knowledge of the provisions 
of this part, and whether or not the operator filed a flight plan 
identifying the installation as a destination. Aircraft must depart the 
installation as soon as practical. On all unauthorized landings, the 
installation commander or a designated representative:
    (1) Informs the operator of Subpart B procedures and the requirement 
for notifying the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as specified in 
section 6 of the FAA Airman's Information Manual.
    (2) Notifies the Federal Aviation Flight Standards District Office 
(FSDO) by telephone or telefax, followed by written notification using 
FAA Form 8020-9, 8020-11, or 8020-17, as appropriate. A copy of the 
written notification must be provided to HQ USAF/XOOBC.
    (3) Ensures the operator completes a DD Form 2402, and collects 
applicable charges. (In some instances, it may be necessary to arrange 
to bill the user for the appropriate charges.) DD Form 2402 need not be 
completed for commercial carriers if it is known that the form is 
already on file at HQ USAF/XOOBC.
    (4) In a foreign country, notifies the local US Defense Attache 
Office (USDAO) by telephone or telefax and, where applicable, the 
appropriate USDAO in the country of aircraft registry, followed by 
written notification with an information copy to HQ USAF/XOOBC and the 
civil aviation authority of the country or countries concerned.
    (b) Emergency landings. Any aircraft operator who experiences an 
inflight emergency may land at any Air Force airfield without prior 
authorization (approved DD Form 2401 and 24 hours prior notice). An 
inflight emergency is defined as a situation that makes continued flight 
hazardous.
    (1) The Air Force will use any method or means to clear an aircraft 
or wreckage from the runway to preclude interference with essential 
military operations after coordinating with the FSDO and National 
Transportation Safety Board. Removal efforts will minimize damage to the 
aircraft or wreckage; however, military or other operational factors may 
be overriding.
    (2) An operator making an emergency landing:
    (i) Is not charged a landing fee.
    (ii) Pays all costs for labor, material, parts, use of equipment and 
tools, and so forth, to include, but not limited to:
    (A) Spreading foam on the runway.
    (B) Damage to runway, lighting, and navigation aids.
    (C) Rescue, crash, and fire control services.
    (D) Movement and storage of aircraft.
    (E) Performance of minor maintenance.
    (F) Fuel or oil (AFM 67-1, vol 1, part three, chapter 1, Air Force 
Stock Fund and DPSC Assigned Item Procedures <SUP>4</SUP>).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 855.6.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Inadvertent unauthorized landings:
    (1) The installation commander or a designated representative may 
determine a landing to be inadvertent if the aircraft operator:
    (i) Landed due to flight disorientation.
    (ii) Mistook the Air Force airfield for a civil airport.
    (2) Normal landing fees must be charged and an unauthorized landing 
fee may be assessed to compensate the Government for the added time, 
effort, and risk involved in the inadvertent landing. Only the 
unauthorized landing fee may be waived by the installation commander or 
a designated representative if, after interviewing the pilot-in-command 
and appropriate Government personnel, it is determined that flying 
safety was not significantly impaired. The pilot-in-command may appeal 
the imposition of an unauthorized landing fee for an inadvertent landing 
to the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU whose decision will be final. A subsequent 
inadvertent landing will be processed as an intentional unauthorized 
landing.

[[Page 135]]

    (d) Intentional unauthorized landings.
    (1) The installation commander may categorize an unauthorized 
landing as intentional when there is unequivocal evidence that the pilot 
deliberately:
    (i) Landed without an approved DD Form 2401 on board the aircraft.
    (ii) Landed for a purpose not approved on the DD Form 2401.
    (iii) Operated an aircraft not of a model or registration number on 
the approved DD Form 2401.
    (iv) Did not request or obtain the required final approval from the 
installation commander or a designated representative at least 24 hours 
before aircraft arrival.
    (v) Did not obtain landing clearance from the air traffic control 
tower.
    (vi) Landed with an expired DD Form 2401.
    (vii) Obtained landing authorization through fraudulent methods, or
    (viii) Landed after having been denied a request to land from any 
Air Force authority, including the control tower.
    (2) Normal landing fees and an unauthorized landing fee must be 
charged. Intentional unauthorized landings increase reporting, 
processing, and staffing costs; therefore, the unauthorized landing fee 
for paragraph (d)(1)(i) through (d)(1)(vi) of this section will be 
increased by 100 percent. The unauthorized landing fee will be increased 
200 percent for paragraph (d)(1)(vii) and (d)(1)(viii) of this section.
    (3) Intentional unauthorized landings may be prosecuted as a 
criminal trespass, especially if a debarment letter has been issued. 
Repeated intentional unauthorized landings prejudice the user's FAA 
operating authority and jeopardize future use of Air Force airfields.


<R05>
Sec. 855.15  Detaining an aircraft.

    (a) An installation commander in the United States, its territories, 
or its possessions may choose to detain an aircraft for an intentional 
unauthorized landing until:
    (1) The unauthorized landing has been reported to the FAA, HQ USAF/
XOOBC, and the appropriate US Attorney.
    (2) All applicable charges have been paid.
    (b) If the installation commander wishes to release the aircraft 
before the investigation is completed, he or she must obtain bond, 
promissory note, or other security for payment of the highest charge 
that may be assessed.
    (c) The pilot and passengers will not be detained longer than is 
necessary for identification, although they may be permitted to remain 
in a lounge or other waiting area on the base at their request for such 
period as the installation commander may determine (normally not to 
exceed close of business hours at the home office of the entity owning 
the aircraft, if the operator does not own the aircraft). No person, 
solely due to an intentional unauthorized landing, will be detained 
involuntarily after identification is complete without coordination from 
the appropriate US Attorney, the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU, and HQ USAF/XOOBC.


<R05>
Sec. 855.16  Parking and storage.

    The time that an aircraft spends on an installation is at the 
discretion of the installation commander or a designated representative 
but should be linked to the purpose of use authorized. Parking and 
storage may be permitted on a nonexclusive, temporary, or intermittent 
basis, when compatible with military requirements. At those locations 
where there are Air Force aero clubs, parking and storage privileges may 
be permitted in the area designated for aero club use without regard for 
the purpose of use authorized, if consistent with aero club policies. 
Any such permission may be revoked upon notice, based on military needs 
and the installation commander's discretion.


<R05>
Sec. 855.17  Fees for landing, parking, and storage.

    (a) Landing, parking, and storage fees (Tables 3 and 4 to this part) 
are determined by aircraft maximum gross takeoff weight (MGTOW). All 
fees are normally due and collectable at the time of use of the Air 
Force airfield. DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher, is used to 
deposit the fees with the base accounting and finance officer. In some 
instances, it may be necessary to bill the user for charges incurred.

[[Page 136]]

    (b) Landing fees are not charged when the aircraft is operating in 
support of official Government business or for any purpose, the cost of 
which is subject to reimbursement by the US Government. Parking and 
Storage Fees (Table 4 to this part) are charged if an aircraft must 
remain beyond the period necessary to conduct official Government 
business and for all non-official Government business operations.


<R05>
Sec. 855.18  Aviation fuel and oil purchases.

    When a user qualifies under the provisions of AFM 67-1, vol. 1, part 
three, chapter 1, Air Force Stock Fund and DPSC Assigned Item 
Procedures,\5\ purchase of Air Force fuel and oil may be made on a cash 
or credit basis. An application for credit authority can be filed by 
submitting an Authorized Credit Letter to SA-ALC/SFRL, 1014 Andrews 
Road, Building 1621, Kelly AFB TX 78241-5603.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<R05>
Sec. 855.19  Supply and service charges.

    Supplies and services furnished to a user will be charged for as 
prescribed in AFM 67-1, volume 1, part one, chapter 10, section N, Basic 
Air Force Supply Procedures, and AFR 177-102, paragraph 28.24, 
Commercial Transactions at Base Level.\6\ A personal check with 
appropriate identification, cashier's check, money order, or cash are 
acceptable means of payment. Charges for handling foreign military sales 
cargo are prescribed in AFR 170-3, Financial Management and Accounting 
for Security Assistance and International Programs.\7\

<R04>
   Subpart C--Agreements for Civil Aircraft Use of Air Force Airfields


<R05>
Sec. 855.20  Joint-use agreements.

    An agreement between the Air Force and a local Government agency is 
required before a community can establish a public airport on an Air 
Force airfield.
    (a) Joint use of an Air Force airfield will be considered only if 
there will be no cost to the Air Force and no compromise of mission 
capability, security, readiness, safety, or quality of life. Further, 
only proposals submitted by authorized representatives of local 
Government agencies eligible to sponsor a public airport will be given 
the comprehensive evaluation required to conclude a joint use agreement. 
All reviewing levels will consider and evaluate such requests on an 
individual basis.
    (b) Generally, the Air Force is willing to consider joint use at an 
airfield if it does not have pilot training, nuclear storage, or a 
primary mission that requires a high level of security. Civil operations 
must begin within 5 years of the effective date of an agreement. 
Operational considerations will be based on the premise that military 
aircraft will receive priority handling (except in emergencies), if 
traffic must be adjusted or resequenced. The Air Force normally will not 
consider personnel increases solely to support civil operations but, if 
accommodated, all costs must be fully reimbursed by the joint-use 
sponsor. The Air Force will not provide personnel to install, operate, 
maintain, alter, or relocate navigation equipment or aircraft arresting 
systems for the sole use of civil aviation. Changes in equipment or 
systems to support the civil operations must be funded by the joint-use 
sponsor. The Air Force must approve siting, design, and construction of 
the civil facilities.


<R05>
Sec. 855.21  Procedures for sponsor.

    To initiate consideration for joint use of an Air Force airfield, a 
formal proposal must be submitted to the installation commander by a 
local Government agency eligible to sponsor a public airport. The 
proposal must include:
    (a) Type of operation.
    (b) Type and number of aircraft to be located on or operating at the 
airfield.
    (c) An estimate of the number of annual operations for the first 5 
years.


<R05>
Sec. 855.22  Air Force procedures.

    (a) Upon receipt of a joint-use proposal, the installation 
commander, without precommitment or comment, will send the documents to 
the Air Force Representative (AFREP) at the Federal Aviation 
Administration

[[Page 137]]

(FAA) Regional Office within the geographical area where the 
installation is located. AFI 13-201, Air Force Airspace Management,\8\ 
lists the AFREPs and their addresses. The installation commander must 
provide an information copy of the proposal to HQ USAF/XOOBC, 1480 Air 
Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1480.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 855.6.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) The AFREP provides comments to the installation commander on 
airspace, air traffic control, and other related areas, and informs 
local FAA personnel of the proposal for joint use.
    (c) The installation, the numbered Air Force, and the major command 
(MAJCOM) will then evaluate the proposal. The MAJCOM will send the 
comments and recommendations from all reviewing officials to HQ USAF/
XOOBC.
    (d) Factors considered in evaluating joint use include, but are not 
limited to:
    (1) Impact on current and programmed military activities at the 
installation.
    (2) Compatibility of proposed civil aviation operations with present 
and planned military operations.
    (3) Compatibility of communications systems.
    (4) Instrument capability of crew and aircraft.
    (5) Runway and taxiway configuration. (Installations with single 
runways normally will not be considered for joint use.)
    (6) Security. The possibility for sabotage, terrorism, and vandalism 
increases with joint use; therefore, joint use will not be considered:
    (i) If military and civil aircraft would be collocated in hangars or 
on ramps.
    (ii) If access to the civil aviation facilities would require 
routine transit through the base.
    (7) Fire, crash, and rescue requirements.
    (8) Availability of public airports to accommodate the current and 
future air transportation needs of the community through construction or 
expansion.
    (9) Availability of land for civil airport complex.

    Note: The majority of land required for a terminal and other support 
facilities must be located outside the installation perimeter or at a 
site that will allow maximum separation of military and civil 
activities. If the community does not already own the needed land, it 
must be acquired at no expense to the Air Force. The Air Force may make 
real property that is not presently needed, but not excess, available by 
lease under 10 U.S.C 2667. An application for lease of Air Force real 
property must be processed through the chain of command to the Air Force 
Real Estate Agency, 172 Luke Avenue, Suite 104, Building 5683, Bolling 
AFB DC 20332-5113, as prescribed in AFI 32-9003, Granting Temporary Use 
of Air Force Real Property <SUP>9</SUP>. All real property outleases 
require payment of fair market consideration and normally are processed 
through the Corps of Engineers. The General Services Administration must 
be contacted regarding availability of excess or surplus Federal real 
property and an application submitted through FAA for an airport use 
public benefit transfer under 49 U.S.C. Sec. 47151-47153.

    \9\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 855.6.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (10) Sponsor's resources to pay a proportionate share of costs for 
runway operation and maintenance and other jointly used facilities or 
otherwise provide compensation that is of direct benefit to the 
Government.
    (e) When the Air Force determines that joint use may be compatible 
with its defense mission, the environmental impact analysis process must 
be completed before a final decision can be made. The Air Force will act 
as lead agency for the preparation of the environmental analysis (32 CFR 
part 989, Environmental Impact Analysis Process). The local Government 
agency representatives, working in coordination with Air Force personnel 
at the installation and other concerned local or Federal officials, must 
identify the proposed action, develop conceptual alternatives, and 
provide planning, socioeconomic, and environmental information as 
specified by the appropriate MAJCOM and HQ USAF/CEVP. The information 
must be complete and accurate in order to serve as a basis for the 
preparation of the Air Force environmental documents. All costs 
associated with the environmental studies required to complete the 
environmental impact analysis process must be paid by the joint use 
sponsor. Information

[[Page 138]]

on environmental analysis requirements is available from HQ USAF/CEVP, 
1260 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1260.
    (f) HQ USAF/XOOBC can begin negotiating a joint-use agreement after 
the environmental impact analysis process is completed. The agreement 
must be concluded on behalf of the Air Force by SAF/MII as the approval 
authority for use of Air Force real property for periods exceeding 5 
years. The joint-use agreement will state the extent to which the 
provisions of subpart B of this part, Civil Aircraft Landing Permits, 
apply to civil aircraft operations.
    (1) Joint-use agreements are tailored to accommodate the needs of 
the community and minimize the impact on the defense mission. Although 
each agreement is unique, attachment 4 to this part provides basic terms 
that are frequently included in such agreements.
    (2) Agreements for joint use at Air Force airfields on foreign soil 
are subject to the requirements of AFI 51-701, Negotiating, Concluding, 
Reporting, and Maintaining International Agreements <SUP>10</SUP>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 855.6.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (g) HQ USAF/XOOBC and SAF/MII approval is required to amend existing 
joint use agreements. The evaluation and decision processes followed in 
concluding an initial joint-use proposal must be used to amend existing 
joint-use agreements.


<R05>
Sec. 855.23  Other agreements.

    (a) Temporary use of Air Force runways occasionally is needed for 
extended periods when a local civil airport is unavailable or to 
accommodate special events or projects. Such use requires agreement 
between the Air Force and the local airport authority or other 
equivalent responsible entity.
    (b) The local proponent and Air Force personnel should draft and 
submit an agreement to the MAJCOM Director for Operations, or equivalent 
level, for review and comment. The agreement must address all 
responsibilities for handling aircraft, cargo, and passengers, and hold 
the Air Force harmless of all liabilities. The agreement will not exceed 
3 years. Although each agreement will be unique, attachment 5 of this 
part provides one example. The draft agreement, with all comments and 
recommendations, must be sent to HQ USAF/XOOBC for final approval.

<R05>
Sec. 861.2  Purpose.

    Department of Defense Directive 4500.53, Commercial Passenger 
Airlift Management and Quality Control, charges the Commander, Air 
Mobility Command (AMC), with establishing safety standards and criteria 
for commercial passenger airlift service used by the Department of 
Defense. It also charges the Commander, AMC, jointly with the Commander, 
Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC), with establishing the 
Commercial Airlift Review Board and providing policy guidance and 
direction for its operation. This part establishes Department of Defense 
(DOD) quality and safety criteria for commercial air carriers providing 
or seeking to provide airlift services to the DOD. Included are the 
operating procedures of the Commercial Airlift Review Board (CARB). The 
CARB has the authority

[[Page 152]]

to suspend air carriers from DOD use or take other action when issues of 
air safety arise.


<R05>
Sec. 861.3  DOD commercial air carrier quality and safety requirements.

    (a) DOD, as a customer of airlift services, expects an air carrier 
or operator soliciting for or doing business with the DOD to engage in 
quality programs and business practices that not only ensure good 
service but enhance the safety, operational, and maintenance standards 
established by the applicable Civil Aviation Agency Regulations (CARs). 
Accordingly, and as required by U.S. Public Law 99-661, the DOD has 
established a set of air carrier quality and safety requirements that 
reflect the type programs and practices the DOD seeks from air carriers 
or operators airlifting DOD resources.
    (b) A DOD survey team will use the following requirements, the 
specifics of the applicable DOD contract or agreement, the CARs, and the 
experienced judgment of DOD personnel to evaluate an air carrier's 
capability to perform for the DOD. The survey will also include, with 
the carrier's coordination, observation of cockpit crew performance, as 
well as ramp inspections of selected company aircraft. A satisfactory 
on-site survey (audit) conducted by DOD personnel is prerequisite to 
participation in the DOD air transportation program. Surveys are 
conducted prior to an air carrier's acceptance into the program; 
thereafter, surveys will be completed on a biennial basis and when 
otherwise required to validate adherence to DOD quality and safety 
requirements. DOD personnel will also assess these quality and safety 
requirements when conducting periodic commercial air carrier table-top 
performance evaluations.
    (c) The size of an air carrier, along with the type and scope of 
operations, will be considered during the on-site survey. For example, 
while an air taxi/FAA part 135 air carrier may not have a formal flight 
control function, such as a 24-hour dispatch organization, that same air 
taxi is expected to demonstrate some kind of effective flight following 
capability. On the other hand, a major carrier/FAA part 121 air carrier 
is expected to have a formal flight control or dispatch function. Both, 
however, will be evaluated based on the effectiveness and quality of 
whatever flight following function they do maintain.
    (d) The air carrier requirements stated in this part provide the 
criteria against which would-be DOD air carrier contractors may be 
subjectively evaluated by the DOD. These requirements are neither all-
inclusive nor are they inflexible in nature. They are not replacements 
for the certification criteria and other regulations established by 
civil aviation agencies; rather, these requirements are customer-
developed and describe enhanced air carrier activities sought by the 
DOD.

    Note: The term ``Civil Aviation Agency (CAA)'' is used throughout 
this part since these requirements are applicable to U.S. and 
international air carriers doing business with DOD. CAA includes the 
United States Federal Aviation Administration.

    (1) Quality and Safety Requirements--prior experience. Commercial 
air carriers or operators applying to conduct passenger or cargo 
business for the United States Department of Defense are required to 
possess 12 months of continuous service equivalent to the service sought 
by DoD. The service must have been performed for the 12 continuous 
months immediately prior to applying for DoD business. Prior experience 
must be equivalent in difficulty and complexity in regard to distance, 
weather systems, international or national procedures, similar aircraft, 
schedule demands, aircrew experience, and management required.
    (2) Quality and safety requirements--air carrier management. 
Management has clearly defined safety as the number one company 
priority, and safety is never sacrificed to satisfy passenger concern, 
convenience, or cost. Policies, procedures, and goals that enhance the 
CAA's minimum operations and maintenance standards have been established 
and implemented. A cooperative response to CAA inspections, critiques, 
or comments is demonstrated. Proper support infrastructure, including 
facilities, equipment, parts, and qualified personnel, is provided at 
the certificate holder's primary facility and en route

[[Page 153]]

stations. Personnel with aviation credentials and experience fill key 
management positions. An internal quality audit program or other method 
capable of identifying in-house deficiencies and measuring the company's 
compliance with their stated policies and standards has been 
implemented. Audit results are analyzed in order to determine the cause, 
not just the symptom, of any deficiency. The result of sound fiscal 
policy is evident throughout the company.
    (3) Quality and safety requirements--operations--(i) Flight safety. 
Establish policies that promote flight safety. These policies are 
infused among all aircrew and operational personnel who translate the 
policies into practice. New or revised safety-related data are promptly 
disseminated to affected personnel who understand that deviation from 
any established safety policy is unacceptable. An audit system that 
detects unsafe practices is in place and a feedback structure informs 
management of safety policy results including possible safety problems. 
Management ensures that corrective actions resolve every unsafe 
condition.
    (ii) Flight operations. Established flight operations policies and 
procedures are up-to-date, reflect the current scope of operations, and 
are clearly defined to aviation department employees. These adhered-to 
procedures are further supported by a flow of current, management-
generated safety and operational communications. Managers are in touch 
with mission requirements, supervise crew selection, and ensure the risk 
associated with all flight operations is reduced to the lowest 
acceptable level. Flight crews are free from undue management pressure 
and are comfortable with exercising their professional judgment during 
flight activities, even if such actions do not support the flight 
schedule. Effective lines of communication permit feedback from line 
crews to operations managers. Personnel records are maintained and 
reflect such data as experience, qualifications, and medical status.
    (iii) Flight crew hiring. Established procedures ensure that 
applicants are carefully screened, including a review of the 
individual's health and suitability to perform flight crew duties. 
Consideration is given to the applicant's total aviation background, 
appropriate experience, and the individual's potential to perform 
safely. Freedom from alcohol abuse and illegal drugs is required. If 
new-hire cockpit crewmembers do not meet industry standards for 
experience and qualification, then increased training and management 
attention to properly qualify these personnel are required.
    (iv) Aircrew training. Training, including recurrent training, that 
develops and refines skills designed to eliminate mishaps and improve 
safety is essential to a quality operation. Crew coordination training 
that facilitates full cockpit crews training and interacting together 
using standardized procedures and including the principles of Cockpit 
Resource Management (CRM) is required. Programs involving the use of 
simulators or other devices that can provide realistic training 
scenarios are desired. Captain and first officer training objectives 
cultivate similar levels of proficiency. Appropriate emergency 
procedures training (e.g., evacuation procedures) is provided to flight 
deck and flight attendant personnel as a total crew whenever possible; 
such training focuses on cockpit and cabin crews functioning as a 
coordinated team during emergencies. Crew training--be it pilot, 
engineer, or flight attendant--is appropriate to the level of risk and 
circumstances anticipated for the trainee. Training programs have the 
flexibility to incorporate and resolve recurring problem areas 
associated with day-to-day flight operations. Trainers are highly 
skilled in both subject matter and training techniques. Training 
received is documented, and that documentation is maintained in a 
current status.
    (v) Captain upgrade training. A selection and training process that 
considers proven experience, decision making, cockpit resource 
management, and response to unusual situations, including stress and 
pressure, is required. Also important is emphasis on captain 
responsibility and authority.

[[Page 154]]

    (vi) Aircrew scheduling. A closely monitored system that evaluates 
operational risks, experience levels of crewmembers, and ensures the 
proper pairing of aircrews on all flights is required. New captains are 
scheduled with highly experienced first officers, and new or low-time 
first officers are scheduled with experienced captains. Except for 
aircraft new to the company, captains and first officers assigned to DOD 
charter passenger missions possess at least 250 hours combined 
experience in the type aircraft being operated. The scheduling system 
involves an established flight duty time program for aircrews, including 
flight attendants, carefully managed so as to ensure proper crew rest 
and considers quality-of-life factors. Attention is given to the stress 
on aircrews during strikes, mergers, or periods of labor-management 
difficulties.
    (vii) In-flight performance. Aircrews, including flight attendants, 
are fit for flight duties and trained to handle normal, abnormal, and 
emergency situations. They demonstrate crew discipline and a knowledge 
of aviation rules; use company-developed standardized procedures; adhere 
to checklists; and emphasize safety, including security considerations, 
throughout all preflight, in-flight, and postflight operations. 
Qualified company personnel evaluate aircrews and analyze results; known 
performance deficiencies are eliminated. Evaluations ensure aircrews 
demonstrate aircraft proficiency in accordance with company established 
standards. Flight crews are able to determine an aircraft's maintenance 
condition prior to flight and use standardized methods to accurately 
report aircraft deficiencies to the maintenance activity.
    (viii) Operational control/support. Effective mission control 
includes communications with aircrews and the capability to respond to 
irregularities or difficulties. Clear written procedures for mission 
preparation and flight following aircraft and aircrews are provided. 
There is access to weather, flight planning, and aircraft maintenance 
data. There are personnel available who are knowledgeable in aircraft 
performance and mission requirements and that can correctly respond to 
emergency situations. There is close interface between operations and 
maintenance, ensuring a mutual awareness of aircraft operational and 
maintenance status. Procedures to notify DOD in case of an accident or 
serious incident have been established. Flight crews involved in such 
accidents or incidents report the situation to company personnel who, in 
turn, have procedures to evaluate the flight crew's capability to 
continue the mission. Aircraft involved in accidents or incidents are 
inspected in accordance with Civil Aviation Regulations and a 
determination made as to whether or not the aircraft is safe from 
continued operations.
    (ix) DOD charter procedures. Detailed procedures addressing military 
charter requirements are expected. The level of risk associated with DOD 
charter missions does not exceed the risk inherent in the carrier's non-
DOD daily flight operations. Complete route planning and airport 
analyses are accomplished, and actual passenger and cargo weights are 
used in computing aircraft weight and balance.
    (4) Quality and safety requirements--maintenance. Maintenance 
supervisors ensure all personnel understand that in spite of scheduling 
pressure, peer pressure, supervisory pressure, or other factors, the 
airplane must be airworthy prior to flight. Passenger and employee 
safety is a paramount management concern. Quality, completeness, and 
integrity of work are trademarks of the maintenance manager and 
maintenance department. Nonconformance to established maintenance 
practices is not tolerated. Management ensures that contracted 
maintenance, including repair and overhaul facilities, is performed by 
maintenance organizations acceptable to the CAA.
    (i) Maintenance personnel. Air carriers are expected to hire and 
train the number of employees required to safely maintain the company 
aircraft and support the scope of the maintenance operation both at home 
station (the company's primary facility) and at en route locations. 
These personnel ensure that all maintenance tasks, including required 
inspections and airworthiness

[[Page 155]]

directives, are performed; that maintenance actions are properly 
documented; and that the discrepancies identified between inspections 
are corrected. Mechanics are fit for duty, properly certificated, the 
company verifies certification, and these personnel possess the 
knowledge and the necessary aircraft-specific experience to accomplish 
the maintenance tasks. Noncertified and inexperienced personnel receive 
proper supervision. Freedom from alcohol abuse and illegal drugs is 
required.
    (ii) Quality assurance (continuing analysis and surveillance 
program). A system that continuously analyzes the performance and 
effectiveness of maintenance activities and maintenance inspection 
programs is required. This system evaluates such functions as 
reliability reports, audits, component tear-down reports, inspection 
procedures and results, tool calibration program, real-time aircraft 
maintenance actions, warranty programs, and other maintenance functions. 
The extent of this program is directly related to the air carrier's size 
and scope of operation. The cause of any recurring discrepancy or 
negative trend is researched and eliminated. Action is taken to prevent 
recurrence to these discrepancies and preventive actions are monitored 
to ensure effectiveness. The results of preventive actions are provided 
to appropriate maintenance technicians.
    (iii) Maintenance inspection activity. A process to ensure required 
aircraft inspections are completed and the results properly documented 
is required. Also required is a system to evaluate contract vendors, 
suppliers, and their products. Inspection personnel are identified, 
trained (initial and recurrent), and provided guidance regarding 
inspector responsibility and authority. The inspection activity is 
normally a separate entity within the maintenance department.
    (iv) Maintenance training. Training is conducted commensurate with 
the size and type of maintenance function being performed. Continuing 
education and progressive experience are provided for all maintenance 
personnel. Orientation, familiarization, on-the-job, and appropriate 
recurrent training for all full- and part-time personnel is expected. 
The use of such training aids as mockups, simulators, and computer-based 
training enhances maintenance training efforts and is desired. Training 
documentation is required; it is current, complete, well-maintained, and 
correctly identifies any special authorizations such as inspection and 
airworthiness release. Trainers are fully qualified in the subject 
matter.
    (v) Maintenance control. A method to control maintenance activities 
and track aircraft status is required. Qualified personnel monitor 
maintenance preplanning, ensure completion of maintenance actions, and 
track deferred discrepancies. Deferred maintenance actions are 
identified to supervisory personnel and corrected in accordance with the 
criteria provided by the manufacturer or regulatory agency. Constant and 
effective communications between maintenance and flight operations 
ensure an exchange of critical information.
    (vi) Aircraft maintenance program. Aircraft are properly certified 
and maintained in a manner that ensures they are airworthy and safe. The 
program includes the use of manufacturer's and CAA information, as well 
as company policies and procedures. Airworthiness directives are 
complied with in the prescribed time frame, and service bulletins are 
evaluated for applicable action. Approved reliability programs are 
proactive, providing management with visibility on the effectiveness of 
the maintenance program; attention is given to initial component and 
older aircraft inspection intervals and to deferred maintenance actions. 
Special tools and equipment are calibrated.
    (vii) Maintenance records. Maintenance actions are well documented 
and provide a complete record of maintenance accomplished and, for 
repetitive actions, maintenance required. Such records as aircraft log 
books and maintenance documentation are legibly prepared, dated, clean, 
readily identifiable, and maintained in an orderly fashion. Inspection 
compliance, airworthiness release, and maintenance release records, 
etc., are complete and signed by approved personnel.
    (viii) Aircraft appearance (in-service aircraft). Aircraft 
exteriors, including

[[Page 156]]

all visible surfaces and components, are clean and well maintained. 
Interiors are also clean and orderly. Required safety equipment and 
systems are available and operable.
    (ix) Fueling and servicing. Aircraft fuel is free from 
contamination, and company fuel facilities (farms) are inspected and 
results documented. Procedures and instructions pertaining to servicing, 
handling, and storing fuel and oil meet established safety standards. 
Procedures for monitoring and verifying vendor servicing practices are 
included in this program.
    (x) Maintenance manuals. Company policy manuals and manufacturer's 
maintenance manuals are current, available, clear, complete, and adhered 
to by maintenance personnel. These manuals provide maintenance personnel 
with standardized procedures for maintaining company aircraft. 
Management policies, lines of authority, and company maintenance 
procedures are documented in company manuals and kept in a current 
status.
    (xi) Maintenance facilities. Well maintained, clean maintenance 
facilities adequate for the level of aircraft repair authorized in the 
company's CAA certificate are expected. Safety equipment is available in 
hangars, shops, etc., and is serviceable. Shipping, receiving, and 
stores areas are likewise clean and orderly. Parts are correctly 
packaged, tagged, segregated, and shelf life properly monitored.
    (5) Quality and safety requirements--security. Company personnel are 
schooled in security responsibilities and practice applicable procedures 
during ground and in-flight operations. Compliance with provisions of 
the appropriate standard security program, established by the CAA, is 
required for all DOD missions.
    (6) Quality and safety requirements--specific equipment 
requirements. Air carriers satisfy DOD equipment and other requirements 
as specified in Air Mobility Command contracts or Military Traffic 
Management Command Military Air Transportation Agreements.

<R05>
Sec. 861.4  DOD Commercial Airlift Review Board procedures.

    (a) This part establishes the procedures to be used by the United 
States Air Force Air Mobility Command (AMC) and the United States Army 
Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC) when, in accordance with 
references Sec. 861.1 (a) through (d):
    (1) A commercial air carrier is subject to review or other action by 
the DOD Commercial Airlift Review Board (hereinafter referred to as the 
CARB),
    (2) A warning, suspension, temporary nonuse, or reinstatement action 
is taken against a carrier by the CARB, or
    (3) Review or other CARB action is escalated to a higher authority.
    These procedures apply to all commercial air carriers providing DOD 
passenger or cargo airlift through charter, individual ticket movements, 
contracts, or other transportation agreements. They also apply to 
carriers providing air transportation purchased by DOD individuals for 
which government reimbursement will be made in whole or in part.
    (b) Safety or airworthiness issues, per reference Sec. 861.1(b) must 
be referred to the CARB. AMC and MTMC may each take independent 
corrective action in accordance with their respective procedures on 
standards of service issues when safety and airworthiness issues are not 
involved. The DOD Air Carrier Survey and Analysis Directorate will be 
informed of all actions taken independently by AMC or MTMC.
    (c) Except as otherwise provided herein, the rights and remedies of 
the government and commercial air carriers outlined in these procedures 
are not exclusive and are in addition to any other rights and remedies 
provided for by law, regulation, contract, or agreement.
    (d) Definitions. (1) Letter of warning is a notice to a carrier of a 
failure to satisfy safety or airworthiness requirements which, if not 
remedied, may result in temporary nonuse or suspension. The issuance of 
a letter of warning is not a prerequisite to a suspension or other 
action.
    (2) Temporary nonuse is the immediate exclusion of a carrier from 
any

[[Page 157]]

flight activities in the DOD airlift transportation program, pending a 
decision on suspension, taken under the conditions outlined in paragraph 
(h)(1) of this section. By mutual agreement of the CARB and the air 
carrier involved, a suspension hearing or decision may be delayed and 
the air carrier continued in a temporary nonuse status for an extended 
period of time.
    (3) Suspension is the exclusion of an air carrier from participating 
in the DOD airlift transportation program. The period of suspension will 
normally:
    (i) Remain in effect until the carrier furnishes satisfactory 
evidence that the conditions causing the suspension have been remedied 
or
    (ii) Be for a fixed period of time as determined at the discretion 
of the CARB.
    (4) The procedures for commercial airlift safety review include five 
possible levels with increasing authority:
    (i) DOD Air Carrier Survey and Analysis Directorate.
    (ii) DOD Commercial Airlift Review Committee.
    (iii) DOD Commercial Airlift Review Board.
    (iv) Commanders MTMC and AMC.
    (v) DOD Commercial Airlift Review Authority.
    These levels are described in reference Sec. 861.1(b), with the 
exception of the DOD Commercial Airlift Review Committee, which is 
described in reference Sec. 861.1(c). The Committee provides 
multifunctional review of the efforts of the DOD Air Carrier Survey and 
Analysis Directorate, including approval or disapproval of carriers 
initially seeking DOD business, and offers advice to the higher 
authorities when appropriate.
    (e) Causes and conditions for suspension. (1) Carrier shall be 
subject to suspension for good cause, including:
    (i) Failing to comply with generally accepted standards of 
airmanship, training, and maintenance practices and procedures.
    (ii) Failing to satisfy DOD quality and safety requirements as 
described in Sec. 861.3.
    (iii) Failing to comply with all provisions of applicable statutes, 
agreements, and contract terms, as such may affect flight safety, as 
well as with all applicable Federal Aviation Administration regulations, 
airworthiness directives, orders, rules, and standards promulgated under 
the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 as amended.
    (iv) Involvement of one of the carrier's aircraft in a serious or 
fatal accident, incident, or operational occurrence (regardless of 
whether or not such aircraft is being used in the performance of 
government procured transportation).
    (v) Any other condition which affects the safe operation of the 
carrier's flights hereunder.
    (vi) Compliance with published standards does not, standing alone, 
constitute compliance with generally accepted standards or airmanship, 
training, or maintenance practices.
    (f) Reinstatement considerations. In no event shall reinstatement 
occur unless and until the carrier shows to the satisfaction of the CARB 
that deficiencies that led to suspension have been corrected and that 
actions have been implemented to preclude the recurrence of similar 
deficiencies.
    (g) CARB membership. (1) Four voting members will constitute the 
CARB; two senior, knowledgeable individuals appointed by Commander, AMC; 
one similarly knowledgeable individual appointed by USCINCTRANS; and one 
appointed by Commander, MTMC. At least one of the voting HQ AMC members 
and the MTMC member will be of general/flag officer or civilian 
equivalent rank. Other non-voting CARB members will be appointed as 
necessary to facilitate the CARB deliberative process. A non-voting 
recorder will also be appointed.
    (2) The HQ AMC senior member will act as the CARB chairperson. A 
voting member who will not be present at any meeting of the CARB, may be 
represented by a knowledgeable alternate empowered with the voting 
responsibilities of the voting member. Three voting members (or their 
alternate) shall constitute a quorum. Decisions shall be by majority 
vote. In the case of a tie vote, the chairperson will have the deciding 
vote.
    (3) The meeting date, time, and site of the CARB will be determined 
at the time of the decision to convene the CARB. Teleconferencing, if 
utilized,

[[Page 158]]

will be specified in the notice to the carrier.
    (4) Minutes of CARB hearings may be recorded or summarized and will 
be maintained with all other records pertaining to the CARB proceeding.
    (5) The CARB recorder shall ensure that the air carrier and 
appropriate DOD agencies are notified of the CARB's decision and reasons 
therefor.
    (h) CARB operating procedures--(1) Temporary nonuse. (i) In case of 
a fatal aircraft accident or for other good cause, the two senior 
members of the CARB (see paragraph (g)(1) of this section) will jointly 
make an immediate determination whether to place the carrier involved in 
a temporary nonuse status pending suspension proceedings. Prior notice 
to the carrier is not required.
    (ii) Such determination shall include consideration of the advice of 
the DOD Commercial Airlift Review Committee, if reasonably available, 
but will not await such advice.
    (iii) The carrier shall be promptly notified of the temporary nonuse 
determination and the basis therefore.
    (iv) Temporary nonuse status terminates automatically if suspension 
proceedings are not commenced, as set out in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of 
this section, within 30 days of inception, unless otherwise agreed to 
per paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (2) Suspension: (i) On a recommendation of the DOD Air Carrier 
Survey and Analysis Directorate, the DOD Commercial Airlift Review 
Committee, or any individual member of the CARB, the CARB shall consider 
whether or not to suspend a carrier.
    (ii) If the CARB determines that suspension may be appropriate, it 
shall notify the carrier that suspension action is under consideration 
and of the basis for such consideration and offer the carrier a hearing 
thereon within 15 days of the date of the notice, or such other period 
as granted by the CARB, at which the carrier may be present and may 
offer evidence. The presiding member of the CARB shall establish 
procedures for such hearing as may be appropriate which shall be as 
informal as practicable, consistent with administrative due process.
    (iii) Types of evidence which may be considered, if appropriate, 
shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
    (A) Information and analysis provided by the DOD Air Carrier Survey 
and Analysis Directorate.
    (B) Carrier's written/oral evidence.
    (C) Corrective actions that may have been taken by the carrier to:
    (1) Correct the specific deficiencies that led the CARB to consider 
suspension, and
    (2) Preclude recurring similar deficiencies.
    (D) Such other matters as the CARB deems relevant.
    (E) The CARB's decisions on the reception or exclusion of evidence 
shall be final.
    (iv) Carriers shall have the burden of proving their suitability to 
safely perform DOD airlift services by clear and convincing evidence.
    (v) After the conclusion of such hearing, or if no hearing is 
requested and attended by the carrier within the time specified by the 
CARB, the CARB shall consider the matter and make a final decision 
whether or not to suspend the carrier or to impose such lesser sanction 
as is appropriate. The carrier shall be notified of the CARB's decision.
    (3) Reinstatement: (i) The CARB may consider reinstating a suspended 
carrier on either CARB motion or carrier motion, unless such carrier has 
become ineligible in the interim.
    (ii) The carrier has the burden of proving by clear and convincing 
evidence that the reinstatement considerations in paragraph (f) of this 
section have been satisfied.
    (iii) Carrier evidence in support of reinstatement will be provided 
in a timely manner to the CARB for its review. The CARB may 
independently corroborate the carrier-provided evidence and may, at its 
option, convene a hearing and request the participation of the carrier.
    (i) Decision by others. In the event the CARB is unable to decide an 
issue properly before it, or if the issue in the judgment of the CARB 
requires review at a DOD organizational level higher than the CARB, the 
issue will be referred to the Commander, AMC, and Commander, MTMC, for 
appropriate

[[Page 159]]

disposition. In such event, the decision will be made upon the written 
record only, no hearing will be held.
    (j) Appeal of a determination. (1) A carrier placed in suspension 
may administratively appeal this action to the authorities shown in 
paragraph (j)(3) of this section. An appeal, if any, must be filed 
within 15 work days after receipt of the decision of the CARB or 
Commander, AMC, and Commander, MTMC. The suspension will not be stayed 
pending appeal unless for good cause, as determined by the CARB. The 
decision of the appellate authority designated herein is final and is 
not subject to further administrative review or appeal.
    (2) An appeal will be in writing only and carriers shall not be 
entitled to a de novo hearing before the administrative appellate 
authorities.
    (3) The following administrative appellate authorities will review 
and make decisions on appeals:
    (i) When the decision being appealed was made by the CARB, the 
appellate authorities are Commander, AMC, and Commander, MTMC. They will 
jointly decide the appeal.
    (ii) When Commander, AMC, and Commander, MTMC, are unable to jointly 
agree on an appeal, they shall refer the matter to the DOD Commercial 
Airlift Review Authority (CARA) for its decision.
    (iii) When the decision being appealed was made by Commander, AMC, 
and Commander, MTMC, the appellate authority is the DOD CARA.

<R05>
Sec. 863.0  Purpose.

    This part outlines United States Air Force (USAF) policies and 
procedures for leasing USAF aircraft and related equipment to 
nongovernment organizations (such as, American manufacturers) under 10 
U.S.C. 2667. The intended uses of the leased assets might include, but 
are not necessarily limited to, participation in national and 
international trade or air shows, foreign military sales or direct 
foreign sales demonstrations, independent research and development 
efforts by defense firms, and direct or indirect support of United 
States Government (USG) contracts. This part does not apply to

[[Page 160]]

military leases of USG property to foreign governments or international 
organizations (such as, North Atlantic Treaty Organization) under 
Chapter 6 of the Arms Export Control Act. This part establishes the 
responsibilities for evaluating lease requests, obtaining approvals, and 
negotiating and administering the lease agreements. This part applies to 
the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, the Air Staff, Air Force 
Systems Command (AFSC), and Air Force Logistics Command (AFLC). This 
part requires coordination with the USAF operational commands, the Air 
Force Reserve, and the Air National Guard when their assets are under 
consideration for lease. It implements DOD Instructions 7230.7, January 
29, 1985 (32 CFR part 288), and 7230.8, June 9, 1976.


<R04>
                 Subpart A--Policy and Responsibilities


<R05>
Sec. 863.1  Leasing policy.

    10 U.S.C. 2667 provides the Secretary of the Air Force the authority 
to lease assets under the control of the USAF to nongovernment 
organizations. When the Secretary considers it advantageous for the 
United States, leases may be approved under such terms and conditions 
the Secretary considers will promote the national defense or be in the 
public interest. The statute provides that the property must be under 
the control of the department; not for the time needed for public use; 
and not excess property. Typically, the USAF does not lease assets which 
are otherwise available from commercial sources.


<R05>
Sec. 863.2  SAF/AQ responsibilities.

    (a) The Secretary of the Air Force delegated the statutory authority 
to approve leases to the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for 
Acquisition (SAF/AQ). Since final leasing authority rests at the 
secretariat level, field and staff elements must take care not to 
preempt or prejudice the Secretary's authority to determine whether a 
proposed lease is advantageous to the United States and what terms and 
conditions will be considered as promoting the national defense or being 
in the public interest.
    (b) SAF/AQ determines whether a lease request from a nongovernment 
organization or from a command on behalf of a nongovernment organization 
meets the general guidelines of this part. Furthermore, SAF/AQ ensures 
that the Air Staff (HQ USAF/LE, PR, XO, CC), the Office of the Secretary 
of the Air Force (SAF/AC, PA, GC), Defense Security Assistance Agency 
(DSAA), and USAF operational commands, the Air Force Reserve, or Air 
National Guard when their assets are potential lease candidates have 
coordinated, as necessary, before recommending that SAF/AQ sign a 
Determination and Finding (D&F). This document designates which command, 
normally AFSC or AFLC, will negotiate and execute the lease agreement 
and outlines the basic terms and conditions which must be contained in 
the lease. SAF/AQ makes the determination if it is unclear whether AFSC 
or AFLC should assume a particular leasing action. The determination and 
finding format for authority to lease United States government property 
is shown below.

                    Determination and Finding Format

    The Department of the Air Force (USAF) proposes to lease aircraft to 
     for a      period. (Describe the details of the proposed lease 
activity.) As consideration for the lease, the lease will contain the 
following additional terms and conditions:
    (1) The leased property shall not be transferred, encumbered, or 
used for other purposes without the written consent of the Secretary of 
the Air Force.
    (2) The leased property shall be furnished ``as is'' without any 
warranty, express or implied, as to serviceability, fitness for use, or 
other matters.
    (3) The lessee shall pay the United States Government (USG) all 
rent, costs, and charges associated with the use of the leased property 
while under lease according to 32 CFR part 288 and this Determination 
and Finding.
    (4) The lessee shall maintain the leased property during the term of 
the lease in a safe and serviceable condition according to prescribed 
USAF standards or pay the full cost of any such maintenance accomplished 
by the USG.
    (5) Support provided by the USG, if any, shall be on a 
noninterference, reimbursable basis, including use of support aircraft, 
equipment, and facilities. The availability of such support, and the 
computation of any associated charges or costs, will be according

[[Page 161]]

to applicable Department of Defense directives and instructions and USAF 
regulations and manuals.
    (6) The lessee shall be responsible for all costs relating to the 
leased property during the term of the lease including, without 
limitation, expenses of operation, maintenance, display, demonstration, 
ferrying, transportation, support, and protection.
    (7) The lessee shall not include any charges or costs resulting from 
the lease authorized hereby directly or indirectly in any USG contract, 
except to the extent authorized under the Federal Acquisition 
Regulations.
    Optional (7) Except as otherwise authorized under the Federal 
Acquisition Regulations, the lessee shall not include any charges or 
costs resulting from the lease authorized hereby directly or indirectly 
in any USG contract except for DOD contracts expressly requiring use of 
the leased property and then only to the extent that such costs are 
properly allocable to such contracts and reimbursable according to the 
terms thereof. Costs charged to the USG respecting the leased property 
under any such contracts will not exceed the lessee's costs under the 
lease.
    (8) The lessee shall assume the risk of loss, damage, or destruction 
to the leased property. The risk will be covered by insurance on the 
depreciated value of the property or, with the USG's approval, the 
lessee may be self-insured.
    (9) The lessee shall indemnify and hold the USG, its agents, 
officers, and employees harmless from any and all loss and liability 
(whether in tort or contract) which might arise in connection with the 
lease because of: (a) Injury or death of personnel of the USG, the 
lessee, or third parties; and (b) damage to or destruction of property 
of the lessee or third parties, and leased property, support equipment, 
or other property of the USG. The lessee shall obtain insurance adequate 
to cover all such liabilities.
    (10) The lessee shall return all leased property to the USAF, at 
such place as is designated by the contracting officer, in the same 
condition as when accepted, fair wear and tear expected. If the USAF 
determines that any of the leased property was not returned in such 
condition, or has not been maintained according to prescribed USAF 
standards, the lessee shall reimburse the USAF for the cost of returning 
such property to its proper condition.
    Optional (10) The lessee shall return all leased property to the 
USAF, at such place as is designated by the contracting officer, in the 
same condition and configuration as when accepted, fair wear and tear 
expected. If the USAF determines that any of the leased property was not 
returned in such condition or configuration, or has not been maintained 
according to prescribed USAF standards, the lessee shall reimburse the 
USAF for the cost of returning such property to its proper condition and 
pre-lease configuration.
    (11) The lease may be revocable by the USAF at any time. The lease 
may be terminated by the lessee at any time upon 15 days prior written 
notice, subject to the lessee's residual responsibilities under the 
lease (to return leased property, to pay all costs resulting from the 
lease, to indemnify and hold harmless the USG, etc.).
    (12) The lessee shall assume responsibility that may be imposed by 
other Government agencies for certification and registration of the 
leased property and for payment of any taxes or other charges thereon.
    Optional (13) During the term of the lease, the lease status of the 
leased property may be interrupted from time to time by the USAF and the 
property made available for other USG activities under USG contracts 
with the lessee. During such periods, the property will revert to 
Government-Furnished Property status under the applicable USG contract. 
Any doubt as to the status of the leased property at any particular time 
will be resolved in favor of lease status.
    Optional (14) The lessee shall secure necessary Defense Security 
Assistance Agency and State Department clearances prior to commencement 
of any demonstration or evaluation flights for representatives of 
foreign governments.
    Optional (15) Orientation flights for United States Congressional 
and news media representatives and orientation and evaluation flights 
for foreign nationals shall be subject to approval according to 
Department of Defense Regulation 4515.13R.
    Optional (16) The lessee planning to fly leased aircraft at the air 
show shall prepare an air show plan for the USAF's approval which 
provides information on: scheduled use of the leased property; 
qualifications and duties of lessee personnel attending the air show; 
intended and contingency flight profiles; provisions for ensuring 
adequate preflight crew rest and for ensuring proper preflight briefings 
and postflight debriefings; and provisions for obtaining a visual 
record, and flight data recorder coverage (if aircraft is so equipped) 
of practice and show flight demonstrations, and orientation flights. USG 
approval of, or involvement in, such plan shall not diminish the 
lessee's assumption of risk of loss and liability in connection with the 
lease.
    Pursuant to title 10, United States Code, section 2667, I find that 
the property to be leased is under the control of the USAF; it is not 
excess property as defined by section 472 of title 40, United States 
Code; but it is not for the time needed for public use. I consider the 
above described lease of such property to be advantageous to the United 
States and such terms to be in the public interest.

    The Commander,           , or designee, is authorized to execute a 
lease according to this Determination and Finding.


<R05>
Sec. 863.3  AFSC responsibilities.

    AFSC evaluates lease requests, determines asset availability, and 
negotiates approved leases. When a prospective lessee desires to lease 
an asset being acquired or managed by a System Program Office (SPO), 
that SPO evaluates the lease request, makes its recommendation to HQ 
AFSC/PKC, and negotiates the lease agreement, if approved by SAF/AQ.


<R05>
Sec. 863.4  AFLC responsibilities.

    AFLC evaluates lease requests, determines asset availability, and 
negotiates approved leases. When a prospective lessee requests the lease 
of an asset managed by AFLC or an asset under the control of any of the 
USAF operational commands, the AFLC Air Logistics Center (ALC) most 
familiar with the asset evaluates the lease request and makes its 
recommendation to HQ AFLC/PM. The Wright-Patterson Contracting Center 
(WPCC) negotiates the lease agreement, if approved by SAF/AQ.


<R04>
                  Subpart B--Basic Terms and Conditions


<R05>
Sec. 863.5  Authorized uses.

    The lease agreement will specify what uses may be made of the leased 
property. The authorized uses of the leased property need not support a 
USG contract or requirement. The lease may limit or specify the location 
of lease performance.


<R05>
Sec. 863.6  Lease charges.

    (a) Lease charges are comprised of rent, reimbursement of any out of 
pocket expense to the USG, and other costs which the lessee must pay 
according to the terms of the lease. Pursuant to 32 CFR part 288, User 
Charges, rent must include charges for depreciation and interest on 
investment. These charges may be assessed on a daily, monthly, or yearly 
basis as determined appropriate by the cotnracting officer. For example, 
if the lease period is short term or if the leased property is being 
modified in such a way as to preclude its return to the USAF for 
immediate use to satisfy a USG mission requirement, charge rent during 
the entire lease term. However, if the lease period is long term and 
lease activities are actually intermittent rather than continuous, 
charge rent only during those times the leased property is actually in 
use by the lessee or unavailable for USAF use.

    (Note: Periods of use are defined in the lease.)

    (b) It may be appropriate to assess flying-hour charges if an 
aircraft is leased. Flying hour charges can be assessed for depot 
maintenance, replenishment spares, base support, etc., depending on the 
leasing situation. If an operational aircraft is leased, payment of 
depot maintenance and replenishment spares charges would be in order. If 
the lessee is authorized under the lease to obtain spare parts from the 
supply system, the lessee should either pay the spares flying-hour 
charges or reimburse the USG the cost of the spare part plus the cost of 
providing it.
    (c) Leases should include a charge for general and administrative 
expenses of the USG. The contracting officer should assess a charge of 
10 percent of all other lease charges to recoup the USG's general and 
administrative expenses.
    (d) SAF/ACCS sets depreciation, interest on investment, and flying-
hour charges. When the specific item to be leased is identified, these 
rates may be based on supplemental information from the SPO or ALC as to 
the property's acquisition cost, replacement cost, age, major 
modifications, salvage value, etc. When the specific item is not 
identified or actual costs are unknown, use reasonable estimates. The 
contracting officer is authorized to communicate directly with SAF/ACCS 
in determining rental charges. Also assess rent for pieces of support 
equipment which the lessee may require to support the major items of 
leased property. In such cases, SAF/ACCS may recommend the use of the 
rates set forth in the Use and Charges clause in the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation for rental computation.

[[Page 163]]

    (e) When the lease activity being pursued by the lessee is of 
particular interest to the USG, the contracting officer may arrange to 
receive a technical report from the lessee. The value of the report, as 
established by the contracting officer, can represent a credit against 
rental charges otherwise due under the lease. Such a credit must not 
exceed the rental charges owed by the lessee.


<R05>
Sec. 863.7  No cost to the USG.

    The lessee is responsible for all rent, costs and charges relating 
to the leased property during the lease. Generally, the lessee may not 
include any charges or costs resulting from the lease directly or 
indirectly in any USG contract or subcontract. Exceptions may be 
approved for contracts for foreign military sales, for independent 
research and development costs, international air show costs and in 
other limited cases where specific USG contracts or programs benefit 
from the lease activities or when otherwise authorized by law.


<R05>
Sec. 863.8  Risk of loss.

    The lessee must agree to assume the risk of loss, damage, or 
destruction of the leased property during the period of the lease. This 
applies when equipment or an aircraft is leased whether a lessee or USAF 
operator or pilot is operating the equipment or acting as pilot in 
command. The lessee must obtain insurance to cover the insurable value 
of the leased property, unless the contracting officer agrees that the 
lessee may be self-insured.


<R05>
Sec. 863.9  Indemnification of the USG.

    The lessee must agree to hold harmless and indemnify the USG, its 
agents, employees, and officers from any and all loss and liability. The 
lessee must obtain insurance adequate to cover all such liabilities.


<R05>
Sec. 863.10  Maintenance responsibilities.

    The lessee must maintain the leased property during the lease period 
according to standards established by the USG or pay the cost of 
maintenance accomplished by the USG.


<R05>
Sec. 863.11  Inspection responsibilities.

    The contracting officer should ensure appropriate inspections are 
performed by contract administration services personnel or others during 
lease performance and by the activity receiving the property after lease 
performance to determine whether the lessee maintained and leased 
property according to USAF standards.


<R05>
Sec. 863.12  USG support.

    Any support provided the lessee by the USG will be on a 
noninterference, cost-reimbursable basis. This applies to material, 
facilities, support aircraft, and crewmembers.


<R05>
Sec. 863.13  Terminating the lease agreement.

    The USG may terminate the lease at any time and at no cost. The 
lessee may terminate the lease upon prior written notice to the 
contracting officer and subject to its residual responsibilities under 
the lease (payment of charges, return of the leased property, etc.). In 
long-term leases it may be appropriate to provide for periodic 
interruptions of the lease so the leased property can be returned to the 
USG to satisfy its requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 863.14  DSAA and State Department approvals.

    When a lessee poroposes to demonstrate the leased property to 
representatives of foreign governments or international organizations or 
to participate in international air shows, the lessee must secure DSAA 
approval and obtain export license clearance from the State Department. 
If the lessee knows the details of the proposed demonstration or 
evaluation at the time the lease request is submitted, SAF/AQ will 
obtain DSAA coordination when processing the lease request to the SAF/AQ 
for approval. If these details are unknown at the time of the lease 
request, then the lessee must obtain DSAA approval by separate request 
through HQ USAF/PRI (Directorate of International Programs) channels.


<R05>
Sec. 863.15  Flights for dignitaries.

    The lessee must get prior approval for flights if one of the 
authorized uses of a leased aircraft is orientation

[[Page 164]]

flights for foreign nationals or dignitaries, including members of 
Congress and representatives of the US news media (see DOD Regulation 
4515.13R).


<R05>
Sec. 863.16  Air show participation plan clause.

    Leases authorizing participation in an international air show must 
contain a provision requiring the lessee to obtain prior USAF approval 
of its plans for conducting flight operations and providing adequate 
crew rest. The provision also requires the lessee to describe its 
demonstration flight profiles. Leases for international air shows 
require compliance with part 862 of this chapter. The Air Show 
Participation Plan clause is shown below.

                   Air Show Participation Plan Clause

    (a) Prior to any flight performed for demonstration, exhibition, 
practice, or evaluation purposes at a scheduled international air show 
as authorized elsewhere in this lease, the Lessee shall obtain the 
approval of the Director of Operations and Readiness, Headquarters, USAF 
(AF/XOO), for an Air Show Participation Plan covering the following:
    (1) Detailed schedule of planned use of the leased aircraft.
    (2) The name (or names) and qualifications of the pilot (or pilots) 
who are scheduled to fly the aircraft in practice, deployment or 
redeployment, and air show flights.
    (3) Specific information on the qualifications of other crewmembers 
who may be needed.
    (4) The names, qualifications, and exact duties of contractor 
supervisory personnel who may take part in any way in the management and 
control of the USAF aircraft while it is leased.
    (5) The intended flight profiles planned for:
    (i) Favorable weather conditions (specify favorable weather 
conditions for subject aircraft).
    (ii) Weather conditions less than favorable but above the air show 
minimums, AFRs 60-16 and 60-18, and the aircraft handbook (Technical 
Order) limitations.
    (iii) Alternate modified profiles for both weather conditions that 
would be flown if air show authorities limit flight time due to 
scheduling problems.
    (6) Provisions for ensuring adequate preflight crew rest for the 
pilot (or pilots) and other crewmembers. This must include the way in 
which the flightcrews (pilots) will be isolated from potential marketing 
or other pressures that may be expected in the internal air show 
environment.
    (7) Specific schedule and attendees at preflight planning, preflight 
briefings, and postflight debriefings.
    (8) Provisions for providing a visual record of all practice flights 
and air show demonstrations (16mm film or three-fourth inch video tape).
    (9) Provisions for providing maximum flight data recorder coverage 
(if subject aircraft is normally flight data recorder equipped) of all 
practice flights and air show flight demonstrations.
    (10) Provisions for ensuring the pilot who flies the aircraft wears 
suitable flight clothing for maneuvers to be performed (such as, anti-g 
suit).
    (11) The Air Show Participation Plan as submitted for such required 
approval shall specify each nonstandard configuration of the aircraft to 
be leased and shall list each item of equipment or stores intended to be 
incorporated in or used to support the leased aircraft that is not part 
of the USAF standard equipment or approved stores list.
    (b) Lessee's initial proposal and any revised proposals for such Air 
Show Participation Plan are to be submitted to the cognizant Systems 
Program Office or Plant Representative Office according to part 862 of 
this chapter.
    (c) The provisions of such Air Show Participation Plan as so 
approved shall be complied with by the Lessee as regards all air show 
demonstrations, exhibition, and evaluation flights performed with the 
leased property during the term of this lease, at or in the general 
vicinity of the air show location, and shall also be complied with 
regarding all practice and pilot qualification flights performed during 
the term of this lease in preparation for such demonstration, 
exhibition, or evaluation flights.
    (d) The Lessee shall permit the Contract Monitor or a delegate, as 
appointed by the United States Government (USG) for this lease, to 
monitor air show participation under this lease, and to have access to 
the leased aircraft during the entire period of air show participation 
and during all periods of practice or qualification for such air show 
participation as authorized under this lease, together with access to 
the maintenance and staging areas used for such participation or 
practice.
    (e) The Contract Monitor shall be considered an element of USAF 
support, the costs of which are charged to the Lessee as lease support 
costs.
    (f) The Lessee shall submit to the Contracting Officer, within 
thirty days after the completion of such air show participation 
authorized under this lease, a lease completion report outlining and 
explaining any problems encountered in and during the performance of the 
lease as regards such aircraft practice and participation flights, 
together with recommended procedures and

[[Page 165]]

procedural changes to improve the safety of USAF aircraft leased for air 
show participation under future leases. If no such problems are 
encountered, a negative report shall be submitted. The Lessee shall 
also, upon the written request of the Contracting Officer, and at no 
cost to the USG under this lease, provide the USG with copies 
(duplicate) of all visual record and of the flight recorder data of all 
practice flights and air show demonstrations as called for in the 
foregoing paragraphs.
    (g) The Lessee shall also advise the cognizant System Program 
Director of its proposed participation in static displays or flights 
demonstrations at the air show, and shall ensure that appropriate Lessee 
personnel are available, at the time and place designated by the System 
Program Director, to receive a cautionary prebriefing on the military 
security requirements and other sensitive areas related to the leased 
aircraft and equipment.
    (h) It is mutually understood and agreed that the sole purpose of 
this clause is to give the USG full knowledge of the intended use of the 
leased property and an opportunity to observe the Lessee's compliance 
with its proposed plan. Lessee acknowledges and agrees that the USG 
makes no warranty that the approve plan is safe and that the USG assumes 
no risk of loss or liability to third parties that may arise despite the 
Lessee's adherence to the approve plan. This clause creates no 
exceptions to the Lessee's obligations to assume risk of loss and third 
party liability, including obtaining insurance, as set out fully in the 
clauses elsewhere in this lease.


<R04>
                Subpart C--Lease Requests and Evaluation


<R05>
Sec. 863.17  Request initiation.

    The prospective lessee initiates the lease request and submits it to 
the appropriate SPO or ALC responsible for the items described under the 
lease. The lease request must contain, as a minimum, the following 
information:
    (a) Identification of the property to be leased (including tail 
numbers or part numbers, if known).
    (b) Purpose of the lease.
    (c) Proposed start date and duration.
    (d) Proposed location(s) of the lease activity.
    (e) Expected benefits to the lessee.
    (f) Expected benefits to the USG.
    (g) Statement as to nonavailability of suitable commercial items.
    (h) Other pertinent facts (flights for dignitaries, for example).


<R05>
Sec. 863.18  SPO or ALC.

    When the SPO or ALC receives a request to lease USAF assets, they 
evaluate the request for the benefits to the USG and the lessee and the 
availability of the property during the proposed lease period. Also, 
they address the appropriateness of the intended use of the property and 
any limitations on reservations which should be imposed on such use. If 
the property requested for lease is assigned to an operational command, 
the SPO or ALC coordinates with that command then sends the request 
through contracting channels to command headquarters.


<R05>
Sec. 863.19  HQ AFSC or HQ AFLC.

    Command headquarters review each lease request and prepare a draft 
Secretarial D&F. The command then forwards the lease package consisting 
of the lease request, the D&F, and other supporting data with an 
endorsement to SAF/AQC for approval. The command forwards lease packages 
requesting participation in an international air show to HQ USAF/XOO 
(with an information copy to SAF/AQC).


<R04>
              Subpart D--Coordination and Approval Process


<R05>
Sec. 863.20  Air Staff coordination.

    Coordination requirements depend on the intended use of the leased 
items and whether the items are developmental or operational. SAF/AQC 
coordinates with HQ USAF/XOO, PRI, and LEY, as necessary. SAF/AQC 
coordinates with HQ USAF/PRP on the use of aerospace vehicles counted in 
the USAF inventory. If the proposed lease is for participation in an 
international air show, follow part 862 of this chapter.

    Note: HQ USAF/XOO approves the lessee's international air show 
plans, including flight profiles. HQ USAF/PRI coordinates on requests 
involving demonstrations of leased property to representatives of 
foreign governments.


<R05>
Sec. 863.21  Secretariat approval process.

    Secretariat coordination and approval involves offices of diverse 
responsibilities. SAF/PA coordinates on

[[Page 166]]

air show lease requests. SAF/ACCS reviews all requests and provides 
rental charge guidance to the contracting officer. The DSAA approves all 
requests involving potential sales to foreign governments and 
organizations. In all cases SAF/GC reviews lease requests and D&Fs. SAF/
AQ gives final approval on all lease requests.


<R05>
Sec. 863.22  Processing time.

    The coordination and approval process for a routine lease request 
usually takes four weeks. Prospective lessees and the commands should 
plan on a minimum of four weeks for approval of the D&F once a lease 
request reaches the SAF/AQC. Lease requests received with insufficient 
lead time may be returned without action.


<R04>
             Subpart E--Lease Negotiation and Administration


<R05>
Sec. 863.23  AFSC lease negotiation.

    The AFSC SPO responsible for an item which is approved for lease 
must negotiate the lease according to the signed D&F. The office which 
negotiates a lease is also responsible for amending it and recommending 
renewal, if appropriate. The SPO is also responsible for working with 
SAF/ACCS to determine the appropriate lease charges.


<R05>
Sec. 863.24  AFLC lease negotiation.

    WPCC negotiates leases of equipment no longer being acquired by 
AFSC. WPPC also amends leases and recommends renewal, if appropriate. 
The Secretarial D&F sets the basic terms and conditions which must be 
incorporated into the lease. WPCC works with SAF/ACCS to establish the 
proper lease charges.


<R05>
Sec. 863.25  Delegation of lease administration.

    After negotiation, the SPO or WPCC delegates the lease to the 
cognizant contract administration office for administration. However, if 
the lease is to be performed overseas, the contracting officer may 
retain administration.


<R05>
Sec. 863.26  Lessee compliance.

    The contract administration activity must make sure that the lessee 
is complying with all the terms and conditions of the lease. The lessee 
must follow maintenance requirements, obtain necessary approvals keep 
use records upon which rental charges may be calculated, and pay rental 
and other charges according to the lease agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 863.27  Lessee payments.

    Payments for rental (including depreciation and interest on 
investment) must be returned to miscellaneous receipts of the US 
Treasury. Payments for flying-hour charges and reimbursement for support 
or services provided by the USG may be credited to the appropriation of 
the activity to which the leased property is assigned or which provided 
the support or service. If the lessee is authorized to obtain material 
from the supply system, it can only be provided on an as available, 
reimbursable basis. The contracting officer provides instructions to the 
lessee and appropriate accounting and finance office on handling 
payments.

<R04>
      Subpart A--Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records

    Source: 61 FR 16047, Apr. 11, 1996, unless otherwise noted.
    Authority: 10 U.S.C. 1034, 1552.


<R05>
Sec. 865.0   Purpose.

    This subpart sets up procedures for correction of military records 
to remedy error or injustice. It tells how to apply for correction of 
military records and how the Air Force Board for Correction of Military 
Records (AFBCMR, or the Board) considers applications. It defines the 
Board's authority to act on applications. It directs collecting and 
maintaining information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 authorized by 
10 U.S.C. 1034 and 1552. System of Records notice F035 SAFCB A, Military 
Records Processed by the Air Force Correction Board, applies.


<R05>
Sec. 865.1  Setup of the Board.

    The AFBCMR operates within the Office of the Secretary of the Air 
Force according to 10 U.S.C. 1552. The Board consists of civilians in 
the executive part of the Department of the Air Force who are appointed 
and serve at the pleasure of the Secretary of the Air Force. Three 
members constitute a quorum of the Board.


<R05>
Sec. 865.2  Board responsibilities.

    (a) Considering applications. The Board considers all individual 
applications properly brought before it. In appropriate cases, it 
directs correction of military records to remove an error or injustice, 
or recommends such correction.
    (b) Recommending action. When an applicant alleges reprisal under 
the Military Whistleblowers Protection Act, 10 U.S.C. 1034, the Board 
may recommend to the Secretary of the Air Force that disciplinary or 
administrative action be taken against those responsible for the 
reprisal.
    (c) Deciding cases.  The Board normally decides cases on the 
evidence of the record. It is not an investigative body. However, the 
Board may, in its

[[Page 168]]

discretion, hold a hearing or call for additional evidence or opinions 
in any case.


<R05>
Sec. 865.3  Application procedures.

    (a) Who may apply:
    (1) In most cases, the applicant is a member or former member of the 
Air Force, since the request is personal to the applicant and relates to 
his or her military records.
    (2) An applicant with a proper interest may request correction of 
another person's military records when that person is incapable of 
acting on his or her own behalf, is missing, or is deceased. Depending 
on the circumstances, a child, spouse, parent or other close relative, 
an heir, or a legal representative (such as a guardian or executor) of 
the member or former member may be able to show a proper interest. 
Applicants will send proof of proper interest with the application when 
requesting correction of another person's military records.
    (b) Getting forms. Applicants may get a DD Form 149, ``Application 
for Correction of Military Record Under the Provisions of Title 10, 
U.S.C., Section 1552,'' and Air Force Pamphlet 36-2607, ``Applicants' 
Guide to the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records 
(AFBCMR),'' from:
    (1) Any Air Force Military Personnel Flight (MPF) or publications 
distribution office.
    (2) Most veterans' service organizations.
    (3) The Air Force Review Boards Office, SAF/MIBR, 550 C Street West, 
Suite 40, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4742.
    (4) The AFBCMR, 1535 Command Drive, EE Wing 3rd Floor, Andrews AFB 
MD 20331-7002.
    (c) Preparation. Before applying, applicants should:
    (1) Review Air Force Pamphlet 36-2607.
    (2) Discuss their concerns with MPF, finance office, or other 
appropriate officials. Errors can often be corrected administratively 
without resort to the Board.
    (3) Exhaust other available administrative remedies (otherwise the 
Board may return the request without considering it).
    (d) Submitting the application. Applicants should complete all 
applicable sections of the DD Form 149, including at least:
    (1) The name under which the member served.
    (2) The member's social security number or Air Force service number.
    (3) The applicant's current mailing address.
    (4) The specific records correction being requested.
    (5) Proof of proper interest if requesting correction of another 
person's records.
    (6) The applicant's signature.
    (e) Applicants should mail the original signed DD Form 149 and any 
supporting documents to the Air Force address on the back of the form.
    (f) Meeting time limits. Ordinarily, applicants must file an 
application within three years after the error or injustice was 
discovered, or, with due diligence, should have been discovered. An 
application filed later is untimely and may be denied by the Board on 
that basis.
    (1) The Board may excuse untimely filing in the interest of justice.
    (2) If the application is filed late, applicants should explain why 
it would be in the interest of justice for the Board to waive the time 
limits.
    (g) Stay of other proceedings. Applying to the AFBCMR does not stay 
other proceedings.
    (h) Counsel representation. Applicants may be represented by 
counsel, at their own expense.
    (1) The term ``counsel'' includes members in good standing of the 
bar of any state, accredited representatives of veterans' organizations 
recognized under 38 U.S.C. 3402, and other persons determined by the 
Executive Director of the Board to be competent to represent the 
interests of the applicant.
    (2) See Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) 7050.6, Whistleblower 
Protection Act, 3 September 1992,<SUP>1</SUP> for special provisions for 
counsel in cases processed under 10 U.S.C. 1034.

<R05>
Sec. 865.4  Board actions.

    (a) Board information sources. The applicant has the burden of 
providing sufficient evidence of probable material error or injustice. 
However, the Board:
    (1) May get additional information and advisory opinions on an 
application from any Air Force organization or official.
    (2) May require the applicant to furnish additional information 
necessary to decide the case.
    (b) Applicants will normally be given an opportunity to review and 
comment on advisory opinions and additional information obtained by the 
Board.
    (c) Consideration by the Board. A panel consisting of at least three 
board members considers each application. One panel member serves as its 
chair. The panel's actions and decisions constitute the actions and 
decisions of the Board.
    (d) The panel may decide the case in executive session or authorize 
a hearing. When a hearing is authorized, the procedures in paragraph (f) 
of this section apply.
    (e) Board deliberations. Normally only members of the Board and 
Board staff will be present during deliberations. The panel chair may 
permit observers for training purposes or otherwise in furtherance of 
the functions of the Board.
    (f) Board hearings. The Board in its sole discretion determines 
whether to grant a hearing. Applicants do not have a right to a hearing 
before the Board.
    (g) The Executive Director will notify the applicant or counsel, if 
any, of the time and place of the hearing. Written notice will be mailed 
thirty days in advance of the hearing unless the notice period is waived 
by the applicant. The applicant will respond not later than fifteen days 
before the hearing date, accepting or declining the offer of a hearing 
and, if accepting, provide information pertaining to counsel and 
witnesses. The Board will decide the case in executive session if the 
applicant declines the hearing or fails to appear.
    (h) When granted a hearing, the applicant may appear before the 
Board in person, represented by counsel, or in person with counsel and 
may present witnesses. It is the applicant's responsibility to notify 
witnesses, arrange for their attendance at the hearing, and pay any 
associated costs.
    (i) The panel chair conducts the hearing, maintains order, and 
ensures the applicant receives a full and fair opportunity to be heard. 
Formal rules of evidence do not apply, but the panel observes reasonable 
bounds of competency, relevancy, and materiality. Witnesses other than 
the applicant will not be present except when testifying. Witnesses will 
testify under oath or affirmation. A recorder will record the 
proceedings verbatim. The chair will normally limit hearings to two 
hours but may allow more time if necessary to ensure a full and fair 
hearing.
    (j) Additional provisions apply to cases processed under 10 U.S.C. 
1034. See DoDD 7050.6.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ See footnote 1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (k) The Board will not deny or recommend denial of an application on 
the sole ground that the issue already has been decided by the Secretary 
of the Air Force or the President of the United States in another 
proceeding.
    (l) Board decisions. The panel's majority vote constitutes the 
action of the Board. The Board's decision will be in writing and will 
include determinations on the following issues:
    (1) Whether the provisions of the Military Whistleblowers Protection

[[Page 170]]

Act apply to the application. This determination is needed only when the 
applicant invokes the protection of the Act, or when the question of its 
applicability is otherwise raised by the evidence.
    (2) Whether the application was timely filed and, if not, whether 
the applicant has demonstrated that it would be in the interest of 
justice to excuse the untimely filing. When the Board determines that an 
application is not timely, and does not excuse its untimeliness, the 
application will be denied on that basis.
    (3) Whether the applicant has exhausted all available and effective 
administrative remedies. If the applicant has not, the application will 
be denied on that basis.
    (4) Whether the applicant has demonstrated the existence of a 
material error or injustice that can be remedied effectively through 
correction of the applicant's military record and, if so, what 
corrections are needed to provide full and effective relief.
    (5) In Military Whistleblowers Protection Act cases only, whether to 
recommend to the Secretary of the Air Force that disciplinary or 
administrative action be taken against any Air Force official whom the 
Board finds to have committed an act of reprisal against the applicant. 
Any determination on this issue will not be made a part of the Board's 
record of proceedings and will not be given to the applicant, but will 
be provided directly to the Secretary of the Air Force under separate 
cover (Sec. 865.2(b)).
    (m) Record of proceedings. The Board staff will prepare a record of 
proceedings following deliberations which will include:
    (1) The name and vote of each Board member.
    (2) The application.
    (3) Briefs and written arguments.
    (4) Documentary evidence.
    (5) A hearing transcript if a hearing was held.
    (6) Advisory opinions and the applicant's related comments.
    (7) The findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the Board.
    (8) Minority reports, if any.
    (9) Other information necessary to show a true and complete history 
of the proceedings.
    (n) Minority reports. A dissenting panel member may prepare a 
minority report which may address any aspect of the case.
    (o) Separate communications. The Board may send comments or 
recommendations to the Secretary of the Air Force as to administrative 
or disciplinary action against individuals found to have committed acts 
of reprisal prohibited by the Military Whistleblowers Protection Act and 
on other matters arising from an application not directly related to the 
requested correction of military records. Such comments and 
recommendations will be separately communicated and will not be included 
in the record of proceedings or given to the applicant or counsel.
    (p) Final action by the Board. The Board acts for the Secretary of 
the Air Force and its decision is final when it:
    (1) Denies any application (except under 10 U.S.C. 1034).
    (2) Grants any application in whole or part when the relief was 
recommended by the official preparing the advisory opinion, was 
unanimously agreed to by the panel, and does not involve an appointment 
or promotion requiring confirmation by the Senate.
    (q) The Board sends the record of proceedings on all other 
applications to the Secretary of the Air Force or his or her designee 
for final decision.


<R05>
Sec. 865.5  Decision of the Secretary of the Air Force.

    (a) The Secretary may direct such action as he or she deems 
appropriate on each case, including returning the case to the Board for 
further consideration. Cases returned to the Board for further 
reconsideration will be accompanied by a brief statement of the reasons 
for such action. If the Secretary does not accept the Board's 
recommendation, the decision will be in writing and will include a brief 
statement of the grounds for denial.
    (b) Decisions in cases under the Military Whistleblowers Protection 
Act. The Secretary will issue decisions on such cases within 180 days 
after receipt

[[Page 171]]

of the case and will, unless the full relief requested is granted, 
inform applicants of their right to request review of the decision by 
the Secretary of Defense (SecDef). Applicants will also be informed:
    (1) Of the name and address of the official to whom the request for 
review must be submitted.
    (2) That the request for review must be submitted within ninety days 
after receipt of the decision by the Secretary of the Air Force.
    (3) That the request for review must be in writing and include the 
applicant's name, address, and telephone number; a copy of the 
application to the AFBCMR and the final decision of the Secretary of the 
Air Force; and a statement of the specific reasons the applicant is not 
satisfied with the decision of the Secretary of the Air Force.
    (4) That the request must be based on the Board record; requests for 
review based on factual allegations or evidence not previously presented 
to the Board will not be considered under this section but may be the 
basis for reconsideration by the Board under Sec. 865.6.
    (c) Decisions in cases filed under Section 507, Public Law 103-160. 
The Secretary will issue a decision within 60 days of receipt of the 
case of an officer who:
    (1) Was offered the opportunity to be discharged or separated from 
active duty under the Voluntary Separation Incentive (VSI) or Special 
Separation Benefit (SSB) programs,
    (2) Elected not to accept such discharge or separation,
    (3) Was thereafter discharged or separated from active duty, after 
September 30, 1990, as a result of selection by a board convened to 
select officers for early separation (a ``RIF board''),
    (4) Files an application with the Board within two years of the date 
of separation or discharge, or one year after March 1, 1996, whichever 
is later, alleging that the officer was not effectively counseled, 
before electing not to accept discharge or separation under the VSI/SSB 
programs, concerning the officer's vulnerability to selection for 
involuntary discharge or separation (``RIF''), and
    (5) Requests expedited consideration under this section.
    (d) Upon finding of ineffective counseling, the Secretary will 
provide the officer with an opportunity to participate, at the officer's 
option, in the VSI or SSB programs or, if eligible, in an early 
retirement program.
    (e) In cases under Secs. 865.5(b) and 865.5(c) which involve 
additional issues not cognizable under those sections, the additional 
issues may be considered separately by the Board under Secs. 865.3 and 
865.4. The special time limits in Secs. 865.5(b) and 865.5(c) do not 
apply to the decision concerning these additional issues.


<R05>
Sec. 865.6  Reconsideration of applications.

    The Board may reconsider an application if the applicant submits 
newly discovered relevant evidence that was not available when the 
application was previously considered. The Executive Director will 
screen each request for reconsideration to determine whether it contains 
new evidence.
    (a) If the request contains new evidence, the Executive Director 
will refer it to a panel of the Board for a decision. The Board will 
decide the relevance and weight of any new evidence, whether it was 
reasonably available to the applicant when the application was 
previously considered, and whether it was submitted in a timely manner. 
The Board may deny reconsideration if the request does not meet the 
criteria for reconsideration. Otherwise the Board will reconsider the 
application and decide the case either on timeliness or merit as 
appropriate.
    (b) If the request does not contain new evidence, the Executive 
Director will return it to the applicant without referral to the Board.


<R05>
Sec. 865.7  Action after final decision.

    (a) Action by the Executive Director. The Executive Director will 
inform the applicant or counsel, if any, of the final decision on the 
application. If any requested relief was denied, the Executive Director 
will advise the applicant of reconsideration procedures and, for cases 
processed under the Military Whistleblowers Protection Act, review by 
the SecDef. The Executive Director will send decisions requiring 
corrective

[[Page 172]]

action to the Chief of Staff, U.S. Air Force, for necessary action.
    (b) Settlement of claims. The Air Force is authorized, under 10 
U.S.C. 1552, to pay claims for amounts due to applicants as a result of 
correction of military records.
    (c) The Executive Director will furnish the Defense Finance and 
Accounting Service (DFAS) with AFBCMR decisions potentially affecting 
monetary entitlement or benefits. DFAS will treat such decisions as 
claims for payment by or on behalf of the applicant.
    (d) DFAS settles claims on the basis of the corrected military 
record. Computation of the amount due, if any, is a function of DFAS. 
Applicants may be required to furnish additional information to DFAS to 
establish their status as proper parties to the claim and to aid in 
deciding amounts due.
    (e) Public access to decisions. After deletion of personal 
information, AFBCMR decisions will be made available for review and 
copying at a public reading room in the Washington, DC metropolitan 
area.


<R05>
Sec. 865.8  Miscellaneous provisions.

    (a) At the request of the Board, all Air Force activities and 
officials will furnish the Board with:
    (1) All available military records pertinent to an application.
    (2) An advisory opinion concerning an application. The advisory 
opinion will include an analysis of the facts of the case and of the 
applicant's contentions, a statement of whether or not the requested 
relief can be done administratively, and a recommendation on the 
timeliness and merit of the request. Regardless of the recommendation, 
the advisory opinion will include instructions on specific corrective 
action to be taken if the Board grants the application.
    (b) Access to records. Applicants will have access to all records 
considered by the Board, except those classified or privileged. To the 
extent practicable, applicants will be provided unclassified or 
nonprivileged summaries or extracts of such records considered by the 
Board.
    (c) Payment of expenses. The Air Force has no authority to pay 
expenses of any kind incurred by or on behalf of an applicant in 
connection with a correction of military records under 10 U.S.C. 1034 or 
1552.

the Department of the Air Force under section 301 of the Serviceman's 
Readjustment Act of 1944, as amended (now 10 U.S.C. 1553) and further

Sec. 865.103  Definition of terms.

    (a) Applicant. A former member of the Armed Forces who has been 
dismissed or discharged administratively in accordance with Military 
Department regulations or by sentence of a court-martial (other than a 
general court-martial) and under statutory regulatory provisions whose 
application is accepted by the DRB concerned or whose case is heard on 
the DRB's own motion. If the former member is deceased or incompetent, 
the term ``applicant'' includes the surviving spouse, next-of-kin, or 
legal representative who is acting on behalf of the former member. When 
the term ``applicant'' is used in this subpart, it includes the 
applicant's counsel or representative, except that the counsel or 
representative may not submit an application for review, waive the 
applicant's right to be present at a hearing, or terminate a review 
without providing the DRB an appropriate power of attorney or other 
written consent of the former member.
    (b) Complainant. A former member of the Armed Forces (or the former 
member's counsel) who submits a complaint in accordance with 
Sec. 865.121 of this subpart with respect to the decisional document 
issued in the former member's own case; or a former member of the Armed 
Forces (or the former member's counsel) who submits a complaint stating 
that correction of the decisional document will assist the former member 
in preparing for an administrative or judicial proceeding in which the 
former member's own discharge will be at issue.
    (c) Counsel or representative. An individual or agency designated by 
the applicant who agrees to represent the applicant in a case before the 
DRB. It includes, but is not limited to: a lawyer who is a member of the 
bar of a federal court or of the highest court of a state; an accredited 
representative designated by an organization recognized by the 
Administrator of Veterans Affairs; a representative from a state agency 
concerned with veterans affairs; and representatives from private 
organizations or local government agencies.
    (d) Discharge. A general term used in this subpart that includes 
dismissal and separation or release from active or inactive military 
status, and actions that accomplish a complete severance of all military 
status. This term also includes the assignment of a reason for such 
discharge and characterization of service.
    (e) Discharge review. The process by which the reason for 
separation, the procedures followed in accomplishing separation, and 
characterization of service are evaluated. This includes determinations 
made under the provisions of title 38 U.S.C. 3103(e)(2).

[[Page 174]]

    (f) Discharge Review Board (DRB). An administrative board 
constituted by the Secretary of the Air Force and vested with 
discretionary authority to review discharges and dismissals under the 
provisions of title 10 U.S.C. 1553.
    (g) Regional Discharge Review Board. A DRB that conducts discharge

records, and additional documents (if any) submitted by the applicant.
    (k) National Capital Region (NCR). The District of Columbia; Prince 
Georges and Montgomery Counties in Maryland; Arlington, Fairfax, 
Loudoun, and Prince William Counties in Virginia; and all cities and 
towns included within the outer boundaries of the foregoing counties.
    (l) Director, Air Force Personnel Council. The person designated by 
the Secretary of the Air Force who is responsible for the supervision of 
the Discharge Review function.


<R05>
Sec. 865.104  Secretarial responsibilities.

    The Secretary of the Air Force is responsible for the overall 
operation of the Discharge Review program within the Department of the 
Air Force. The following delegation of authority have been made:
    (a) To the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force 
(Manpower, Reserve Affairs and Installations) to act for the Secretary 
of the Air Force in all discharge review actions subject to review by 
the Secretary as specified in Sec. 865.113 of this subpart.
    (b) To the Director, Air Force Personnel Council, for operation of 
all phases of the discharge review function and authority to take action 
in the name of the Secretary of the Air Force in all discharge review 
actions except those specified in Sec. 865.113 of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 865.105  Jurisdiction and authority.

    The DRB has jurisdiction and authority in cases of former military 
personnel who, at the time of their separation from the Service, were 
members of the US Army Aviation components (Aviation Section, Signal 
Corps; Air Service; Air Corps; or Air Forces) prior to September 17, 
1947, or the US Air Force. The DRB does not have jurisdiction and 
authority concerning personnel of other armed services who at the time 
of their separation, were assigned to duty with the Army Air Forces or 
the US Air Force.
    (a) The DRB's review is based on the former member's available 
military records, issues submitted by the former member, or his counsel 
and on any other evidence that is presented to the DRB. The DRB 
determines whether the type of discharge or dismissal the former member 
received is equitable and proper; if not, the DRB instructs the USAF 
Manpower and Personnel Center (AFMPC) to change the discharge reason or 
to issue a new character of discharge according to the DRB's findings.
    (b) The DRB is not authorized to revoke any discharge, to reinstate 
any person who has been separated from the military service, or to 
recall any person to active duty.
    (c) The DRB, on its own motion, may review a case that appears 
likely to result in a decision favorable to the former military member, 
without the member's knowledge or presence. In this case, if the 
decision is:
    (1) Favorable, the DRB directs AFMPC to notify the former member 
accordingly at the member's last known address.
    (2) Unfavorable, the DRB returns the case to the files without any 
record of formal action; the DRB then reconsiders the case without 
prejudice in accordance with normal procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 865.106  Application for review.

    (a) General. Applications shall be submitted to the Air Force DRB on 
DD Form 293, Application for Review of Discharge or Dismissal from the 
Armed Forces of the United States (OMB Approval No. 0704-0004) with such 
other statements, affidavits, or documentation as desired. It is to the 
applicant's

[[Page 175]]

advantage to submit such documents with the application or within 60 
days thereafter in order to permit a thorough screening of the case. The 
DD Form 293 is available at most DOD installations and regional offices 
of the Veterans Administration, or by writing to: DA Military Review 
Boards Agency, Attention: SFBA (Reading Room), Room 1E520, The Pentagon, 
Washington, DC 20310.
    (b) Timing. A motion or request for review must be made within 15 
years after the date of discharge or dismissal.
    (c) Applicant's responsibilities. An applicant may request a change 
in the character of or reason for discharge (or both).
    (1) Character of discharge. DD Form 293 provides an applicant an 
opportunity to request a specific change in character of discharge (for 
example, General Discharge to Honorable Discharge; Under Other Than 
Honorable Conditions Discharge to General or Honorable Discharge). Only 
a person separated on or after 1 October 1982 while in an entry level 
status may request a change from other than an honorable discharge to 
Entry Level Separation. A request for review from an applicant who does 
not have an Honorable Discharge will be treated as a request for a 
change to an Honorable Discharge unless the applicant requests a 
specific change to another character of discharge.
    (2) Reason for discharge. DD Form 293 provides an applicant an 
opportunity to request a specific change in the reason for discharge. If 
an applicant does not request a specific change in the reason for 
discharge, the DRB will presume that the request for review does not 
involve a request for change in the reason for discharge. Under its 
responsibility to examine the propriety and equity of an applicant's 
discharge, the DRB will change the reason for discharge if such a change 
is warranted.
    (3) The applicant must ensure that issues submitted to the DRB are 
consistent with the request for change in discharge set forth in ``Board 
Action Requested'' of the DD Form 293. If an ambiguity is created by a 
difference between an applicant's issue and the requested action, the 
DRB will respond to the issue in the context of the action requested in 
``Board Action Requested.'' In the case of a Personal Appearance 
hearing, the DRB will attempt to resolve the ambiguity.
    (d) If the member is deceased or mentally incompetent, the spouse, 
next-of-kin, or legal representative may, as agent for the member, 
submit the application for the review along with proof of the member's 
death or mental incompetency.
    (e) Applicants forward their requests for review to the USAF 
Manpower and Personnel Center-mailing address: AFMPC/MPCDOA1, Randolph 
AFB TX 78150. AFMPC will obtain all available military records of the 
former members from the National Personnel Records Center.
    (f) Withdrawal of application. An applicant shall be permitted to 
withdraw an application without prejudice at any time before the 
scheduled review.
    (g) Submission of issues on DD Form 293. Issues must be provided to 
the DRB on DD Form 293 before the DRB closes the review process for 
deliberation and should be submitted in accordance with the guidelines 
of this subpart for submission of issues.
    (1) Issues must be clear and specific. An issue must be stated 
clearly and specifically in order to enable the DRB to understand the 
nature of the issue and its relationship to the applicant's discharge.
    (2) Separate listing of issues. Each issue submitted by an applicant 
should be listed separately. Submission of a separate statement for each 
issue provides the best means of ensuring that the full import of the 
issue is conveyed to the DRB.
    (3) Use of DD Form 293. DD Form 293 provides applicants with a 
standard format for submitting issues to the DRB, and its use:
    (i) Provides a means for an applicant to set forth clearly and 
specifically those matters that, in the opinion of the applicant, 
provide a basis for changing the discharge;
    (ii) Assists the DRB in focusing on those matters considered to be 
important by an applicant;
    (iii) Assists the DRB in distinguishing between a matter submitted 
by an applicant in the expectation that it will be treated as a 
decisional issue

[[Page 176]]

under Sec. 865.112, and those matters submitted simply as background or 
supporting materials;
    (iv) Provides the applicant with greater rights in the event that 
the applicant later submits a complaint under Sec. 865.121 of this 
subpart concerning the decisional document.
    (v) Reduces the potential for disagreement as to the content of an 
applicant's issue.
    (4) Incorporation by reference. If the applicant makes an additional 
written submission, such as a brief, in support of the application, the 
applicant may incorporate by reference specific issues set forth in the 
written submission in accordance with the guidance on DD Form 293. The 
reference shall be specific enough for the DRB to identify clearly the 
matter being submitted as an issue. At a minimum, it shall identify the 
page, paragraph, and sentence incorporated. Because it is to the 
applicant's benefit to bring such issues to the DRB's attention as early 
as possible in the review, applicants who submit a brief are strongly 
urged to set forth all issues as a separate item at the beginning of the 
brief. If it reasonably appears that the applicant inadvertently has 
failed expressly to incorporate an issue which the applicant clearly 
identifies as an issue to be addressed by the DRB, the DRB shall respond 
to such an issue in accordance with Secs. 865.111 and 865.112 of this 
subpart.
    (5) Effective date of the new DD Form 293. With respect to 
applications received before November 27, 1982, the DRB shall consider 
issues clearly and specifically stated in accordance with the rules in 
effect at the time of submission. With respect to applications received 
on or after November 27, 1982, if the applicant submits an obsolete DD 
Form 293, the application will be returned with a copy of the revised DD 
Form 293 for reaccomplishment. The DRB will only respond to the issues 
submitted on the new form in accordance with 32 CFR part 70, 47 FR 
37770, August 26, 1982 and this subpart.
    (h) Relationship of issues to character of or reason for discharge. 
If the application applies to both character of and reason for 
discharge, the applicant is encouraged, but not required, to identify 
the issue as applying to the character of or reason for discharge (or 
both). Unless the issue is directed at the reason for discharge 
expressly or by necessary implication, the DRB will presume that it 
applies solely to the character of discharge.
    (i) Relationship of issues to the standards for discharge review. 
The DRB reviews discharges on the basis of issues of propriety and 
equity. The standards used by the DRB are set forth in Sec. 865.120 of 
this subpart. The applicant is encouraged to review those standards 
before submitting any issue upon which the applicant believes a change 
in discharge should be based. The applicant is also encouraged, but not 
required, to identify an issue as pertaining to the propriety or the 
equity of the discharge. This will assist the DRB in assessing the 
relationship of the issue to propriety or equity under Sec. 865.112(d) 
of this subpart.
    (j) Citation of matter from decisions. The primary function of the 
DRB involves the exercise of discretion on a case-by-case basis. 
Applicants are not required to cite prior decisions as the basis for a 
change in discharge. If the applicant wishes to bring the DRB's 
attention to a prior decision as background or illustrative material, 
the citation should be placed in a brief or other supporting documents. 
If, however, it is the applicant's intention to submit an issue that 
sets forth specific principles and facts from a specific cited decision, 
the following requirements apply with respect to applications received 
on or after November 27, 1982.
    (1) The issue must be set forth or expressly incorporated in the 
``Applicant's Issue'' portion of DD Form 293.
    (2) If an applicant's issue cites a prior decision (of the DRB, 
another Board, an agency, or a court), the applicant shall describe the 
specific principles and facts that are contained in the prior decision 
and explain the relevance of cited matter to the applicant's case.
    (3) To insure timely consideration of principles cited from 
unpublished opinions (including decisions maintained by the Armed Forces 
Discharge Review Board/Correction Board Reading Room), the applicant 
must provide the

[[Page 177]]

DRB with copies of such decisions or of the relevant portion of 
treatise, manual, or similar source in which the principles were 
discussed. At the applicant's request, such materials will be returned.
    (4) If the applicant fails to comply with the requirements above, 
the decisional document shall note the defect, and shall respond to the 
issue without regard to the citation.
    (k) Identification by the DRB of issues submitted by an applicant. 
The applicant's issues shall be identified in accordance with this 
section after a review of all materials and information is made.
    (1) Issues on DD Form 293. The DRB shall consider all items 
submitted as issues by an applicant on DD Form 293 (or incorporated 
therein) in accordance with this part. With respect to applications 
submitted before November 27, 1982, the DRB shall consider all issues 
clearly and specifically stated in accordance with the rules in effect 
at the time of the submission.
    (2) Amendment of issues. The DRB shall not request or instruct an 
applicant to amend or withdraw any matter submitted by the applicant. 
Any amendment or withdrawal of an issue by an applicant shall be 
confirmed in writing by the applicant. This provision does not:
    (i) Limit by DRB's authority to question an applicant as to the 
meaning of such matter;
    (ii) Preclude the DRB from developing decisional issues based upon 
such questions:
    (iii) Prevent the applicant from amending or withdrawing such matter 
any time before the DRB closes the review process for deliberation; or
    (iv) Prevent the DRB from presenting an applicant with a list of 
proposed decisional issues and written information concerning the right 
of the applicant to add to, amend, or withdraw the applicant's 
submission. The written information will state that the applicant's 
decision to take such action (or decline to do so) will not be used 
against the applicant in the consideration of the case.
    (3) Additional Issues Identified During a Hearing. The following 
additional procedure shall be used during a hearing in order to promote 
the DRB's understanding of an applicant's presentation. If before 
closing the hearing for deliberation, the DRB believes that an applicant 
has presented an issue not listed on DD Form 293, the FRB may so inform 
the applicant, and the applicant may submit the issue in writing or add 
additional written issues at that time. This does not preclude the DRB 
from developing its own decisional issues.
    (l) Notification of possible bar to benefits. Written notification 
shall be made to each applicant whose record indicates a reason for 
discharge that bars receipt of benefits under 38 U.S.C. 3103(a). This 
notification will advise the applicant that separate action by the Board 
for Correction of Military Records or the Veterans Administration may 
confer eligibility for VA benefits. Regarding the bar to benefits based 
upon the 180 days consecutive unauthorized absence, the following 
applies:
    (1) Such absence must have been included as part of the basis for 
the applicant's discharge under other than honorable conditions.
    (2) Such absence is computed without regard to the applicant's 
normal or adjusted expiration of term of service.


<R05>
Sec. 865.107  DRB composition and meeting location.

    (a) The DRB consists of five members, with the senior line officer 
acting as the presiding officer. The presiding officer convenes, 
recesses and adjourns the Board.
    (b) In addition to holding hearings in Washington, DC, the DRB, as a 
convenience to applicants, periodically conducts hearings at selected 
locations throughout the Continental United States. Reviews are 
conducted at locations central to those areas with the greatest number 
of applicants. A continuing review and appraisal is conducted to ensure 
the selected hearing locations are responsive to a majority of 
applicants. Administrative details and responsibilities for Regional 
Boards are outlined in Sec. 865.124.

[[Page 178]]


<R05>
Sec. 865.108  Availability of records and documents.

    (a) Before applying for discharge review, potential applicants or 
their designated resentatives may, and are encouraged to obtain copies 
of their military personnel records by submitting a General Services 
Administration Standard Form 180, Request Pertaining to Military 
Records, to the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) 9700 Page 
Boulevard, St. Louis, Mo 63132; thus avoiding any lengthy delays in the 
processing of the application (DD Form 293) and the scheduling of 
reviews.
    (1) Once the application for discharge review (DD Form 293) is 
submitted, an applicant's military records are forwarded to the DRB 
where they cannot be reproduced. Submission of a request for an 
applicant's military records, including a request under the Freedom of 
Information Act or Privacy Act after the DD Form 293 has been submitted, 
shall result automatically in the termporary suspension of processing of 
the application for discharge review until the requested records are 
sent to an appropriate location for copying, are copied, and returned to 
the headquarters of the DRB. Processing of the application shall then be 
resumed at whatever stage of the discharge review process is 
practicable.
    (2) Applicants and their designated representatives also may examine 
their military personnel records at the site of their scheduled review 
before the hearing. The DRB shall notify applicants and their designated 
representatives of the dates the records are available for examination 
in their standard scheduling information.
    (b) The DRB is not authorized to provide copies of documents that 
are under the cognizance of another government department, office, or 
activity. Applications for such information must be made by the 
applicant to the cognizant authority. The DRB shall advise the applicant 
of the mailing address of the government department, office, or activity 
to which the request should be submitted.
    (c) If the official records relevant to the discharge review are not 
available at the agency having custody of the records, the applicant 
shall be so notified and requested to provide such information and 
documents as may be desired in support of the request for discharge 
review. A period of not less than 30 days shall be allowed for such 
documents to be submitted. At the expiration of this period, the review 
may be conducted with information available to the DRB.
    (d) The DRB may take steps to obtain additional evidence that is 
relevant to the discharge under consideration beyond that found in the 
official military records or submitted by the applicant, if a review of 
available evidence suggests that it would be incomplete without the 
additional information, or when the applicant presents testimony or 
documents that require additional information to evaluate properly. Such 
information shall be made available to the applicant, upon request, with 
appropriate modifications regarding classified material.
    (1) In any case heard on the request of an applicant, the DRB shall 
provide the applicant and counsel or representative, if any, at a 
reasonable time before initiating the decision process, a notice of the 
availability of all regulations and documents to be considered in the 
discharge review, except for documents in the official personnel or 
medical records and any documents submitted by the applicant. The DRB 
shall also notify the applicant or counsel or representative (i) of the 
right to examine such documents or to be provided with copies of 
documents upon request; (ii) of the date by which such request must be 
received; and (iii) of the opportunity to respond within a reasonable 
period of time to be set be the DRB.
    (2) When necessary to acquaint the applicant with the substance of a 
classified document, the classifying authority, on the request of the 
DRB, shall prepare a summary of or an extract from the document, 
deleting all reference to source of information and other matters, the 
disclosure of which, in the opinion of the classifying authority, would 
be detrimental to the national security interest of the United States. 
Should preparation of such summary be deemed impracticable by the 
classifying authority, information from the classified source shall not 
be

[[Page 179]]

considered by the DRB in its review of the case.
    (e) Current Air Force numbered publications may be obtained from the 
Chief, Central Base Administration at any major Air Force installation 
or by writing:

HQ USAF/DASJL, Washington, DC 20330

      or

DA Military Review Boards Agency, Attention: SPBA (Reading Room), Room 
1E520, Washington, DC 20310


<R05>
Sec. 865.109  Procedures for hearings.

    (a) The applicant is entitled, by law, to appear in person at his or 
her request before the DRB in open session and to be represented by 
counsel of his or her own selection. The applicant also may present such 
witnesses as he or she may desire.
    (b) There are two types of reviews. They are:
    (1) Record Review. A review of the application, available service 
records, and additional documents (if any) submitted by the applicant.
    (2) Hearing. A personal appearance before the DRB by the applicant 
with or without counsel, or by the counsel only.
    (c) The Government does not compensate or pay the expenses of the 
applicant, applicant's witnesses, or counsel.
    (d) A summary of the available military records of the applicant is 
prepared for use by the DRB in the review process. A copy of the summary 
is available to the applicant and/or his or her counsel, upon request.
    (e) When an applicant has requested a personal appearance and/or 
representation by counsel on the DD Form 293, the DRB sends written 
notice of the hearing time and place to the applicant and designated 
counsel. Evidence of such notification will be placed in the applicant's 
record.
    (f) Personal appearance hearings shall be conducted with recognition 
of the rights of the individual to privacy. Accordingly, presence at 
hearings of individuals other than those whose presence is required will 
be limited to persons authorized by the presiding officer and/or 
expressly requested by the applicant, subject to reasonable limitations 
based upon available space.
    (g) Formal rules of evidence shall not be applied in DRB 
proceedings. The presiding officer shall rule on matters of procedure 
and shall ensure that reasonable bounds of relevancy and materiality are 
maintained in the taking of evidence and presentation of witnesses. 
Applicants and witnesses may present evidence to the DRB panel either in 
person or by affidavit or through counsel. If an applicant or witness 
testifies under oath or affirmation, he or she is subject to questioning 
by Board members.
    (h) There is a presumption of regularity in the conduct of 
governmental affairs. This presumption can be applied in any review 
unless there is substantial credible evidence to rebut the presumption.
    (i) Failure to appear at a hearing or respond to scheduling notice.
    (1) Except as otherwise authorized by the Secretary of the Air 
Force, further opportunity for a personal appearance hearing shall not 
be made available in the following circumstances to an applicant who has 
requested a hearing.
    (i) When the applicant and/or a designated counsel or representative 
has been sent a letter containing the date and location of a proposed 
hearing and fails to make a timely response; or
    (ii) When the applicant and/or a designated representative, after 
being notified by letter of the time and place of the hearing, fails to 
appear at the appointed time, either in person or by representative, 
without having made a prior, timely request for a postponement or 
withdrawal.
    (2) In such cases, the applicant shall be deemed to have waived his/
her right to a hearing, and the DRB shall complete its review of the 
discharge. Further request for a hearing shall not be granted unless the 
applicant can demonstrate that the failure to appear or respond was due 
to circumstances beyond the applicant's control.
    (j) Continuance and postponements:
    (1) A continuance of a discharge review hearing may be authorized by 
the presiding officer of the Board concerned, provided that such 
continuance is of a reasonable duration and is essential to achieving a 
full and fair

[[Page 180]]

hearing. Where a proposal for continuance is indefinite, the pending 
application shall be returned to the applicant with the option to 
resubmit when the case is fully ready for review.
    (2) Postponements of scheduled reviews normally shall not be 
permitted other than for demonstrated good and sufficient reason set 
forth by the applicant in a timely manner, or for the convenience of the 
government.
    (k) Reconsideration. A discharge review shall not be subject to 
reconsideration except:
    (1) Where the only previous consideration of the case was on the 
motion of the DRB;
    (2) When the original discharge review did not involve a personal 
appearance hearing and a personal appearance is now desired, and the 
provisions of Sec. 865.109(j) do not apply;
    (3) Where changes in discharge policy are announced subsequent to an 
earlier review of an applicant's discharge, and the new policy is made 
expressly retroactive;
    (4) Where the DRB determines that policies and procedures under 
which the applicant was discharged differ in material respects from 
policies and procedures currently applicable on a service-wide basis to 
discharges of the type under consideration, provided that such changes 
in policies or procedures represent a substantial enhancement of the 
rights afforded an applicant in such proceeding;
    (5) Where an individual is to be represented by a counsel/
representative, and was not so represented in any previous consideration 
of the case.
    (6) Where the case was not previously considered under the uniform 
standards published pursuant to Pub. L. 95-126 and application is made 
for such consideration within 15 years after the date of discharge; or
    (7) On the basis of presentation of new, substantial, relevant 
evidence not available to the applicant at the time of the original 
review. The decision as to whether evidence offered by an applicant in 
support of a request for reconsideration is in fact new, substantial, 
relevant, and was not available to the applicant at the time of the 
original review will be based on a comparison of such evidence with the 
evidence considered in the previous discharge review. If this comparison 
shows that the evidence submitted would have had a probable effect on 
matters concerning the propriety or equity of the discharge, the request 
for reconsideration shall be granted.


<R05>
Sec. 865.110  Decision process.

    (a) The DRB shall meet in plenary session to review discharges and 
exercise its discretion on a case-by-case basis in applying the 
standards set forth in this regulation.
    (b) The presiding officer is responsible for the conduct of the 
discharge review. The presiding officer shall convene, recess, and 
adjourn the DRB as appropriate, and shall maintain an atmosphere of 
dignity and decorum at all times.
    (c) Each board member shall act under oath or affirmation requiring 
careful, objective consideration of the application. They shall consider 
all relevant material and competent information presented to them by the 
applicant. In addition, they shall consider all available military 
records, together with such other records as may be in the files and 
relevant to the issues before the DRB.
    (d) The DRB shall identify and address issues after a review of the 
following material obtained and presented in accordance with this 
subpart and 32 CFR part 70: available official military records, 
documentary evidence submitted by or on behalf of the applicant, 
presentation of testimony by or on behalf of the applicant, oral or 
written arguments presented by or on behalf of the applicant, and any 
other relevant evidence.
    (e) Application of Standards:
    (1) When the DRB determines that an applicant's discharge was 
improper, the DRB will determine which reason for discharge should have 
been assigned based upon the facts and circumstances properly before the 
discharge authority in view of the regulations governing reasons for 
discharge at the time the applicant was discharged.
    (2) When the board determines that an applicant's discharge was 
inequitable, any change will be based on the evaluation of the 
applicant's overall

[[Page 181]]

record of service and relevant regulations.
    (f) Voting shall be conducted in closed session, a majority of the 
five members' votes constituting the DRB's decision.
    (g) Details of closed session deliberations of a DRB are privileged 
information and shall not be divulged.
    (h) A formal minority opinion may be submitted in instances of 
disagreement between members of a board. The opinion must cite findings, 
conclusions and reasons which are the basis for the opinion. The 
complete case with the majority and minority recommendations will be 
submitted to the Director, Air Force Personnel Council.
    (i) The DRB may request advisory opinions from staff offices of the 
Air Force. These opinions are advisory in nature and are not binding on 
the DRB in its decision making process.


<R05>
Sec. 865.111  Response to items submitted as issues by the applicant.

    (a) If an issue submitted by an applicant contains two or more 
clearly separate issues, the DRB should respond to each issue under the 
guidance of this section as if it had been set forth separately by the 
applicant.
    (b) If an applicant uses a ``building block'' approach (that is, 
setting forth a series of conclusions on issues that lead to a single 
conclusion purportedly warranting a change in the applicant's 
discharge), normally there should be a separate response to each issue.
    (c) This section does not preclude the DRB from making a single 
response to multiple issues when such action would enhance the clarity 
of the decisional document, but such response must reflect an adequate 
response to each separate issue.
    (d) An item submitted as an issue by an applicant in accordance with 
this regulation shall be addressed as a decisional issue under 
Sec. 865.112 of this subpart in the following circumstances:
    (1) When the DRB decides that a change in discharge should be 
granted, and the DRB bases its decision in whole or in part on the 
applicant's issue; or
    (2) When the DRB does not provide the applicant with the full change 
in discharge requested, and the decision is based in whole or in part on 
the DRB's disagreement with the merits of an issue submitted by the 
applicant.
    (e) If the applicant receives the full change in discharge requested 
(or a more favorable change), that fact shall be noted and the basis 
shall be addressed as a decisional issue even if that basis is not 
addressed as an issue by the applicant. No further response is required 
to other issues submitted by the applicant.
    (f) If the applicant does not receive the full change in discharge 
requested with respect to either the character of or reason for 
discharge (or both), the DRB shall address the items submitted by the 
applicant unless one of the following responses is applicable:
    (1) Duplicate issues. The DRB may state that there is a full 
response to the issue submitted by the applicant under a specified 
decisional issue. This respose may be used only when one issue clearly 
duplicates another or the issue clearly requires discussion in 
conjunction with another issue.
    (2) Citations without principles and facts. The DRB may state that 
any issue, which consists of a citation of a previous decision without 
setting forth any principles and facts from the decision that the 
applicant states are relevant to the applicant's case, does not comply 
with the requirements of Sec. 865.106(g)(1) of this part.
    (3) Unclear issues. The DRB may state that it cannot respond to an 
item submitted by the applicant as an issue because the meaning of the 
item is unclear. An issue is unclear if it cannot be understood by a 
reasonable person familiar with the discharge review process after a 
review of the materials considered under Sec. 865.110(d) of this 
subpart.
    (4) Nonspecific issues. The DRB may state that it cannot respond to 
an item submitted by the applicant as an issue because it is not 
specific. A submission is considered not specific if a reasonable person 
familiar with the discharge review process after a review of the 
materials considered under Sec. 865.110(d), cannot determine the 
relationship between the applicant's submission and the particular 
circumstances of the case. This response may be used only if the 
submission is expressed in such

[[Page 182]]

general terms that no other response is applicable. For example, if the 
DRB disagrees with the applicant as to the relevance of matters set 
forth in the submission, the DRB normally will set forth the nature of 
the disagreement under the guidance in Sec. 865.112 of this subpart with 
respect to decisional issues, or it will reject the applicant's position 
on the basis of Sec. 865.111(f)(1) or Sec. 865.111(f)(2). If the 
applicant's submission is so general that none of those provisions is 
applicable, then the DRB may state that it cannot respond because the 
item is not specific.


<R05>
Sec. 865.112  Decisional issues.

    (a) The decisional document shall discuss the issues that provide a 
basis for the decision whether there should be a change in the character 
of or reason for discharge. In order to enhance clarity, the DRB should 
not address matters other than issues relied upon in the decision or 
raised by the applicant.
    (b) Partial Change. When the decision changes a discharge but does 
not provide the applicant with the full change in discharge requested, 
the decisional document shall address both the issues upon which change 
is granted and the issues upon which the DRB denies the full change 
requested.
    (c) Relationship of Issue To Character of or Reason for Discharge. 
Generally, the decisional document should specify whether a decisional 
issue applies to the character of or reason for discharge (or both), but 
it is not required to do so.
    (d) Relationship of an Issue To Propriety or Equity. (1) If an 
applicant identifies an issue as pertaining to both propriety and 
equity, the DRB will consider it under both standards.
    (2) If an applicant identifies an issue as pertaining to the 
propriety of the discharge (for example, by citing a propriety standard 
or otherwise claiming that a change in discharge is required as a matter 
of law), the DRB shall consider the issue solely as a matter of 
propriety. Except as provided in Sec. 865.112(d)(4), the DRB is not 
required to consider such an issue under the equity standards.
    (3) If the applicant's issue contends that the DRB is required as a 
matter of law to follow a prior decision by setting forth an issue of 
propriety from the prior decision and decribing its relationship to the 
applicant's case, the issue shall be considered under the propriety 
standards and addressed under Sec. 865.112(e) or Sec. 865.112(f).
    (4) If the applicant's issue sets forth principles of equity 
contained in a prior DRB decision, describes the relationship to the 
applicant's case, and contends that the DRB is required as a matter of 
law to follow the prior case, the decisional document shall note that 
the DRB is not bound by its discretionary decisions in prior cases under 
the standards in Sec. 865.120 of this subpart. However, the principles 
cited by the applicant, and the description of the relationship of the 
principles to the applicant's case, shall be considered under the equity 
standards and addressed under Sec. 865.112(h) or Sec. 865.112(i).
    (5) If the applicant's issue cannot be identified as a matter of 
propriety or equity, the DRB shall address it as an issue of equity.
    (e) Change of discharge: Issues of propriety. If a change in the 
discharge is warranted under the propriety standards the decisional 
document shall state that conclusion and list the errors or expressly 
retroactive changes in policy that provide a basis for the conclusion. 
The decisional document shall cite the facts in the record that 
demonstrate the relevance of the error or change in policy to the 
applicant's case. If the change in discharge does not constitute the 
full change requested by the applicant, the reasons for not granting the 
full change shall be addressed.
    (f) Denial of the full change requested: Issues of propriety. If the 
decision rejects the applicant's position on an issue of propriety, or 
if it is otherwise decided on the basis of an issue of propriety that 
the full change in discharge requested by the applicant is not 
warranted, the decisional document shall note that conclusion. The 
decisional document shall list reasons for its conclusion on each issue 
of propriety under the following guidance:
    (1) If a reason is based in whole or in part upon a part, statute, 
constitutional provision, judicial determination, or other source of 
law, the DRB

[[Page 183]]

shall cite the pertinent source of law and the facts in the record that 
demonstrate the relevance of the source of law to the particular 
circumstances in the case.
    (2) If a reason is based in whole or in part on a determination as 
to the occurrence or nonoccurrence of an event or circumstance, 
including a factor required by applicable Air Force regulations to be 
considered for determination of the character of and reason for the 
applicant's discharge, the DRB shall make a finding of fact for each 
such event or circumstance.
    (i) For each such finding, the decisional document shall list the 
specific source of the information relied upon. This may include the 
presumption of regularity in appropriate cases. If the information is 
listed in the service record section of the decisional document, a 
citation is not required.
    (ii) If a finding of fact is made after consideration of 
contradictory evidence in the record (including information cited by the 
applicant or otherwise identified by members of the DRB), the decisional 
document shall set forth the conflicting evidence, and explain why the 
information relied upon was more persuasive than the information that 
was rejected. If the presumption of regularity is cited as the basis for 
rejecting such information, the decisional document shall explain why 
the contradictory evidence was insufficient to overcome the presumption. 
In an appropriate case, the explanation as to why the contradictory 
evidence was insufficient to overcome the presumption of regularity may 
consist of a statement that the applicant failed to provide sufficient 
corroborating evidence, or that the DRB did not find the applicant's 
testimony to be sufficiently credible to overcome the presumption.
    (3) If the DRB disagrees with the position of the applicant on an 
issue of propriety, the following guidance applies in addition to the 
guidance in Sec. 842.112(f) (1) and (2).
    (i) The DRB may reject the applicant's position by explaining why it 
disagrees with the principles set forth in the applicant's issue 
(including principles derived from cases cited by the applicant).
    (ii) The DRB may reject the applicant's position by explaining why 
the principles set forth in the applicant's issue (including principles 
derived from cases cited by the applicant) are not relevant to the 
applicant's case.
    (iii) The DRB may reject an applicant's position by stating that the 
applicant's issue of propriety is not a matter upon which the DRB grants 
a change in discharge, and by providing an explanation for this 
position. When the applicant indicates that the issue is to be 
considered in conjunction with one or more other specified issues, the 
explanation will address all such specified issues.
    (iv) The DRB may reject the applicant's position on the grounds that 
other specified factors in the case preclude granting relief, regardless 
of whether the DRB agreed with the applicant's position.
    (v) If the applicant takes the position that the discharge must be 
changed because of an alleged error in a record associated with the 
discharge, and the record has not been corrected by the organization 
with primary responsibility for corrective action, respond that it will 
presume the validity of the record in the absence of such corrective 
action. If the organization empowered to correct the record is within 
the Department of the Air Force, the DRB should provide the applicant 
with a brief description of the procedures for requesting correction of 
the record. If the DRB on its own motion cites this issue as a 
decisional issue on the basis of equity, it shall address the issue as 
such.
    (vi) When an applicant's issue contains a general allegation that a 
certain course of action violated his or her constitutional rights, 
respond in appropriate cases by noting that the action was consistent 
with statutory or regulatory authority, and by citing the presumption of 
constitutionality that attaches to statutes and regulations. If, on the 
other hand, the applicant makes a specific challenge to the 
constitutionality of the action by challenging the application of a 
statute or regulation is a particular set of circumstances, it is not 
sufficient to respond solely by citing the presumption of 
constitutionality of the statute or

[[Page 184]]

regulation when the applicant is not challenging the constitutionality 
of the statute or regulation. Instead, the response must address the 
specific circumstances of the case.
    (g) Denial of the full change in discharge requested when propriety 
is not at issue. If the applicant has not submitted an issue of 
propriety and the DRB has not otherwise relied upon an issue of 
propriety to change the discharge, the decisional document shall contain 
a statement to that effect. The DRB is not required to provide any 
further discussion as to the propriety of the discharge.
    (h) Change of discharge: Issues of equity. If the DRB concludes that 
a change in the discharge is warranted under equity standards the 
decisional document shall list each issue of equity upon which this 
conclusion is based. The DRB shall cite the facts in the record that 
demonstrate the relevance of the issue to the applicant's case. If the 
change in discharge does not constitute the full change requested by the 
applicant, the reasons for not giving the full change requested shall be 
discussed.
    (i) Denial of the full change requested: Issues of equity. If the 
DRB rejects the applicant's position on an issue of equity, or if the 
decision otherwise provides less than the full change in discharge 
requested by the applicant, the decisional document shall note that 
conclusion. The DRB shall list reasons for its conclusions on each issue 
of equity in accordance with the following:
    (1) If a reason is based in whole or in part upon a part, statute, 
constitutional provision, judicial determination, or other source of 
law, the DRB shall cite the pertinent source of law and the facts in the 
record that demonstrate the relevance of the source of law to the 
exercise of discretion on the issue of equity in the applicant's case.
    (2) If a reason is based in whole or in part on a determination as 
to the occurrence or nonoccurrence of an event or circumstance, 
including a factor required by applicable Air Force regulations to be 
considered for determination of the character of and reason for the 
applicant's discharge, the DRB shall make a finding of fact for each 
such event or circumstance.
    (i) For each such finding, the decisional document shall list the 
specific source of the information relied upon. This may include the 
presumption of regularity in appropriate cases. If the information is 
listed in the service record section of the decisional document, a 
citation is not required.
    (ii) If a finding of fact is made after consideration of 
contradictory evidence in the record (including information cited by the 
applicant or otherwise identified by members of the DRB), the decisional 
document shall set forth the conflicting evidence, and explain why the 
information relied upon was more persuasive than the information that 
was rejected. If the presumption of regularity is cited as the basis for 
rejecting such information, the decisional document shall explain why 
the contradictory evidence was insufficient to overcome the presumption. 
In an appropriate case, the explanation as to why the contradictory 
evidence was insufficient to overcome the presumption of regularity may 
consist of a statement that the applicant failed to provide sufficient 
corroborating evidence, or that the DRB did not find the applicant's 
testimony to be sufficiently credible to overcome the presumption.
    (3) If the DRB disagrees with the position of the applicant on an 
issue of equity, the following guidance applies in addition to the 
guidance in Sec. 865.112(i) (1) and (2):
    (i) The DRB may reject the applicant's position by explaining why it 
disagrees with the principles set forth in the applicant's issue 
(including principles derived from cases cited by the applicant).
    (ii) The DRB may reject the applicant's position by explaining why 
the principles set forth in the applicant's issue (including principles 
derived from cases cited by the applicant) are not relevant to the 
applicant's case.
    (iii) The DRB may reject an applicant's position by explaining why 
the applicant's issue is not a matter upon which the DRB grants a change 
in discharge as a matter of equity. When the applicant indicates that 
the issue is to be considered in conjunction with other specified 
issues, the explanation will address all such issues.

[[Page 185]]

    (iv) The DRB may reject the applicant's position on the grounds that 
other specified factors in the case preclude granting relief, regardless 
of whether the DRB agreed with the applicant's position.
    (v) If the applicant takes the position that the discharge should be 
changed as a matter of equity because of an alleged error in a record 
associated with the discharge, and the record has not been corrected by 
the organization with primary responsibility for corrective action, the 
DRB may respond that it will presume the validity of the record in the 
absence of such corrective action. However, the DRB will consider 
whether it should exercise its equitable powers to change the discharge 
on the basis of the alleged error. If it declines to do so, the DRB 
shall explain why the applicant's position did not provide a sufficient 
basis for the change in the discharge requested by the applicant.
    (4) When the DRB concludes that aggravating factors outweigh 
mitigating factors, the DRB must set forth reasons such as the 
seriousness of the offense, specific circumstances surrounding the 
offense, number of offenses, lack of mitigating circumstances, or 
similar factors. The DRB is not required, however, to explain why it 
relied on any such factors unless the applicability or weight of such 
factors are expressly raised as an issue by the applicant.
    (5) If the applicant has not submitted any issues and the DRB has 
not otherwise relied upon an issue of equity for a change in discharge, 
the decisional document shall contain a statement to that effect, and 
shall note that the major factors upon which the discharge was based are 
set forth in the service record portion of the decisional document.

Sec. 865.113  Recommendations by the Director of the Personnel Council and Secretarial Review Authority.

    (a) The Director of the Personnel Council may forward cases for 
consideration by the Secretarial Reviewing Authority (SRA) under rules 
established by the Secretary of the Air Force.
    (b) The following categories of dicharge review requests are subject 
to the review of the Secretary of the Air Force or the Secretary's 
designee.
    (1) Cases in which a minority of the DRB panel requests their 
submitted opinions be forwarded for consideration (refer to 
Sec. 865.110(h)).
    (2) Cases when required in order to provide information to the 
Secretary on specific aspects of the discharge review function which are 
of interest to the Secretary.
    (3) Any case which the Director, Air Force Personnel Council 
believes is of significant interest to the Secretary.
    (c) The Secretarial Reviewing Authority is the Secretary of the Air 
Force or the official to whom he has delegated this authority. The SRA 
may review the types of cases described above before issuance of the 
final notification of a decision. Those cases forwarded for review by 
the SRA shall be considered under the standards set forth in 
Sec. 865.121 and DOD Directive 1332.28.
    (d) There is no requirement that the Director of the Personnel 
Council submit a recommendation when a case is forwarded to the SRA. If 
a recommendation is submitted, however, it should be in accordance with 
the guidelines described below.
    (e) Format for Recommendation. If a recommendation is provided, it 
shall contain the Director's views whether there should be a change in 
the character of or reason for discharge (or both). If the Director 
recommends such a change, the particular change to be made shall be 
specified. The recommendation shall set forth the Director's position on 
decisional issues submitted by the applicant in accordance with the 
following:
    (1) Adoption of the DRB's Decisional document. The recommendation 
may state that the Director has adopted the decisional document prepared 
by the majority. The Director shall ensure that the decisional document 
meets the requirements of this regulation.
    (2) Adoption of the Specific Statements From the Majority. If the 
Director adopts the views of the majority only in part, the 
recommendation shall cite the specific matter adopted from the majority. 
If the Director modifies a statement submitted by the majority,

[[Page 186]]

the recommendation shall set forth the modification.
    (3) Response To Issues Not Included in Matter Adopted From the 
Majority. The recommendation shall set forth the following if not 
adopted in whole or in part from the majority:
    (i) The issues on which the Director's recommendation is based. Each 
such decisional issue shall be addressed by the Director in accordance 
with Sec. 865.112 of this subpart.
    (ii) The Director's response to items submitted as issues by the 
applicant under Sec. 865.111 of this subpart.
    (iii) Reasons for rejecting the conclusions of the majority with 
respect to decisional issues which, if resolved in the applicant's 
favor, would have resulted in greater relief for the applicant than that 
afforded by the Director's recommendation. Each issue shall be addressed 
in accordance with Sec. 865.112 of this subpart.
    (f) Copies of the proposed decisional document on cases that have 
been forwarded to the SRA (except for cases reviewed on the DRB's own 
motion without the participation of the applicant or the applicant's 
counsel) shall be provided to the applicant and counsel or 
representative, if any. The document will include the Director's 
recommendation to the SRA, if any. Classified information shall be 
summarized.
    (g) The applicant shall be provided with a reasonable period of 
time, but not less than 25 days, to submit a rebuttal to the SRA. An 
issue in rebuttal consists of a clear and specific statement by the 
applicant in support of or in opposition to the statements of the DRB or 
Director on decisional issues and other clear and specific issues that 
were submitted by the applicant. The rebuttal shall be based solely on 
matters in the record when the DRB closed the case for deliberation or 
in the Director's recommendation.
    (h) Review of the Decisional document. If corrections in the 
decisional document are required, the decisional document shall be 
returned to the DRB for corrective action. The corrected decisional 
document shall be sent to the applicant and counsel or representative, 
if any, but a further opportunity for rebuttal is not required unless 
the correction produces a different result or includes a substantial 
change in the discussion by the DRB or Director of the issues raised by 
the majority or the applicant.
    (i) The Addendum of the SRA. The decision of the SRA shall be in 
writing and shall be appended as an addendum to the decisional document.
    (1) The SRA's Decision. The addendum shall set forth the SRA's 
decision whether there will be a change in the character of or reason 
for discharge (or both); if the SRA concludes that a change is 
warranted, the particular change to be made shall be specified. If the 
SRA adopts the decision recommended by the DRB or the Director, the 
decisional document shall contain a reference to the matter adopted.
    (2) Discussion of Issues. In support of the SRA's decision, the 
addendum shall set forth the SRA's position on decisional issues, items 
submitted by an applicant and issues raised by the DRB and the Director. 
The addendum will state that:
    (i) The SRA has adopted the Director's recommendation.
    (ii) The SRA has adopted the proposed decisional document prepared 
by the DRB.
    (iii) If the SRA adopts the views of the DRB or the Director only in 
part, the addendum shall cite the specific statements adopted. If the 
SRA modifies a statement submitted by the DRB or the Director, the 
addendum shall set forth the modification.
    (3) Response To Issues Not Included in Master Adopted From the DRB 
or the Director. The addendum shall set forth the following if not 
adopted in whole or in part from the DRB or the Director:
    (i) A list of the issues on which the SRA's decision is based. Each 
such decisional issue shall be addressed by the SRA. This includes 
reasons for rejecting the conclusion of the DRB or the Director with 
respect to decisional issues which, if resolved in the applicant's 
favor, would have resulted in change to the discharge more favorable to 
the applicant than that afforded by the SRA's decision.
    (ii) The SRA's response to items submitted as issues by the 
applicant will

[[Page 187]]

be in accordance with Sec. 865.111 of this subpart.
    (4) Response to Rebuttal:
    (i) If the SRA grants the full change in discharge requested by the 
applicant (or a more favorable change), that fact shall be noted, the 
decisional document shall be addressed accordingly, and no further 
response to the rebuttal is required.
    (ii) If the SRA does not grant the full change in discharge 
requested by the applicant (or a more favorable change), the addendum 
shall list each issue in rebuttal submitted by an applicant and shall 
set forth the response of the SRA under the following:
    (A) If the SRA rejects an issue in rebuttal, the SRA may respond in 
accordance with the principles in Sec. 865.112 of this subpart.
    (B) If the matter adopted by the SRA provides a basis for the SRA's 
rejection of the rebuttal material, the SRA may note that fact and cite 
the specific matter adopted that responds to the issue in rebuttal.
    (C) If the matter submitted by the applicant does not meet the 
requirements for rebuttal material in paragraph (g) of this section, 
that fact shall be noted.
    (j) Index Entries. Appropriate index entries shall be prepared for 
the SRA's actions for matters that are not adopted from the DRB's

Sec. 865.118  Availability of Discharge Review Board documents for public inspection and copying.

    (a) A copy of the decisional document prepared in accordance with 
Sec. 865.114 of this subpart, shall be made available for public 
inspection and copying promptly after a notice of final decision is sent

[[Page 189]]

    (b) To the extent required to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion 
of personal privacy, identifying details of the applicant and other 
persons will be deleted from documents made available for public 
inspection and copying. Names, addresses, social security numbers, and 
military service numbers must be deleted. Written justification shall be 
made for all other deletions and shall be available for public 
inspection.
    (c) The DRB shall ensure that there is a means for relating a 
decisional document number to the name of the applicant to permit 
retrieval of the applicant's records when required in processing a 
complaint in accordance with Sec. 865.121 of this subpart.

appended to any documents required to be furnished the applicant and 
counsel/representative or made available for public inspection and 
copying may be deleted therefrom only if a written statement of the 
basis for the deletions is provided the applicant and counsel/
representative and made available for public inspection. It is not 
intended that the statement be so detailed as to reveal the nature of 
the withheld material.
    (e) DRB documents made available for public inspection and copying 
shall be located in the Armed Forces Discharge Review/Correction Boards 
Reading Room. The documents shall be indexed in usable and concise form 
so as to enable the public and those who represent applicants before the 
DRB to isolate from all these decisions that are indexed those cases 
that may be similar to an applicant's case and that indicate the 
circumstances under and/or reasons for which the DRB or the Secretary of 
the Air Force granted or denied relief.
    (1) The reading file index shall include, in addition to any other 
items determined by the DRB, the case number, the date, character of, 
reason for, and authority for the discharge. It shall further include 
the decisions of the DRB and reviewing authority, if any, and the issues 
addressed in the statement of findings, conclusions and reasons.
    (2) The index shall be maintained at selected permanent locations 
throughout the United States. This ensures reasonable availability to 
applicants at least 30 days before a regional board review. The index 
shall also be made available at sites selected for regional Boards for 
such periods as the DRB is present and in operation. An applicant who 
has requested a regional board review shall be advised in the notice of 
scheduled hearings.
    (3) The Armed Forces Discharge Review/Correction Board Reading Room 
shall publish indexes quarterly for the DRB. The DRB shall be 
responsible for timely submission to the Reading Room of individual case 
information required for update of indexes. These indexes shall be 
available for public inspection or purchase (or both) at the Reading 
Room. This information will be provided to applicants in the notice of 
acceptance of the application.
    (4) Correspondence relating to matters under the cognizance of the 
Reading Room (including request for purchase of indexes) shall be 
addressed to:

Sec. 865.119  Privacy Act information.

    Information protected under the Privacy Act is involved in discharge 
review functions. The provisions of 32 CFR part 286a will be observed 
throughout the processing of a request for review of discharge or 
dismissal.


<R05>
Sec. 865.120  Discharge review standards.

    (a) Objective of review. The objective of a discharge review is to 
examine the propriety and equity of the applicant's discharge and to 
effect changes, if necessary. The standards of review and the underlying 
factors which aid in determining whether the standards are met shall be 
historically consistent with criteria for determining honorable service. 
No factors shall be established which require automatic change or denial 
of a change in a discharge. Neither the DRB nor the Secretary of the Air 
Force shall be bound by any methodology of weighing of the factors in 
reaching a determination. In each case, the DRB or Secretary of the Air 
Force

[[Page 190]]

shall give full, fair, and impartial consideration to all applicable 
factors prior to reaching a decision. An applicant may not receive a 
less favorable discharge than that issued at the time of separation. 
This does not preclude correction of clerical errors.
    (b) Propriety. A discharge shall be deemed to be proper unless in 
the course of discharge review, it is determined that:
    (1) There exists an error of fact, law, procedures, or discretion 
associated with the discharge at the time of issuance; and that the 
rights of the applicant were prejudiced thereby (such error shall 
constitute prejudicial error, if there is substantial doubt that the 
discharge would have remained the same if the error had not been made); 
or
    (2) A change in policy by the Air Force made expressly retroactive 
to the type of discharge under consideration, requires a change in the 
discharge.
    (c) When a record associated with the discharge at the time of 
issuance involves a matter in which the primary responsibility for 
corrective action rests with another organization (for example, another 
Board, agency, or court), the DRB will recognize an error only to the 
extent that the error has been corrected by the organization with 
primary responsibility for correcting the record.
    (d) The primary function of the DRB is to exercise its discretion on 
issues of equity by reviewing the individual merits of each application 
on a case-by-case basis. Prior decisions in which the DRB exercised its 
discretion to change a discharge based on issues of equity (including 
the factors cited in such decisions or the weight given to factors in 
such decisions) do not blind the DRB in its review of subsequent cases 
because no two cases present the same issues of equity.
    (e) The following applies to applicants who received less than fully 
honorable administrative discharges because of their civilian misconduct 
while in an inactive reserve component and who were discharged or had 
their discharge reviewed on or after April 20, 1971: the DRB shall 
either recharacterize the discharge to honorable without any additional 
proceedings or additional proceedings shall be conducted in accordance 
with the Court's Order of December 3, 1981, in Wood v. Secretary of 
Defense to determine whether proper grounds exist for the issuance of a 
less than honorable discharge, taking into account that:
    (1) An Under Other Than Honorable (formerly Undesirable) Discharge 
for an inactive reservist can only be based upon civilian misconduct 
found to have affected directly the performance of military duties;
    (2) A General Discharge for an inactive reservist can only be based 
upon civilian misconduct found to have had an adverse impact on the 
overall effectiveness of the military, including military morale and 
efficiency.
    (f) The following applies to applicants who received less than fully 
honorable administrative discharges (between June 21, 1971 and March 2, 
1982) because evidence developed by or as a direct result of complusory 
urinalysis testing was introduced in the discharge proceedings. 
Applicants who believe they are members of the above category will so 
indicate this by writing ``CATEGORY W'' in block 7 of their DD Form 293. 
AFMPC/MPCDOA1 will expedite processing these applications to the 
designated ``CATEGORY W'' reviewer. For class members the designated 
reviewer shall either recharacterize the discharge to honorable without 
any additional proceedings or complete a review to determine whether 
proper ground exists for the issuance of a less than honorable 
discharge. If the applicant is determined not to be a class member, the 
application is returned to normal review procedure channels. If new 
administrative proceedings are initiated, the former service member must 
be notified of:
    (1) The basis of separation other than drug abuse or use or 
possession of drugs based upon compelled urinalysis that was specified 
in the commander's report and upon which the Air Force now seeks to base 
a less than honorable discharge.
    (2) The full complement of procedural protections that are required 
by current regulations.
    (3) Name, address and telephone number of an Area Defense Counsel 
with

[[Page 191]]

whom the former service member has a right to consult, and
    (4) The right to participate in the new proceedings to be conducted 
at the Air Force base nearest the former service member's current 
address, or to elect to maintain his or her present character of 
discharge.
    (g) Equity. A discharge shall be deemed to be equitable unless:
    (1) In the course of a discharge review, it is determined that the 
policies and procedures under which the applicant was discharged differ 
in material respects from policies and procedures currently applicable 
on a service-wide basis to discharges of the type under consideration 
provided that:
    (i) Current policies or procedures represent a substantial 
enhancement of the rights afforded an applicant in such proceedings; and
    (ii) There is substantial doubt that the applicant would have 
received the same discharge if relevant current policies and procedures 
had been available to the applicant at the time of the discharge 
proceedings under consideration.
    (2) At the time of issuance, the discharge was inconsistent with 
standards of discipline in the Air Force; or
    (3) In the course of a discharge review, it is determined that a 
change is warranted based upon consideration of the applicant's military 
record and other evidence presented to the DRB viewed in conjunction 
with the factors listed in this section and the regulations under which 
the applicant was discharged, even though the discharge was determined 
to have been otherwise equitable and proper at the time of issuance. 
Areas of consideration include, but are not limited to:
    (i) Quality of Service, as evidenced by factors such as:
    (A) Service History, including date of enlistment, period of 
enlistment, highest rank achieved, conduct or efficiency ratings 
(numerical or narrative).
    (B) Awards and decorations.
    (C) Letters of commendation or reprimand.
    (D) Combat service.
    (E) Wounds received in action.
    (F) Record of promotions and demotions.
    (G) Level of responsibility at which the applicant served.
    (H) Other acts of merit that may not have resulted in a formal 
recognition through an award or commendation.
    (I) Length of service during the period which is the subject of the 
discharge review.
    (J) Prior military service and type of discharge received or 
outstanding post-service conduct to the extent that such matters provide 
a basis for a more thorough understanding of the performance of the 
applicant during the period of service which is the subject of the 
discharge review.
    (K) Convictions by court-martial.
    (L) Record of non-judicial punishment.
    (M) Convictions by civil authorities while a member of the Air 
Force, reflected in the discharge proceedings or otherwise noted in 
military records.
    (N) Record of periods of unauthorized absence.
    (O) Records relating to a discharge in lieu of court-martial.
    (ii) Capability to Serve, as evidenced by factors such as:
    (A) Total Capabilities. This includes an evaluation of matters such 
as age, educational level, and aptitude scores. Consideration may also 
be given to whether the individual met normal military standards of 
acceptability for military service and similar indicators of an 
individual's ability to serve satisfactorily, as well as ability to 
adjust to the military service.
    (B) Family/Personal Problems. This includes matters in extenuation 
or mitigation of the reason for discharge that may have affected the 
applicant's ability to serve satisfactorily.
    (C) Arbitrary or Capricious Actions. This includes actions by 
individuals in authority which constitute a clear abuse of such 
authority and which, although not amounting to prejudicial error, may 
have contributed to the decision to discharge or to the characterization 
of service.
    (D) Discrimination. This includes unauthorized acts as documented by 
records or other evidence.

<R05>
Sec. 881.1  Explanation of terms.

    (a) Active military service. The same as in section 101, title 38, 
United States Code.
    (b) Applicant. A person who applies for a discharge based on 
membership in a group determined by the Secretary of the Air Force to 
have performed active military service with the US Air Force or a 
predecessor organization. An application may be made on behalf of such a 
person, if he or she is deceased or mentally incompetent, by the spouse, 
next of kin, or legal representative.
    (c) Certified group. A group that has been determined by the 
Secertary of the Air Force to have rendered service that constituted 
active military service.
    (d) Characterization of service. A determination reflecting a 
member's behavior and performance of duty during a specific period of 
service. Under this part, service may be characterized as: (1) 
Honorable, or (2) Under Honorable Conditions (General Discharge).
    (e) Discharge. Complete severance from the active military service 
on which the application for discharge is based. Also, the assignment of 
a reason for such discharge and characterization of service.
    (f) Group. An organization similar to the Women's Air-forces Service 
Pilots, and whose members rendered service to the Armed Forces of the 
United States in a capacity considered civilian employment or 
contractual service at the time such service was rendered.


<R05>
Sec. 881.2  General guidance.

    (a) Group determinations. Acting as the Executive Agent for the 
Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Air Force will determine 
whether the service rendered by a group shall be considered active 
military service for the purpose of all laws administered by the 
Veterans Administration.
    (b) Individual applications for discharge.
    (1) Following the determination by the Secretary of the Air Force 
that the service of a group is considered active military service, 
individuals claiming to have been members of that group may apply for 
discharge to the appropriate military department. Applications made to 
the Department of the Air Force will be processed according to this 
part.
    (2) If an applicant is determined to have been a member of a 
certified group, during the dates of its qualification, and the 
characterization of service is honorable or under honorable conditions, 
the Secretary of the Air Force or designee will issue a discharge 
certificate and a DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge From 
Active Duty, to the applicant.


<R05>
Sec. 881.3  Application procedures.

    (a) Who may apply. Any person who claims to be a member of a 
certified group may apply for discharge. An application may be made on

of death or mental incompetency, as appropriate must accompany such an 
application.

[[Page 195]]

    (b) Where to apply. An application for discharge from the Air Force 
may be sent to Headquarters Air Force Manpower and Personnel Center,

    (3) Applications should be as complete as possible. The burden of 
proof is on the applicant. The applicant should provide all available 
evidence to support a claim for membership in the group and to determine 
the character of service performed. The Individual Service Review Board 
will have available a copy of the report of the Advisory Panel to the 
DOD Civilian/Military Service Review Board, which may contain 
information pertinent to individual service.
    (4) Documentation may include, but is not limited to, separation or 
discharge certificates, mission orders, identification cards, contracts 
or personnel action forms, employment records, education certificates, 
diplomas, pay vouchers, certificates of awards, casualty information, 
and any other supporting evidence of membership, or character of service 
performed.
    (5) The Air Force will not provide representation by counsel for the 
applicant, nor will it defray costs of such representation under any 
circumstances.
    (d) When to apply. There is no specific time for submitting an 
application for discharge.


<R05>
Sec. 881.4  Application screening.

    HQ AFMPC/MPCDOAI will acknowledge receipt of each application. The 
application will then be reviewed to see if it is proper and complete.
    (a) An application that should be considered by another military 
department will be referred to that department, and the applicant will 
be sent a written notice or a copy of the referral letter.
    (b) If the Secretary of the Air Force has not made a determination 
concerning the particular group in which an applicant claims membership, 
the applicant will be returned without prejudice. An application may be 
resubmitted after Secretarial determination that the group is certified.
    (c) Applications made by a group (or individuals on behalf of a 
group) are not processed under this part. If such applications are 
received, they are to be referred to the Secretary of the Air Force, 
Manpower, Reserve Affairs and Installations, Personnel Council (SAF/
MIPC). The Pentagon, Washington DC 20330, for further review.
    (d) Incomplete applications will be returned to the applicant 
without prejudicing later consideration.
    (e) All proper, complete applications will be referred to the 
Individual Service Review Board for further consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 881.5  Individual Service Review Board.

    (a) Purpose. The Individual Service Review Board is established by 
the Secretary of the Air Force at AFMPC to:
    (1) Review applications for discharge under this part.
    (2) Make findings of fact based on evidence submitted; and,
    (3) Based on those findings, act further on the application as 
outlined in section 6 of this part.
    (b) Composition. The Board consists of military members in grade 
lieutenant coloniel or higher, and civilian members, grade GS-12 or 
higher, appointed by the Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff, Manpower and 
Personnel for Military Personnel (HQ USAF/MPC). Three members constitute 
a quorum. The senior member acts as Board chairperson. A nonvoting 
recorder keeps a record of the Board's actions concerning an 
application.
    (c) Administrative support. The Directorate of Personnel Program 
Actions, Separation Programs and Procedures

[[Page 196]]

Branch (HQ AFMPC/MPCAKP), Randolph AFB TX 78150, provides administrative 
support to the Board.


<R05>
Sec. 881.6  Application processing.

    (a) Individual Service Review Board. The Board meets in closed 
session and considers the application, all evidence submitted, and other 
relevant information available. Applicants or their representatives do 
not have the right to appear before the Boards.
    (b) Board findings. The Board makes findings of fact based on the 
evidence and information available, and determines whether the applicant 
was a member of a certified group during the dates of its qualification 
and, accordingly, whether the application for discharge should be 
approved or disapproved.
    (c) Board determinations. The Board determines that the application 
for discharge should be approved; the Board also determines the period 
and character of the applicant's service.
    (d) Approved applications. (1) If the Board approves an application 
for discharge and determines that the service characterization should be 
DD Form 256 AF, Honorable Discharge, and a DD Form 214, under AFR 35-6. 
A military grade will be entered on the DD Form 214 only upon an 
individual request from the administrator of Veteran's Affairs. For the 
purpose of Veteran's Administration benefits, a pay grade is needed only 
in cases when an individual was killed or received service-related 
injuries or disease during the approved period of service. Proof of 
grade criteria, in order of importance, is cited in DOD 1000.20, Section 
G, paragraph 5.
    (2) If the Board approves an application for discharge but 
determines that the service characterization should be ``Under Honorable 
Conditions'' (General Discharge), the case is forwarded to the SAF/MIPC 
for a final decision. After the final decision on the case, HQ AFMPC/
MPCDOAI issues the appropriate discharge certificate and a DD Form 214 
to the applicant.
    (3) If the applicant challenges the characterization of a discharge 
issued by the Air Force, the applicant may appeal the characterization 
by submitting DD Form 149, Application for Correction of Military or 
Naval Records, to the Secretary of the Air Force through HQ AFMPC/
MPCDOAI.
    (4) If member was killed during the period of equivalent active 
military duty, the Assistant for Casualty and Mortuary Matters, Casualty 
Division (HQ AFMPC/MPCCA) will issue a DD Form 1300, Report of Casualty, 
including military pay grade, according to DODI 1300.9 (AFR 30-25, 
Casualty Services).
    (e) Application denial actions: (1) If the Board determines that an 
application for discharge should be denied because there is insufficient 
evidence to show that the applicant was a member of a qualifying group, 
or if the Board determines that the applicant's service cannot be 
characterized at least under honorable conditions, HQ AFMPC/MPCDOAI 
notifies the applicant of the determination.
    (2) The applicant has 60 days from the date of this notice to submit 
additional evidence or information to HQ AFMPC/MPCDOAI, Randolph AFB TX 
78150, for the Board's consideration.
    (3) After 60 days, the Board reviews the case again if additional 
evidence or information is submitted. If the Board determines that the 
application now merits approval, further action on the case follows as 
outlined in Sec. 881.6(d).
    (4) If the applicant fails to submit additional evidence or 
information or if, after review, the Board determines that the 
application should be denied, the case is sent to the SAF/MIPC for final 
decision on the question of discharge and character of service.
    (i) The Airman Actions Branch (HQ AFMPC/MPCDOA) notifies the 
applicant of the final decision and, if appropriate, issues the 
discharge documents.
    (ii) An application that is denied is returned to the applicant, 
without prejudicing any later consideration.
    (f) Discharge upgrade. If a General Discharge is approved, the 
recipient may apply to the Air Force Discharge Review Board for 
discharge upgrade under AFR 20-10 or to the Air Force Board for 
Correction of Military Records under AFR 31-3. HQ AFMPC/MPDOA will 
provide copies of these regulations and application forms to individuals 
who received a General Discharge.

[[Page 197]]

<R05>
Sec. 884.0  Purpose.

    This part sets forth the authority, policy, and procedures for 
making Air Force military and civilian personnel as well as dependents 
available to U.S. civil authorities for trial, or specified court 
appearances. It implements 32 CFR part 146. It applies to all Air Force 
military personnel, including Reserve members while on active or

for the purpose of executing criminal process, proceeds by service of 
process to take custody of a military member, employee or dependent 
without making a formal request for the individual's delivery. This part 
is not intended to confer any rights, benefits, privileges or form of 
due process procedure upon any individuals.


<R04>
                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>

[[Page 198]]

an installation or support group commander when authorized by the 
officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction, may authorize 
delivery of a member of his or her command to the civil authorities of 
the United States or of a state of the United States under the 
conditions prescribed in this part. An installation commander given 
authority to approve requests made pursuant to this part may delegate 
such approval authority to a commander of a combat support group, air 
base group, mission support squadron, or equivalent.


<R05>
Sec. 884.2  Requests under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act.

    The Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act (Act), 18 U.S.C. App. 
section 1 et seq., is a compact entered into by most of the 50 states, 
the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the 
United States. The Act applies to military prisoners and is implemented 
by this section. The purpose of the Act is to encourage the expeditions 
and orderly disposition of charges outstanding against a prisoner and 
determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on 
untried indictments, informations, or complaints. The Act provides a way 
for the prisoner to be tried on charges pending before state courts, 
either at the prisoner's request or at the request of the state where 
the charges are pending. When a request under the Act is received from 
either the prisoner or state authorities, the procedures set out in 18 
U.S.C. App. section 1 et seq., should be followed. The Act applies only 
to ``a person who has entered upon a term of imprisonment in a penal or 
correctional institution'' and is therefore inapplicable to members in 
pretrial confinement.


<R05>
Sec. 884.3  Release on bail or recognizance.

    The civil authority to whom a military member is delivered under 
this part may release the member on bail or on the member's own 
recognizance before final disposition of the charges. In the event of 
such a release, the commander authorized to deliver the member, or his 
or her designee, must, before delivery, direct the member in writing to 
report to a designated Air Force unit, activity or recruiting office for 
further instructions (see Sec. 884.18). If the civil authorities to whom 
delivery was authorized are in the immediate vicinity of the member's 
base, the activity designated ordinarily will be the member's unit. The 
Air Force unit, activity, or recruiting office designated will be 
advised of this action by the commander taking this action. The 
authority to whom the member reports must communicate, by the fastest 
practicable means, the member's name, rank, SSN, organization, and other 
pertinent information to, and request disposition instructions from, the 
commander who authorized the delivery of the member to civil 
authorities, with an information copy to the HQ AFMPC assignment office 
responsible for the member's Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC), as listed 
in Air Force Regulation 36-20 \1\ or Air Force Regulation 39-11. If 
contact with such commander is not feasible, instructions must be 
obtained from HQ AFMPC/DPMARS or DPMRPP2.

<R05>
Sec. 884.4  Placing member under restraint pending delivery.

    A member may be placed under restraint (see Manual for Courts-
Martial (MCM) 1984, Rule for Court-Martial (R.C.M.) 304, as to types of 
restraint available) by military authorities pending delivery to state 
or federal authorities. Such restraint may be imposed upon receipt of 
information establishing probable cause to believe that the member 
committed an offense, and upon reasonable belief such restraint is 
necessary. Such restraint may continue only for such time as is 
reasonably necessary to effect the delivery to civilian authorities. As 
to the type of analysis to be undertaken in determining whether probable 
cause exists and whether a reasonable belief exists that restraint is 
necessary, see MCM 1984, R.C.M. 305(h)(2)(B), and its following 
discussion. There is no requirement for the formal review of restraint 
provided in MCM 1984, R.C.M. 305, Air Force Regulation 111-1.

Sec. 884.5  Returning members, employees, and dependents from overseas who fail to comply with court orders or custody decrees or who are sought for parental 
          kidnapping.

    Persons overseas who are wanted by state or federal authorities are 
expected to make themselves available to those authorities for proper 
disposition. If this does not occur, 32 CFR part 146, which implements 
10 U.S.C. 814 and Pub. L. 100-456, section 721(a), authorizes and 
requires commanders to respond promptly to request from civil 
authorities for assistance in returning members, civilian employees, and 
dependents from overseas (subpart C of this part).


<R04>
  Subpart B--Requests by Authorities for Military Personnel Stationed 
              Within the United States and its Possessions


<R05>
Sec. 884.6  Policy on delivery.

    When such authorities request the delivery of service members, it is 
Air Force policy normally to deliver service members when the request is 
accompanied by a warrant issued pursuant to the Federal Rules of 
Criminal Procedure, Rule 4, or when the appropriately identified federal 
officer represents that such a warrant has been issued (MCM 1984, 
appendix 3).


<R05>
Sec. 884.7  Delivery to Federal authorities.

    Persons desired by the federal authorities for trial will be called 
for, and taken into custody by, a U.S. marshal, deputy marshal, or other 
officer authorized by law. The officer taking custody must execute a 
statement in substantially the following form:

    A warrant for the arrest of (name, grade, and social security 
number), hereinafter referred to as the ``member,'' who is charged with 
(offense), has been issued by (name of issuer), and in execution 
thereof, I accept his or her custody.
    The commander (Unit), will be advised of the disposition of the 
charges. The member will be immediately returned to the custody of the 
Air Force at (Air Force activity or recruiting office nearest place of 
trial) upon completion of the trial if acquitted, upon satisfying the 
sentence imposed if convicted, or upon other disposition of the case. 
The member's return will not be required if the member's commander has 
indicated that return is not appropriate. Pending disposition of the 
charges, the member will remain in the custody of (name of agency and 
location), unless released on bail or the member's own recognizance, in 
which event (Air Force unit, activity or recruiting office nearest place 
of trial) will be notified.


<R05>
Sec. 884.8  Requests by authorities of the state in which the member requested is located.

    (a) Policy on delivery. It is Air Force policy normally to turn over 
to the civilian authorities of the state, upon their request, Air Force 
members charged with an offense against civil authority. There 
ordinarily will be required with each request by the state authorities 
for the surrender of a member of the armed forces, a copy of an 
indictment, information, or other document used in the state to prefer 
charges.
    (b) Delivery to state authorities. Before making delivery to civil 
authorities of a state, the commander having authority to deliver will 
obtain from the Governor or other duly authorized officer of such state, 
a written agreement substantially in the following form:

    In consideration of the delivery at (location) of (name, grade, and 
social security number), hereinafter referred to as the ``member,'' to 
me (name and capacity), for trial upon the charge of (offense), I, 
pursuant to the authority vested in me as (position), hereby agree to 
the following:
    The commander, (unit), will be advised of the disposition of the 
charges. The member will be immediately returned to the custody of the 
military upon completion of the trial if acquitted, upon satisfying the 
sentence imposed if convicted, or upon other disposition of the case. 
The member's return will be to the aforesaid place of delivery, or to 
such other place as may be designated by the Department of the Air 
Force. The member's return will not be required if the member's 
commander has indicated that return is not appropriate. Instead of 
actual delivery, transportation for the member may be arranged so long 
as it is without expense to the United States or to the member. Pending 
dispositon of the charges, the member will remain in the custody of 
(name of agency and location), unless released on bail or the member's 
own recognizance, in which event

[[Page 200]]

(Air Force unit, activity, or recruiting office nearest place of trial) 
will be notified.
Where, under the laws of the state concerned, no authority exists 
permitting agreement to one or more of the conditions set out in the 
form, the commander may authorize modification. This agreement is 
substantially complied with when the Air Force authority who delivered 
the accused is informed of his or her prospective release for return to 
military authorities, and when the individual is furnished 
transportation back to his or her station together with necessary funds 
to cover incidental expenses enroute thereto. Copies of the statement or 
agreement referenced above, and in Sec. 884.7, will be furnished to the 
civil authority to whom the member was delivered and to the Air Force 
unit, activity, or recruiting office nearest to the place of trial 
designated in the agreement as the point of contact in the event of 
release on bail or on recognizance (Sec. 884.3). The commander, who 
authorized delivery to civil authority or designee, will immediately 
notify the civil authority if the return of the member to Air Force 
custody is no longer required (e.g., discharge from the Air Force).


<R05>
Sec. 884.9  Request for delivery by authorities of any state in which the member requested is not located.

    This section applies to requested members who are not located 
overseas. With respect to the extradition process, Air Force ed Force 
personnel have the same status as persons not in the Armed Forces. 
Accordingly, if the delivery of a military member is requested by a 
state other than the state in which the member is located, the 
requesting state will be required, in the absence of a waiver of 
extradition process by the member concerned, to use its extradition 
procedures and to make arrangements to take the individual into custody 
in the state where he or she is located. It is contrary to Air Force 
policy to transfer a military member from a base within one state to a 
base within another state for the purpose of making him or her amenable 
to prosecution by civil authorities.


<R04>
Subpart C--Requests for Custody of Members Stationed Outside the United 
                                 States


<R05>
Sec. 884.10  Air Force policy.

    (a) Air Force members are expected to comply with orders issued by a 
federal or state court of competent jurisdiction unless noncompliance is 
legally justified. Air Force members who persist in noncompliance are 
subject to adverse administrative action, including separation for cause 
under AFRs 36-2 and 39-1.\2\ Such action is taken to improve discipline 
and maintain the standards of conduct expected of Air Force members, but 
not for the purpose of enforcing private civil obligations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ See footnote 1 in Sec. 884.3.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Air Force officials will ensure that members do not use 
assignments or officially sponsored residence outside the United States 
to avoid complying with valid orders of a federal or state court of 
competent jurisdiction.
    (c) Noncompliance with a court order may be legally justified when 
the individual can adequately demonstrate that the conduct, which is the 
subject of the complaint or request, was sanctioned by supplemental 
court orders, equally valid court orders of other jurisdictions, good 
faith legal efforts to resist the request, or other reasons. HQ USAF/
JACM and JACA, and Air Force legal offices in the jurisdiction concerned 
will provide legal support to servicing staff judge advocates who 
request assistance in reviewing these issues.
    (d) When federal, state or local authorities request delivery of an 
Air Force member who is stationed outside the United States and who is 
convicted of or is charged by such authorities with a felony or other 
serious offense punishable by confinement for more than one year under 
the laws of the requesting jurisdiction, or who is sought by such 
authorities in connection with the unlawful or contemptuous taking of a 
child from the jurisdiction of a court or from the lawful custody of 
another, the member normally will be expeditiously returned to the 
United States for delivery to the requesting authorities. Delivery of 
the member is not required if the controversy can be resolved without 
returning the member to the United States, or the request for delivery 
of the member is denied in accordance with this subpart.
    (e) An Air Force member stationed outside the United States 
ordinarily will not be returned to the United

[[Page 201]]

States for delivery to civilian authorities in connection with an 
offense not enumerated in paragraph (d) of this section, but The Judge 
Advocate General (TJAG) may direct return in such cases when TJAG 
determines that the best interests of the Air Force require it.
    (f) Before action is taken under this subpart, the member will be 
afforded the opportunity to provide evidence of legal efforts to resist 
the court order or process sought to be enforced, or otherwise to show 
legitimate cause for noncompliance.


<R05>
Sec. 884.11  Assigned responsibilities.

    (a) The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Force Management and 
Personnel) (ASD(FM&P)) is the denial authority for all requests for 
return of members to the United States for delivery to civilian 
authorities when the request falls under Sec. 884.10(d) of this subpart.
    (b) The Judge Advocate General (TJAG) of the Air Force may approve 
requests which fall under Sec. 884.10(d) of this subpart, or recommend 
denial of such requests. TJAG or his designee may approve or deny:
    (1) Requests for return of members to the United States for delivery 
to civilian authorities when the request falls under Sec. 884.10(e) of 
this subpart.
    (2) Requests for delays of up to 90 days in completing action on 
requests for return of members to the United States for delivery to 
civilian authorities.
    (c) The Military Justice Division (HQ USAF/JAJM) is responsible for 
the timely processing of requests for return of members to the United 
States for delivery to civilian authorities, and for notifying 
requesting authorities of decisions on requests. Action on a request 
will be completed within 30 days after receipt of the request by HQ 
USAF/JAJM, unless a delay is granted. HQ USAF/JAJM also is responsible 
for all reports and notifications to ASD (FM&P) and General Counsel, DOD 
(DOD/GC), as required by this part. HQ USAF/JAJM will conduct all 
communications with requesters.


<R05>
Sec. 884.12  Procedures for return of an Air Force member to the United States.

    (a) A request for return of an Air Force member to the United States 
for delivery to civilian authorities shall:
    (1) Fully identify the member sought. Requesting agencies shall 
provide the members' name, grade, social security number (SSN), and unit 
of assignment, to the extent that information is known.
    (2) Specify the offense for which the member is sought. If the 
member is charged with a crime, the request shall specify the maximum 
punishment under the laws of the requesting jurisdiction. If the member 
is sought in connection with the unlawful or contemptuous taking of a 
child from the jurisdiction of a court or the lawful custody of another, 
the request should so specify.
    (3) Include copies of all relevant indictments, informations, or 
other instruments used to bring charges, all relevant court orders or 
decrees, and all arrest warrants, writs of attachment or capias, or 
other process directing or authorizing the requesting authorities to 
take the member into custody. Reports of investigation and other 
material concerning the background of the case shall be included, if 
reasonably available.
    (4) State that the requesting authorities will initiate appropriate 
action to secure the member's lawful delivery or extradition from the 
port of entry to the requesting jurisdiction, at the expense of the 
requesting authorities, and that they will notify HQ USAF/JAJM of the 
member's release from custody and the ultimate disposition of the 
matter.
    (5) Be signed by a United States Attorney or Assistant U.S. 
Attorney, by the Governor or other duly authorized officer of a 
requesting state or local jurisdiction, or by the judge, magistrate or 
clerk of a court of competent jurisdiction.
    (b) Requests for return of members to the United States for delivery 
to civilian authorities shall be directed to HQ USAF/JAJM, Bolling AFB, 
DC 20332-6128. Requests received by any other Air Force agency or 
official must be

[[Page 202]]

sent to HQ USAF/JAJM by the most expeditious available means.
    (c) Upon receipt of a request, HQ USAF/JAJM will promptly notify the 
members' commander, who will consult with his or her servicing staff 
judge advocate and provide to HQ USAF/JAJM, through command channels, a 
report of relevant facts and circumstances and recommended disposition 
of the request. If the commander recommends denial of the request, or a 
delay in processing or approving it, he or she will provide the 
information specified in Sec. 884.13 or Sec. 884.14 of this subpart.
    (d) When a request for return of a member to the United States for 
delivery to civilian authorities has been approved, HQ USAF/JAJM will 
notify AFMPC of the decision to return a member to the United States 
under this subpart. AFMPC will issue permanent change of station (PCS) 
orders assigning the member to an installation as close to the 
requesting jurisdiction as possible, in light of the needs of the Air 
Force for personnel in the member's grade and AFSC.
    (e) The requesting authorities will be notified concerning the 
member's new assignment, port of entry into the United States, and 
estimated time of arrival. Absent unusual circumstances, this 
notification will be made at least 10 days before the member's return.


<R05>
Sec. 884.13  Delays in returning members to the United States.

    (a) A delay of not more than 90 days in completing action on a 
request to return a member to the United States for delivery to civilian 
authorities may be granted when:
    (1) Efforts are in progress to resolve the controversy to the 
satisfaction of the requesting authorities without the member's return 
to the United States.
    (2) Additional time is required to permit the member to provide 
satisfactory evidence of legal efforts to resist the request or show 
legitimate cause for noncompliance.
    (3) Additional time is required to permit the commander to determine 
and present the specific effect of the loss of the member on command 
mission and readiness, or pertinent facts and circumstances relating to 
any international agreement, foreign judicial proceeding, DOD, Air 
Force, or other military department, investigation, or court-martial 
affecting the member.
    (4) Other unusual facts or circumstances warrant delay.
    (b) HQ USAF/JAJM will promptly report all delays in cases falling 
under Sec. 884.10(d) of this subpart, through SAF/GC and SAF/MI 
ASD(FM&P), and to DOD/GC.
    (c) Delays in excess of 90 days are not authorized in cases falling 
under Sec. 884.10(d) of this subpart, unless approved by ASD (FM&P).


<R05>
Sec. 884.14  Denials of a request for return of a member to the United States.

    (a) Denial of a request for return of a member to the United States 
for delivery to civilian authorities may be justified when:
    (1) The member's return would have an adverse impact on operational 
readiness or mission requirements.
    (2) The member's return is precluded by an applicable international 
agreement.
    (3) The member is the subject of foreign judicial proceedings, 
court-martial, or a DOD, Air Force, or other military department 
investigation.
    (4) The member has shown satisfactory evidence of legal efforts to 
resist the request or other legitimate cause for noncompliance.
    (5) Other unusual facts or circumstances warrant a denial.
    (b) Commanders shall promptly send to HQ USAF/JAJM information 
suggesting that denial may be appropriate. In cases warranting denial, 
TJAG will promptly send a recommendation and supporting documentation, 
through SAF/GC and SAF/MI, to ASD(FM&P) for decision.
    (c) The fact that a recommendation for denial is pending does not by 
itself authorize noncompliance, or a delay in compliance, with any 
provision of this part, but TJAG may consider a pending request for 
denial in determining whether to grant a delay.

   Subpart D--Compliance with Court Orders by Civilian Employees and 
                               Dependents


<R05>
Sec. 884.15  Policy on complying.

    (a) Air Force civilian employees and dependents are expected to 
comply with orders issued by a federal or state court of competent 
jurisdiction unless noncompliance is legally justified. Air Force 
civilian employees who persist in noncompliance are subject to adverse 
administrative action, including separation for cause, as provided in 
AFRs 40-7, 40-735, 40-750, and 147-15.\3\ Such action is taken to 
improve discipline and maintain the standards of conduct expected of Air 
Force employees, but not for the purpose of enforcing private civil 
obligations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See footnote 1 in Sec. 884.3.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Air Force officials will ensure that civilian personnel and 
dependents do not use assignments or officially sponsored residence 
outside the United States to avoid complying with valid orders of a 
federal or state court of competent jurisdiction.
    (c) Noncompliance with a court order may be legally justified when 
the individual can adequately demonstrate that the conduct, which is the 
subject of the complaint or request, was sanctioned by supplemental 
court orders, equally valid court orders of other jurisdictions, good 
faith legal efforts to resist the request, or other reasons. HQ USAF/
JACM, and JACA, and Air Force legal offices in the jurisdiction 
concerned will provide legal support to servicing staff judge advocates 
who request assistance in reviewing these issues.


<R05>
Sec. 884.16  Procedure involving a request by federal or state authorities for custody of an overseas civilian employee or a command sponsored dependent.

    (a) The procedures of this subpart apply to the following persons:
    (1) Civilian employees, including nonappropriated fund 
instrumentality (NAFI) employees, who are assigned outside the United 
States.
    (2) Dependents residing outside the United States.
    (b) This subpart applies only when Air Force authorities receive a 
request for assistance (see Sec. 884.12 of this part) from federal, 
state or local authorities involving noncompliance with a court order 
and noncompliance is the subject of any of the following: an arrest 
warrant; an indictment, information, or other document used in the 
jurisdiction to prefer charges; or a contempt citation involving the 
unlawful or contemptuous removal of a child from the jurisdiction of the 
court or the lawful custody of a parent or third party.
    (c) Commanders will comply with requests to the maximum extent 
possible consistent with operational readiness, mission requirements, 
provisions of international agreements and foreign court orders, DOD and 
military department investigations, and courts-martial. If, after all 
reasonable efforts have been exhausted (see Sec. 884.13 of this part), 
the matter cannot be resolved without the employee or dependent 
returning to the United States, then the commander shall:
    (1) Strongly encourage the individual to comply; and,
    (2) Consider imposing disciplinary action (including removal) 
against the employee or withdrawing command sponsorship of the 
dependent, as appropriate, for failure to comply.


<R05>
Sec. 884.17  Reporting requests for assistance and action.

    The commander or designee will report promptly by message each 
request for assistance and intended action. Send reports to HQ USAF/
JAJM, who in turn will submit required reports through channels to 
ASD(FM&P). HQ USAF/JAJM will conduct all communication with requesters.


<R05>
Sec. 884.18  Format letter.

    Subject: Instructions in Case of Release on Bail or Recognizance.
    1. You are being released to the custody of civil authorities under 
the provisions of AFR 111-11. This action does not constitute a 
discharge from the Air Force. If you are released from civil custody on 
bail or on your own recognizance, report immediately in person or by 
telephone to the (Air Force unit, activity, or recruiting office) for 
further instructions. Advise the commander of your name, grade, SSN, 
organization, the circumstances of your release from custody,

[[Page 204]]

and the contents of this letter, including the Note below.
    2. Certain restrictions may be placed upon you by the civil 
authorities in connection with your temporary release from custody. Be 
certain to include in your report what these limitations are.
(Signature element)
    Note: Section 884.3 provides that the authority to whom you will 
report will advise the commander who authorized your delivery to civil 
authorities, or if that is not possible, HQ AFMPC/DPMARS or DPMRPP2, by 
the fastest means available. Your name, grade, SSN, organization, and 
other pertinent circumstances will be provided and further instructions 
will be requested.

<R05>
Sec. 887.0  Purpose.

    This part tells who may apply for a certificate in lieu of a lost or 
destroyed certificate of separation. It explains where and how to apply. 
It implements 10 U.S.C. 1041 and DOD Instruction 1332.13, December 23, 
1968. This publication applies to ANG and USAFR members. It authorizes 
collection of information protected by the Privacy Act of 1974. The 
authority to collect the information is title 10, U.S.C. 8912 and 
Executive Order 9397. Each form used to collect personal information has 
an associated Privacy Act Statement that will be given to the individual 
before information is collected. System of records notice F035 AF MP C, 
Military Personnel Records System, applies.


<R05>
Sec. 887.1  Explanation of terms.

    (a) Certificate in lieu (CIL). A certificate issued in lieu of a 
lost or destroyed certificate of service, discharge, or retirement.
    (b) Service person. One who:
    (1) Is currently serving as a member of the Air Force; or
    (2) Formerly served in the active military service as a member of 
the Air Force and all military affiliation was terminated after 
September 25, 1947.
    (c) Surviving spouse. A survivor who was legally married to a member 
of the service at the time of the member's death.
    (d) Guardian. A person or group of persons legally placed in charge 
of the affairs of a service member adjudicated mentally incompetent.


<R05>
Sec. 887.2  Safeguarding certificates.

    Certificates of separation are important personal documents. 
Processing applications for CILs is costly to the Air Force. To keep 
requests for CILs at a minimum:
    (a) Personnel officers will tell members of the importance of 
safeguarding the original certificates.
    (b) Persons who issue CILs will type or stamp across the lower 
margin ``THIS IS AN IMPORTANT RECORD--SAFEGUARD IT'' (if it is not 
printed on the certificate).

    Note: Do not show this legend on DD Form 363AF, Certificate of 
Retirement.


<R05>
Sec. 887.3  Persons authorized CILs.

    CILs may be issued only to:
    (a) A service member whose character of service was honorable or 
under honorable conditions.
    (b) A surviving spouse.
    (c) A guardian, when a duly certified or otherwise authenticated 
copy of the court order of appointment is sent with the application.


<R05>
Sec. 887.4  Requesting CILs.

    (a) Standard Form 180 (SF 180), Request Pertaining to Military 
Records, should be used by persons who had service as shown in 
Sec. 887.3(a). However, a letter request, with sufficient identifying 
data and proof that the original

[[Page 205]]

certificate of separation was lost or destroyed, may be used. Members on 
active duty will forward their applications through their unit 
commander.
    (b) SF 180, or any similar form used by agencies outside the 
Department of Defense, will be used by persons shown in Sec. 887.3(b), 
(c), and Sec. 887.7.

    Note: Persons authorized CILs may be assisted in their request by 
the Customer Service Unit (DPMAC) in the consolidated base personnel 
office.


<R05>
Sec. 887.5  Issuing CILs.

    The issuing authority makes sure that the proper CIL form is issued, 
particularly if the service member has had service in both the Army and 
Air Force. The assignment status as of September 26, 1947 determines if 
the person was in the Army or Air Force at the time of discharge or 
release from active duty. Separations that took place on or before 
September 25, 1947 are considered Army separations. Those that took 
place on or after September 26, 1947 are considered Air Force 
separations, unless the records clearly show the person actually served 
as a member of the Army during the period of service for which the CIL 
is requested. Individuals indicated in Sec. 887.3 may be issued CILs 
prepared on one of the following forms:
    (a) DD Form 303AF, Certificate in Lieu of Lost or Destroyed 
Discharge, is used to replace any lost or destroyed certificate of 
discharge from the Air Force.
    (b) DD Form 363AF, Certificate of Retirement, is used to replace any 
lost or destroyed certificate of retirement from the Air Force (issued

    Source: 43 FR 4605, Feb. 3, 1978, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 888g.1  Purpose.

    This part establishes policies and guidelines for dealing with 
individuals and organizations whose objective is to organize or 
represent military members of the Air Force for the purpose of 
negotiation or collective bargaining over terms or conditions of 
military service, prohibits Air Force commanders and supervisors from 
engaging in negotiation or collective bargaining, and prohibits military 
personnel from engaging in strikes and other concerted activities, on-
base recruitment, and active membership in organizations which would 
engage in such activities.


<R05>
Sec. 888g.2  Applicability.

    (a) This part does not modify or diminish the existing authority of 
commanders to control access to, or maintain good order and discipline 
on, military installations; nor does it change or lessen the obligations 
of commanders and supervisors pursuant to Executive Order 11491 with 
respect to organizations representing Department of the Air Force 
civilian employees.

[[Page 207]]

    (b) This part applies to all active duty military personnel, members 
of Reserve components on inactive duty training, civilian employees, and 
to individuals and groups entering, using or seeking to enter or use Air 
Force installations. Violations of the specific prohibitions of this 
part by military members of the Air Force may result in prosecution 
under the UCMJ or administrative action.
    (c) This part implements DOD Directive 1354.1, Relationships With 
Organizations Which Seek to Represent Members of the Armed Forces in 
Negotiation or Collective Bargaining, October 6, 1977.


<R05>
Sec. 888g.3  Policy on unionization of military personnel.

    (a) The mission of the Air Force is to safeguard the security of the 
United States. The Air Force must be ready to execute its 
responsibilities in supporting that role with absolute reliability and 
immediate responsiveness. Essential to maintaining this state of 
readiness are the military requirements of control, discipline, and 
prompt obedience to lawful orders of command. The chain of command must 
remain unencumbered by outside influence or obstruction of authority.
    (b) The Air Force recognizes the important contributions which 
organized labor has made to the social and economic development of our 
nation. Civilian labor unions are an integral part of everyday Air Force 
activities. However, the traditional union functions of collective or 
concerted actions would impair the control of Air Force commanders over 
military personnel so as to threaten the security of the United States. 
Air Force commanders could not maintain readiness, be responsive to 
contingency plans or accomplish their missions if required to bargain 
over their orders, consult over decisions, or be subject to collective 
actions of any sort.
    (c) Any individual or organization which seeks to intrude on the 
relationship between commanders and military members of the Air Force in 
matters relating to mission accomplishment or terms or conditions of 
military service, presents a clear danger to discipline, loyalty, and 
obedience to lawful orders of command and such interference will not be 
permitted.


<R05>
Sec. 888g.4  Explanation of terms.

    (a) Aid and abet means to be present during the commission of any 
act prohibited by this regulation and to assist, command, counsel or 
otherwise encourage such an act.
    (b) Air Force installation includes bases, stations, sites, aircraft

    (c) Civilian employee includes Executive Schedule, Scientific and 
Technical, General Schedule, Wage Board, and Nonappropriated Fund

persons that is intended to and does obstruct or interfere with the 
performance of a military duty assignment.
    (e) Conspire means to join or agree with one or more persons to 
commit any act prohibited by this part.
    (f) Installation commander means the senior host wing or equivalent 
commander. Major commanders may designate the commander of a higher 
level organization to enforce the provisions of this part when two or 
more organizations of the host command are located at the same

inactive duty training and members of the Air National Guard of the 
United States and United States Air Force Reserve while serving in a

commander or supervisor, military or civilian, acting on behalf of the 
United States, engages in discussions with a military member or members 
of the Air Force (purporting to represent such members), or with an 
individual group, organization, or association purporting to represent 
such members, for the purpose of resolving bilaterally, terms or 
conditions of military service.

determination, and
    (3) The military members intend to promote the conduct upon which

    (4) The military members actively participate in activities of the

    (e) General Prohibitions. Military members of the Air Force will not

prohibited in this part.


<R05>

    (a) The Secretary of the Air Force is responsible for making 
determinations as required by Sec. 888g.5(c)(2) and 888g.5(d)(1), and 
for the selective application of such determinations to particular Air 
Force installations on a case-by-case basis. Guidelines for making these 
determinations are contained in Sec. 888g.10. Section 888g.11 lists 
those Air Force installations where selective application has been 
invoked by the Secretary of the Air Force. Section 888g.12 lists those 
organizations which have been determined to present a clear danger to 
discipline, loyalty, or obedience to lawful orders of command.
    (b) Installation commanders:
    (1) Are responsible for enforcement of Sec. 888g.5 (a), (b), (c)(1), 
and (e), which automatically apply to all personnel and Sec. 888g.5 
(c)(2) and (d)(1) after a determination is made by the Secretary of the 
Air Force.
    (2) Will gather the facts and data needed by the Secretary of the 
Air Force to make determinations required by this part. The limitations 
on obtaining information on persons or organizations not affiliated with 
the Department of Defense imposed by part 954 of this chapter will be 
strictly complied with.
    (3) Will report through intermediate commanders to their major 
commander, with information to HQ USAF/DPXX/JACM, Pentagon, Washington, 
DC, all incidents concerning requests for permission or attempts to 
engage in activities prohibited by this part. The checklist/form at 
Sec. 888g.13 will be utilized for submitting these reports.
    (4) Will post notices of the determinations made by the Secretary of 
the Air Force affecting their installation which clearly state:
    (i) That the identified organization poses a clear danger to 
discipline, loyalty, or obedience to lawful orders, including the reason 
upon which the determination is based, and
    (ii) That knowing, active membership in that organization by a 
military member with the intent to promote such prohibited conduct is 
not permitted.
    (c) Intermediate commanders will resolve incidents or provide 
guidance to installation commanders as appropriate, or request 
assistance or additional guidance from HQ USAF/DPXX/JACM. HQ USAF/DPXX/
JACM will be an information addressee on all correspondence and messages 
concerning activities addressed by this part and reports of guidance and 
action taken.
    (d) HQ USAF/DPXX/JACM is the Air Staff focal point for activities

identifying incidents and/or conduct prohibited by this part.


<R05>
Sec. 888g.8  Situational guidance.

    To assist installation and intermediate commanders in dealing with 
activities prohibited by this part, guidance for typical situations is 
provided in Sec. 888g.14. This guidance is for example only and is not 
intended to override the judgment of individual commanders or the advice 
of their staff judge advocates.


<R05>
Sec. 888g.9  Military union incident, RCS HAF-DPX(AR) 7701.

    The reports specified in Sec. 888g.7(b)(3) will be furnished as 
required to HQ USAF/DPXX/JACM. The reports will be submitted by 
electrical message in the format of Sec. 888g.13. During periods when 
MINIMIZE is imposed, commanders will consider the severity of the 
activity in approving electrical transmission.

[[Page 210]]


<R05>
Sec. 888g.10  Guidelines for making determinations.

    This part requires that certain determinations be made on the basis 
of facts that exist at particular installations. The guidelines for 
making these determinations are:
    (a) A person or organization poses a clear danger to the discipline, 
loyalty, or obedience to lawful orders when the person or organization, 
or any person on behalf of the organization, engages in, solicits, or 
aids and abets any act prohibited by this part, or violates or conspires 
to violate 18 U.S.C. 1382, or solicits or aids and abets a violation of 
Articles 82, 85, 86, 87, 89, 90, 91, 92, 94, 108, 109, 115, 116, 117 or 
128 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. In making this 
determination, the history and operations of the organization (including 
the constitution and bylaws, if any) or person in question may be 
evaluated along with evidence with respect to the conduct constituting a 
prohibited act. In addition, there must be sufficient evidence to 
support a conclusion that the person or organization is substantially 
likely to engage in a prohibited act.
    (b) In determining whether commission of a prohibited act by 
individual members of an organization can be attributed to that 
organization, examples of factors which should be considered include: 
the frequency of such act; the position in the organization of persons 
committing such act; whether the commission of such act was known by the 
leadership of the organization; and whether the commission of such act 
was condemned or disavowed by the leadership of the organization.
    (c) In determining whether individual contact or posting for public 
display of any poster, handbill, or other writing constitutes or 
includes an invitation to collectively engage in an act prohibited by 
this regulation, specific language of the conversation or written 
material will be considered. In the case of individual conversations, 
determinations will be sensitive to protection of First Amendment rights 
of free speech.
    (d) In making the decision that a military member of the Air Force 
is an ``active'' member of the organization in question, membership must 
be more than merely nominal or passive. Normally a person can be 
considered an active member if he or she engages in certain kinds of 
conduct for the organization. This conduct includes solicitation or 
collection of dues, membership recruitment, distribution of literature, 
service as an officer of the organization, or frequent attendance at 
meetings or activities of the organization.
    (e) In deciding that a military member knows about the prohibited 
conduct engaged in by the organization, such knowledge may be inferred 
if the notice specified in Sec. 888g.7(b)(4) has been properly posted.
    (f) In deciding that a military member intends to promote the 
prohibited conduct engaged in by the organization, his or her conduct 
and/or participation in the organizational activities which constitute 
active membership will be considered.

            Subpart B--Nomination Procedures and Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 901.7  Precandidate evaluation.

    The Air Force Academy conducts a precandidate evaluation program as 
an initial step in the admissions process and as an aid to Members of 
Congress in screening their applicants for nomination.
    (a) Applicants normally are sent a precandidate packet, including 
USAFA Form 149, Precandidate Questionnaire, with a request for the 
applicant to provide academic, athletic, leadership, and medical 
information.
    (b) The Academy evaluates the precandidate information and provides 
an analysis to appropriate congressional offices. Such information gives 
the nominating authorities an indication of the applicant's potential to 
qualify for admission and the applicant's self-reported medical status; 
it does not, however, reflect the applicant's final admission status. It 
is intended only to aid in selecting the best-qualified applicants for 
nomination.
    (c) Applicants whose evaluation indicates they are fully qualified 
will be notified and advised to seek a nomination. Individuals whose 
evaluations reflect areas needing improvement are informed and 
encouraged to submit additional test scores or information in an effort 
to meet the qualifying levels.


<R05>
Sec. 901.8  Congressional and U.S. Possessions categories.

    Individuals who meet the basic eligibility requirements of

Delegate to the House of Representatives, and the Resident Commissioner

Academy at any one time. If a vacancy occurs in their quota, each may 
nominate ten candidates to fill each vacancy.

    (1) These nominating authorities may nominate only if a vacancy 
occurs from their authorized quota of cadets attending the Academy. 
Vacancies normally occur from graduation or separation of cadets from 
the Academy. Failure of a member of a graduating class to complete the 
Academy program with his class does not delay the admission of his or 
her successor. HQ USAF/DPPA maintains the master records of cadets 
nominated and appointed, determines vacancies in each nominating 
authority's quota, and validates nominations submitted by each 
nominating authority.
    (2) These nominating authorities forward their nominations on DD 
Form 1870, Nomination for Appointment to the U.S. Military Academy, 
Naval Academy, or Air Force Academy, for each Air Force Academy nominee

nomination are submitted directly to the Vice President no later than 
October 31. Any individual who meets the basic eligibility requirements 
of Sec. 901.4 may apply to the Vice President for a nomination. The Vice 
President forwards nominations on DD Form 1870 for each Air Force

    (d) Multiple Congressional nominations. For candidates receiving 
numerous nominations, normally the candidate is charged to the 
congressional source. If the candidate is nominated by several 
congressional sources, the candidate normally is charged to the slate of 
the congressional member where the candidate ranks the highest, unless 
the candidate is the principal nominee or a numbered alternate.
    (e) Other sources of nomination. All other candidates not nominated 
by congressional, Vice-Presidential, or U.S. Possessions who are 
appointed are charged to that nominating source (Presidential, AFJROTC, 
AFROTC, CODDV, Medal of Honor, etc.).
    (f) Qualified alternates. To bring the Cadet Wing up to strength, 
the qualified alternate appointed according to Sec. 901.19 is charged to 
the Secretary of the Air Force as a qualified alternate. Those 
candidates having congressional, Vice-Presidential, or U.S. Possessions 
nominations appear as a qualified alternate for that nominating source.
    (g) Multiple congressional and other sources of nominations. For 
appointees who have multiple nominations, USAFA/RRS determines the 
appointment category to which they are assigned. Normally a cadet with 
both congressional and non-congressional nominations is assigned to a 
congressional authority. Designation of ``charged'' cadets (those 
filling a Vice-Presidential, congressional, or U.S. Possessions quota) 
also is accomplished by USAFA/RRS according to Sec. 901.18. USAFA/RRS 
notifies HQ USAF/DPPA of these assignments which are audited and 
verified by HQ USAF/DPPA. The Vice Presidential and nominating 
authorities in Congress and U.S. Possessions are notified of their 
charged appointees and other nominees who win appointments by HQ USAF/
DPPA.

and that the request is reasonable.

accused as charged, it shall require the accused to identify himself and 
state whether or not he has counsel. If he has no counsel, but desires 
counsel, the Court shall give him a reasonable opportunity to procure 
counsel.
    (c) When both sides are ready for arraignment, or when the Court 
determines that both sides have had adequate opportunities to prepare 
for arraignment, the Court shall read the charges to the accused, 
explain them (if necessary), and, after the reading or stating of each 
charge in Court, ask the accused whether he pleads ``guilty'' or ``not 
guilty.'' The Court shall enter in the record of the case the plea made 
to each charge.
    (d) The accused may plead ``guilty'' to any or all of the charges 
against him, except that the Court may at its discretion refuse to 
accept a plea of guilty, and may not accept a plea without first 
determining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the 
nature of the charge.
    (e) The accused may plead ``not guilty'' to any or all of the 
charges against him. The Court shall enter a plea of not guilty if the 
answer of the accused to any charge is such that it does not clearly

<R05>
Sec. 989.1  Purpose.

    (a) This part implements the Air Force Environmental Impact Analysis 
Process and provides procedures for environmental impact analysis both 
within the United States and abroad. Because the authority for, and 
rules governing, each aspect of the Environmental Impact Analysis 
Process differ depending on whether the action takes place in the United 
States or outside the United States, this part provides largely separate 
procedures for each type of action. Consequently, the main body of this 
part deals primarily with environmental impact analysis under the 
authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) 
(Public Law 91-190, 42 U.S.C. 4321-4347), while the primary procedures 
for environmental impact analysis of actions outside the United States 
in accordance with Executive Order 12114, Environmental Effects Abroad 
of Major Federal Actions, are contained in Secs. 989.32 and 989.33.
    (b) The procedures in this part are essential to achieve and 
maintain compliance with NEPA and the Council on Environmental Quality 
(CEQ) Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of the NEPA 
(40 CFR Parts 1500-1508, referred to as the ``CEQ Regulations''). 
Further requirements are contained in 32 CFR Part 188 (Department of 
Defense Directive (DoDD) 6050.1, Environmental Effects in the United 
States of DoD Actions, July 30, 1979), and DoD Instruction 5000.2, 
Defense Acquisition Management Policies and Procedures, February 23, 
1991, with Change 1 <SUP>1</SUP> and Air Force Supplement 1, Acquisition 
Management Policies, 31 August 1993, with Change 1. To comply with NEPA 
and complete the EIAP, the CEQ Regulations and this part must be used 
together.

    (c) Air Force activities abroad will comply with this part, 
Executive Order 12114, and 32 CFR Part 187 (DoDD 6050.7, Environmental 
Effects Abroad of Major Department of Defense Actions, March

[[Page 245]]

<R05>
Sec. 989.4  Initial considerations.

    Air Force personnel will:
    (a) Consider and document environmental effects of proposed Air 
Force actions through AF Forms 813, EAs, FONSIs, EISs, EIS Records of 
Decision (ROD), and documents prepared according to Executive Order 
(E.O.) 12114.
    (b) Evaluate proposed actions for possible categorical exclusion 
(CATEX) from environmental impact analysis (attachment 2 of this part). 
CATEXs may apply to actions in the United States, its territories and 
possessions, and abroad.
    (c) Make environmental documents, comments, and responses, including 
those of other Federal, state, and local agencies and the public, part 
of the record available for review and use at all levels of decision 
making.

[[Page 248]]

    (d) Review the specific alternatives analyzed in the EIAP when 
evaluating the proposal prior to decision making.
    (e) Ensure that alternatives considered by the decision-maker are 
both reasonable and within the range of alternatives analyzed in the 
environmental documents.
    (f) Pursue the objective of furthering foreign policy and national 
security interests while at the same time considering important 
environmental factors.
    (g) Consider the environmental effects of actions that affect the 
global commons.
    (h) Carry out actions that affect the environment of a foreign 
nation in a way that allows consideration of the environment, existing 
international agreements, and the sovereignty of other nations.
    (i) Determine whether any foreign government should be informed of 
the availability of environmental documents. Formal arrangements with 
foreign governments concerning environmental matters and communications 
with foreign governments concerning environmental agreements will be 
coordinated with the Department of State by the Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of the Air Force for Environment, Safety, and Occupational 
Health (SAF/MIQ) through the Assistant Secretary of Defense. This 
coordination requirement does not apply to informal working-level 
communications and arrangements.


<R05>
Sec. 989.5  Organizational relationships.

    The host EPF manages the EIAP using an interdisciplinary team 
approach. This is especially important for tenant-proposed actions, 
because the host command is responsible for the EIAP for actions related 
to the host command's installations.
    (a) The host command prepares environmental documents internally or 
directs the host base to prepare the environmental documents. 
Environmental document preparation may be by contract (requiring the 
tenant to fund the EIAP), or by the tenant unit. Regardless of the 
preparation method, the host command will ensure the required 
environmental analysis is accomplished before a decision is made on the 
proposal and an action is undertaken. Host/tenant agreements should 
provide specific procedures to ensure host oversight of tenant 
compliance.
    (b) For aircraft beddown and unit realignment actions, program 
elements are identified in the Program Objective Memorandum. Subsequent 
Program Change Requests must include AF Form 813. When a program for a 
given year has sufficient support, HQ USAF/XOO notifies the host command 
or NGB-XO to initiate the EIAP. For classified actions, MAJCOMs and ANG 
begin reporting monthly EIAP status to HQ USAF/XO (copy to SAF/MIQ and 
HQ USAF/CEV) while the proposal is still classified, and upon 
declassification, to HQ USAF/CEV. MAJCOMs and ANG continue reporting 
until the EIAP is complete for all projects.
    (c) To ensure timely initiation of the EIAP, SAF/AQ forwards 
information copies of all Mission Need Statements and System Operational 
Requirements Documents to SAF/MIQ, HQ USAF/CEV (or ANGRC/CEV), the Air 
Force Medical Operations Agency, Aerospace Medicine Office (AFMOA/SG), 
and the affected MAJCOM EPFs.
    (d) The MAJCOM of the scheduling unit managing affected airspace is 
responsible for preparing and approving environmental analyses. The 
scheduling unit's higher headquarters may choose whether to prepare the 
environmental document, but is ultimately responsible for EIAP document 
accomplishment and approval.


<R05>
Sec. 989.6  Budgeting and funding.

    Contract EIAP efforts are proponent MAJCOM responsibilities. Each 
year, the EPF budgets for the anticipated EIAP workload based on reports 
of command proponents. If proponent offices exceed the budget in a given 
year or identify unforeseen requirements, the proponent offices must 
provide the remaining funding. For HQ AFMC, the system program office or 
project office budgets and funds EIAP efforts relating to research, 
development, testing, and evaluation activities.

[[Page 249]]


<R05>
Sec. 989.7  Requests from non-Air Force agencies or entities.

    Non-Air Force agencies or entities may request the Air Force to 
undertake an action, such as issuing a permit or outleasing Air Force 
property, that may primarily benefit the requester or an agency other 
than the Air Force. The EPF and other Air Force staff elements must 
identify such requests and coordinate with the proponent of the non-Air 
Force proposal, as well as with concerned state, local, and tribal 
authorities.
    (a) Air Force decisions on such proposals must take into 
consideration the potential environmental impacts of the applicant's 
proposed activity (as described in an Air Force environmental document), 
insofar as the proposed action involves Air Force property or programs, 
or requires Air Force approval.
    (b) The Air Force may require the requester to prepare, at the 
requester's expense, an analysis of environmental impacts (40 CFR 
1506.5), or the requester may be required to pay for an EA or EIS to be 
prepared by a contractor selected and supervised by the Air Force. The 
EPF may permit requesters to submit draft EAs for their proposed 
actions, except for actions described in Sec. 989.16 (a) and (b), or for 
actions the EPF has reason to believe will ultimately require an EIS. 
For EISs, the EPF has the responsibility to prepare the environmental 
document, although responsibility for funding remains with the 
requester. The fact that the requester has prepared environmental 
documents at its own expense does not commit the Air Force to allow or 
undertake the proposed action or its alternatives. The requester is not 
entitled to any preference over other potential parties with whom the 
Air Force might contract or make similar arrangements.
    (c) In no event is the requester who prepares or funds an 
environmental analysis entitled to reimbursement from the Air Force. 
When requesters prepare environmental documents outside the Air Force, 
the Air Force must independently evaluate and approve the scope and 
content of the environmental analyses before using the analyses to 
fulfill EIAP requirements. Any outside environmental analysis must 
evaluate reasonable alternatives as defined in Sec. 989.8.


<R05>
Sec. 989.8  Analysis of alternatives.

    The Air Force must analyze reasonable alternatives to the proposed 
action and the ``no action'' alternative in all EAs and EISs, as fully 
as the proposed action alternative.
    (a) ``Reasonable'' alternatives are those that meet the underlying 
purpose and need for the proposed action and that would cause a 
reasonable person to inquire further before choosing a particular course 
of action. Reasonable alternatives are not limited to those directly 
within the power of the Air Force to implement. They may involve another 
government agency or military service to assist in the project or even 
to become the lead agency. The Air Force must also consider reasonable 
alternatives raised during the scoping process (see Sec. 989.18) or 
suggested by others, as well as combinations of alternatives. The Air 
Force need not analyze highly speculative alternatives, such as those 
requiring a major, unlikely change in law or governmental policy. If the 
Air Force identifies a large number of reasonable alternatives, it may 
limit alternatives selected for detailed environmental analysis to a 
reasonable range or to a reasonable number of examples covering the full 
spectrum of alternatives.
    (b) The Air Force may expressly eliminate alternatives from detailed 
analysis, based on reasonable selection standards (for example, 
operational, technical, or environmental standards suitable to a 
particular project). Proponents may develop written selection standards 
to firmly establish what is a ``reasonable'' alternative for a 
particular project, but they must not so narrowly define these standards 
that they unnecessarily limit consideration to the proposal initially 
favored by proponents. This discussion of reasonable alternatives 
applies equally to EAs and EISs.
    (c) Except where excused by law, the Air Force must always consider 
and assess the environmental impacts of the ``no action'' alternative. 
``No action'' may mean either that current management practice will not 
change or that

[[Page 250]]

the proposed action will not take place. If no action would result in 
other predictable actions, those actions should be discussed within the 
no action alternative section. The discussion of the no action 
alternative and the other alternatives should be comparable in detail to 
that of the proposed action.


<R05>
Sec. 989.9  Cooperation and adoption.

    (a) Lead and Cooperating Agency (40 CFR 1501.5-1501.6). When the Air 
Force is a cooperating agency in the preparation of an EIS, the Air 
Force reviews and approves principal environmental documents within the 
EIAP as if they were prepared by the Air Force. The Air Force executes a 
Record of Decision for its program decisions that are based on an EIS 
for which the Air Force is a cooperating agency. The Air Force may also 
be a lead or cooperating agency on an EA using similar procedures, but 
the MAJCOM EPC retains approval authority unless otherwise directed by 
HQ USAF. Before invoking provisions of 40 CFR 1501.5(e), the lowest 
authority level possible resolves disputes concerning which agency is 
the lead or cooperating agency.
    (b) Adoption of EA or EIS. The Air Force, even though not a 
cooperating agency, may adopt an EA or EIS prepared by another entity 
where the proposed action is substantially the same as the action 
described in the EA or EIS. In this case, the EA or EIS must be 
recirculated as a final EA or EIS but the Air Force must independently 
review the EA or EIS and determine that it is current and that it 
satisfies the requirements of this part. The Air Force then prepares its 
own FONSI or ROD, as the case may be. In the situation where the 
proposed action is not substantially the same as that described in the 
EA or the EIS, the Air Force may adopt the EA or EIS, or a portion 
thereof, by circulating the EA or EIS as a draft and then preparing the 
final EA or EIS.


<R05>
Sec. 989.10  Tiering.

    The Air Force should use tiered (40 CFR 1502.20) environmental 
documents, and environmental documents prepared by other agencies, to 
eliminate repetitive discussions of the same issues and to focus on the 
issues relating to specific actions. If the Air Force adopts another 
Federal agency's environmental document, subsequent Air Force 
environmental documents may also be tiered.


<R05>
Sec. 989.11  Combining EIAP with other documentation.

    (a) The EPF combines environmental analysis with other related 
documentation when practicable (40 CFR 1506.4) following the procedures 
prescribed by the CEQ regulations and this part.
    (b) The EPF must integrate comprehensive planning (AFI 32-7062, Air 
Force Comprehensive Planning) <SUP>7</SUP> with the requirements of NEPA 
and the EIAP. Prior to making a decision to proceed, the EPF must 
analyze the environmental impacts that could result from implementation 
of a proposal identified in the comprehensive plan.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 989.1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 989.12  Air Force Form 813, request for environmental impact analysis.

    The Air Force uses AF Form 813 to document the need for 
environmental analysis or for certain CATEX determinations for proposed 
actions. The form helps narrow and focus the issues to potential 
environmental impacts. AF Form 813 must be retained with the EA or EIS 
to record the focusing of environmental issues. The rationale for not 
addressing environmental issues must also be recorded in the EA or EIS.


<R05>
Sec. 989.13  Categorical exclusion.

    (a) CATEXs apply to those classes of actions that do not 
individually or cumulatively have potential for significant effect on 
the environment and do not, therefore, require further environmental 
analysis in an EA or an EIS. The list of Air Force-approved CATEXs is in 
attachment 2 of this part. Command supplements to this part may not add 
CATEXs or expand the scope of the CATEXs in attachment 2 of this part.
    (b) Characteristics of categories of actions that usually do not 
require either an EIS or an EA (in the absence of extraordinary 
circumstances) include:
    (1) Minimal adverse effect on environmental quality.
    (2) No significant change to existing environmental conditions.

[[Page 251]]

    (3) No significant cumulative environmental impact.
    (4) Socioeconomic effects only.
    (5) Similarity to actions previously assessed and found to have no 
significant environmental impacts.
    (c) CATEXs apply to actions in the United States and abroad. General 
exemptions specific to actions abroad are in 32 CFR Part 187. The EPF or 
other decision-maker forwards requests for additional exemption 
determinations for actions abroad to HQ USAF/CEV with a justification 
letter.
    (d) Normally, any decision-making level may determine the 
applicability of a CATEX and need not formally record the determination 
on AF Form 813 or elsewhere, except as noted in the CATEX list.
    (e) Application of a CATEX to an action does not eliminate the need 
to meet air conformity requirements (see Sec. 989.28).


<R05>
Sec. 989.14  Environmental assessment.

    (a) When a proposed action is one not usually requiring an EIS but 
is not categorically excluded, the EPF must prepare an EA (40 CFR 
1508.9). Every EA must lead to either a FONSI, a decision to prepare an 
EIS, or no decision on the proposal.
    (b) Whenever a proposed action usually requires an EIS, the EPF 
responsible for the EIAP may prepare an EA to definitively determine if 
an EIS is required based on the analysis of environmental impacts. 
Alternatively, the EPF may choose to bypass the EA and proceed with 
preparation of an EIS.
    (c) An EA is a written analysis that:
    (1) Provides analysis sufficient to determine whether to prepare an 
EIS or a FONSI.
    (2) Aids the Air Force in complying with the NEPA when no EIS is 
required.
    (d) An EA discusses the need for the proposed action, reasonable 
alternatives to the proposed action, the affected environment, the 
environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives (including 
the ``no action'' alternative), and a listing of agencies and persons 
consulted during preparation.
    (e) The format for the EA is the same as the EIS. The alternatives 
section of an EA and an EIS are similar and should follow the 
alternatives analysis guidance outlined in Sec. 989.8.
    (f) The EPF should design the EA to facilitate rapidly transforming 
the document into an EIS if the environmental analysis reveals a 
significant impact.
    (g) Certain EAs require SAF/MIQ approval because they involve topics 
of special importance or interest. Unless directed otherwise by SAF/MIQ, 
the EPF must forward the following types of EAs to SAF/MIQ through HQ 
USAF/CEV (copy to AFCEE/EC for technical review), along with an unsigned 
FONSI:
    (1) EAs for actions where the Air Force has wetlands or floodplains 
compliance responsibilities (E.O. 11988 and E.O. 11990). A Finding of No 
Practicable Alternative (FONPA) must be submitted to HQ USAF/CEV when 
the alternative selected is located in wetlands or floodplains, and must 
discuss why no other practical alternative exists to avoid impacts. See 
AFI 32-7064, Integrated Resources Management. <SUP>8</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 989.1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) System acquisition EAs.
    (3) All EAs on non-Air Force agency proposals that require an Air 
Force decision, such as use of Air Force property for highways and 
joint-use proposals.
    (4) EAs for actions that require the Air Force to make conformity 
determinations pursuant to the Clean Air Act, as amended, and the 
implementing rules. Conformity determinations are made by SAF/MIQ, see 
Sec. 989.28.
    (5) EAs where mitigation to insignificance is accomplished in lieu 
of initiating an EIS (Sec. 989.22(c)).
    (h) A few examples of actions that normally require preparation of 
an EA (except as indicated in the CATEX list) include:
    (1) Public land withdrawals of less than 5,000 acres.
    (2) Minor mission realignments and aircraft beddowns.
    (3) Building construction on base within developed areas.
    (4) Minor modifications to Military Operating Areas (MOA), air-to-
ground weapons ranges, and military training routes.

[[Page 252]]

    (5) Remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites.
    (i) Abbreviated Environmental Assessment. In special circumstances, 
when the potential environmental impacts of a proposed action are 
clearly insignificant (as documented on AF Form 813) and none of the 
CATEXs in attachment 2 of this part apply, the EPF can use an 
abbreviated EA to assess the action. At a minimum, the abbreviated EA 
will consist of:
    (1) AF Form 813 with attachments analyzing the environmental impacts 
of the proposed action and reasonable alternatives.
    (2) A concise description of the affected environment.
    (3) A concise FONSI (see Sec. 989.15).
    (j) The Air Force should involve environmental agencies, applicants, 
and the public in the preparation of EAs (40 CFR 1501.4(b)). The extent 
of involvement usually coincides with the magnitude and complexity of 
the proposed action and its potential environmental effect on the area. 
For proposed actions described in Sec. 989.15(e)(2), use either the 
scoping process described in Sec. 989.18 or the public notice process in 
Sec. 989.23(b) and (c).


<R05>
Sec. 989.15  Finding of no significant impact.

    (a) The FONSI (40 CFR 1508.13) briefly describes why an action would 
not have a significant effect on the environment and thus will not be 
the subject of an EIS. The FONSI must summarize the EA or, preferably, 
have it attached and incorporated by reference, and must note any other 
environmental documents related to the action.
    (b) If the EA is not attached, the FONSI must include:
    (1) Name of the action.
    (2) Brief description of the action (including alternatives 
considered and the chosen alternative).
    (3) Brief discussion of anticipated environmental effects.
    (4) Conclusions leading to the FONSI.
    (5) All mitigation actions that will be adopted with implementation 
of the proposal (see Sec. 989.22).
    (c) Keep FONSIs as brief as possible. Most FONSIs should not exceed 
two typewritten pages. Stand-alone FONSIs without an attached EA may be 
longer.
    (d) For actions of regional or local interest, disseminate the FONSI 
according to Sec. 989.23. The MAJCOM and NGB are responsible for release 
of FONSIs to regional offices of Federal agencies, the state single 
point of contact (SPOC), and state agencies concurrent with local 
release by the installations.
    (e) The EPF must provide the FONSI and complete EA to organizations 
and individuals requesting them and to whomever the proponent or the EPF 
has reason to believe is interested in the action. The EPF provides a 
copy of the documents without cost to organizations and individuals 
requesting them. The earliest of the FONSI transmittal date (date of 
letter of transmittal) to the SPOC or other interested party is the 
official notification date.
    (1) The EPF must make the draft EA/FONSI available to the affected 
public unless disclosure is precluded for security classification 
reasons. Before the FONSI is signed and the action is implemented, the 
EPF should allow sufficient time to receive comments from the public. 
The time period will reflect the magnitude of the proposed action and 
its potential for controversy. The greater the magnitude of the proposed 
action or its potential for controversy, the longer the time that must 
be allowed for public review. Mandatory review periods for certain 
defined actions are contained in Sec. 989.15(e)(2). These are not all 
inclusive but merely specific examples. In every case where an EA/FONSI 
is prepared, the proponent and EPF must determine how much time will be 
allowed for public review. In all cases, other than classified actions, 
a public review period should be the norm unless clearly unnecessary due 
to the lack of potential controversy.
    (2) In the following circumstances, the EA and draft FONSI are made 
available for public review for at least 30 days before FONSI approval 
and implementing the action (40 CFR 1501.4(e)(2)):
    (i) When the proposed action is, or is closely similar to, one that 
usually requires preparation of an EIS (see Sec. 989.16).
    (ii) If it is an unusual case, a new kind of action, or a precedent-
setting case in terms of its potential environmental impacts.

[[Page 253]]

    (iii) If the proposed action would be located in a floodplain or 
wetland.
    (iv) If the action is mitigated to insignificance in the FONSI, in 
lieu of an EIS (Sec. 989.22(c)).
    (v) If the proposed action is a change to airspace use or 
designation.
    (f) As a rule, the same organizational level that prepares the EA 
reviews and recommends the FONSI for approval by the EPC. MAJCOMs may 
decide the level of EA approval and FONSI signature, except as provided 
in Sec. 989.14(g).
    (g) Air Force staff must get permission to deviate from the 
procedures outlined in this part from SAF/MIQ in accordance with 
Sec. 989.30.


<R05>
Sec. 989.16  Environmental impact statement.

    (a) Certain classes of environmental impacts require preparation of 
an EIS (40 CFR Part 1502). These include, but are not limited to:
    (1) Potential for significant degradation of the environment.
    (2) Potential for significant threat or hazard to public health or 
safety.
    (3) Substantial environmental controversy concerning the 
significance or nature of the environmental impact of a proposed action.
    (b) Certain other actions normally, but not always, require an EIS. 
These include, but are not limited to:
    (1) Public land withdrawals of over 5,000 acres (Engle Act, 43 
U.S.C. 155-158).
    (2) Establishment of new air-to-ground weapons ranges.
    (3) Site selection of new airfields.
    (4) Site selection of major installations.
    (5) Development of major new weapons systems (at decision points 
that involve demonstration, validation, production, deployment, and area 
or site selection for deployment).
    (6) Establishing or expanding supersonic training areas over land 
below 30,000 feet MSL (mean sea level).
    (7) Disposal and reuse of closing installations.


<R05>
Sec. 989.17  Notice of intent.

    The EPF must furnish to HQ USAF/CEV the NOI (40 CFR 1508.22) 
describing the proposed action for publication in the Federal Register. 
The EPF, through the host base public affairs office, will also provide 
the NOI to newspapers and other media in the area potentially affected 
by the proposed action. The EPF must provide copies of the notice to the 
proper state SPOC (E.O. 12372) and must also distribute it to requesting 
agencies, organizations, and individuals. Along with the draft NOI, the 
EPF must also forward the completed DOPAA to HQ USAF for review.


<R05>
Sec. 989.18  Scoping.

    After publication of the NOI for an EIS, the EPF must initiate the 
public scoping process (40 CFR 1501.7) to determine the scope of issues 
to be addressed and to help identify significant environmental issues to 
be analyzed in depth. Methods of scoping range from soliciting written 
comments to conducting public scoping meetings (see 40 CFR 1501.7 and 
1506.6(e)). The purpose of this process is to de-emphasize insignificant 
issues and focus the scope of the environmental analysis on significant 
issues (40 CFR 1500.4(g)). The result of scoping is that the proponent 
and EPF determine the range of actions, alternatives, and impacts to be 
considered in the EIS (40 CFR 1508.25). The EPF must send meeting plans 
for scoping meetings to AF/CEV (or ANGRC/CEV) for SAF/MIQ concurrence no 
later than 30 days before the first scoping meeting. Scoping meeting 
plans are similar in content to public hearing plans (see attachment 3 
of this part).


<R05>
Sec. 989.19  Draft EIS.

    (a) Preliminary draft. The EPF prepares a Preliminary draft EIS 
(PDEIS) (40 CFR 1502.9) based on the scope of issues decided on during 
the scoping process. The format of the EIS must be in accordance with 
the format recommended in the CEQ regulations (40 CFR 1502.10 and 
1502.11). The CEQ regulations indicate that EISs are normally fewer than 
150 pages (300 pages for proposals of unusual complexity). The EPF 
provides a sufficient number of copies of the PDEIS to HQ USAF/CEV for 
HQ USAF EPC review and to AFCEE/EC for technical review.
    (b) Review of draft EIS. After the HQ USAF EPC review, the EPF makes 
any

[[Page 254]]

necessary revisions to the PDEIS and forwards it to HQ USAF/CEV as a 
draft EIS for security and policy review. Once the draft EIS is 
approved, HQ USAF/CEV notifies the EPF to print sufficient copies of the 
draft EIS for distribution to congressional delegations and interested 
agencies. After congressional distribution, the EPF sends the draft EIS 
to all others on the distribution list. HQ USAF/CEV then files the 
document with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and provides a 
copy to the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Environmental 
Security.
    (c) Public review of draft EIS (40 CFR 1502.19). (1) The public 
comment period for the draft EIS is at least 45 days from the 
publication date of the notice of availability (NOA) of the draft EIS in 
the Federal Register. EPA publishes in the Federal Register, each week, 
NOAs of EISs filed during the preceding week. This public comment period 
may be extended an additional 15 days, at the request of the EPF. If the 
draft EIS is unusually long, the EPF may distribute a summary to the 
public with an attached list of locations (such as public libraries) 
where the entire draft EIS may be reviewed. The EPF must distribute the 
full draft EIS to certain entities, for example agencies with 
jurisdiction by law or agencies with special expertise in evaluating the 
environmental impacts, and anyone else requesting the entire draft EIS 
(40 CFR 1502.19).
    (2) The EPF holds public hearings on the draft EIS according to the 
procedures in 40 CFR 1506.6(c) and (d). Hearings take place no sooner 
than 15 days after the Federal Register NOA and at least 15 days before 
the end of the comment period. Scheduling hearings toward the end of the 
comment period is encouraged to allow the public to obtain and more 
thoroughly review the draft EIS. The EPF must provide hearing plans to 
HQ USAF/CEV (or ANGRC/CEV) for SAF/MIQ concurrence no later than 30 days 
prior to the first public hearing. See attachment 3 of this part for 
public hearing procedures.
    (d) Response to comments (40 CFR 1503.4). The EPF must incorporate 
its responses to comments in the final EIS by either modifying the text 
and referring in the appendix to where the appropriate modification is 
addressed or providing a written explanation in the comments section, or 
both. The EPF may group comments of a similar nature together to allow a 
common response and may also respond to individuals separately.
    (e) Seeking additional comments. The EPF may, at any time during the 
EIS process, seek additional public comments, such as when there has 
been a significant change in circumstances, development of significant 
new information of a relevant nature, or where there is substantial 
environmental controversy concerning the proposed action. Significant 
new information leading to public controversy regarding the scope after 
the scoping process is such a changed circumstance. An additional public 
comment period may also be necessary after the publication of the draft 
EIS due to public controversy or changes made as the result of previous 
public comments. Such periods when additional public comments are sought 
shall last for at least 30 days.


<R05>
Sec. 989.20  Final EIS.

    (a) If changes in the draft EIS are minor or limited to factual 
corrections and responses to comments, the proponent may, with the prior 
approval of SAF/MIQ, prepare a document containing only draft EIS 
comments, Air Force responses, and errata sheets of changes staffed to 
the HQ USAF EPC for coordination. However, the proponent must submit the 
draft EIS and all of the above documents, with a new cover sheet 
indicating that it is a final EIS (40 CFR 1503.4(c)), to HQ USAF/CEV for 
filing with the EPA (40 CFR 1506.9). If more extensive modifications are 
required, the EPF must prepare a preliminary final EIS incorporating 
these modifications for coordination within the Air Force. Regardless of 
which procedure is followed, the final EIS must be processed in the same 
way as the draft EIS, except that the public need not be invited to 
comment during the 30-day post-filing waiting period. The final EIS 
should be furnished to every person, organization, or agency that made 
substantive comments on

[[Page 255]]

the draft EIS or requested a copy. Although the EPF is not required to 
respond to public comments received during this period, comments 
received must be considered in determining final decisions such as 
identifying the preferred alternative, appropriate mitigations, or if a 
supplemental analysis is required.
    (b) The EPF processes all necessary supplements to EISs (40 CFR 
1502.9) in the same way as the original draft and final EIS, except that 
a new scoping process is not required.
    (c) If major steps to advance the proposal have not occurred within 
5 years from the date of the FEIS approval, reevaluation of the 
documentation should be accomplished to ensure its continued validity.


<R05>
Sec. 989.21  Record of decision.

    (a) The MAJCOM prepares draft RODs, formally staffs them to HQ USAF/
CEV for verification of adequacy, and forwards them to the final 
decision-maker for signature. A ROD (40 CFR 1505.2) is a concise public 
document stating what an agency's decision is on a specific action. The 
ROD may be integrated into any other document required to implement the 
agency's decision. A decision on a course of action may not be made 
until 30 days after publication of the NOA of the final EIS in the 
Federal Register. EPA publishes NOAs each Friday; when Friday is a 
holiday, the notice is published on Thursday.
    (b) The Air Force must announce the ROD to the affected public as 
specified in Sec. 989.23, except for classified portions. The ROD should 
be concise and should explain the conclusion, the reason for the 
selection, and the alternatives considered. The ROD must identify the 
course of action (proposed action or an alternative) that is considered 
environmentally preferable regardless of whether it is the alternative 
selected for implementation. The ROD should summarize all the major 
factors the agency weighed in making its decision, including essential 
considerations of national policy.
    (c) The ROD must state whether the selected alternative employs all 
practicable means to avoid, minimize, or mitigate environmental impacts 
and, if not, explain why.


<R05>
Sec. 989.22  Mitigation.

    (a) When preparing EIAP documents, indicate clearly whether 
mitigation measures (40 CFR 1508.20) must be implemented for the 
alternative selected. Discuss mitigation measures in terms of ``will'' 
and ``would'' when such measures have already been incorporated into the 
proposal. Use terms like ``may'' and ``could'' when proposing or 
suggesting mitigation measures. Both the public and the Air Force 
community need to know what commitments are being considered and 
selected, and who will be responsible for implementing, funding, and 
monitoring the mitigation measures.
    (b) The proponent funds and implements mitigation measures in the 
mitigation plan that are approved by the decision-maker. Where possible 
and appropriate because of amount, the proponent should include the cost 
of mitigation as a line item in the budget for a proposed project. The 
proponent must keep the EPF informed of the status of mitigation 
measures when the proponent implements the action. The EPF monitors the 
progress of mitigation implementation and reports its status to HQ USAF/
CEV on a periodic basis. Upon request, the EPF must also provide the 
results of relevant mitigation monitoring to the public.
    (c) The proponent may ``mitigate to insignificance'' potentially 
significant environmental impacts found during preparation of an EA, in 
lieu of preparing an EIS. The FONSI for the EA must include these 
mitigation measures. Such mitigations are legally binding and must be 
carried out as the proponent implements the project. If, for any reason, 
the project proponent later abandons or revises in environmentally-
adverse ways the mitigation commitments made in the FONSI, the proponent 
must prepare a supplemental EIAP document before continuing the project. 
If potentially significant environmental impacts would result from any 
project revisions, the proponent must prepare an EIS.
    (d) For each FONSI or ROD containing mitigation measures, the 
proponent publishes a plan specifically

[[Page 256]]

identifying each mitigation, discussing how the proponent will execute 
the mitigations, identifying who will fund and implement the 
mitigations, and stating when the proponent will complete the 
mitigation. The mitigation plan will be forwarded to HQ USAF/CEV for 
review within 90 days from the date of signature of the FONSI or ROD.


<R05>
Sec. 989.23  Public notification.

    Except as provided in Sec. 989.25, public notification is required 
for various aspects of the EIAP.
    (a) Activities that require public notification include:
    (1) The FONSI for an EA.
    (2) An EIS NOI.
    (3) Public scoping meetings.
    (4) Availability of the draft EIS.
    (5) Public hearings on the draft EIS (which should be included in 
the NOA for the draft EIS).
    (6) Availability of the final EIS.
    (7) The ROD for an EIS.
    (b) For actions of local concern, the list of possible notification 
methods in 40 CFR 1506.6(b)(3) is only illustrative. The EPF may use 
other equally effective means of notification as a substitute for any of 
the methods listed. Because many Air Force actions are of limited 
interest to persons or organizations outside the Air Force, the EPF may 
limit local notification to the SPOC, local government representatives, 
and local news media. For all FONSI or EIS notices, if the news media 
fail to carry the story and, in the case of a FONSI, if the action 
requires that, after public notice of the FONSI, 30 days must pass 
before a decision or any action is permissible (see Sec. 989.15(e)(2)), 
the public affairs officer must purchase an advertisement in the local 
newspaper(s) of general circulation (not ``legal'' newspapers or ``legal 
section'' of general newspapers).
    (c) For the purpose of EIAP, the EPF begins the time period of local 
notification when it sends written notification to the state SPOC or 
other organization (date of letter of notification) or when the local 
media carries the story (date of story), whichever occurs first. 
Operations and maintenance funds pay for the advertisements.


<R05>
Sec. 989.24  Base closure and realignment.

    Base closure or realignment may entail special requirements for 
environmental analysis. The permanent base closure and realignment law, 
10 U.S.C. 2687, requires a report to the Congress when an installation 
where at least 300 DoD civilian personnel are authorized to be employed 
is closed, or when a realignment reduces such an installation by at 
least 50 percent or 1,000 of such personnel, whichever is less. In 
addition, other base closure laws may be in effect during particular 
periods. Such non-permanent closure laws frequently contain provisions 
limiting the extent of environmental analysis required for actions taken 
under them. Such provisions may also add requirements for studies not 
necessarily required by NEPA. When dealing with base closure or 
realignment EIAP documents, MAJCOMs and HQ USAF offices should obtain 
legal advice on special congressional requirements. Consult with HQ 
USAF/XOO, the HQ USAF focal point for the realignment process, decision 
documents, and congressional requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 989.25  Classified actions (40 CFR 1507.3(c)).

    (a) Classification of an action for national defense or foreign 
policy purposes does not relieve the requirement of complying with NEPA. 
In classified matters, the Air Force must prepare and make available 
normal NEPA environmental analysis documents to aid in the decision 
making process; however, Air Force staff must prepare, safeguard and 
disseminate these documents according to established procedures for 
protecting classified documents. If an EIAP document must be classified, 
the Air Force may modify or eliminate associated requirements for public 
notice (including publication in the Federal Register) or public 
involvement in the EIAP. However, the Air Force should obtain comments 
on classified proposed actions or classified aspects of generally 
unclassified actions, from public agencies having jurisdiction by law or 
special expertise, to the extent that such review and comment is 
consistent with security requirements. Where feasible, the EPF may need 
to help appropriate personnel

[[Page 257]]

from those agencies obtain necessary security clearances to gain access 
to documents so they can comment on scoping or review the documents.
    (b) Where the proposed action is classified and unavailable to the 
public, the Air Force may keep the entire NEPA process classified and 
protected under the applicable procedures for the classification level 
pertinent to the particular information. At times (for example, during 
weapons system development and base closures and realignments), certain 
but not all aspects of NEPA documents may later be declassified. In 
those cases, the EPF should organize the EIAP documents, to the extent 
practicable, in a way that keeps the most sensitive classified 
information (which is not expected to be released at any early date) in 
a separate annex that can remain classified; the rest of the EIAP 
documents, when declassified, will then be comprehensible as a unit and 
suitable for release to the public. Thus, the documents will reflect, as 
much as possible, the nature of the action and its environmental 
impacts, as well as Air Force compliance with NEPA requirements.
    (c) Where the proposed action is not classified, but certain aspects 
of it need to be protected by security classification, the EPF should 
tailor the EIAP for a proposed action to permit as normal a level of 
public involvement as possible, but also fully protect the classified 
part of the action and environmental analysis. In some instances, the 
EPF can do this by keeping the classified sections of the EIAP documents 
in a separate, classified annex.
    (d) For Sec. 989.25(b) actions, an NOI or NOA will not be published 
in the Federal Register until the proposed action is declassified. For 
Sec. 989.25(c) actions, the Federal Register will run an unclassified 
NOA which will advise the public that at some time in the future the Air 
Force may or will publicly release a declassified document.
    (e) The EPF similarly protects classified aspects of FONSIs, RODs, 
or other environmental documents that are part of the EIAP for a 
proposed action, such as by preparing separate classified annexes to 
unclassified documents, as necessary.
    (f) Whenever a proponent believes that EIAP documents should be kept 
classified, the EPF must make a report of the matter to SAF/MIQ, 
including proposed modifications of the normal EIAP to protect 
classified information. The EPF may make such submissions at whatever 
level of security classification is needed to provide a comprehensive 
understanding of the issues. SAF/MIQ, with support from SAF/GC and other 
staff elements as necessary, makes final decisions on EIAP procedures 
for classified actions.


<R05>
Sec. 989.26  Occupational safety and health.

    Assess direct and indirect impacts of proposed actions on the safety 
and health of Air Force employees and others at a work site. Normally, 
compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 
standards will mitigate hazards. The EIAP document does not need to 
specify such compliance procedures. However, the EIAP documents should 
discuss impacts that require a change in work practices to achieve an 
adequate level of health and safety.


<R05>
Sec. 989.27  Airspace proposals.

    The DoD and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have entered 
into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that outlines various airspace 
responsibilities. For purposes of compliance with NEPA, the DoD is the 
``lead agency'' for all proposals initiated by DoD, with the FAA acting 
as the ``cooperating agency.'' Where airspace proposals initiated by the 
FAA affect military use, the roles are reversed. The proponent's action 
officers (civil engineering and local airspace management) must ensure 
that the FAA is fully integrated into the airspace proposal and related 
EIAP from the very beginning and that the action officers review the 
FAA's responsibilities as a cooperating agency. The proponent's airspace 
manager develops the preliminary airspace proposal per appropriate FAA 
handbooks and the FAA-DoD MOU. The preliminary airspace proposal is the 
basis for initial dialogue between DoD and the FAA on the proposed 
action. A close working relationship between DoD and the

[[Page 258]]

FAA, through the FAA regional Air Force representative, greatly 
facilitates the airspace proposal process and helps resolve many NEPA 
issues during the EIAP.


<R05>
Sec. 989.28  Air quality.

    Section 176(c) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, 42 U.S.C. 
7506(c), establishes a conformity requirement for Federal agencies which 
has been implemented by regulation, 40 CFR Part 93, Subpart B. All EIAP 
documents must address applicable conformity requirements and the status 
of compliance. Conformity applicability analyses and determinations are 
separate and distinct requirements and should be documented separately. 
To increase the utility of a conformity determination in performing the 
EIAP, the conformity determination should be completed prior to the 
completion of the EIAP so as to allow incorporation of the information 
from the conformity determination into the EIAP.


<R05>
Sec. 989.29  Pollution prevention.

    The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. 13101(b), 
established a national policy to prevent or reduce pollution at the 
source, whenever feasible. Pollution prevention approaches should be 
applied to all pollution-generating activities. The environmental 
document should analyze potential pollution that may result from the 
proposed action and alternatives and must incorporate pollution 
prevention measures whenever feasible. Where pollution cannot be 
prevented, the environmental analysis and proposed mitigation measures 
should include, wherever possible, recycling, energy recovery, 
treatment, and environmentally safe disposal actions (see AFI 32-7080, 
Pollution Prevention Program <SUP>9</SUP>).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 989.1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 989.30  Special and emergency procedures.

    (a) Special procedures. During the EIAP, unique situations may arise 
that require EIAP strategies different than those set forth in this 
part. These situations may warrant modification of the procedures in 
this part. EPFs should only consider procedural deviations when the 
resulting process would benefit the Air Force and still comply with NEPA 
and CEQ regulations. EPFs must forward all requests for procedural 
deviations to HQ USAF/CEV (or ANGRC/CEV) for review and approval by SAF/
MIQ.
    (b) Emergency procedures (40 CFR 1506.11). Certain emergency 
situations may make it necessary to take immediate action having 
significant environmental impact, without observing all the provisions 
of the CEQ regulations or this part. If possible, promptly notify HQ 
USAF/CEV, for SAF/MIQ coordination and CEQ consultation, before 
undertaking emergency actions that would otherwise not comply with NEPA 
or this part. The immediate notification requirement does not apply 
where emergency action must be taken without delay. Coordination in this 
instance must take place as soon as practicable.


<R05>
Sec. 989.31  Reporting requirements.

    (a) EAs, EISs, and mitigation measures will be tracked through the 
Work Information Management System-Environmental Subsystem (WIMS-ES), as 
required by AFI 32-7002, Environmental Information Management 
System.<SUP>10</SUP> ANGRC/CE will provide EIAP updates to HQ USAF/CEV 
through the WIMS-ES.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 989.1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) All documentation will be disposed of according to AFMAN 37-139, 
Records Disposition--Standards (formerly AFR 4-20, Volume 2 
<SUP>11</SUP>).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<R05>
Sec. 989.32  Procedures for analysis abroad.

    Procedures for analysis of environmental actions abroad are 
contained in 32 CFR Part 187. That directive provides comprehensive 
policies, definitions, and procedures for implementing E.O. 12114, 
Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Federal Actions. For analysis of 
Air Force actions abroad, 32 CFR Part 187 will be followed. Also, refer 
to Environmental Defense Fund v. Massey, 986 F. 2d 528.

[[Page 259]]


<R05>
Sec. 989.33  Requirements for analysis abroad.

    The EPF will generally perform the same functions for analysis of 
actions abroad that it performs in the United States. In addition to the 
requirements of 32 CFR Part 187, the following Air Force specific rules 
apply:
    (a) For EAs dealing with global commons, HQ USAF/CEV will review 
actions that are above the MAJCOM approval authority. In this instance, 
approval authority refers to the same approval authority that would 
apply to an EA in the United States. The EPF documents a decision not to 
do an EIS.
    (b) For EISs dealing with the global commons, the EPF provides 
sufficient copies to HQ USAF/CEV for the HQ USAF EPC review and AFCEE/EC 
technical review. After EPC review, the EPF makes a recommendation as to 
whether the proposed draft EIS will be released as a draft EIS.
    (c) For environmental studies and environmental reviews, forward all 
environmental studies and reviews to HQ USAF/CEV for coordination among 
appropriate Federal agencies. HQ USAF/CEV makes environmental studies 
and reviews available to the Department of State and other interested 
Federal agencies, and, on request, to the United States public, in 
accordance with 32 CFR Part 187. HQ USAF/CEV also may inform interested 
foreign governments or furnish copies of studies, in accordance with 32 
CFR Part 187.

apply to this part. In addition, the following terms apply:

    Description of Proposed Action and Alternatives (DOPAA)--An Air 
Force document that is the framework for assessing the environmental 
impact of a proposal. It describes the purpose and need for the action, 
the alternatives to be considered, and the rationale used to arrive at 
the proposed action.
    Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP)--The Air Force program 
that implements the requirements of NEPA and requirements for analysis 
of environmental effects abroad under E.O. 12114.
    Finding of No Practicable Alternative (FONPA)--Documentation 
according to Executive Orders 11988 and 11990 that explains why there 
are no practicable alternatives to an action affecting a wetland or 
floodplain, based on appropriate EIAP analysis or other documentation.
    Interdisciplinary--An approach to environmental analysis involving 
more than one discipline or branch of learning.
    National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA)--The basic national 
charter to protect the environment that requires all Federal agencies to 
consider environmental impacts when making decisions regarding proposed 
actions.
    Pollution Prevention--``Source reduction'', as defined under the 
Pollution Prevention Act, and other practices that reduce or eliminate 
pollutants through increased efficiency in the use of raw materials, 
energy, water, or other resources, or in the protection of natural 
resources by conservation.
    Proponent--Any office, unit, or activity that proposes to initiate 
an action.
    Scoping--A public process for proposing alternatives to be addressed 
and for identifying the significant issues related to a proposed action.
    United States--All states, commonwealths, the District of Columbia, 
territories and possessions of the United States, and all waters and 
airspace subject to the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. 
The territories and possessions of the United States include the Virgin 
Islands, American Samoa, Wake Island, Midway Island, Guam, Palmyra 
Island, Johnston Atoll, Navassa Island, and Kingman Reef.

            Attachment 2 to Part 989--Categorical Exclusions

    A2.1. Proponent/EPF Responsibility. Although a proposed action may 
qualify for a categorical exclusion from the requirements for 
environmental impact analysis under NEPA, this exclusion does not 
relieve the EPF or the proponent of responsibility for complying with 
all other environmental requirements related to the proposal, including 
requirements for permits, state regulatory agency review of plans, and 
so on.
    A2.2. Additional Analysis. Circumstances may arise in which usually 
categorically excluded actions may have a significant environmental 
impact and, therefore, may generate a requirement for further 
environmental analysis. Examples of situations

[[Page 261]]

where such unique circumstances may be present include:
    A.2.2.1. Actions of greater scope or size than generally experienced 
for a particular category of action.
    A2.2.2. Potential for degradation (even though slight) of already

without altering it (inspections, audits, surveys, investigations). This 
CATEX includes the granting of any permits necessary for such surveys, 
provided that the technology or procedure involved is well understood 
and there are no adverse environmental impacts anticipated from it. The 
EPF must document application of this CATEX on AF Form 813.
    A2.3.26. Undertaking specific investigatory activities to support 
remedial action activities for purposes of cleanup of hazardous spillage 
or waste sites or contaminated groundwater or soil. These activities 
include soil borings and sampling, installation, and operation of test 
or monitoring wells. This CATEX applies to studies that assist in 
determining final cleanup actions when they are conducted in accordance 
with interagency agreements, administrative orders, or work plans 
previously agreed to by EPA or state regulators. Note: This CATEX does 
not apply to the selection of the remedial action.
    A2.3.27. Normal or routine basic and applied scientific research 
confined to the laboratory and in compliance with all applicable safety, 
environmental, and natural resource conservation laws.
    A2.3.28. Routine transporting of hazardous materials and wastes in

support requirements at the receiving installation.
    A2.3.32. Temporary (for less than 30 days) increases in air 
operations up to 50 percent of the typical installation aircraft 
operation rate or increases of 50 operations a day, whichever is 
greater.
    A2.3.33. Flying activities that comply with the Federal aviation 
regulations, that are dispersed over a wide area and that do not 
frequently (more than once a day) pass near the same ground points. This 
CATEX does not cover regular activity on established routes or within 
special use airspace.
    A2.3.34. Supersonic flying operations over land and above 30,000 
feet MSL, or over water and above 10,000 feet MSL and more than 15 
nautical miles from land.
    A2.3.35. Formal requests to the FAA, or host-nation equivalent 
agency, to establish or modify special use airspace (for example, 
restricted areas, warning areas, military operating areas) and military 
training routes for subsonic operations that have a base altitude of 
3,000 feet above ground level or higher. The EPF must document 
application of this CATEX on AF Form 813, which must accompany the 
request to the FAA.
    A2.3.36. Adopting airfield approach, departure, and en route 
procedures that do not route air traffic over noise-sensitive areas, 
including residential neighborhoods or cultural, historical, and outdoor

control, etc., have not in the past presented significant safety or 
environmental impacts.

  Attachment 3 to Part 989--Procedures for Holding Public Hearings on 
               Draft Environmental Impact Statements (EIS)

    A.3.1. General Information:
    A.3.1.1. The Air Force solicits the views of the public and special 
interest groups and, in appropriate cases, holds public hearings on the 
draft EIS.
    A3.1.2. The Office of the Judge Advocate General, through the Air 
Force Legal Services Agency/Trial Judiciary Division

[[Page 263]]

(AFLSA/JAJT) and its field organization, is responsible for conducting 
public hearings.
    A3.1.3. The proponent EPF establishes the date and location, 
arranges for hiring the court reporter, funds temporary duty costs for 
the hearing officer, makes logistical arrangements (for example, 
publishing notices, arranging for press coverage, obtaining tables and 
chairs, etc.), and forwards the transcripts of the hearings to AFLSA/
JAJT.
    A3.2. Notice of Hearing (40 CFR 1506.6):
    A3.2.1. Public Affairs officers:
    A3.2.1.1. Announce public hearings and assemble a mailing list of 
individuals to be invited.
    A3.2.1.2. Distribute announcements of a hearing to all interested 
individuals and agencies, including the print and electronic media.
    A3.2.1.3. Under certain circumstances, purchase an advertisement 
announcing the time and place of the hearing as well as other pertinent 
particulars.
    A3.2.1.4. Distribute the notice in a timely manner so it will reach 
recipients or be published at least 15 days before the hearing date. 
Distribute notices fewer than 15 days before the hearing date when you 
have substantial justification and if the justification for a shortened 
notice period appears in the notice.
    A3.2.2. If an action has effects of national concern, publish 
notices in the Federal Register and mail notices to national 
organizations that have an interest in the matter.
    A3.2.2.1. Because of the longer lead time required by the Federal 
Register, send out notices for publication in the Federal Register to 
arrive at HQ USAF/CEV no later than 30 days before the hearing date.
    A3.2.3. The notice should include:
    A3.2.3.1. Date, time, place, and subject of the hearing.
    A3.2.3.2. A description of the general format of the hearing.
    A3.2.3.3. The name and telephone number of a person to contact for 
more information.
    A3.2.3.4. The request that speakers submit (in writing or by return 
call) their intention to participate, with an indication of which 
environmental impact (or impacts) they wish to address.
    A3.2.3.5. Any limitation on the length of oral statements.
    A3.2.3.6. A suggestion that speakers submit statements of 
considerable length in writing.
    A3.2.3.7. A summary of the proposed action.
    A3.2.3.8. The offices or location where the Draft EIS and any 
appendices are available for examination.
    A.3.3. Availability of the Draft EIS to the Public. The EPF makes 
copies of the Draft EIS available to the public at an Air Force 
installation or other suitable place in the vicinity of the proposed 
action and public hearing.
    A3.4. Place of the Hearing. The EPF arranges to hold the hearing at 
a time and place and in an area readily accessible to military and 
civilian organizations and individuals interested in the proposed 
action. Generally, the EPF should arrange to hold the hearing in an off-
base civilian facility, which is more accessible to the public.
    A3.5. Hearing Officer:
    A3.5.1. The AFLSA/JAJT selects a judge advocate, who is a military 
judge with experience in conducting public meetings, to preside over 
hearings. The hearing officer does not need to have personal knowledge 
of the project, other than familiarity with the Draft EIS. In no event 
should the hearing officer be the Staff Judge Advocate of the proponent 
command, have participated personally in the development of the project, 
or have rendered legal advice or assistance with respect to it (or be 
expected to do so in the future). The principal qualification of the 
hearing officer should be the ability to conduct a hearing as an 
impartial participant.
    A3.5.2. The primary duties of the hearing officer are to make sure 
that the hearing is orderly, is recorded, and that interested parties 
have a reasonable opportunity to speak. The presiding officer should 
direct the speakers' attention to the purpose of the hearing, which is 
to consider the environmental impacts of the proposed project. Each 
speaker should have a time limit to provide maximum public input to the 
decision-maker.
    A3.6. Record of the Hearing. The hearing officer must make sure a 
verbatim transcribed record of the hearing is prepared, including all 
stated positions, all questions, and all responses. The hearing officer 
should append all written submissions that parties provide to the 
hearing officer during the hearing to the record as attachments. The 
hearing officer should also append a list of persons who spoke at the 
hearing and submitted written comments and a list of the organizations 
or interests they represent with addresses. The hearing officer must 
make sure a verbatim transcript of the hearing is provided to the EPF 
for inclusion as an appendix to the Final EIS. The officer should also 
ensure that all persons who request a copy of the transcript get a copy 
when it is completed. Copying charges are determined according to 40 CFR 
1506.6(f).
    A3.7. Hearing Format. Use the format outlined below as a general 
guideline for conducting a hearing. Hearing officers should tailor the 
format to meet the hearing objectives. These objectives provide 
information to the public, record opinions of interested persons on 
environmental impacts of the proposed action, and set out alternatives 
for improving the EIS and for later consideration.
    A3.7.1. Organizing Speakers by Subject. If time and circumstances 
permit, the hearing

[[Page 264]]

officer should group speakers by subject matter. For example, all 
persons wishing to address water quality issues should make their 
presentations one after the other so the EIS preparation team can review 
the transcript and make summaries from it more easily.
    A3.7.2. Record of Attendees. The hearing officer should make a list 
of all persons who wish to speak at the hearing to help the hearing 
officer in calling on these individuals, to ensure an accurate 
transcript of the hearing, and to enable the officer to send a copy of 
the Final EIS (40 CFR Sec. 1502.19) to any person, organization, or 
agency that provided substantive comments at the hearing. The hearing 
officer should assign assistants to the entrance of the hearing room to 
provide cards on which individuals can voluntarily write their names, 
addresses, telephone numbers, organizations they represent, and titles; 
whether they desire to make a statement at the hearing; and what 
environmental area(s) they wish to address. The hearing officer can then 
use the cards to call on individuals who desire to make statements. 
However, the hearing officer will not deny entry to the hearing or the 
right to speak to people who decline to submit this information on 
cards.
    A3.7.3. Introductory Remarks. The hearing officer should first 
introduce himself or herself and the EIS preparation team. Then the 
hearing officer should make a brief statement on the purpose of the 
hearing and give the general ground rules on how it will be conducted. 
This is the proper time to welcome any dignitaries who are present. The 
hearing officer should explain that he or she does not make any 
recommendation or decision on whether the proposed project should be 
continued, modified, or abandoned or how the EIS should be prepared.
    A3.7.4. Explanation of the Proposed Action. The Air Force EIS 
preparation team representative should next explain the proposed action, 
the alternatives, the potential environmental consequences, and the 
EIAP.
    A3.7.5. Questions by Attendees. After the EIS team representative 
explains the proposed action, alternatives, and consequences, the 
hearing officer should give attendees a chance to ask questions to 
clarify points they may not have understood. The hearing officer may 
have to reply in writing, at a later date, to some of the questions. 
While the Air Force EIS preparation team should be as responsive as 
possible in answering questions about the proposal, they should not 
become involved in debate with questioners over the merits of the 
proposed action. Cross-examination of speakers, either those of the Air 
Force or the public, is not the purpose of an informal hearing. If 
necessary, the hearing officer may limit questioning or conduct portions 
of the hearing to ensure proper lines of inquiry. However, the hearing 
officer should include all questions in the hearing record.
    A3.7.6. Statement of Attendees. The hearing officer must give the 
persons attending the hearing a chance to present oral or written 
statements. The hearing officer should be sure the recorder has the name 
and address of each person who submits an oral or written statement. The 
officer should also permit the attendees to submit written statements 
within a reasonable time, usually two weeks, following the hearing. The 
officer should allot a reasonable length of time at the hearing for 
receiving oral statements. The officer may waive any announced time 
limit at his or her discretion. The hearing officer may allow those who 
have not previously indicated a desire to speak to identify themselves 
and be recognized only after those who have previously indicated their 
intentions to speak have spoken.
    A3.7.7. Ending or Extending a Hearing. The hearing officer has the 
power to end the hearing if the hearing becomes disorderly, if the 
speakers become repetitive, or for other good cause. In any such case, 
the hearing officer must make a statement for the record on the reasons 
for terminating the hearing. The hearing officer may also extend the 
hearing beyond the originally announced date and time. The officer 
should announce the extension to a later date or time during the hearing 
and prior to the hearing if possible.
    A3.8. Adjourning the Hearing. After all persons have had a chance to 
speak, when the hearing has culled a representative view of public 
opinion, or when the time set for the hearing and any reasonable 
extension of time has ended, the hearing officer adjourns the hearing. 
In certain circumstances (for example, if the hearing officer believes 
it is likely that some participants will introduce new and relevant 
information), the hearing officer may justify scheduling an additional, 
separate hearing session. If the hearing officer makes the decision to 
hold another hearing while presiding over the original hearing he or she 
should announce that another public hearing will be scheduled or is 
under consideration. The officer gives notice of a decision to continue 
these hearings in essentially the same way he or she announced the 
original hearing, time permitting. The Public Affairs officer provides 
the required public notices and directs notices to interested parties in 
coordination with the hearing officer. Because of lead time constraints, 
SAF/MIQ may waive Federal Register notice requirements or advertisements 
in local publications. At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing 
officer should inform the attendees of the deadline (usually 2 weeks) to 
submit additional written remarks in the hearing record. The officer 
should also notify attendees of the deadline for the commenting period 
of the Draft EIS.

Sec. 1285.1  Purpose and scope.

    This rule provides policies and procedures for the DLA 
implementation of DoD 5400.7-R,\1\ DoD Freedom of Information Act 
Program. It applies to HQ DLA and all DLA field activities and takes 
precedence over all DLA regulations that supplement the FOIA program. A 
list of mailing addresses for DLA activities is provided at appendix A 
to this part.

<R05>
Sec. 1285.2  Policy.

    (a) General. The public has a right to information concerning the 
activities of its Government. DLA policy is to conduct its activities in 
an open manner and provide the public with a maximum amount of accurate 
and timely information concerning its activities, consistent always with 
the legitimate public and private interests of the American people. A 
DLA record requested by a member of the public who follows rules 
established herein shall be withheld only when it is exempt from 
mandatory public disclosure

[[Page 272]]

under the FOIA. In order that the public may have timely information 
concerning DLA activities, records requested through public information 
channels by news media representatives that would not be withheld if 
requested under the FOIA should be released upon request. Prompt 
responses to requests for information from news media representatives 
should be encouraged to eliminate the need for these requesters to 
invoke the provisions of the FOIA and thereby assist in providing timely 
information to the public. Similarly, requests from other members of the 
public for information should continue to be honored through appropriate 
means even though the request does not qualify under FOIA requirements.
    (b) Control system. A request for records that invokes the FOIA 
shall enter a formal control system designed to ensure compliance with 
the FOIA. A release determination must be made and the requester 
informed within the time limits specified in this rule. Any request for 
DLA records that either explicitly or implicitly cites the FOIA shall be 
processed under the provisions of this rule, unless otherwise required 
by paragraph (m) of this section.
    (c) Compliance with the FOIA. DLA personnel are expected to comply 
with the FOIA and this rule in both letter and spirit. This strict 
adherence is necessary to provide uniformity in the implementation of 
the DLA FOIA program and to create conditions that will promote public 
trust. To promote a positive attitude among DLA personnel, each DLA 
Primary Level Field Activity (PLFA) will establish education and 
training programs described in part 286, subpart H, of this title. 
Training materials, including supplements, will be coordinated with DLA-
XAM prior to publication or issuance.
    (d) Openness with the public. DLA shall conduct its activities in an 
open manner consistent with the need for security and adherence to other 
requirements of law and regulation. Records not exempt from disclosure 
under the Act shall, upon request, be made readily accessible to the 
public in accordance with rules promulgated herein, whether or not the 
Act is invoked.
    (e) Avoidance of procedural obstacles. DLA activities shall ensure 
that procedural matters do not unnecessarily impede a requester from 
obtaining DLA records promptly. DLA activities shall provide assistance 
to requesters to help them understand and comply with procedures 
established by this rule and any rules published by the DLA PLFA's.
    (f) Prompt action on requests. When a member of the public complies 
with the procedures established in this rule for obtaining DLA records, 
the request shall receive prompt attention; a reply shall be dispatched 
within 10 working days unless a delay is authorized. When a DLA activity 
has a significant number of requests, e.g., 10 or more, the requests 
shall be processed in order of receipt. However, this does not preclude 
an activity from completing action on a request which can be easily 
answered, regardless of its ranking within the order of receipt. A DLA 
activity may expedite action on a request regardless of its ranking 
within the order of receipt upon a showing of exceptional need or 
urgency. Exceptional need or urgency is determined at the discretion of 
the activity processing the request.
    (g) Public domain. Nonexempt records released under the authority of 
this rule are considered to be in the public domain. Such records may 
also be made available in reading rooms to facilitate public access. 
Exempt records released pursuant to this rule or other statutory or 
regulatory authority, however, may be considered to be in the public 
domain only when their release constitutes a waiver of the FOIA 
exemption. When the release does not constitute such a waiver, such as 
when disclosure is made to a properly constituted advisory committee or 
to a Congressional committee, the released records do not lose their 
exempt status. Also, while authority may exist to disclose records to 
individuals in their official capacity, the provisions of this rule 
apply if the same individual seeks the records in a private or personal 
capacity.
    (h) Creating a record. (1) There is no obligation to create nor 
compile a record to satisfy an FOIA request. A DLA activity, however, 
may compile a new record when doing so would result

[[Page 273]]

in a more useful response to the requester or be less burdensome to the 
activity provided the requester does not object. The cost of creating or 
compiling such a record may not be charged to the requester unless the 
fee for creating the record is equal to or less than the fee which would 
be charged for providing the existing record. Fee assessments shall be 
in accordance with Sec. 1285.6 of this part and part 286, subpart F, of 
this title.
    (2) With respect to electronic data, the issue of whether records 
are actually created or merely extracted from an existing database is 
not always readily apparent. Consequently, when responding to FOIA 
requests for electronic data where creation of a record, programming, or 
particular format are questionable, DLA activities should apply a 
standard of reasonableness. In other words, if the capability exists to 
respond to the request and the effort would be a business-as-usual 
approach, then the request should be processed. However, the request 
need not be processed where the capability to respond does not exist 
without a significant expenditure of resources, thus not being a normal 
business-as-usual approach.
    (i) Description of the requested record. (1) Identification of the 
record desired is the responsibility of the member of the public who 
requests a record. The requester must provide a description of the 
desired record that enables DLA to locate the record with a reasonable 
amount of effort. When a DLA activity receives a request that does not 
reasonably describe the requested record, it shall notify the requester 
of the defect. The requester may be asked to provide the type of 
information outlined in paragraph (i)(2) of this section. Activities are 
not obligated to act on the request until the requester responds to the 
specificity letter. When practicable, DLA activities shall offer 
assistance to the requester in identifying the records sought and in 
reformulating the request to reduce the burden on the agency in 
complying with the Act.
    (2) The following guidelines are provided to deal with ``fishing 
expedition'' requests and are based on the principle of reasonable 
effort. Descriptive information about a record may be divided into two 
broad categories.
    (i) Category I is file-related and includes information such as type 
of record (for example, memorandum), title, index citation, subject 
area, date the record was created, and originator.
    (ii) Category II is event-related and includes the circumstances 
that resulted in the record being created or the date and circumstances 
surrounding the event the record covers.
    (3) Generally, a record is not reasonably described unless the 
description contains sufficient Category I information to permit the 
conduct of an organized, nonrandom search based on the activity's filing 
arrangements and existing retrieval systems, or unless the record 
contains sufficient Category II information to permit inference of the 
Category I elements needed to conduct such a search. The decision of the 
DLA activity concerning reasonableness of description must be based on 
knowledge of its files. If the description enables DLA activity 
personnel to locate the record with reasonable effort, the description 
is adequate.
    (4) The following guidelines deal with requests for personal 
records. Ordinarily, when only personal identifiers are provided in 
connection with a request for records concerning the requester, then 
only records retrievable by personal identifiers need be searched. The 
search for such records may be conducted under Privacy Act procedures 
contained in DLAR 5400.21.\2\ No record may be denied that is releasable 
under the FOIA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Copies may be obtained, at cost, from DASC-PD, Cameron Station, 
Alexandria, VA 22304-6130.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (j) Possession and control. A record must exist and be in the 
possession and control of DLA at the time of the search to be considered 
subject to this rule and the FOIA. Mere possession of a record does not 
presume Agency control. Information created or originated by another 
activity shall be referred to that activity for release determination 
and direct response to the requester.
    (1) Referring requests. A DLA activity having no responsive records 
to an FOIA request may refer the request to another DLA activity, DoD 
component, or Federal agency if, after consultation with such activity, 
component, or

[[Page 274]]

agency, the intended recipient confirms that it has the requested 
record. In cases where the DLA activity receiving the request has reason 
to believe that the existence or nonexistence or the record may in 
itself be classified, that activity shall consult the DoD component 
having cognizance over the record in question before referring the 
request. If the DoD component that is consulted determines that the 
existence or nonexistence of the record is in itself classified, the 
requester shall be so notified by the DLA activity originally receiving 
the request, and no referral shall take place. Otherwise, the request 
shall be referred to the other DoD component, and the requester shall be 
notified of any such referral. Any DLA activity receiving a request that 
has been misaddressed shall refer the request to the proper address and 
advise the requester.
    (2) Referring records. (i) Whenever a record or a portion of a 
record is, after prior consultation, referred to another DLA activity, 
DoD component, or to a Government agency outside of the DoD for a 
release determination and direct response, the requester shall be 
informed of the referral. Referred records shall only be identified to 
the extent consistent with security requirements.
    (ii) A DLA activity shall refer an FOIA request for a classified 
record that it holds to another DoD component or agency outside the 
Department of Defense if the record originated in the other DoD 
component or outside agency or if the classification is derivative. In 
this situation, provide the record and a release recommendation on the 
record with the referral action.
    (iii) A DLA activity may refer a request for a record that it 
originated to another DoD component or agency when the record was 
created for the use of the other DoD component or agency. The DoD 
component or agency for which the record was created may have an equally 
valid interest in withholding the record as the DLA activity that 
created the record. In such situations, provide the record and a release 
recommendation on the record with the referral action.
    (iv) Within DLA, an activity shall ordinarily refer an FOIA request 
for a record that it holds but that was originated by another activity 
or that contains substantial information obtained from another activity 
to that activity for direct response after coordination and obtaining 
concurrence from the activity. The requester shall then be notified of 
such referral. DLA activities shall not, in any case, release or deny 
such records without prior consultation with the other activity.
    (3) On-loan documents. A DLA activity shall refer to the agency that 
provided the record any FOIA request for investigative, intelligence, or 
any other type of records that are on loan to DLA for a specific purpose 
if the records are restricted from further release and so marked. 
However if, for investigative or intelligence purposes, the outside 
agency desires anonymity, a DLA activity may only respond directly to 
the requester after coordination with the outside agency.
    (4) General Accounting Office (GAO) documents. On occasion, the DoD 
receives FOIA requests for GAO documents containing DoD information. 
Even though the GAO is outside the executive branch and not subject to 
the FOIA, all FOIA requests from GAO documents containing DoD 
information received either from the public or on referral from GAO will 
be processed under the provisions of the FOIA.
    (5) Agencies not subject to the FOIA. A DLA activity may refer an 
FOIA request for any record that originated in an agency outside the DoD 
or that is based on information obtained from an outside agency to the 
agency for direct response to the requester after coordination with the 
outside agency, if that agency is subject to FOIA. Otherwise, the DLA 
activity must respond to the request.
    (6) Time to respond. DLA activities that receive referred requests 
shall answer them in accordance with the time limits established by the 
FOIA and this rule. Those time limits shall begin to run upon proper 
receipt of the referral by the PLFA FOIA manager to respond.
    (7) Accumulating fees. Requesters receiving the first two hours of 
search and the first 100 pages of duplication without charge (see part 
286, subpart F, of this title) are entitled to such only once per 
request. Consequently, if a

[[Page 275]]

DLA activity, after completing its portion of a request, finds it 
necessary to refer the request to another DLA activity or another DoD 
component to action their portion of the request, the referring activity 
shall inform the recipient of the expended amount of search time and 
duplication cost to date.
    (k) Requests for authentication of records. FOIA requests for 
authentication of records shall be authenticated with an appropriate 
seal, whenever necessary, to fulfill an official Government or other 
legal function according to DLA Regulation 5105.5.\3\ This service, 
however, is in addition to that required under the FOIA and is not 
included in the FOIA fee schedule. DLA activities may charge for the 
service at a rate of $5.20 for each authentication.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See Footnote 2 to Sec. 1285.2(i)(4).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (l) Records management. FOIA records shall be maintained and 
disposed of in accordance with DLA Manual 5015.1.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See Footnote 2 to Sec. 1285.2(i)(4).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (m) Relationship between the FOIA and the Privacy Act. Not all 
requesters are knowledgeable of the appropriate statutory authority to 
cite when requesting records. In some instances, they may cite neither 
Act but will imply one or both Acts. For these reasons, the following 
guidelines are provided to ensure that requesters receive the greatest 
amount of access rights under both Acts:
    (1) Requesters who seek records about themselves contained in a 
Privacy Act system of records and who cite or imply the Privacy Act, 
will have their requests processed under the provisions of the Privacy 
Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a.
    (2) Requesters who seek records about themselves which are not 
contained in a Privacy Act system of records and who cite or imply the 
Privacy Act, will have their requests processed under the provisions of 
the FOIA, since they have no access rights under the Privacy Act.
    (3) Requesters who seek records about themselves which are contained 
in a Privacy Act system of records and who cite or imply the FOIA or 
both Acts will have their requests processed under the time limits of 
the FOIA and the exemption and fee provisions of the Privacy Act.
    (4) Requesters who seek access to Agency records and who cite or 
imply the Privacy Act, the FOIA, or both will have their requests 
processed under the FOIA.
    (5) Requesters should be advised in final responses why their 
request was processed under a particular act.
    (n) Reading rooms. (1) DLA activities may provide a facility or room 
where the public may inspect and copy or have copied the so-called 
``(a)(2)'' material (see Sec. 1285.3(b) of this part). At those 
activities where it is impractical to set up a formal reading room, the 
FOIA manager will arrange for a review of ``(a)(2)'' material at a 
suitable time and location. Identifying details that, if revealed, would 
create a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy may be deleted 
from ``(a)(2)'' materials prior to placement in reading rooms. However, 
in every case, justification for the deletion must be fully explained in 
writing. The public's right to inspect first and then decide what is to 
be copied applies only to ``(a)(2)'' material. Activities may elect to 
place other documents in their reading room, including so-called 
``(a)(1)'' material (see Sec. 1285.3(a) of this part), as a means to 
provide public access to such documents and allow the public to first 
inspect them before copying. When appropriate, the cost of copying may 
be imposed on the person requesting the material in accordance with 
Sec. 1285.6 of this part and part 286, subpart F, of this title.
    (2) ``(a)(2)'' materials index. Each activity maintaining a reading 
room shall maintain an index of the ``(a)(2)'' materials that are 
issued, adopted, or promulgated after 4 July 1967. No ``(a)(2)'' 
materials issued, promulgated, or adopted after 4 July 1967 that are not 
indexed and either made available or published may be relied upon or 
used or cited as precedent against any individual unless such individual 
has actual and timely notice of the contents of such materials. Each 
index shall be arranged topically or by descriptive words rather than by 
case name or numbering system so that members of the public can readily 
locate material.

[[Page 276]]

Case name and numbering arrangements, however, may also be included for 
the convenience of the DLA activity. Such materials issued, promulgated, 
or adopted before 4 July 1967 need not be indexed but must be made 
available upon request if not exempted under part 286, subpart C, of 
this title.
    (3) DLA publications and PLFA supplements may, at the discretion of 
the DLA activity, be regarded as ``(a)(2)'' material and placed in 
reading rooms subject to the restrictions in paragraph (o)(2) of this 
section. Otherwise, requests for publications will be handled according 
to paragraph (o)(1) of this section.
    (o) Publications of DLA regulations, manuals, handbooks, and 
uncontrolled forms. (1) Since most DLA publications are available to the 
public through the publications distribution sales outlet, the requester 
may be referred to that outlet.
    (2) Requests for DLA publications which are classified, marked ``FOR 
OFFICIAL USE ONLY,'' or have limited distribution statements will be 
referred to the issuing activity for release determination and, if 
appropriate, formal denial. Such publications will not be placed in 
reading rooms. However, where a public reading room also serves as an 
activity's library, restricted publications may be maintained provided 
they are appropriately safeguarded and not commingled with other 
nonensitive regulations.
    (3) For DoD regulations, manuals, directives, handbooks and similar 
issuances, the FOIA manager may refer the requester to the National 
Technical Information Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, 
VA 22161-2171.
    (p) Exemptions. The types of records described in part 286, subpart 
C, of this title may be withheld in whole or in part from disclosure 
under the FOIA unless otherwise prescribed by law.
    (q) Requests for the examination of DLA records. Only those 
materials described as ``(a)(2)'' (and ``(a)(1)'' at the discretion of 
the PLFA head) are subject to the examination clause of the FOIA. Such 
requests will be submitted directly to the appropriate DLA activity 
listed in appendix A. FOIA managers will inform requesters of the 
location and time the requested record may be examined. Requesters may 
be charged for the cost to reproduce copies subject to the guidelines 
Sec. 1285.6 of this part and part 286, subpart F, of this title.
    (r) Requests for copies of records. Individuals seeking copies of 
DLA records should address their FOIA requests to the FOIA manager of 
the appropriate activity. Addresses and brief descriptions of functions 
are included in appendix A to this part.
    (s) Requests from private parties. The provisions of the FOIA are 
reserved for persons with private interests as opposed to Federal 
Governments seeking official information. Requests from private persons 
will be made in writing and will clearly show all other addressees 
within the Federal Government to whom the request was also sent. This 
procedure will reduce processing time requirements and ensure better 
inter- and intra-agency coordination. DLA activities are under no 
obligation to establish procedures to receive hand delivered requests. 
Release for records to individuals under the FOIA is considered public 
release of information, except as provided for in paragraph (g) of this 
section and Sec. 286.13(a) of this title.
    (t) Requests from government officials. Requests from Members of 
Congress for records on behalf for a Congressional Committee, 
Subcommittee, or either House sitting as a whole will be processed 
according to DLA Regulation 5400.12.\5\ Requests from officials of 
foreign governments which do not invoke the FOIA shall be referred to HQ 
DLA-I or the appropriate foreign disclosure channel for processing and 
the requester so notified. Requests invoking the FOIA from the following 
government officials will be considered the same as any other requested 
and processed according to this rule:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See Footnote 2 to Sec. 1285.2(i)(4).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) Officials of State or local governments.
    (2) Members of Congress seeking records on behalf of their 
constituents.
    (3) Officials of foreign governments.
    (u) Privileged release to U.S. Government officials. (1) Records 
determined to be exempt from public disclosure under one or more of FOIA 
exemptions may

[[Page 277]]

be authenticated and released to U.S. Government officials requesting 
them on behalf of Federal governmental bodies, whether legislative, 
executive, administrative, or judicial, as follows:
    (i) To a Committee or Subcommittee of Congress or to either House 
sitting as a whole in accordance with DoD Directive 5400.4.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ See Footnote 1 to Sec. 1285.1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) To the Federal courts, whenever ordered by officers of the 
court as necessary for the proper administration of justice. However, 
receipt of a subpoena duces tecum does not automatically compel 
disclosure of DLA records. To qualify for privileged release under this 
section, the subpoena must be signed by the judge of a court of 
competent jurisdiction. A subpoena which has been sent through FOIA 
channels and signed by a litigating attorney, a subpoena service agent, 
or an official of a state or local court will be treated as any other 
FOIA request and subject to the exemptions in part 286 subpart C, of 
this title. Consult with Counsel before acting on such subpoenas.
    (iii) To other Federal Agencies, both executive and administrative, 
as determined by the DLA Director or designee.
    (2) Disclosure under these privileged release circumstances does not 
set a precedent for disclosure to the general public under the FOIA.
    (3) DLA activities shall inform officials receiving records under 
the provisions of this paragraph that those records are exempt from 
public release under the FOIA and are privileged. DLA activities will 
also advise officials of any special handling instructions. See part 
286, subpart D, of this title for marking requirements under privileged 
release circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 1285.3  Definitions.

    The following terms and meanings shall be applicable:
    (a) ``(a)(1) material''. Material described in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1) 
consisting of descriptions of central and field organizations and, to 
the extent that they affect the public, rules of procedures, 
descriptions of forms available, instruction as to the scope and 
contents of papers, reports, or examinations, and any amendment, 
revision, or report of the aforementioned.
    (b) ``(a)(2) material''. Material described in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) 
encompassing:
    (1) Final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, 
and orders made in the adjudication of cases, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 
551, that may be cited, used, or relied upon as precedents in future 
adjudications.
    (2) Statements of policy and interpretations that have been adopted 
by the agency and are not published in the Federal Register.
    (3) Administrative staff manuals and instructions, or portions 
thereof, that establish DLA policy or interpretations of policy that 
affect a member of the public. This provision does not apply to 
instructions for employees on tactics and techniques to be used in 
performing their duties or to instructions relating only to the internal 
management of the DLA activities. Examples of manuals and instructions 
not normally made available include but are not limited to the 
following:
    (i) Those issued for audit, investigation, and inspection purposes 
or those that prescribe operational tactics, standards of performance, 
or criteria for defense, prosecution, or settlement of cases.
    (ii) Operations and maintenance manuals and technical information 
concerning munitions, equipment, systems, and foreign intelligence 
operations.
    (c) Administrative appeal. A request made under the FOIA by a member 
of the general public asking the appellate authority to reverse an 
initial denial authority's decision to withhold all or part of a 
requested record, to review a ``no record found'' determination, to 
reverse a decision to deny a request for waiver or reduction of fees, or 
to review a category determination for fee assessment purposes.
    (d) Agency record. (1) The products of data compilation, such as all 
books, papers, maps and photographs, machine readable materials, or 
other documentary materials, regardless of physical form or 
characteristics, made or received by an agency of the United States 
Government under Federal law in connection with the transaction of

[[Page 278]]

public business and in DLA's possession and control at the time the FOIA 
request is made.
    (2) The following are not included within the definition of the word 
``record'':
    (i) Objects or articles, such as structures, furniture, vehicles and 
equipment, whatever their historical value or value as evidence.
    (ii) Administrative tools by which records are created, stored, and 
retrieved, if not created or used as sources of information about 
organizations, policies, functions, decisions, or procedures of a DLA 
activity. Normally, computer software, including source code, object 
code, and listings of source and object codes, regardless of medium, are 
not agency records. (This does not include the underlying data which is 
processed and produced by such software and which may in some instances 
be stored with the software.) Exceptions to this position are outlined 
in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
    (iii) Anything that is not a tangible or documentary record, such as 
an individual's memory or oral communication.
    (iv) Personal records of an individual not subject to agency 
creation or retention requirements, created and maintained primarily for 
the convenience of an agency employee and not distributed to other 
agency employees for their official use.
    (v) Information stored within a computer for which there is no 
existing computer program for retrieval of the requested information.
    (3) In some instances, computer software may have to be treated as 
an agency record and processed under the FOIA. These situations are rare 
and shall be treated on a case-by-case basis. Examples of when computer 
software may have to be treated as an agency record are:
    (i) When the data is embedded within the software and cannot be 
extracted without the software. In this situation, both the data and the 
software must be reviewed for release or denial under the FOIA.
    (ii) Where the software itself reveals information about 
organizations, policies, functions, decisions, or procedures of a DLA 
activity, such as computer models used to forecast budget outlays, 
calculate retirement system costs, or optimization models on travel 
costs.
    (iii) See part 286, subpart C, of this title for guidance on release 
determinations of computer software.
    (4) A record must exist and be in the possession and control of DLA 
at the time of the request to be considered subject to this rule and the 
FOIA. There is no obligation to create, compile, or obtain a record to 
satisfy an FOIA request.
    (5) If unaltered publications and processed documents, such as 
regulations, manuals, maps, charts, and related geophysical materials 
are available to the public through an established distribution system 
with or without charge, the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3) normally do 
not apply, and requests for such need not be processed under the FOIA. 
Normally, documents disclosed to the public by publication in the 
Federal Register also require no processing under the FOIA. In such 
cases, DLA activities should direct the requester to the appropriate 
source to obtain the record.
    (e) Appellate authority. The Director, DLA, or his designee, except 
for fee waivers and category determinations. The appellate authority for 
such appeals is the Staff Director, Office of Administration, HQ DLA.
    (f) DLA activity. An element of DLA authorized to receive and act 
independently on FOIA requests. A DLA activity has its own FOIA manager, 
initial denial authority, and office of counsel.
    (g) Electronic data. Those records and information which are 
created, stored, and retrievable by electronic means. This does not 
include computer software, which is the tool by which to create, store, 
or retrieve electronic data. See paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) and (d)(3) of 
this section for a discussion of computer software.
    (h) FOIA request. A written request for records made by any person, 
including a member of the public (U.S. or foreign citizen), an 
organization, or a business, but not including a Federal agency or a 
fugitive from the law, that either explicitly or implicitly invokes the 
FOIA, DoD 5400.7-R, DLAR 5400.14, this rule, or DLA activity

[[Page 279]]

supplementing regulations or instructions.
    (i) Initial denial authority (IDA). An official who has been granted 
authority by the Director, DLA, to withhold records requested under the 
FOIA for one or more of the nine categories of records exempt from 
mandatory disclosure or to issue a ``no record'' determination. These 
include the Directors (or equivalent) of HQ DLA Primary Staff Elements 
(PSE's) and the Commanders (or equivalent) of PLFA's. For fee waiver and 
requester category determinations, the initial denial authority is the 
FOIA manager or head of the FOIA unit.
    (j) Public interest disclosures. Those disclosures which shed light 
on DLA performance of its statutory duties and thus inform citizens 
about what their government is doing. The ``public interest'', however, 
is not fostered by disclosure of information about private citizens that 
is accumulated in various governmental files that reveals little or 
nothing about an agency's or official's own conduct. The public interest 
is one of several factors considered in determining if a fee waiver is 
appropriate (see part 286, subpart F, of this title).
    (k) Releasing official. Any individual with sufficient knowledge of 
a requested record or program to allow him or her to determine if harm 
would come through release. Releasing officials are at all levels and 
may be selected to review a particular document because of their 
expertise in the subject area. The level must be high enough to make 
sure that releases are made according to the policies outlined here. The 
authority to release records of a routine nature, such as fact sheets or 
local directories, may be delegated to any individual at the discretion 
of the denial authority. In doubtful cases, releasing officials may 
consult with the FOIA staff or servicing counsel prior to release.

<R05>
Sec. 1285.5  Procedures.

    (a) FOIA channels. If DLA personnel receive a FOIA request directly 
from the public that has not been logged in and processed through the 
FOIA office, they will immediately forward it to the local FOIA manager.
    (b) Central log system. Each FOIA manager will maintain a central 
log of FOIA requests received within the activity to ensure compliance 
with the time limits and accurate cost accounting, fee assessment, and 
reporting.
    (c) Time limit. FOIA requests must be responded to within 10 
business days after proper receipt, except in unusual circumstances 
outlined in paragraph (j) of this section. A request is considered 
properly received on the date the FOIA manager receives it provided the 
request has been reasonably described and the requester has either 
agreed to pay assessable fees or has provided sufficient justification 
for a fee waiver.
    (d) Screening requests. (1) Before assigning a request for search, 
the FOIA manager will screen the request for defects in the description, 
the requester category, and the issue of fees. FOIA managers will notify 
requesters of any such defects and, wherever possible, offer assistance 
to help remedy the defects. If the FOIA manager must consult with the 
requester on any of the following issues, then the request is not 
considered to be properly received and the 10-day time limit does not 
begin or resume until the requester has satisfactorily addressed the 
issue.
    (i) Payments in arrears. If a requester has failed to pay fees for a 
previous request, then the FOIA manager need not process the current 
request until the requester pays the delinquent amount. In such 
situations, the FOIA manager will notify the requester of the defect and 
provide an opportunity to forward payment along with any assessable 
interest. At that time, the FOIA manager may, at his or her discretion, 
demand that the requester also pay an estimated fee for the current 
request.
    (ii) Faulty description. If the request is not reasonably described, 
the FOIA manager will notify the requester of the defect and advise that 
a search cannot be initiated without more specific information. In 
making such determinations, FOIA managers may consult with offices of 
primary interest to determine the details that are needed to conduct a 
search. See also paragraph (f)(2) of this section and Sec. 1285.2(i) of 
this part.
    (iii) Requester category and fees. The FOIA manager will analyze the 
request to determine the category of the requester. If the category of 
the requester is different than that claimed by the requester, the FOIA 
manager will:
    (A) Notify the requester that he or she should provide additional 
justification to warrant the category claimed and that a search for 
responsive records will not be initiated until agreement has been 
attained relative to the category of the requester. Absent further 
category justification from the requester and within a reasonable period 
of time (i.e., 30 calendar days), the FOIA manager shall render a

[[Page 282]]

final category determination, and notify the requester of such 
determination, to include normal administrative appeal rights.
    (B) Advise the requester that, notwithstanding any appeal, a search 
for responsive records will not be initiated until the requester 
indicates a willingness to pay assessable costs appropriate for the 
category determined by the FOIA manager. Requesters must submit a fee 
declaration appropriate for the following categories:
    (1) Commercial. Requesters must indicate a willingness to pay all 
search, review, and duplication costs.
    (2) Educational or noncommercial scientific institution or news 
media. Requesters must indicate a willingness to pay duplication charges 
in excess of 100 pages if more than 100 pages of records are desired.
    (3) All others. Requesters must indicate a willingness to pay 
assessable search and duplication costs if more than two hours of search 
effort or 100 pages of records are desired.
    (iv) Justification for fee waivers. If the requester has asked for a 
fee waiver but failed to provide a justification, FOIA managers will ask 
requesters to address the fee waiver criteria in part 286, subpart F, of 
this title before further processing the request. FOIA managers are 
reminded that with some types of records, a final decision cannot be 
made on waiver until after the records have been surfaced, reviewed, and 
the public benefit and previous public availability assessed.
    (2) In cases where there is disagreement on the category of the 
requester or there is lack of justification for fee waiver, the FOIA 
manager may process the request without further contacting the requester 
if he or she believes it can be processed within the automatic $15 
waiver limit.
    (e) Providing estimates. In the situations described by paragraphs 
(d)(1)(iii) and (d)(1)(iv) of this section, DLA activities must be 
prepared to provide an estimate of assessable fees if desired by the 
requester. While it is recognized that search situations will vary among 
DLA activities and that an estimate is often difficult to obtain prior 
to an actual search, requesters who desire estimates are entitled to 
such before committing to a willingness to pay. Should actual costs 
exceed the actual amount of the estimate or the amount agreed to by the 
requester, the amount in excess of the estimate or the requester's 
agreed amount shall not be charged without the requester's agreement.
    (f) Internal processing. (1) Upon making a determination that the 
request is reasonably described, that the fee issue has been settled, 
and that the requester does not owe for a prior request, the FOIA 
manager will assign the request to the appropriate office of primary 
interest (OPI) for handling and provide instructions on the category of 
the requester, the fees to be charged or waived, and what actions the 
OPI is to take.
    (2) After reviewing a request, the OPI may determine, based on 
knowledge of the files and programs, that a request is, in fact, not 
reasonably described. OPI's will notify FOIA managers of such defects 
immediately so that further details may be sought from the requester. 
Any delays on the requester's part in receiving more detailed 
information will not count toward the 10-day time limit.
    (g) Initial determinations--(1) Reasons for not releasing a record. 
There are seven reasons for not complying with a request for a record:
    (i) The request is transferred to another DLA activity, DOD 
component, or to another Federal agency.
    (ii) The DLA activity determines through knowledge of its files and 
reasonable search efforts that it neither controls nor otherwise 
possesses the requested record. Responding officials will advise 
requesters of the right to appeal such determinations. See paragraph 
(i)(5) of this section for details on processing ``no record'' 
responses.
    (iii) A record has not been described with sufficient particularity 
to enable the DLA activity to locate it by conducting a reasonable 
search.
    (iv) The requester has failed unreasonably to comply with procedural 
requirements, including payment of fees, imposed by this rule.
    (v) The request is withdrawn by the requester.
    (vi) The information requested is not a record within the meaning of 
the FOIA and this rule.

[[Page 283]]

    (vii) The record is denied in accordance with procedures set forth 
in the FOIA and this rule.
    (2) Reasonably segregable portions. Although portions of some 
records may be denied, the remaining reasonably segregable portions must 
be released to the requester when it reasonably can be assumed that a 
skillful and knowledgeable person could not reconstruct the excised 
information. When a record is denied in whole, the response advising the 
requester of that determination will specifically state that it is not 
reasonable to segregate portions of the record for release.
    (h) Preparing documents for public release--(1) Material containing 
For Official Use Only marks. When a determination has been made that a 
FOUO document may be fully released to a requester under any public 
information program, the FOUO markings will be removed from the 
requester's copy prior to release. In cases where a person seeks access 
to his or her own record and the record is marked FOUO to protect that 
person's personal or proprietary interests, the FOUO marks will be 
deleted from the requester's copy prior to release, even though the FOUO 
status has not been terminated. In such cases, the official file copy 
will retain the FOUO warning. If only portions of a document marked as 
FOUO are to be released to the public under the FOIA, then the exempt 
portions will be taped out, blackened out, whited out, or cut out and a 
copy reproduced for the requester from the marked up copy. Initial 
denial authorities will ensure that the deleted portion cannot be read 
and that the FOUO marks have been lined through prior to release.
    (2) Material containing classification markings. The procedures in 
paragraph (h)(1) of this section apply to classified documents with the 
exception that the classified portions will be cut out rather than 
blackened, taped, or whited out. The classification markings on the 
requester's copy will be deleted prior to release.
    (i) Response to requester--(1) Time limits. Initial determinations 
to release or deny a record normally shall be made and the decision 
reported to the requester within 10 working days after receipt of the 
request by the FOIA manager. When a decision is made to release a 
record, a copy should be made available promptly to the requester once 
he has complied with procedural requirements.
    (2) Acknowledging date of receipt. When the time for response 
becomes an issue, the official responsible for replying shall 
acknowledge to the requester the date of the receipt of the request.
    (3) Billing. When fees are being levied, the response to the 
requester will contain a billing paragraph. Responding officials will 
advise requesters to make checks or money orders payable to the United 
States Treasury and forward them to the FOIA manager of the PLFA that 
incurred the expense. FOIA managers will notify DLA-XAM of names and 
addresses of requesters who have failed to pay after a second billing 
has been mailed and 30 days have elapsed without payment.
    (4) Full and partial denials. (i) When a request for a record is 
denied in whole or in part on the basis of one or more of the exemptions 
in part 286, subpart C, of this title the initial denial authority shall 
inform the requester in writing and shall explain to the requester the 
basis for the determination in sufficient detail to permit the requester 
to make a decision concerning appeal. The requester specifically shall 
be informed of the exemption(s) on which the denial is based. When the 
initial denial is based in whole or in part on a security 
classification, the explanation should include a summary of the 
applicable Executive Order criteria for classification, as well as an 
explanation, to the extent reasonably feasible, of how those criteria 
apply to the particular record in question. The requester shall also be 
advised of the opportunity and procedures for appealing an unfavorable 
determination to the Director, DLA.
    (ii) FOIA managers shall forward a copy of each letter of denial to 
DLA-XAM, Cameron Station, Alexandria, Virginia 22304-6100. Do not 
include attachments, the incoming request, or any backup material.
    (5) Providing ``no record'' responses. (i) If no documents can be 
located in response to a FOIA request, the initial

[[Page 284]]

denial authority will so advise the requester. Requesters will also be 
advised that, if they consider the response to be adverse, they may file 
an appeal within 60 calendar days from the date of the response. 
Requesters are to be advised to address appeals to the local FOIA 
manager and include the case number and reasons why they believe the DLA 
activity should have records on the subject matter.
    (ii) Before a formal ``no record'' response is issued, OPI will 
verify that the requester has adequately described the record. If 
additional details will aid the search, then the requester will be asked 
to provide those details. See paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section and 
Sec. 1285.2(i) of this part for procedures for resolving inadequate 
descriptions.
    (iii) In cases where the requested record has been destroyed, the 
initial denial authority will confirm that the record was retained for 
the period authorized in DLAM 5015.1 before issuing a formal response. 
In responding to requesters in these cases, advise the requester that 
the records were properly destroyed according to Agency rules for record 
disposition and give the right to appeal as outlined in paragraph 
(i)(5)(i) of this section. However, do not ask the requester to provide 
reasons why the activity should have the records.
    (iv) Upon receipt of an appeal, the FOIA manager will direct that a 
second search be conducted using any information supplied by the 
requester. If the second search produces no documents, the appeal will 
be forwarded to HQ DLA-G, Cameron Station, Alexandria, Virginia 22304-
6100, along with a copy of the case file. The FOIA manager will include 
the cost information and an explanation of the method of search and the 
types of offices searched. In cases where the ``no record'' response was 
issued because the records have been destroyed, the FOIA manager will 
verify that the records were destroyed as provided for in DLAM 5015.1 
and provide a statement to that effect.
    (v) FOIA managers will ensure that a copy of each ``no record'' 
response letter is forwarded to DLA-XAM, Cameron Station, Alexandria, 
Virginia 22304-6100. Do not include attachments, the incoming request, 
or any backup material.
    (6) Coordination. OPI's will ensure that the proposed response is 
fully coordinated with offices having an interest in the request. 
Proposed responses to FOIA requests from members of the Congress will be 
coordinated with DLA-Y or the local Congressional Affairs focal point.
    (j) Extensions of time--(1) Formal extensions. In unusual 
circumstances, when additional time is needed to respond, the FOIA 
manager will acknowledge the request in writing within the 10-day 
period, describe the circumstances requiring the delay, and indicate the 
anticipated date for substantive response that may not exceed 10 
additional working days. Such extensions will be approved on a case-by-
case basis. In these unusual cases where the statutory time limits 
cannot be met and no informal extension of time has been agreed to, the 
inability to process any part of the request within the specified time 
should be explained to the requester with a request that he agree to 
await a substantive response by an anticipated date. It should be made 
clear that any such agreement does not prejudice the right of the 
requester to appeal the initial decision after it is made. Since the 
requester still retains the right to treat this delay as a defacto 
denial with full administrative remedies, such extensions should be 
issued only when essential. The unusual circumstances that may be cited 
to justify delay are:
    (i) Location. The requested record is located in whole or in part at 
places other than the office processing the request.
    (ii) Volume. The request requires the collection and evaluation of a 
substantial number of records.
    (iii) Consultation. Consulation is required with other DoD 
components or agencies having substantial interest in the subject matter 
to determine whether the records requested are exempt from disclosure in 
whole or in part under provisions of this rule or should be released as 
a matter of discretion.
    (2) Informal extensions. Where practical and expedient, the FOIA 
manager or official designated to respond may

[[Page 285]]

negotiate with the requester and arrange for an informal extension. Such 
extensions may be appropriate in instances where the records have to be 
ordered from a record repository; where the record has been sent out for 
commercial printing and is not expected back before the 10-day time has 
elapsed; and similar circumstances.
    (k) Misdirected requests. Misdirected requests shall be forwarded 
promptly to the FOIA manager of the DLA activity, DoD component, or 
Federal agency with the responsibility for the records requested. The 
period allowed for responding to the request misdirected by the 
requester shall not begin until the request is received by the FOIA 
manager of the PLFA that controls the records requested.
    (l) Records of contractors and other non-U.S. government sources. 
(1) Executive Order 12600 of 23 June 1987 (52 FR 23781) establishes 
predisclosure notification procedures for confidential commercial 
information. When a request is received for a record that was obtained 
from a contractor or other non-U.S. Government source or for a record 
containing information clearly identified as having been provided by a 
contractor or other non-U.S. Government source, the source of the record 
or information (also known as ``the submitter'' for matters pertaining 
to proprietary data under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)) (see Sec. 286.13(a)(4) of 
this title) shall be notified promptly of that request and afforded 
reasonable time (e.g., 30 calendar days) to present any objections 
concerning the release, unless it is clear that there can be no valid 
basis for objection. The following procedures will be followed:
    (i) The person designated to respond will provide the source with a 
copy of the incoming request, a copy of the documents responsive to the 
request, and a letter of instruction. The notification letter will be 
addressed to the president of the entity or the entity's counsel and 
sent by return receipt mail.
    (ii) When a substantial issue has been raised, the DLA activity may 
seek additional information from the source and afford the source and 
requester reasonable opportunities to present their arguments on the 
legal and substantive issues involved.
    (iii) Any objections to release will be evaluated and the source 
provided with a copy of the activity's final decision. Where a decision 
is made to release information claimed to be exempt, the source will be 
notified that the information will be released on a specified date 
unless the source seeks a restraining order or takes court action to 
prevent disclosure. Evaluators are cautioned that any decision to 
disclose information claimed to be exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) must 
be made by an official equivalent in rank to the initial denial 
authority.
    (iv) When the source advises it will seek a restraining order or 
take court action to prevent release of the record or information, the 
FOIA manager will notify the requester and suspend action on the request 
until after the outcome of that court action is known. When the 
requester brings court action to compel disclosure, the FOIA manager 
shall promptly notify the submitter of this action.
    (2) These procedures are required for those FOIA requests for data 
not deemed clearly exempt from disclosure under exemption (b)(4). If, 
for example, the record or information was provided with actual or 
presumptive knowledge of the non-U.S. Government source and established 
that it would be made available to the public upon request, there is no 
obligation to notify the source.
    (3) These coordination provisions also apply to any non-U.S. 
Government record in the possession and control of DLA from multi-
national organizations, such as North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(NATO) and North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), or foreign 
governments. Coordination with foreign governments under the provisions 
of this paragraph shall be made through the Department of State.
    (m) File of initial denials. Copies of all initial denials shall be 
maintained by each DLA activity in a form suitable for rapid retrieval, 
periodic statistical compilation, and management evaluation.
    (n) Appeals.
    (1) General.

[[Page 286]]

    (i) Appeals to record denials. Requesters denied access to records 
under the provisions of part 286, subpart C, of this title may appeal 
such determinations to the Director, DLA. The appeal should be 
accompanied by a copy of the letter denying the initial request and 
contain the basis for disagreement with the initial refusal.
    (ii) Appeals to a ``no record'' finding. Requesters have the right 
to appeal any ``no record'' finding to the FOIA manager of the activity 
that issued the finding. The letter of appeal should include the case 
number and, where appropriate, reasons why the requester believes the 
activity should have records on the subject matter. Using the 
information supplied by the requester, the FOIA manager will direct that 
a second search be conducted. If the second search produces no 
documents, the appeal will be forwarded to HQ DLA-G, Cameron Station, 
Alexandria, Virginia 22304-6100, along with a copy of the case file. The 
FOIA manager will include information on the amount of time spent on the 
request and provide an explanation of the method of search and the types 
of offices searched.
    (iii) Appeals to fee waiver denials or requester category decisions. 
Requesters may appeal an initial determination regarding placement in a 
certain fee assessment category or waiver or reduction of fees when 
disclosure serves the public interest. Requesters will include a basis 
for disagreement and submit the appeal to the Staff Director, Office of 
Administration (Attn: DLA-XAM), Cameron Station, Alexandria, Virginia 
22304-6100.
    (2) Time limits--(i) Time limits to file appeals. The requester 
shall be advised to file an appeal so that it reaches the appellate 
authority no later than 60 calendar days after the date of the initial 
denial letter. At the conclusion of this period, the case may be 
considered closed; however, such closure does not preclude the requester 
from filing litigation. In cases where the requester is provided several 
incremental determinations for a single request, the time for the appeal 
shall not begin until the requester receives the last such notification.
    (ii) Time of receipt. An FOIA appeal is considered received by DLA 
when it reaches DLA-G or, in the case of fee or requester category 
appeals, when it reaches DLA-XAM. Misdirected appeals should be referred 
expeditiously to the appropriate office.
    (iii) Time limits to decide appeals. Final determinations on appeals 
normally shall be made within 20 working days after receipt.
    (iv) Delay in responding to an appeal. (A) If additional time is 
needed due to the unusual circumstances described in paragraph (j) of 
this section, the final decision may be delayed for the number of 
working days (not to exceed 10), that were not used as additional time 
for responding to the initial request.
    (B) If a determination cannot be made and the requester notified 
within 20 working days, the appellate authority shall acknowledge to the 
requester, in writing, the date of receipt of the appeal, the 
circumstances surrounding the delay, and the anticipated date for 
substantive response. Requesters shall be advised that if the delay 
exceeds the statutory extension provision or is for reasons other than 
the unusual circumstances identified in paragraph (j) of this section, 
they may consider their administrative remedies exhausted. They may, 
however, without prejudicing their right of judicial remedy, await a 
substantive response. DLA shall continue to process the case 
expeditiously, whether or not the requester seeks a court order for 
release of the records, but a copy of any response provided subsequent 
to filing of a complaint shall be forwarded to the Department of 
Justice.
    (C) When the appellate authority or the authority's representative 
must consult with the requester over an issue not previously settled, 
such as agreement to pay fees for documents previously denied, then any 
delays on the requester's part will not count toward the 20-day time 
limit.
    (3) Response to the requester.
    (i) When an appellate authority makes a determination to release all 
or a portion of records withheld by an IDA, a copy of the records so 
released should be forwarded promptly to the requester after compliance 
with any

[[Page 287]]

preliminary procedural requirements, such as payment of fees.
    (ii) Final refusal to provide a requested record must be made in 
writing by the DLA Director or his designee. In the case of fee appeals, 
final refusal to waive or reduce fees must be made in writing by the 
Staff Director of Administration. Record denial responses, at a minimum, 
shall conform to the following:
    (A) The basis for the refusal shall be explained to the requester 
with regard to the applicable statutory exemption or exemptions invoked.
    (B) When the final refusal is based in whole or in part on a 
security classification, the explanation shall include a determination 
that the record meets the cited criteria and rationale of the governing 
Executive Order, and that this determination is based on a 
declassification review, with the explanation of how that review 
confirmed the continuing validity of the security classification.
    (C) The response shall advise the requester that the material being 
denied does not contain meaningful portions that are reasonably 
segregable.
    (D) The response shall advise the requester of the right to judicial 
review.
    (4) Consultaton. (i) Final refusal involving issues not previously 
resolved or that are known to be inconsistent with rulings of other DoD 
components ordinarily should not be made without first consulting with 
the Office of the General Counsel of the Department of Defense.
    (ii) Tentative decisions to deny records that raise new or 
significant legal issues of potential significance to other agencies of 
the Government shall be provided to the Department of Justice, Attn: 
Office of Legal Policy, Office of Information and Policy, Washington, DC 
20530.
    (5) Records management. Case files of appeals shall be retained by 
DLA-G or, in the case of fee or requester category appeals, by DLA-XAM 
for a period of six years to meet the statute of limitations of claims 
requirement.
    (o) Special mail services. DLA activities are authorized to use 
registered mail, certified mail, certificates of mailing and return 
receipts. However, their use should be limited to instances where it 
appears advisable to establish proof of dispatch or receipt of FOIA 
correspondence.
    (p) Receipt accounts. The Treasurer of the United States has 
established Receipt Account 3210 for use in depositing search, review, 
and duplication fees collected under the FOIA. Upon receipt of payment, 
the FOIA manager will forward the check or money order to DFAS/CO/PDG, 
P.O. Box 182317, Columbus, Ohio 43218-2317. FOIA managers will advise 
DFAS that the check is to be deposited to accounting classification 
21R3210.0004. This account will not, however, be used for depositing 
receipts for technical information released under the FOIA, 
industrially-funded activities, and non-appropriated funded activities. 
Instead, payments for these shall be deposited to the appropriate fund.


<R05>
Sec. 1285.6  Fees and fee waivers.

    The rules and rates published in part 286, subpart F of this title 
apply to this rule. For purposes of computer search, DLA has established 
rates of $20 per minute of central processing unit time for mainframe 
computer use and $20 per hour of wall clock time for personal computer 
use. These rates represent average operational costs and may be used 
when the actual computer cost cannot be determined.


<R05>
Sec. 1285.7  Reports.

    The reporting requirement outlined in this rule is assigned Report 
Control Symbol DD-PA(A)1365 and will be prepared according to part 286, 
subpart G, of this title.

         Appendix A to Part 1285--Gaining Access to DLA Records

                               I. General

     The Defense Logistics Agency was established pursuant to authority 
vested in the Secretary of Defense and is an agency of DoD under the 
direction, authority, and control of the Assistant Secretary of Defense 
(Production and Logistics) and is subject to DoD policies, directives, 
and instructions. DLA is made up of a headquarters and 22 Primary Level 
Field Activities (PLFA's). DLA does not have a central repository for 
its records. FOIA requests, therefore, should be addressed to the FOIA 
Office of the DLA activity that has custody of the record desired. In

[[Page 288]]

answering inquiries regarding FOIA requests, DLA personnel will assist 
requesters in determining the correct DLA activity to address their 
requests. If there is uncertainty as to the ownership of the DLA record 
desired, the requester may be referred to the FOIA manager of the DLA 
activity most likely to have the record or to HQ DLA-XAM.

         II. Description of DLA's Central and Field Organization

 A. HQ Defense Logistics Agency, Cameron Station, Alexandria, Virginia

civil agencies, and certain foreign governments. The districts are:

Defense Contract Management District Northeast (DCMDN).
Defense Contract Management District Mid Atlantic (DCMDM).
Defense Contract Management District North Central (DCMDC).
Defense Contract Management District South (DCMDS).
Defense Contract Management District West (DCMDW).
Defense Contract Management Command International (DCMCI).

                       III. Requester Requirements

                         A. Addressing Requests

    Address requests to the DLA PLFA most likely to hold the records 
(see paragraph V of this appendix for mailing addresses of FOIA 
managers). If the PLFA is undeterminable, address requests to HQ DLA-XAM 
for proper routing. Requests must be in writing.

                       B. Description of Records.

    Provide a reasonable description of the documents you are seeking. 
If you have detailed information which would help reduce the search time 
involved, please include it in your request. If you have a document 
which references the DLA record you seek, include a copy of that 
document.

                        C. Fees and fee waivers.

    State your willingness to pay fees above the $15 automatic waiver or 
provide a justification for waiver of all or part of the costs. Waiver 
requests must address with specificity each of the fee waiver elements 
in part 286, subpart F, of this title.

                  IV. Availability of DLA Publications

    Unrestricted DLA regulations, manuals, and handbooks may be 
purchased from the DLA publications sales outlet. DLA Handbook 5025.1, 
Defense Logistics Agency Index of Publications, is published quarterly 
and may be used to help you identify publications of interest to you. 
Orders for this and other nonrestricted publications may be placed 
through DASC-PD, Cameron Station, Alexandria, VA 22304-6130. That office 
will advise you of cost before completing your order.

<R05>
Sec. 1288.1  Purpose and scope.

    To prescribe policy and procedures for the registration, inspection, 
and marking of privately owned vehicles (POV) on Defense Logistics 
Agency (DLA) activities. This regulation is applicable to individuals 
serving in or employed by the Defense Logistics Agency, and to all other 
individuals subject to motor vehicle registration requirements set forth 
in this part 1288 and DLAR 5720.1/AR 190-5/OPNAVINST 11200.5B/AFR 125-
14/MCO 5110.1B, Military Police Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision.


<R05>
Sec. 1288.2  Policy.

    (a) The operation of a POV on a DLA activity constitutes a 
conditional privilege extended by the Head of the activity. The Heads of 
DLA primary level field activities (PLFA's) have the authority to 
supplement this regulation to implement additional controls and 
restraints warranted by existing conditions at a PLFA. For example, 
commanders of depots and supply centers may impose searches of vehicles 
as warranted to reduce pilferage, and protect Government interests.
    (b) POV's permanently registered for operation on a DLA activity 
will be identified by use of one of the decals prescribed in this part 
1288 (appendices A and B).
    (c) The DLA vehicle decal will be valid for a period of 3 years from 
the year and month of issue.
    (d) Activities will use DLA Form 1454, Vehicle Registration/Driver 
Record, as the basic vehicle registration and driver record.
    (e) DLA tenant activities will comply with host installation 
policies and procedures for registering POV's.


<R05>
Sec. 1288.3  Definitions.

may be temporarily registered in accordance with DLAR 5720.1, paragraph 
3-2c.


<R05>
Sec. 1288.5  Procedures.

    (a) Issuance of DLA POV decal and 3-year validation sticker. (1) One 
decal will be affixed to the left front bumper (operator's side) of a 
four-wheel vehicle. An additional decal may be placed on the rear bumper 
of the vehicle. For vehicles not equipped with bumpers and two-wheeled 
vehicles, the placement of decals will be determined locally.

[[Page 291]]

    (2) A 3-year validation sticker indicating the decal expiration will 
be issued at the same time the DLA decal is issued. Every 3 years, or

their registration information. Evidence of compliance will be 
documented by the issuance and display of a new 3-year validation 
sticker.
    (3) The validation sticker will be placed next to the DLA decal 
affixed to the front bumper of the vehicle. This sticker will reflect 
the month and year of the decal expiration, e.g., vehicles registered 
during the month of June 1978 will have affixed a validation sticker 
with the numbers ``6-81'', indicating expiration of the decal at the end 
of June 1981. The specifications for the validation sticker will be 
determined locally.
    (4) Decals or other media used to identify vehicles of temporary 
registrants or visitors will be locally prescribed.
    (5) Decals will be removed from POV's by the registrant when 
activity registration is terminated. See DLAR 5720.1, chapter 3, for 
information on termination of registration.
    (6) Vehicle decals will be purchased with appropriated funds for 
issuance at no cost to authorized users.
    (b) Proof of insurance. (1) Individuals registering vehicles will

located in areas not requiring such inspections.
    (d) Registrant. Registrant must inform the vehicle registration 
office within 72 hours as information on DLA form 1454 becomes invalid.


<R05>
Sec. 1288.6  Forms and reports.

    (a) DLA form 1454 will be prepared at the time of initial 
registration of the vehicle and will remain valid for as long as the 
registrant retains ownership of the vehicle and complies with 
registration requirements. A Privacy Act statement for use in 
conjunction with DLA form 1454 will be made available to the individual 
supplying data on the form.
    (b) Data blocks 3, 4, and 14 on DLA form 1454 will be entered in 
ink; remaining entries will be in pencil.
    (c) One copy of DLA form 1454 will also serve as the driver record 
of the registrant.
    (d) Upon permanent change of station of the military service 
registrant, activity clearance procedures will provide for DLA form 1454 
to be included in the registrant's military personnel folder for 
transmittal to the gaining activity. DLA forms 1454 for transferring 
civilian personnel will be forwarded to the security officer of the 
gaining activity.
    (e) The DLA form 1454 for military personnel being discharged or 
separated will be forwarded to the appropriate personnel office for 
inclusion in the records folder for subsequent retirement.

              Appendix A to Part 1288--Decal Specifications

<R05>
Sec. 1290.2  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This part 1290 implements DoD Instruction 6055.4, Department of 
Defense Traffic Safety Program, and sets forth basic objectives and 
procedures applicable to implementation of the Federal Magistrate System 
by DLA. This part 1290 is applicable to HQ DLA, Defense Supply Centers 
(DSC's), less Defense Fuel Supply Center and Defense Industrial Supply 
Center, and to Defense Depots, less Defense Depot Mechanicsburg. DLA 
activities/personnel tenant on other DoD activities will abide by the 
requirements of the host.
    (b) This part 1290 provides Heads of DLA primary level field 
activities (PLFAs) with a means of exercising effective control over 
violators who are not otherwise under their jurisdiction.


<R05>
Sec. 1290.3  Policy.

    (a) It is the policy of HQ DLA that the Heads of DLA PLFAs will take 
such steps as are necessary to prevent offenses. Emphasis will be placed 
on prevention rather than apprehension and prosecution of offenders.
    (b) The procedures outlined in this part 1290 may, at the discretion 
of the Head of the activity concerned, be invoked in lieu of the 
provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) to deal with 
minor offenses of a civil nature, other than violations of state traffic 
laws, committed by military personnel. These procedures may also be 
invoked to deal with nontraffic minor offenses committed by civilian 
personnel.


<R05>
Sec. 1290.4  Definitions.

    For the purpose of this part 1290 the following definitions apply:

This part 1290 supersedes part 1290 April 26, 1972.

    (a) Law Enforcement Personnel. Persons authorized by the Head of the 
PLFA to direct, regulate, control traffic; to make apprehensions or 
arrests for violations of traffic regulations; or to issue citations or 
tickets. Personnel so designated will include the Command Security 
Officer and all other personnel in 080, 083, 085, or 1800 series 
positions.
    (b) Minor Federal Offenses. Those offenses for which the authorized 
penalty does not exceed imprisonment for a period of 1 year, or a fine 
of not more than $1000, or both (18 U.S.C. 3401f).
    (c) Petty Federal Offenses. Those offenses for which the authorized 
penalty does not exceed imprisonment for a period of 6 months or a fine 
of not more than $500, or both (18 U.S.C. 1(3)).

    Note: A petty offense is a type of minor offense.

    (d) Violation Notice. DD Form 1805, Violation Notice, which will be 
used to refer all petty offenses to the U.S. Magistrate/District Courts 
for disposition.

    Note: A complaint, made under oath on forms provided by the 
magistrate, is the prescribed form for charging minor offenses other 
than petty offenses.


<R05>
Sec. 1290.5  Background.

    (a) DoD Instruction 6055.4 requires that all traffic violations 
occurring on DoD installations be referred to the appropriate United 
States Magistrate, or State or local system magistrate, in the interest 
of impartial judicial determination and effective law enforcement. 
Exceptions will be made only for those rare violations in which military 
discipline is the paramount consideration, or where the Federal court 
system having jurisdiction has notified the PLFA commander it will not 
accept certain offenses for disposition.

[[Page 294]]

    (b) Generally, the Federal Magistrate System applies state traffic 
laws and appropriate Federal laws to all personnel while on Federal 
property (section 13, title 18 U.S.C., Assimilative Crimes Act).


<R05>
Sec. 1290.6  Significant changes.

    This revision incorporates the DoD requirement for referral of 
traffic violations occurring on military installations to the Federal or 
local magistrate.


<R05>
Sec. 1290.7  Responsibilities.

    (a) HQ DLA.
    (1) The Command Security Officer, DLA (DLA-T) will:
    (i) Exercise staff supervision over the Magistrate system within 
DLA.
    (ii) Provide guidance and assistance to DLA activities concerning 
administrative and procedural aspects of this part 1290.
    (2) The Counsel, DLA (DLA-G) will provide guidance and assistance to

    (b) The Heads of DLA Primary Level Field Activities will:
    (1) Develop and put into effect the necessary regulatory and 
supervisory procedures to implement this part 1290.
    (2) Ensure implementing directives authorize law enforcement/
security force (080, 083, 085 and 1800 series) personnel to issue DD 
Form 1805.
    (3) Periodically publish in the PLFA Daily or Weekly Bulletin, a 
listing of offenses for which mail-in procedures apply, with the amount 
of the fine for each, and a listing of offenses requiring mandatory 
appearance of the violator before the U.S. Magistrate. The listings will 
indicate that they are not necessarily all inclusive and that they are 
subject to change. A copy of the listings will be provided to the local 
Union representatives.


<R05>
Sec. 1290.8  Procedures.

    (a) The U.S. Magistrate Court Provides DLA with:
    (1) The means to process and dispose of certain categories of minor 
offenses by mail. Under this system, U.S. Magistrate and District Courts 
will, by local court rule, preset fines for the bulk of petty violations 
(Federal or Assimilated) and permit persons charged with such 
violations, who do not contest the charge nor wish to have a court 
hearing, to pay their fines by using mail-in, preaddressed, postage paid 
envelopes furnished to them with the violation notice.
    (2) Efficient, minimal commitment of judicial and clerical time by 
using uniform procedures which centralize the collection of fines, the 
scheduling of mandatory hearings or hearings where violators request 
them, and the keeping of violator records.
    (3) A simple but sure method of accounting for fines collected and 
tickets issued.
    (4) Impartial enforcement of minor offense laws.
    (b) Court Appearances--(1) Mandatory Appearances. (i) As required by 
the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, each District 
Court will determine, by local court rule, those offenses requiring 
mandatory appearance of violators. PLFA Counsels will coordinate with 
local magistrates or district courts and secure a court approved list of 
offenses requiring mandatory appearance of violators before the local 
U.S. Magistrate.
    (ii) Mandatory appearance offense categories normally include:
    (A) Indictable offenses.
    (B) Offenses resulting in accidents.
    (C) Operation of motor vehicle while under the influence of 
intoxicating alcohol or a narcotic or habit producing or other mind 
altering drug, or permitting another person who is under the influence 
of intoxicating alcohol, or a narcotic or habit producing or mind 
altering drug to operate a motor vehicle owned by the defendant or in 
his/her custody or control.
    (D) Reckless driving or speeding.
    (2) Voluntary Appearances--(i) Requested by violators at the time DD 
Form 1805 is issued. (A) Personnel issuing DD Form 1805 will refer 
violator for hearings before U.S. Magistrates in each instance where a 
hearing is requested by the violator.
    (B) Command security officers will provide security force personnel 
with necessary information to facilitate scheduling violators to appear 
before U.S. Magistrates. Box B of the DD

[[Page 295]]

Form 1805 will be marked by the issuing official for each violator 
requesting a hearing. Additionally procedures set forth in appendix A 
will be accomplished by the official issuing violation notice.
    (ii) Requested by violators by mail. (A) Voluntary appearance 
procedures are also available for violators who are not present at the 
time a DD Form 1805 is issued (i.e., parking violations) or who 
subsequently decide to voluntarily appear before a U.S. Magistrate 
rather than pay the fine indicated in the DD Form 1805.
    (B) Violators who use the mail-in procedure to voluntarily appear 
before a U.S. Magistrate must follow the instructions in Box B of the DD 
Form 1805 (violator copy). The violator will be notified by the clerk of 
the District Court of the time and place to appear for the scheduled 
hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 1290.9  Forms and reports.

    (a) General information on preparation and issue of DD Form 1805:
    (1) The U.S. Magistrate system is based on use of a four-ply ticket 
designed to provide legal notice to violators and records required by 
the court, law enforcement authorities, and, if appropriate, the state 
motor vehicle departments. The DD Form 1805 is printed on chemically 
carbonized paper and prenumbered in series for accounting control. Heads 
of DLA primary level field activities are responsible for maintaining 
accountability for each ticket issued and stocks on hand.
    (2) DLA field activity Counsels will coordinate with the U.S. 
Magistrate of the judicial district in which the activity is located and 
maintain the information listed below:
    (i) List of petty offenses for which mail-in procedure is authorized 
and the amount of the fine for each specific offense. The District Court 
address will be prestamped on the violator's copy of the DD Form 1805 by 
the applicable issuing authority.
    (ii) List of minor offenses requiring mandatory appearance of the 
violator before the magistrate. The name and location of the magistrate 
before whom violators will appear. Schedule will be coordinated with 
nearest Military Service activity and appearance will be conducted 
jointly whenever possible.
    (b) Issue procedures for DD Form 1805:
    (1) Information entered on the DD Form 1805 is dependent upon two 
considerations:
    (i) The type of violation, i.e., parking, (such as blocking a fire 
lane) moving traffic violation, or nontraffic offenses.
    (ii) Whether the offense cited requires the mandatory appearance of 
the violator before a U.S. Magistrate.
    (2) Preparation and disposition of DD Form 1805:
    (i) See illustration in appendix B for petty offenses where the 
mail-in fine procedures are authorized.
    (A) The amount of the fine for a specific offense must be recorded 
in the lower right corner of the DD Form 1805. This amount will always 
be predetermined by the U.S. Magistrate and provided to on duty 
enforcement personnel by the activity security officer or equivalent 
authority. When violation notices are issued for an offense (e.g., 
parking violation) and the offender is absent, all entries concerning 
the violator will be left blank.
    (B) Disposition of DD Form 1805 will be as follows:
    (1) The fourth copy (envelope) will be issued to the violator or 
placed on the vehicle of the violator.
    (2) Copies one (white copy), two (yellow copy), and three (pink 
copy) will be returned to the Security Officer's office. The Security 
Officer will forward copies one and two, by letter of transmittal, to 
the appropriate U.S. District Court.
    (3) Copy three will be filed at the Security Office or equivalent 
issuing authority. DLA Form 1454, Vehicle Registration/Driver Record, 
will be annotated with each traffic offense.
    (ii) When DD Form 1805 is used to cite personnel for mail-in type 
violations, the appropriate supervisor will be provided an information 
copy of DLA Form 635, Security/Criminal Incident Report, denoting the 
date, time, place, and type of violation, and the amount of fine 
assessed.
    (iii) Heads of DLA primary level field activities or their 
representative will not accept or otherwise collect any

[[Page 296]]

fines or keep records of fines paid or not paid. They also will take no 
action concerning nonpayment delinquencies except where warrants are 
subsequently issued for the violator concerned by the appropriate court 
authorities.
    (iv) See illustrations in appendices C and D for minor offenses 
requiring the mandatory appearance of violators before the U.S. 
Magistrate:
    (A) Mail-in fine procedures will not apply in mandatory appearance 
cases. The law enforcement authority issuing a violation notice for an 
offense requiring mandatory appearance of the violator, will place a 
check mark in ``Box A'', DD Form 1805. The name and location of the U.S. 
Magistrate before whom the violator must appear will be inserted on the 
line below ``United States District Court'' as shown in appendix C. The 
date and time of the initial appearance will be entered in the space 
provided in ``Box A''. It is the violator's responsibility to verify the 
date, time, and place of required court appearances.
    (B) Disposition of DD Form 1805 will be as follows:
    (1) The fourth copy (envelope) will be issued to the violator.
    (2) Copies one (white copy), two (yellow copy), and three (pink 
copy) will be returned to the Security Officer's office. The Security 
Officer will forward copies one and two, by transmittal as soon as 
possible, to the magistrate before whom the violator is scheduled to 
appear.
    (3) Copy three will be filed in the office of the Security Officer 
or equivalent issuing authority.
    (C) When DD Form 1805 is used to cite personnel for mandatory 
appearance type offenses, the individual's supervisor will be provided 
an information copy of DLA Form 635, denoting the date, time, place, and 
type of violation, and the date the violator is scheduled to appear 
before the U.S. Magistrate.
    (v) Additional information governing preparation of DD Form 1805 is 
provided as appendix A.

                         Appendices to Part 1290

    Appendix A--Preparation Guide for DD Form 1805, Violation Notice

reservation, post, camp, station, installation, base, or Government-
owned or leased facility administered by another command or agency are 
responsible for protection of property and places under their command 
and may issue security regulations and orders in fulfillment of their 
responsibility to protect property and places under their jurisdiction 
and administration. However, separate security regulations and orders 
should not be issued when the host has issued security regulations and 
orders that afford protection to the DLA activity.
    (d) Detailed physical security and emergency plans developed in 
conjunction with these security regulations and orders will be as 
prescribed by DLAM 5710.1, Physical Security Manual, and DLA War and 
Emergency Support Plan (WESP), part II, Annex A.


<R05>
Sec. 1292.3  Background.

<R05>
Sec. 1293.2  Purpose and scope.

    (a) Part 1293 prescribes standards of conduct required of all DLA 
personnel, military and civilian, regardless of grade or assignment. It 
also establishes criteria and procedures for reports required of certain 
individuals who have left Federal service and of former employees of 
defense contractors presently employed by DLA.
    (b) Close adherence to the standards of conduct will ensure 
compliance with the high ethical standards demanded of all public 
employees. Violations of the standards prescribed in this regulation, or 
by Federal laws, including the laws described in enclosure 1, may result 
in criminal and/or administrative sanctions. Accordingly, all DLA 
personnel should become familiar with these standards.
    (c) The reporting procedures for defense related employment are 
applicable to former military officers and civilian employees of DLA and 
to former employees of defense contractors presently employed by DLA.
    (d) All retired regular officers are also required to file a 
statement of employment with the Military Department in which they hold 
a retired status.
    (e) This DLAR is applicable to HQ DLA and all DLA field activities 
and implements DoD Directive 5500.7, Standards of Conduct.


<R05>
Sec. 1293.3  Policy.

    (a) General requirements. (1) Government employment is a public 
trust which requires that loyalty to country, ethical principles, and 
the law be placed above private gain and other interests. All DLA 
personnel must conduct themselves, both on and off the job, in such a 
manner as to avoid the existence or appearance of a conflict of interest 
between their official responsibilities and their personal affairs.
    (2) DLA personnel shall become familiar with the scope of, authority 
for, and limitations on the activities for which they are responsible. 
DLA personnel also shall acquire a general knowledge of the statutory 
standards of conduct prohibitions and restrictions. The most commonly 
encountered of these provisions are summarized in appendix A, and are 
laws dealing generally with conflicts of interest and postemployment 
activities.
    (3) If DLA personnel are unsure whether a proposed action or 
decision is proper because it may be contrary to law or regulation, they 
shall consult the Designated Agency Ethics Official, or Deputy Ethics 
Official, for guidance. The individuals are identified in Sec. 1293.4.
    (4) DLA personnel shall not take or recommend any action or make or 
recommend any expenditure of funds known or believed to be in violation 
of Federal laws, Executive Orders, or applicable directives, 
instructions, or regulations.
    (5) Practices that may be accepted in the private business world may 
not be acceptable for DLA personnel. As public employees, all DLA 
personnel are accountable for the manner in which they perform their 
official responsibilities.
    (6) DLA personnel shall strictly adhere to the DLA program of equal 
opportunity regardless of race, color, religion, sex, age, national 
origin, or handicap.
    (7) DLA personnel shall avoid any action, whether or not 
specifically prohibited by part 1293, which might result in or 
reasonably be expected to create the appearance of:
    (i) Using public office for private gain.
    (ii) Giving preferential treatment to any person or entity.
    (iii) Impeding Government efficiency or economy.
    (iv) Losing complete independence or impartiality.
    (v) Making a Government decision outside official channels.

[[Page 303]]

    (vi) Affecting adversely the confidence of the public in the 
integrity of the Government.
    (b) Information to personnel. (1) All new civilian employees and 
military personnel newly assigned to DLA will be provided a copy of part 
1293 upon their entrance to duty.
    (2) DLA personnel shall be reminded at least semiannually of their 
duty to comply with the required standards of conduct. Appropriate means 
of accomplishing these reminders include notices, circulation of part 
1293 to employees, briefings, or any other means which serve to remind 
employees of their ethical responsibilities.
    (3) Copies of the Code of Ethics for Government Service (appendix B) 
shall be displayed in appropriate areas of DLA occupied buildings in 
which 20 or more persons are regularly employed. (Code of Ethics posters 
are self-service supply items and may be obtained under NSN 7690-01-099-
8167.)
    (4) All DLA employees (military and civilian) who leave Federal 
service shall be informed of the restrictions on the postemployment 
activities of former Federal employees.
    (c) Conflicts of interest--(1) Affiliations and Outside 
Associations. (i) DLA personnel shall not engage in any personal, 
business, or professional activity which conflicts with the interests of 
the Government they serve through the duties and responsibilities of 
their DLA positions. This prohibition applies to all DLA employees, 
regardless of whether they are required to file a financial disclosure 
report. In the event a conflict, or potential conflict of interest 
arises, it shall be promptly reported and resolved in accordance with 
Sec. 1293.7(b).
    (ii) Membership or activity of DLA personnel in non-Governmental 
associations or organizations must not be incompatible with their 
official Government positions (see DLAR 5500.4).\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Copies may be obtained, if needed, from Defense Logistics 
Agency, ATTN: DLA-XPD, Cameron Station, Alexandria, VA 22304-6100.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (iii) DLA personnel shall not knowingly deal, on behalf of the 
Government, with present or former Government personnel, military or 
civilian, whose participation in the transaction would be in violation 
of a statute, regulation, or policy set forth in part 1293.
    (2) Financial interests. DLA personnel shall not receive or retain 
any direct or indirect financial interest which conflicts with the 
interests of the Government they serve through the duties and 
responsibilities of their DLA positions. Matters concerning outside 
employment by DLA personnel are discussed in paragraph (i) of this 
section. For the purpose of this prohibition, the financial interests of 
a spouse, minor child, or any household member are treated as the 
financial interests of the DLA employee. Thus, not only stocks and other 
similar holdings, but also the wages, salaries, dividends, or any other 
income of a spouse, minor child, or household member are considered 
financial interests of the DLA employee. Particular care must be given 
in situations involving former DoD contractor employees as they may be 
entitled to benefits from their former employer (such as pensions, 
company discounts or concessions, etc.) which could create a criminal 
conflict of interest situation under 18 U.S.C. 208 if DLA assigns the 
employee duties and responsibilities involving the former employer. (For 
reporting requirements unique to former DoD contractor employees see 
Sec. 1293.7(e). These prohibitions apply to all DLA employees, 
regardless of whether they are required to file a financial disclosure 
report. In the event a conflict or potential conflict of interest 
arises, it shall be promptly reported and resolved in accordance with 
Sec. 1293.7(b).
    (3) Avoiding Actual or the Appearance of Conflicts of Interest. 
Direct or indirect financial interests in a defense related contractor, 
in any amount and in any form (stocks, bonds, options, employment of 
spouse, minor child, or any other household member) may be a prohibited 
conflict or appearance of a conflict of interest. Outside employment or 
other outside activity, with or without compensation, regarding possible 
future employment may also create a conflict or the appearance of a 
conflict of interest. Discussions with a defense contractor regarding 
possible future employment may require reporting and disqualification 
under the procedures set forth in paragraph (k) of

[[Page 304]]

this section. In these situations, DLA personnel are encouraged to seek 
advice from the Designated Agency Ethics Official or Deputy Ethics 
Official to protect not only themselves, but also be avoid embarrassment 
to DLA.
    (4) Assignment of Reserves for training. DLA personnel who assign 
Reserves for training shall not assign them to duties in which they will 
obtain information that could be used by them or their private sector 
employers to gain unfair advantage over civilian competitors. Prior to 
entering active duty, reservists must disclose to superiors or 
assignment personnel, sufficient information to ensure that no conflict 
exists between their duty assignments and their private interests.
    (d) Use of DLA Position, Property, Resources, and Information--(1) 
Using DLA position. DLA personnel are prohibited from using their DLA 
position to induce, coerce, or in any manner influence any person to 
provide any benefit, financial or otherwise, to themselves or others.
    (2) Use of Civilian and Military Titles or Positions in Connection 
with Commercial Enterprises. (i) All DLA personnel are prohibited from 
using their official titles or positions in connection with the 
promotion of any commercial enterprise or endorsement of any commercial 
product. This does not preclude author identification for materials 
published in accordance with DLAR 5400.13.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ See footnote 1, to Sec. 1293.3(c)(1)(ii).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) Retired military personnel, and members of Reserve components 
not on active duty, may use their military titles in connection with 
commercial enterprises provided that they indicate their Retired or 
Reserve status. However, if the use of military titles in any way casts 
discredit on the Military Departments or DoD, or gives the appearance of 
sponsorship, sanction, endorsement, or approval by a Military Department 
or DoD, it is prohibited. In addition, a Military Department may further 
restrict the use of titles, including use by retired military personnel 
and members of reserve components not on active duty, in overseas areas.
    (3) Use of Government property and resources. (i) DLA personnel have 
a positive duty to protect and conserve Government property and 
resources and assure that they are used only for official Government 
business. DLA personnel shall not directly or indirectly use, take, 
dispose of, or allow the use, taking, or disposing of, Government 
property including property leased to the Government, for other than 
official purposes. Government facilities, property, and resources (such 
as telephones, stationery, stenographic and typing assistance, 
duplicating and computer equipment) shall be used only for official 
Government business.
    (ii) These provisions do not preclude the use of Government 
facilities for approved activities in furtherance of DLA community 
relations, provided they do not interfere with military missions or 
Government business. Government equipment and clerical support may be 
authorized for the preparation of papers to be presented to professional 
associations if appropriate to the mission of the office and approved, 
in advance, by the Head of the HQ PSE or PLFA.
    (iii) All DLA personnel are responsible for using office 
telecommunication services (telephone, message, data, video, facsimile 
services, etc.) for official use only. The term official use means 
service directly in support of Government business or as otherwise 
approved by the Head of the PSE or PLFA, or their designee, as being in 
the best interest of the Government.
    (A) DLA office telecommunications services are resources provided to 
conduct business directly in support of the Government.
    (B) DLA shall pay only for the official uses of DLA 
telecommunications services.
    (C) Where available and practicable, steps shall be taken to ensure 
user accountability (i.e., call verification, call restriction, other 
telecommunications service features).
    (D) Employees who make unofficial use of DLA office 
telecommunications services are subject to appropriate disciplinary 
action.
    (4) Using inside information. DLA personnel shall not directly or 
indirectly use information obtained as a result of their DLA position to 
further a private

[[Page 305]]

gain for themselves or others if that information is not generally 
available to the public. This prohibition continues even after a DLA 
employee leaves Federal service.
    (5) Release of acquisition information. All releases of acquisition 
information shall be in accordance with authorized procedures. DLA 
personnel are prohibited from making an unauthorized disclosure of any 
information concerning proposed acquisitions or purchases by DLA, or the 
identity of any contractor, unless the contractor's identity has been 
made public under established procedures.
    (6) Unauthorized statements or commitments with respect to award of 
contracts. Only contracting officers and their duly authorized 
representatives acting within their authority are authorized to commit 
the Government to the award of contracts. Unauthorized DLA personnel are 
prohibited from making any commitment or promise relating to the award 
of a contract or from making any representation that reasonably can be 
construed as such a commitment.
    (e) Commercial and charitable solicitations--(1) Commercial 
Soliciting by DLA Personnel. To eliminate the appearance of coercion, 
intimidation, or pressure from rank, grade, or position, full-time DLA 
personnel are prohibited from making personal commercial solicitations 
or sales to DLA personnel (including their family members) who are 
junior in rank or grade, or who are under any level of supervision by 
them, at any time, on or off duty.
    (i) This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, the 
solicitation and sale of insurance, stocks, mutual funds, real estate, 
and any other commodities, goods, or services.
    (ii) This prohibition does not include the sale or lease by 
individuals of their own personal property or privately-owned residence 
or to the off-duty employment of DLA personnel as employees in retail 
stores or other situations not involving solicited sales.
    (2) Charitable solicitations by DLA personnel. The high visibility 
of DLA officials generates requests from charitable and nonprofit 
organizations to use an official's name and title in conjunction with 
fund-raising activities. The use of names and titles of DLA officials, 
even regarding fund-raising activities of charitable organizations, may 
give an improper impression that the Department of Defense or Defense 
Logistics Agency endorses the activities of a particular organization, 
thereby resulting in unauthorized assistance for the organization or 
sponsors of the activities. The presence of DLA officials may be sought, 
under the guise of bestowing awards upon the official, to promote 
attendance at programs. DLA officials shall not allow the use of their 
names or titles in connection with charitable or nonprofit 
organizations, subject to the following:
    (i) DLA personnel may assist only those charitable programs 
administered by the Office of Personnel Management under its delegation 
from the President and those other programs authorized by DLAR 5035.1.
    (ii) This prohibition does not preclude speeches before such 
organizations by DLA officials if the speech is designed to express an 
official position in a public forum.
    (iii) This prohibition does not preclude volunteer efforts on behalf 
of charitable or nonprofit organizations by individuals who do not use 
their official titles in relation to solicitations and who do not 
solicit from individuals or entities with whom they do business in their 
official capacity.
    (f) Other prohibitions--(1) Gambling, betting, and lotteries. While 
on Government-owned, leased, or controlled property, or otherwise while 
on duty for the Government, DLA personnel shall not participate in any 
gambling activity, including a lottery or pool, a game for money or 
property, and the sale or purchase of a number slip or ticket. The only 
exceptions are:
    (i) Where authorized by law, such as vending stands licensed in 
accordance with 20 U.S.C. 107a(a)(5) to sell chances for any lottery 
authorized by state law and conducted by an agency of a state.
    (ii) Activities which have been specifically approved by the 
Director, DLA.
    (2) Indebtedness. DLA personnel shall pay their just financial 
obligations in a timely manner, particularly those imposed by law, such 
as Federal, state, and local taxes. DLA activities are not

[[Page 306]]

required to determine the validity or amount of disputed debts.
    (g) Gratuities, reimbursements, and other benefits from outside 
sources--(1) Policy. No matter how innocently tendered and received, the 
acceptance of gratuities, reimbursements, or other benefits by DLA 
personnel (including their spouse, minor child, or any household member) 
from those who have or seek business with the Department of Defense or 
from those whose business interests are affected by Department of 
Defense functions, may be a source of embarrassment to the Department of 
Defense, may affect the objective judgment of the DLA personnel 
involved, and may impair public confidence in the integrity of the 
Government.
    (2) Bribery and graft. DLA personnel may be subject to criminal 
penalties if they solicit, accept, or agree to accept anything of value 
in return for performing or refraining from performing an official act.
    (3) General prohibition. Except in the limited circumstances set 
forth in appendix C, DLA personnel (including their spouse, minor child, 
or any household member) shall not solicit, accept, or agree to accept 
any gratuity, reimbursement, or other benefit for themselves, or others, 
either directly or indirectly from or on behalf of any source that:
    (i) Is engaged in or seeks business or financial relations of any 
sort with any DoD Component.
    (ii) Conducts operations or activities that are either regulated by 
a DoD Component or substantially affected by DoD decisions.
    (iii) Has interests that may be substantially affected by the 
performance or nonperformance of the official duties of DLA personnel.
    (iv) Is a foreign government or representative of a foreign 
government that is engaged in selling to the DoD, where the gratuity is 
tendered in the context of the foreign government's commercial 
activities. (See also paragraph (h)(1) of this section.)
    (4) Employees who receive gratuities which may not be accepted under 
the limited circumstances set forth in appendix C shall promptly report 
the matter to the Designated Agency Ethics Official or Deputy Ethics 
Official.
    (h) Gifts and donations. (1) Procedures with respect to gifts from 
foreign governments are set forth in DLAR 1005.1.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See footnote 1, to Sec. 1293.3(c)(1)(ii).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Prohibition of Contributions or Presents to Superiors. DLA 
personnel shall not solicit a contribution from other DLA personnel for 
a gift to a superior, make a donation as a gift to a superior, give a 
gift to a superior, or accept a gift from other DLA personnel 
subordinate to themselves. This prohibition also applies to gifts, 
contributions, or donations to immediate family members of a superior. 
However, this paragraph does not prohibit voluntary gifts of reasonable 
value or contributions of nominal amounts (or the acceptance thereof) on 
special occasions such as marriage, illness, transfer, or retirement, 
provided that any gifts acquired with such contributions will be 
reasonable in value in view of the occasion.
    (i) Outside employment of DLA personnel. (1) DLA personnel shall not 
engage in outside employment or other outside activity, with or without 
compensation, that:
    (i) Interferes with, or is not compatible with, the performance of 
their Government duties.
    (ii) May reasonably be expected to bring discredit on the 
Government.
    (iii) Is otherwise inconsistent with the requirements of part 1293, 
including the requirements to avoid actions and situations which 
reasonably can be expected to create the appearance of conflicts of 
interests.
    (2) Enlisted military personnel on active duty may not be ordered or 
authorized to leave their post to engage in a civilian pursuit, 
business, or professional activity if it interferes with the customary 
or regular employment of local civilians in their art, trade, or 
profession.
    (3) Off-duty employment of military personnel by an entity involved 
in a strike is permissible if the person was on the payroll of the 
entity prior to the commencement of the strike, and if the employment is 
otherwise in conformance with the provisions of part 1293.

[[Page 307]]

After a strike begins and while it continues, no military personnel may 
accept employment by that involved entity at the strike location.
    (4) DLA personnel are encouraged to engage in teaching, lecturing, 
and writing. However:
    (i) DLA personnel shall not, either for or without compensation, 
engage in activities that are dependent on information obtained as a 
result of their Government employment, except when: The information has 
been published or is generally available to the public; or it will be 
made generally available to the public, and the Director, DLA gives 
written authorization for the use of nonpublic information on the basis 
that the use is in the public interest.
    (ii) Employment by a DoD contractor is prohibited unless the 
circumstances are presented to and approval is obtained from the 
Designated Agency Ethics Official or Deputy Ethics Official stating that 
such employment does not constitute either a conflict or the appearance 
of a conflict of interest between the employee's duties and the outside 
employment.
    (j) Honoraria. DLA personnel may not accept honoraria for official 
activities, nor may they suggest charitable contributions in place of 
honoraria. Even when acting in a personal, rather than official, 
capacity:
    (1) DLA personnel are prohibited from accepting an honorarium of 
more than $2,000 (excluding travel and subsistence expenses, agent's 
fees or commissions) for any appearance, speech, or article;
    (2) The acceptance of honoraria from groups doing, or seeking to do 
business with DLA, presents the potential for a conflict of interest or 
the appearance of a conflict. Before accepting any honorarium, DLA 
personnel shall consult the Designated Agency Ethics Official, or Deputy 
Ethics Official.
    (k) Pursuit of outside employment. (1) When a military officer 
assigned to DLA or a civilian DLA employee leaves Federal service and 
begins working for a business with which the officer or employee 
conducted official business, or one which might have been affected by 
the officer or employee's performance of official duties, the public may 
perceive that the public's interest has been compromised. There is the 
concern that the former officer or employee may have been more 
interested in future employment than the diligent performance of 
official duties and protecting the Government's interests. Officers and 
employees must be sensitive to this public perception when considering 
future employment opportunities and avoid any action which would cause 
loss of public confidence in their performance of official duties.
    (2) DLA personnel shall not perform any official duties, or 
otherwise participate in any official matter dealing with any 
organization with which the DLA employee is pursuing employment, has any 
arrangement concerning future employment, or has a financial interest. 
Pursuing employment is not limited to firm offers of employment; it 
includes any action which could reasonably be construed as an indication 
of interest in future employment, including sending letters or resumes, 
telephone discussions, or the consideration of unsolicited proposals 
from a business entity regarding possible future employment.
    (3) All DLA personnel who have contact (regardless of who initiated 
the contact) regarding possible future employment, or have any 
arrangement concerning future employment with any organization that may 
be affected by the performance of their official duties shall 
immediately report the contact to the Designated Agency Ethics Official 
or Deputy Ethics Official. So long as the decision on future employment 
with the organization remains open, DLA personnel must disqualify 
themselves from participating in any manner in any official action 
involving that organization. Thus, if a DLA employee mails resumes to 
multiple organizations, that may be affected by the performance of 
official duties, the DLA employee must report the sending of resumes, 
disqualify himself/herself from participating in matters involving those 
organizations until either the organization or the employee specifically 
terminates the employment possibilities. Disqualification procedures are 
set forth in Sec. 1293.7(c).
    (l) Restrictions on the activities of former officers and employees. 
Laws and regulations impose restrictions on the

[[Page 308]]

activities of individuals who have ceased Federal employment. Violation 
of some of the laws and regulations may result in criminal prosecution. 
It is the obligation of each military officer assigned to DLA and each 
civilian employee, upon ending Federal service, to review the post 
employment restrictions in making decisions regarding their post 
employment activities. Appendix A contains a summary of the laws and 
regulations which deal with the conduct of DLA officers and employees 
and the restrictions on the activities of former officers and employees.

Sec. 1293.5  Significant changes.

    Part 1293 has been revised to incorporate changes necessitated by a 
new DoD Standards of Conduct Regulation and new statutory reporting and 
postemployment restrictions. The most significant changes relate to the 
limited circumstances under which DLA personnel can accept gratuities 
from DoD contractors and in prescribing which employees are required to 
file DD Forms 1555, Confidential Statement

[[Page 309]]

of Affiliations and Financial Interests. Finally, the provisions of law 
which require reports of cetain former DLA employees who have left 
Federal service and are working for certain DoD contractors, as well as 
certain former DoD contractor employees currently working for DLA, have 
been incorporated in part 1293 rather than in a separate part, DLAR 
7700.3, Reporting Procedures on Defense Related Employment.\4\

<R05>
Sec. 1293.7  Procedures.

    (a) Reporting suspected violations. DLA personnel who have 
information which causes them to believe that a violation of the 
policies, procedures, or standards set forth in part 1293 or of the 
statutes listed in appendix A is foreseeable or has occurred shall 
report the matter promptly to the General Counsel, DLA or PLFA Counsel 
who shall:
    (1) Evaluate the report and obtain such additional information as 
may be necessary.
    (2) Refer the matter for investigation or other action as 
appropriate, or advise the reporter that no further action will be 
taken.
    (3) Forward a report of the matter and any action taken to the 
General Counsel, DLA within 30 days.
    (b) Resolving violations. The resolution of real, apparent, or 
potential standards of conduct violations shall be accomplished promptly 
by one or more measures, such as divestiture of conflicting interests, 
disqualification for particular assignments, changes in assigned duties, 
transfer, reassignment, suspension, termination, or other appropriate 
action, as provided by statute or administrative procedures (see 
appendix G).
    (c) Disqualification or Divestiture Procedures--(1) Affiliations and 
Financial Interests. (i) Any DLA employee who has affiliations or 
financial interests (which includes those of their spouse, minor 
children, or members of their households) which create conflicts of 
interest or the appearance of conflict of interest with their official 
duties, must immediately disqualify themselves from any official 
activities that are related to those affiliations or interests of the 
entities involved. If the individual cannot adequately perform assigned 
official duties after such disqualification, divestiture will be 
required or the individual must be moved from that position. The 
requirement to remedy the conflict or the appearance of a conflict 
exists independently of the requirement to file a financial disclosure 
report.
    (ii) Exceptions. (A) DLA personnel need not disqualify themselves 
for holding shares of a widely-held, diversified mutual fund or 
regulated investment company. Such holdings are exempt as being too 
remote or inconsequential to affect the integrity of the services of DLA 
personnel.
    (B) In limited circumstances, the General Counsel, DLA may exempt, 
under 18 U.S.C. 208(b), certain affiliations and financial interests if 
they are deemed not substantial enough to affect the integrity of 
Government services. Written requests for such exemptions will be 
processed through the appropriate Deputy Ethics Official.

[[Page 312]]

    (2) Written notice of disqualification must be promptly delivered to 
the employee's immediate supervisor, immediate subordinates, and to the 
Designated Agency Ethics Official or Deputy Agency Ethics Official.

                Appendix A--Laws Affecting DLA Personnel

                               I. Caution

    Employees and former employees are cautioned that the descriptions 
of the laws and regulations in this enclosure should not be the only 
thing relied upon to make decisions regarding their activities. Although 
the descriptions do provide general guidelines, restrictions are 
dependent on the specific facts in a particular case. Accordingly, 
employees and former employees are encouraged to discuss specific cases 
with the Designated Agency Ethics Official or Deputy Ethics Official in 
their Office of Counsel, or with private counsel.

                      II. Conflict of Interest Laws

                            A. 18 U.S.C. 203

    1. Subsection (a) prohibits military officers or civilian employees 
from directly or indirectly receiving or seeking compensation for 
services rendered or to be rendered before any department or agency in 
connection with any contract, claim, controversy or particular matter in 
which the United States is a party or has a direct and substantial 
interest. The statute does not apply to enlisted military personnel. The 
purpose of this law is to reach any situation where the judgment or 
efficiency of a Government agency might be influenced because of 
payments or gifts to an officer or employee regardless of whether there 
is any intent to give preferential treatment in a manner otherwise than 
provided by law.
    2. Subsection (b) makes it unlawful for anyone to offer or to pay 
the compensation prohibited by subsection (a).

                            B. 18 U.S.C. 205

    1. This law prohibits military officers or civilian employees from 
acting as an agent or attorney for anyone else before a department, 
agency, or court in connection with

[[Page 314]]

any particular matter in which the United States is a party or has a 
direct and substantial interest. The law does not apply to enlisted 
military personnel.
    2. The following exemptions are allowed:
    a. The law does not prohibit military officers or civilian employees 
from giving testimony under oath; from making statements required to be 
made under the penalty of perjury or contempt; or, from representing 
another person, without compensation, in a personnel matter such as a 
discrimination complaint or disciplinary action.
    b. The law also authorizes a limited waiver of its restrictions and 
those of section 203 for an officer or employee, including a special 
Government employee, who represents his or her parents, spouse, or 
child, or a person or estate he or she serves as a fiduciary. The waiver 
is available only if approved by the official making appointments to the 
position. However, the waiver does not allow the officer or employee to 
represent any person in matters in which the officer or employee has 
participated personally and substantially or which are the subject of 
the officer or employee's official responsibility.
    c. Finally, section 205 gives the head of a department or agency the 
authority to allow a special Government employee to represent his or her 
regular employer or other outside organization in the performance of 
work under a Government grant or contract if the department or agency 
head certifies and publishes in the Federal Register that the national 
interest requires such representation.

                            C. 18 U.S.C. 208

    1. Subsection (a) prohibits military officers and civilian personnel 
from their personal and substantial participation as Government 
personnel in any particular matter in which they, their spouse, their 
minor children, their partners, their employers, their prospective 
employers, or their organizations have a financial interest. ``Personal 
and substantial participation'' includes such things as decision, 
approval, disapproval, recommendation, the rendering of advice, or 
investigation. A ``particular matter'' may be less concrete than an 
actual contract, but is something more specific than rule making or 
abstract scientific principles. If the individual can reasonably 
anticipate that his/her Government action, or the decision in which he/
she participates or with respect to which he/she advises, will have a 
direct and predictable effect upon financial interests, then a 
``particular matter'' is involved.
    2. Subsection (b) permits a written exemption from subsection (a) if 
the outside financial interest is deemed in advance not substantial 
enough to affect the integrity of Government services. Categories of 
financial interests may also be made nondisqualifying by a regulation 
published in the Federal Register. Shares of a widely held, diversified 
mutual fund or regulated investment company have been exempted as being 
too remote or inconsequential to affect the integrity of the services of 
Government personnel.

                            D. 18 U.S.C. 209

    Subsection (a) prohibits military officers and civilian employees 
from receiving, and prohibits anyone from paying them, any money as 
additional compensation for their Government service. The law does not 
apply to enlisted military personnel. Subsection (b) permits military 
officers and civilian employees to participate in a bona fide pension 
plan or other employee welfare or benefit plan maintained by a former 
employer. Subsection (c) exempts special Government employees and anyone 
serving the Government without compensation. Subsection (d) exempts 
contributions, awards, or other expenses under the Government Employees 
Training Act. See 5 U.S.C. 4111(a).

                           E. 10 U.S.C. 2397a

    This law applies to DoD employees at pay rates of GS-11 or higher 
(GS-10, Step 4) and to military officers in pay grades O-4 or higher. 
These employees must report any contact they have had, or will have, 
with defense contractors regarding future employment with the defense 
contractor. These employees must also disqualify themselves from any 
participation in DoD procurements related to the defense contractor. The 
penalty for violation is a bar from employment with the defense 
contractor for up to 10 years after Government service and up to a 
$10,000 penalty.

   III. Restriction on Former Military Officers and Civilian Employees

    A. Former Officers and Employees Include the Following Personnel:
    1. Full-time civilian employees who have left Federal service.
    2. Special Government employees who have left Federal service.
    3. Retired military officers released from active duty.
    4. Reserve military officers released from active duty. The term 
does not include enlisted personnel; however, enlisted personnel are 
subject to the restrictions applicable to retired members of the Armed 
Forces set forth in subparagraph G.
    B. Senior employees are those individuals who have been specifically 
advised by the Designated Agency Ethics Official that they hold senior 
employee positions. In general, senior employees within DLA include 
military officers in pay grades O-7 and above, and most Senior Executive 
Service (SES) positions.
    C. General:

[[Page 315]]

    1. Laws and regulations restrict the activities of former officers 
and employees, establish certain reporting requirements, and, in some 
cases, restrict employment by former officers and employees with DoD 
contractors. Violation of some of the laws and regulations may result in 
criminal prosecution, or civil fines.
    2. The purpose of the post employment restrictions is to preclude 
the actual or apparent use of public office for private gain, and to 
ensure that the administration of Government is conducted honestly and 
in an impartial manner.
    3. The restrictions are divided into five parts; those applicable to 
all former officers and employees, those applicable to former senior 
employees, those applicable to retired military officers, and those 
applicable to all retired members of the Armed Forces. In addition, the 
special restrictions applicable to personnel who were engaged in 
``procurement functions'' are set out. Because of the expansive 
definition of the term ``procurement function,'' all civilian employees 
whose grade was GS-12, step 7 or higher, and all military personnel in 
grades O-4 and above should review the definition of ``procurement 
function'' set forth in subparagraph H6i below.
    4. In addition to the information contained herein, retired military 
personnel are encouraged to review parallel regulations of their 
Military Service:
    a. Army--AR 600-50.
    b. Navy--SECNAVINST 5370.2H.
    c. Air Force--AFR 30-30.
    d. Marine Corps--MCO 5330.3C.
    5. General professional knowledge acquired while in Federal service 
generally may be used while employed in the private sector. Laws and 
regulations do, however, restrict activities of former officers and 
employees which give the appearance of making unfair use of prior 
Federal employment and affiliations, or are detrimental to public 
confidence in the Government. In addition, certain former employees who 
dealt with DoD contractors may be prohibited from working for those 
contractors.
    D. Restrictions Applicable to all Former Officers and Employees:
    1. Permanent bar on representation. (18 U.S.C. 207(a).) Former 
officers and employees (not including former enlisted personnel) may 
never represent anyone except the United States or communicate with any 
Government agency with the intent to influence the United States in any 
matter with which the former officer or employee was personally and 
substantially involved while a Government employee, and which involves 
specific parties where the United States either is a party or has an 
interest.
    a. This provision is aimed at your activities representing anyone, 
whether or not you make a personal appearance before the Government. The 
intent of the provision is to prevent you from ``switching sides,'' so 
that information, influence, and access you acquired during Federal 
service is not subsequently used for improper or unfair advantage in 
post-employment dealings with the Government.
    b. The matters to which this bar applies are those in which you were 
involved as a Federal employee. Your involvement as a Federal employee 
must have been of significance to the matter, or must form the basis for 
a reasonable appearance that it was significant, and may include 
involvement by any of your subordinates.
    c. Matters of general application such as general policy or program 
design are not included in this bar.
    d. The concept of representation is broadly construed and includes 
any type of communication whose intent is to influence the United 
States. Representation includes not only acting as another's attorney or 
agent, but promotional and contract representations as well. 
Communications include both oral and written communications.
    2. Two-year bar on representation. (18 U.S.C. 207(b)(i).) Former 
officers and employees (not including enlisted personnel) may not, for a 
2-year period after departing from Federal service, represent anyone 
except the United States in any matter which was pending under the 
former employee's official responsibility during the final year of 
Federal service. The bar includes communicating with any Government 
agency with intent to influence the United States on the matter.
    a. The only substantive difference between this 2-year bar and the 
permanent bar described in subparagraph 1. above is the degree of your 
closeness to, or involvement in, the matter.
    b. The term ``official responsibility'' refers to the direct 
administrative or operating authority, whether intermediate or final, 
either personally or through subordinates, to approve, disapprove, or 
otherwise direct Government action.
    3. Exception for Scientific or Technological Information. The 
permanent bar and 2-year bar do not apply to communications made solely 
for the purpose of furnishing scientific or technological information if 
approved by the head of the agency to which the communication is 
directed.
    E. Additional Restrictions Applicable to Former Senior Employees:
    1. Two-year bar. (18 U.S.C. 207(b)(ii).) For 2 years after leaving a 
senior employee position, you may not represent or assist in 
representing another person by personally appearing at any proceeding 
before the Government where the matter that is the subject of the 
proceeding, is one in which you participated personally and 
substantially while in Federal service.

[[Page 316]]

    a. The matters to which this bar applies are those in which you were 
involved as a Federal employee. Your involvement as a Federal employee 
must have been of significance to the matter, or must form the basis for 
a reasonable appearance that it was significant, and may include 
involvement by any of your subordinates.
    b. This restriction does not bar all forms of behind-the-scenes 
assistance by you, but only assistance in representing or assisting in 
representing another person while personally present at any type of 
proceeding.
    2. One-year bar. (18 U.S.C. 207(c).) For one year after leaving a 
senior employee position, you may not represent anyone before your 
former agency, or have any communication with your former agency on any 
matter which is pending before or of substantial interest to the agency. 
This restriction, sometimes called the ``no contract'' bar, is intended 
to provide a ``cooling-off'' period between you and your former agency.
    a. This bar applies regardless of the degree of your involvement 
with the matter.
    b. The bar applies to all matters, whether or not specific parties 
are involved, and includes matters of general application such as 
general policy or program design.
    c. The bar also extends to matters in which your agency has a 
substantial interest even though the matter may be pending before 
another agency.
    d. The bar is limited to contracts with your former agency and does 
not apply Government-wide.
    e. Your former agency is specifically defined. As it pertains to 
former DLA senior employees, the term includes DLA and the DoD less:
    (1) The Military Departments.
    (2) Defense Mapping Agency.
    (3) Defense Communications Agency.
    (4) Defense Intelligence Agency.
    (5) Defense Nuclear Agency.
    (6) National Security Agency.
    f. There are several exemptions to this one-year bar. The bar does 
not cover a former senior employee who is: An elected official of a 
state or local government; an employee of an accredited degree-granting 
institution of higher education; or, an employee of a nonprofit hospital 
or medical research organization, provided that the communication, 
appearance, or representation is on behalf of such government, 
institution, hospital, or organization. The bar also does not cover 
purely social or informational communications, the transmission or 
filing of documents not requiring governmental action, personal matters, 
representing oneself in any administrative or judicial proceeding, any 
expression of personal view where the former senior employee has no 
monetary interest, responses to the former agency's request for 
information, or participation as the principal researcher or 
investigator under Government grants.
    F. Additional Restrictions Applicable to Retired Regular Military 
Officers:

           1. Claims against the United States (18 U.S.C. 281)

    a. A retired officer of the Armed Forces may not, for two years 
after release from active duty, act as an agent or attorney for 
prosecuting or assisting in the prosecution of a claim against the 
United States:
    (1) Which involves the Military Department in which the officer is 
retired, or
    (2) Which involves any subject matter with which the officer was 
directly connected while on active duty.
    b. The penalty for violating this restriction includes civil and 
criminal sanctions.

             2. Selling to the United States (18 U.S.C. 281)

    a. A retired officer of the Armed Forces may not, for two years 
after release from active duty, receive (or agree to receive), either 
directly or indirectly, any compensation for representating any person 
in the sale of anything to the United States through the Military 
Department in which the officer is retired.
    b. The penalty for violating this restriction includes civil and 
criminal sanctions.

                       3. Retired Regular Officers

    For 3 years after retirement, a retired Regular officer may not, 
either for himself/herself or for others, sell, contract, or negotiate 
to sell, any supplies or war materials to the DoD (or any of its 
components), Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, or Public Health Service.
    a. This 3-year bar does not prohibit all types of employment by, or 
association with, a company that does business with the Government. The 
bar is directed only to those activities related to selling which 
include:
    (1) Signing a bid, proposal, or contract.
    (2) Negotiating a contract.
    (3) Contracting an officer or employee of any of the agencies listed 
in subparagraph 2.b. above for the purpose of:
    (a) Obtaining or negotiating contracts,
    (b) Negotiating or discussing changes in specifications, price, cost 
allowance, or other terms of a contract, or
    (c) Settling disputes concerning performance of a contract, or
    (4) Any other liaison activity with a view toward the ultimate 
consummation of a sale although the actual contract therefore is 
subsequently negotiated by another person.
    b. Violations of this bar are punishable by loss of retirement pay 
for that period of time during which the prohibited activity occurs.
    G. Additional Restrictions Applicable to all Retired members of the 
Armed Forces:

[[Page 317]]

    1. DoD civilian employment. A retired member of the Armed Forces may 
not be appointed to a DoD civilian position within 180 days after 
retirement unless:
    a. The employment is approved by the appropriate authority (D0D 
Directive 1402.1, Employment of Retired Members of the Armed Forces).
    b. The position is one for which an advance hiring pay rate has been 
authorized by the Office of Personnel Management under 5 U.S.C. 5305, or
    c. A state of national emergency exists.
    2. Foreign employment. A retired member of the Armed Forces may not 
accept any present, emolument, office, title, or employment from any 
foreign government unless approved by the Secretary of the Military 
Department concerned and the Secretary of State. The penalty for a 
violation is loss of retirement pay.
    3. Use of military titles. Retired members of the Armed Forces may 
not use their military title in such a way as to give rise to the 
appearance of sponsorship, sanction, endorsement, or approval of the 
Military Service or the DoD in connection with any commercial 
enterprise. Overseas commanders may further restrict the use of military 
titles by retired personnel in overseas areas.
    H. Special Restrictions on the Activities of Former Employees Who 
Were Engaged in Procurement Functions:
    1. Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2397b, certain former military officers and 
civilian employees may not receive compensation from a major defense 
contractor for a 2-year period, beginning on the date the former officer 
or employee separated from Federal service. This restriction prohibits 
the acceptance of compensation from a particular major defense 
contractor only if the former officer or employee performed the duties 
listed in subparagraph 2, below, relating to that same defense 
contractor.
    2. Personnel to whom restrictions apply. Individuals in the 
following categories are subject to the restrictions:
    a. Civilian employees whose rate of pay was greater than or equal to 
that for a GS-13, Step 1 (GS-12, Step 7) and military officers in pay 
grades of O-4 or higher, if such individuals:
    (1) Spent the majority of their working days during the last 2 years 
of DoD service performing a procurement function relating to a DoD 
contract, at a site or plant that was owned or operated by a contractor, 
and which was the principal location of their performance of that 
procurement function; or
    (2) Performed, on a majority of their working days during the last 
two years of DoD service, a procurement function relating to a major 
defense system and, in the performance of such a function, participated

major defense system through contact with the contractor.
    b. Civilian employees who served in a Senior Executive Sevice 
position or higher, and military officers who served in the pay grade of 
O-7 or higher, if such individuals during the last 2 years of DoD 
service:

negotiation with a defense contractor of a defense contract in an amount 
in excess of $10,000,000 (the actual contractual action taken by the 
individual must have been in an amount in excess of $10,000,000), or
    (2) Acted as a primary representative of the United States in the 
negotiation of a settlement of an unresolved claim of such a defense

amount of the claim or the amount of the settlement.
    3. Advice from the designated Agency Ethics Official.
    a. Any person may, before accepting compensation, request that PLFA

    b. A request for advice shall be in writing and shall contain all 
relevant information.
    c. If the PLFA Counsel or General Counsel, DLA receives a request 
for advice, he shall issue a written opinion in response thereto not 
later than 30 days after receipt of all relevant information.
    d. If the advice rendered by the PLFA Counsel or General Counsel, 
DLA states that the law and part 1293 are inapplicable, and that the 
individual may accept the compensation from the contractor, then there 
shall be a conclusive presumption that the acceptance of the 
compensation is not a violation of 10 U.S.C. 2397b.
    4. Apparent violations. Apparent violations. Apparent violations of 
these prohibitions shall be referred to the General Counsel, DLA who 
will review the matter for referral to the DoD Inspector General or the 
Inspector General of the appropriate Military Department for

entity that contracts directly with the Department of Defense to supply 
the Department of Defense with goods or services. The term does not 
include an affiliate or subsidiary of an entity that contracts directly

goods or services if the affiliate or subsidiary is clearly not engaged 
in the performance of a defense contract, nor does it include a state or 
local government.

system are estimated to exceed $75,000,000 (based on fiscal year 1980 
constant dollars) or the eventual total expenditure for procurement 
exceeds $300,00,000 (based on fiscal year 1980 constant dollars); or, 
the system is designated a ``major system'' by the head of the agency

time during that day.
    j. Negotiation and settlement. Exchange of views between

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See footnote 1, to Sec. 1293.3(c)(1)(ii).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Q. Any person (including a special Government employee) who is 
required to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938

    S. Acceptance of excessive honoraria (2 U.S.C. 441i).
    T. Acceptance, without statutory authority, of any present,

    Appendix B--Code of Ethics For Government Service--Pub. L. 96-303

    Any person in Government service should:
    I. Put loyalty to the highest moral principles and to country above 
loyalty to persons, party, or Government department.
    II. Uphold the Constitution, laws, and regulations of the United 
States and of all governments therein and never be a party to their 
evasion.
    III. Give a full day's labor for a full day's pay; giving earnest 
effort and best thought to the performance of duties.
    IV. Seek to find and employ more efficient and economical ways of 
getting tasks accomplished.
    V. Never discriminate unfairly by the dispensing of special favors 
or privileges to anyone, whether for remuneration or not; and never 
accept, for himself or herself or for family members, favors and 
benefits under circumstances which might be construed by reasonable 
persons as influencing the performance of governmental duties.
    VI. Make no private promises of any kind binding upon the duties of 
office, since a Government employee has no private word which can be 
binding on public duty.
    VII. Engage in no business with the Government, either directly or 
indirectly, which is inconsistent with the conscientious performance of 
governmental duties.
    VIII. Never use any information gained confidentially in the

Appendix C--Additional Guidance On Gratuities, Reimbursements, And Other 
                      Benefits From Outside Sources

                               I. General

    The general prohibition against accepting gratuities, 
reimbursements, and other benefits from outside sources does not apply 
to

[[Page 320]]

the following. These exceptions shall be applied narrowly in keeping 
with the prohibition in Sec. 1293.3(g).
    A. The continued participation in employee welfare or benefit plans 
of a former employee when permitted by law and approved by the General 
Counsel, DLA, or PLFA Counsel.
    B. The acceptance of unsolicited advertising or promotional items 
that are less than $10 in retail value.
    C. The acceptance of trophies, entertainment, prizes, or awards for 
public service or achievement in an individual, unofficial capacity or 
given in games or contests that do not relate to official duties and are 
clearly open to the public generally, or are officially approved for DLA 
personnel participation.
    D. The acceptance of benefits available to the public, such as 
university scholarships covered by DoD Directive 1322.6, Fellowships, 
Scholarships, and Grants for Members of the Armed Forces, and free 
exhibitions by DoD contractors at public trade fairs.
    E. The acceptance of discounts or concessions realistically 
available to all DLA personnel, provided that such discounts or 
concessions are not used to obtain any item for the purpose of resale at 
a profit.
    F. Participation by DLA personnel in civic and community activities 
that also involve a DoD contractor, when any relationship between DLA 
personnel and the contractor is indirect; for example participation in a 
Little League or Combined Federal Campaign luncheon that is subsidized 
by a defense contractor.
    G. Activities engaged in by DLA personnel with local civic or 
military leaders as part of authorized community relations programs of 
DLA.
    H. The participation of DLA personnel in widely attended gatherings 
of mutual interest to Government and industry, sponsored or hosted by 
industrial, technical, and professional associations (not by individual 
contractors), provided that they have been approved in accordance with 
DoD Instruction 5410.20, Public Affairs Relations with Business and 
Nongovernmental Organizations Representing Business.
    I. Situations in which participation by DLA personnel at public 
ceremonial activities of mutual interest to industry, local communities, 
and DLA serves the interest of the Government, and acceptance of the 
invitation is approved by the General Counsel, DLA or PLFA Counsel.
    J. When on official Government business and when the DLA personnel 
reports the circumstances in writing to the immediate supervisor and to 
the General Counsel, DLA or the PLFA Counsel, as soon as possible:
    1. Space available use of previously scheduled ground transportation 
to or from a DoD contractor's place of business provided by the 
contractor for its own employees, and
    2. Contractor-provided transportation, meals, or overnight 
accommodations when arrangements for Government or commercial 
transportation, meals, or accommodations are clearly impracticable.
    K. Attendance or participation of DLA personnel in gatherings, 
including social events such as receptions, which are hosted by foreign 
governments (when not acting in their DoD contractor capacity) or 
international organizations, provided that the acceptance of the 
invitation is approved by the General Counsel, DLA or PLFA Counsel.
    L. Customary exchanges of gratituities between DLA personnel and 
their friends and relatives or the friends and relatives of their 
spouse, minor children and members of their household, when the 
circumstances clearly indicate that it is the relationship, rather than 
the business of the person concerned, that is the motivating factor for 
the gratuity and it is clear that the gratuity is not paid for by the 
United States Government or any DoD contractor.
    M. Acceptance of coffee, doughnuts, and similar refreshments of 
nominal value offered as a normal courtesy incidental to the performance 
of duty. This exception applies to acceptance on an occasional basis and 
does not authorize acceptance on a recurring basis.
    N. The acceptance of benefits resulting from the business activities 
of a spouse where it is clear that the benefits are given to the spouse 
in the normal course of the spouse's employment or business and have not 
been given or made more attractive because of the DLA employee's status. 
This exception does not, however, alter the requirement for 
disqualification under Sec. 1293.7(c)(1).
    O. Acceptance of transportation and related travel expenses from a 
potential employer in connection with a job interview, provided that 
prior to departing on the trip:
    1. The DLA employee receiving the gratuity notifies his or her 
immediate supervisor of the travel arrangements.
    2. The DLA employee files a written disqualification statement 
concerning any possible official actions involving the potential 
employer.
    3. The DLA employee submits some evidence that the potential 
employer offers the same benefits to all similarly situated individuals, 
not only those employed in the Department of Defense.
    P. Situations in which, in the sound judgment of both the individual 
involved and his or her immediate supervisor, the Government's interest 
will be served by DLA personnel participating in activities otherwise 
prohibited. In any such case, a written report of the circumstances 
shall be made in advance, or, when an advance report is not possible, 
within 48 hours, by the individual or supervisor to the General Counsel, 
DLA or PLFA Counsel.

                    II. Defense Contracting Training

    The guidance in subparagraphs A through C of this section applies 
whenever defense contractors provide training, orientation, or refresher 
courses to DLA personnel. These courses range from executive orientation 
courses in which all expenses are borne by the defense contractor to 
seminars devoted to technical developments in which the only 
``gratuity'' may be lectures given free of charge.
    A. Attendance by DLA employees at training sessions provided by 
defense contractors is permitted when the contractor's products or 
systems are provided under contract to DoD and the training is to 
facilitate the utilization of those products or systems by DLA 
personnel.
    B. When a defense contractor provides training pursuant to a 
contract, the training itself is not a gratuity. Likewise, meals, 
lodging, and transportation would not be considered a gratuity if the 
defense contractor was required to furnish them under the terms of the 
contract, but would result in reductions to the travel and other 
expenses normally payable to the employee under the Joint Federal Travel 
Regulation. However, if the defense contractor, without charge, provides 
something to DLA personnel which is not required by the contract, the 
contractor is giving a gratuity to the DLA employee.
    C. Attendance at tuition-free training, refresher courses, or other 
educational meetings offered by a defense contractor (although not 
required to do so by the terms of a contract) may be authorized when 
attendance is clearly in the best interests of the Government and meets 
the following criteria of DLAR 1430.12, Civilian Employee Development 
and Training: \6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ See footnote 1, to Sec. 1293.3(c)(1)(ii).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1. Selection of the DLA employees attending the contractor training 
will be made by the Government.
    2. The unavailability of alternative training sources, and 
confidence that the contractor provided training will not adversely 
affect the objectivity of the DLA employee.
    3. Approval of the training is at a sufficiently high level to 
assure the need cannot otherwise reasonably be met and has the 
concurrence of the General Counsel, DLA or PLFA Counsel.
    4. No appreciable cost is incurred by the contractor in order to 
accommodate attendance by DLA employees.
    5. An understanding that the contractor will receive no special 
consideration or benefit because of the Government's participation.

                           III. Reimbursements

    DLA personnel may not accept either personal reimbursement or in 
kind accommodations, subsistence, transportation, or services for 
expenses incident to official travel, from any source outside the 
Government except as indicated in subparagraphs A through F of this 
section. In cases where acceptance is authorized, appropriate deductions 
will be made in the travel, per diem, or other allowances payable to the 
employee. In no event will DLA personnel accept benefits which are 
excessive.
    A. A DLA employee who is to be a speaker, panelist, project officer, 
or other bona fide participant in the activity attended, may accept 
accommodations, subsistence, transportation, or other services furnished 
in-kind in connection with official travel when such attendance and 
acceptance are authorized by the order-issuing authority as being in the 
overall Government interest. Under these circumstances, an employee may 
not accept personal reimbursement.
    B. When a DLA employee is summoned to testify in an official 
capacity on behalf of a private party at a judicial proceeding, the 
appearance will be on official time and travel expenses may be accepted 
from the court, authority, or party who caused the person to be 
summoned. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5751, the funds may be turned over 
to the agency and Government travel orders issued or the employee may 
use the funds to defray costs directly. Any excess funds must be 
returned to the party or paid into the U.S. Treasury as miscellaneous 
receipts. Any employee appearing on behalf of a private party not in an 
official capacity must use leave to do so and may retain any fees or 
expenses.
    C. Except as indicated in subparagraphs A and B of this section, DLA 
personnel may not accept personal reimbursement from any source for 
expenses incident to official travel, unless authorized by their 
supervisor consistent with guidance provided by the Designated Agency 
Ethics Official or Deputy Ethics Official pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 4111 or 
other statutory authority. Rather reimbursement must be made to the 
Government by check payable to DLA.
    D. DLA personnel may accept travel, or reimbursement for travel 
expenses from a foreign government as provided in DLAR 1005.1, 
Decorations and Gifts from Foreign Governments.
    E. When accommodations, subsistence, or services in kind are 
furnished to DLA personnel by non-U.S. Government sources, consistent 
with this paragraph, appropriate deductions shall be reported and made 
in the travel, per diem, or other allowance payable.
    F. DLA personnel who receive gratuities, or have gratuities received 
on their behalf, in circumstances not in conformance with the standards 
of part 1293, shall promptly report the circumstances to the Designated 
Agency Ethics Official or Deputy Ethics Official for disposition 
determination.

[[Page 322]]

                 IV. Ship Launch and Similar Ceremonies

    The following guidance applies to ceremonies and gifts associated 
with the launch or commissioning of a naval vessel, an aircraft or other 
vehicle, and all similar events:
    A. Attendance at Ceremonies
    Acceptance of an invitation to attend a ceremony shall be approved 
by the Head of the PSE or PLFA. Attendance is permitted at appropriate 
functions incident to the ceremony, such as a dinner preceding the 
ceremony and the reception following it, as long as the function is not 
lavish, excessive, or extravagant.
    B. Acceptance of Gifts
    DLA personnel, their spouses, and their dependent children, who are 
official participants may accept a tangible thing of value as a gift or 
memento in connection with the ceremony as long as its retail value does 
not exceed $100 per family and the cost is not borne by the Government. 
When a gift exceeds the $100 limit the recipient shall pursue one of the 
following alternatives:
    1. Return the gift to the donor.
    2. Retain the gift after reimbursing the donor the full value of the 
gift.
    3. Forward the gift to the Staff Director, Administration (DLA-X) 
for disposition as a gift to the Government in accordance with statute.

  Appendix D--Executive Personnel Financial Disclosure Report (SF 278)

                I. DLA Personnel Required to File SF 278

    A. DLA personnel required to file a Financial Disclosure Report (SF 
278) are listed at Sec. 1293.7(d)(1). These personnel occupy ``covered 
positions.''
    B. A person who is nominated to or assumes a covered position is not 
required to file an SF 278 if the Secretary of Defense or the General 
Counsel, DLA determines that the person is not reasonably expected to 
perform the duties of the position for more than 60 days in the calendar 
year. However, if the person performs the duties of the office or 
position for more than 60 days in the calendar year, an SF 278 shall be 
filed within 15 days after the 61st day of duty.
    C. A person otherwise required to file an SF 278, but who is 
expected to perform the duties of the position for less than 130 days in 
the calendar year, may request a waiver of any or all reporting 
requirements from the Director, Office of Government Ethics, if the 
person is not a full-time employee of the Government, is able to provide 
specially needed services, and does not have outside employment or 
financial interests likely to create a conflict of interest. A request 
for a waiver shall be initially submitted to the General Counsel, DLA.

                           II. Time of Filing

    An SF 278 shall be submitted under the circumstances described 
below.

                          A. Assumption Report

    DLA personnel shall submit a SF 278 to the General Counsel, DLA 
before assuming a covered position. This requirement does not apply if 
the individual has left another covered position within 30 days before 
assuming a new position, or already has filed with respect to nomination 
for the new position.

                            B. Annual Report

    DLA personnel, including special Government employees, occupying a 
covered position for more than 60 days during a calendar year shall 
submit an SF 278 annually. The annual report must be filed with the 
General Counsel, DLA not later than 15 May unless a written extension is 
granted.

                          C. Termination Report

    DLA personnel occupying a covered position shall submit an SF 278 to 
the General Counsel, DLA no sooner than 15 days before and no later than 
30 days after the date of departure from that position unless they 
accept another covered position. The termination report will cover the 
portion of the present calendar year up to the date of termination and, 
if the annual report has not yet been filed, the preceding calendar 
year.

                        III. Contents of Reports

    Instructions for completing SFs 278 are included as part of the 
report forms. Additional guidance for personnel in covered positions is 
available from the General Counsel, DLA.

                  IV. Submission and Review of Reports

    A. Reports will be submitted to the General Counsel, DLA. After 
final review, copies of the reports of military officers assigned to DLA 
will be forwarded by the General Counsel, DLA to the appropriate 
Military Department official.
    B. Final review of an SF 278 is completed when the Genral Counsel, 
DLA has signed the SF 278, indicating that each item is completed and 
that the report discloses no unresolved conflict or appearance of a 
conflict of interest under applicable laws and regulations.
    1. If the General Counsel, DLA, after reviewing an SF 278, believes 
additional information is required, the reporting individual shall be 
notified of the additional information required and the date by which it 
must be submitted. The reporting individual shall submit the required 
information directly to the General Counsel, DLA.
    2. If the General Counsel, DLA, after reviewing the SF 278, is of 
the opinion, on the

[[Page 323]]

basis of information submitted, that the reporting person is not in 
compliance with applicable laws and regualtions, the following steps 
shall be taken:
    a. The person shall be notified in writing of the preliminary 
determination.
    b. After an opportunity for personal consultation, if practicable, 
the General Counsel, DLA shall notify the person in writing of the 
remedial measures that should be taken to bring the person into 
compliance. The notification shall specify a date by which such measures 
must be taken, which, except in unusual circumstances, must be taken 
within 90 days.
    (1) When the General Counsel, DLA determines that a reporting person 
has fully complied with the remedial measures, a notation to that effect 
shall be made in the comment section of the SF 378. The General Counsel, 
DLA shall then sign and date the SF 278 and send written notice of that 
action to the person.
    (2) If steps assuring compliance with applicable laws and 
regulations are not taken by the date established, the General Counsel, 
DLA shall report the matter to the Director, DLA for appropriate action. 
The Office of Government Ethics and the Attorney General shall also be 
notified.
    3. Remedial action may include the following measures:
    a. Disqualification.
    b. Limitation of duties.
    c. Divestiture.
    d. Transfer or reassignment.
    e. Resignation.
    f. Exemption under 18 U.S.C. 208.

                    V. Public Availability of SFs 278

    A. SFs 278 must be made available for public examination upon 
request 15 days after the report is filed unless otherwise exempted 
pursuant to law. Receipt of the report by the General Counsel, DLA for 
final review constitutes official filing and establishes the date from 
which the 15 days shall run. In most cases, this means the reports are 
available to the public before final review is completed. Reporting 
persons are personally responsible for ensuring that their reports are 
accurate, complete, and timely.
    B. Any request for an SF 278 must be in writing and state:
    1. The person's name, occupation, and address.
    2. The name and address of any other person or organization on whose 
behalf the inspection or copy is requested.
    3. That the person is aware that it is unlawful to obtain or use the 
report for:
    a. Any unlawful purpose.
    b. Any commercial purpose, other than by news and communications 
media for dissemination to the general public.
    c. Determining or establishing the credit rating of any individual.
    d. Use, directly or indirectly, in the solicitation of money for any 
political, charitable, or other purpose.

                        VI. Retention of SFs 278

    SFs 278 shall be retained for 6 years from the date of filing.

                             VII. Penalties

    Compliance with the financial disclosure provisions shall be 
enforced by adminstrative, civil, or criminal remedies, which include:

                   A. Action Within the DoD Component

    The Director, DLA may take appropriate action, including a change in 
assigned duties or adverse action, in accordance with applicable law or 
regulation, against any person who fails to file an SF 278, or who 
falsifies or fails to report required information.

                    B. Action by the Attorney General

    The General Counsel, DLA is required to refer to the Attorney 
General the name of any person whom he or she has reasonable cause to 
believe has failed willfully to file an SF 278 on time or has falsified 
or failed willfully to file information required to be reported. Such 
referral does not bar additional administrative or judicial enforcement. 
The Attorney General may bring a civil action in the U.S. District 
Courts against any person who knowingly and willfully falsifies or fails 
to file or report any required information. The court may assess a civil 
penalty not to exceed $5,000. Knowing or willful falsification of 
information required to be filed also may result in criminal prosecution 
under 18 U.S.C. 1001, leading to a fine of not more than $10,000, or 
imprisonment for not more than 5 years, or both.

                          C. Misuse of Reports

    1. The Attorney General may bring a civil action against a person 
who obtains or uses an SF 278 filed under the Ethics in Government Act 
for any of the following reasons:
    a. Any unlawful purpose.
    b. Any commercial purpose, other than by news and communications 
media for dissemination to the general public.
    c. Determining or establishing the credit rating of any individual.
    d. Directly or indirectly, for the solicitation of money for any 
political, charitable, or other purpose.
    2. The court in which such action is brought may assess a penalty in 
any amount not to exceed $5,000. This is in addition to any other legal 
remedy available.

Financial Interests (DD Forms 1555) are those indicated in 
Sec. 1293.7(d)(2).
    B. Special Government Employees (as defined in Sec. 1293.4(i)).
    1. Special Government employees, including Reserve military officers 
assigned to positions requiring the submission of a DD Form 1555 shall 
file a DD Form 1555 prior to performing the duties of the position.
    2. The following categories of special Government employees are not 
required to file DD Forms 1555 unless they are specifically notified 
that they must do so:
    a. Physicians, dentists, and allied medical specialists engaged only 
in providing service to patients.
    b. Veterinarians providing only veterinary services.
    c. Lecturers participating only in educational activities.
    d. Chaplains performing only religious services.
    e. Individuals in the motion picture and television fields who are 
utilized only as narrators or actors in DLA productions.
    f. A special Government employee who is not a ``consultant'' or

chapter 304.

                         II. Review of Positions

    Immediate supervisors shall annually review each civilian and 
military position under their supervision, determine whether the 
position requires the incumbent to file a DD Form 1555, and will notify 
each employee of the determination. The position description of each 
position shall state whether or not the incumbent must file a DD Form 
1555. Any individual may request a review of the determination requiring 
submission of a DD Form 1555 from the Deputy Ethics Official. In the 
event the employee is dissatisfied with this decision, there is an 
appeal right to the Designated Agency Ethics Official, whose decision 
shall be final.

                        III. Manner of Submission

                          A. Time of Submission

    1. Employees will file a DD Form 1555 for review and approval prior 
to performing the duties of a position that requires filing of a DD Form 
1555. Reserve Officers shall file the form upon reporting for duty. If 
an employee has filed a DD Form 1555 by virtue of a previous position, a 
copy of the previously submitted form may be submitted to the new 
supervisor for review rather than filing a new DD Form 1555.
    2. DD Forms 1555 shall annually be filed by 31 October each year for 
all affiliations and financial interests as of the 30th of September of 
that year. Even if no changes occur from the previous year, a new and 
complete DD Form 1555 is required to be filed each year.
    3. Excusable Delay. When required by reason of duty assignment or 
infirmity, a supervisor may grant an extension of time with concurrence 
of the DAEO or Deputy Ethics Official. Any extension in excess of 30 
days requires the concurrence of the Designated Agency Ethics Official. 
Any late DD Forms 1555 shall include appropriate notation of any 
extension of time granted hereunder.

                          B. To Whom Submitted

    1. HQ DLA. a. Heads of PSEs required to file DD Forms 1555 will 
submit them through the General Counsel, DLA to the Director, DLA.
    b. Deputy Heads of PSEs required to file DD Forms 1555 will submit 
them to the Head of the PSE for review and evaluation. After resolution 
of any conflict, the DD Forms 1555 will be forwarded to the General 
Counsel, DLA.
    c. Other officers and employees of HQ DLA, and their management 
support activities, will submit DD Forms 1555 to their immediate 
supervisor for review and evaluation. Upon completion of their review 
and resolution of any conflicts, supervisors will forward the DD Forms 
1555 to the General Counsel, DLA.
    2. Field activities with assigned DLA Counsel. a. Heads of PLFAs 
required to file DD Forms 1555 will submit them through the General 
Counsel, DLA to the Director, DLA.

them to their immediate supervisors for review and evaluation. After 
resolution of any conflict, the forms will be submitted to the General 
Counsel, DLA.
    c. Other officers and employees of PLFAs or subordinate activities 
required to file DD Forms 1555 will submit them to their immediate 
supervisors for review and evaluation. After resolution of any conflict, 
the forms will be forwarded to the appropriate Deputy Ethics Official.
    d. Counsel for PLFAs will submit DD Forms 1555 to the Head of the 
PLFA for review and evaluation. After resolution of any conflict, the 
forms will be forwarded to the General Counsel, DLA.
    e. Heads of DLA activities subordinate to PLFAs, when required to 
file DD Forms 1555, will submit the forms to the Head of the PLFA, who 
will review and evaluate, and forward to the appropriate Deputy Ethics 
Official after resolution of any conflict.

[[Page 325]]

    f. Counsel for DLA activities subordinate to a PLFA will submit DD 
Forms 1555 to the activity Head for review, evaluation, and resolution 
of any conflict. The forms will be forwarded to the Counsel of the PLFA.
    3. Management Support Activities. a. Heads of Management Support 
Activities will submit DD Forms 1555 to their immediate supervisors for 
review and evaluation. After resolution of any conflict, the forms will 
be submitted to the General Counsel, DLA.
    b. Other officers and employees of Management Support Activities 
will submit them to their immediate supervisors for review and 
evaluation. After resolution of any conflict, the forms will be 
forwarded to the Deputy Ethics Official of the PLFA providing personnel 
services to the Management Support Activity.
    4. Detailed employees. Agreements with other DoD Components and 
Government agencies shall contain a requirement that the other Component 
agency shall, within 60 days, forward to the General Counsel, DLA a copy 
of the detailed individual's DD Form 1555, if required, and notice 
concerning the disposition of any conflict or apparent conflict of 
interest indicated.

                          C. Content of Report

    1. Instructions for completing the DD Form 1555 are included as a 
part of the form. Additional guidance may be obtained from the 
Designated Agency Ethics Official or Deputy Ethics Official.
    2. The interest of a spouse, minor child, or any member of the 
employee's household shall be reported as if it were the interest of the 
employee. The interests of a spouse need not be reported if the employee 
and spouse have:
    a. A final decree of separation,
    b. An interim or interlocutory decree, or
    c. A separation agreement formally executed by the employee and 
spouse in anticipation of its incorporation into a final decree of 
divorce or separation.
    3. DLA personnel are not required to submit on a DD Form 1555 any 
information relating to their connection with or interest in a 
professional society or a charitable, religious, social, fraternal, 
recreational, public service, civic, or political organization, or a 
similar organization not conducted as a business for profit. However, 
educational or other institutions doing research and development or 
related work involving grants of money or contracts with the Government 
must be reported.
    4. Ownership of personal savings or checking accounts in financial 
institutions, shares in credit unions or savings and loan associations, 
life or property insurance policies and shares in widely held 
diversified mutual funds or regulated investment companies need not be 
reported.
    5. An employee need not disclose the assets of, sources of income 
of, or transactions of, a trust if:
    a. The trust is a qualified blind or qualified diversified trust 
certified by the Office of Government Ethics and is otherwise reported 
on the DD Form 1555 by name of trust and date of execution, or
    b. The trust is an ``excepted'' trust, defined as follows:
    (1) A trust that was not created by the DLA employee, or the 
employee's spouse, or dependent child:
    (2) A trust that consists of withholdings or sources of income of 
which the officer or employee, or spouse, or dependent child have no 
knowledge, and
    (3) Which is disclosed as an asset or income source on the report.
    6. DLA personnel shall request submission on their behalf of 
required information known only to other persons; for example, holdings 
of spouse or other members of the household, executor of any estate, or 
trustee. The submissions may be made with a request for confidentiality 
that will be honored even if it includes a limitation on disclosure to 
the DLA employee concerned.
    D. Confidentiality of DD Forms 1555 of DLA personnel. Each DD Form 
1555 shall be held in confidence. Information from a DD Form 1555 may 
not be disclosed except as the Designated Agency Ethics Official or the 
Office of Government Ethics may determine for good cause. Persons 
designated to review the DD Forms 1555 are responsible for maintaining 
the statements in confidence and shall not allow access to or disclosure 
from the DD Forms 1555 except to carry out the purpose of part 1293.
    E. Effect of statements on other requirements. The DD Form 1555 
required of DLA personnel is in addition to, and not in substitution 
for, any similar requirement imposed by statute, Executive Order, or 
regulation. Submission of a DD Form 1555 does not permit DLA personnel 
to participate in matters in which their participation is prohibited by 
statute, Executive Order, or regulation.
    F. Review of DD Forms 1555. 1. The filing employee's immediate 
supervisor reviews the DD Form 1555 to evaluate whether there is a 
conflict or apparent conflict between the employee's private financial 
interests and his or her official responsibilities. The immediate 
supervisor records the results of the evaluation in block 13. Heads of 
PSEs and PLFAs will perform the initial review of their deputies' DD 
Forms 1555 before forwarding them to the General Counsel, DLA. Heads of 
PLFAs perform the initial review of the PLFA Counsel's forms. After 
review and completion of the supervisor's statement, the DD Form 1555 
should be forwarded to the Designated Agency Ethics Official or Deputy 
Ethics Official, as appropriate, for final review and filing.

[[Page 326]]

    2. DD Forms 1555 shall be reviewed to assure that:
    a. Each item is completed, and
    b. No interest or position disclosed on the form violates or appears 
to violate any of the following:
    (1) Any applicable provision of chapter 11 of title 18 of the United 
States Code (part 1).
    (2) The ``Ethics in Government Act of 1978,'' as amended, and any 
regulations promulgated thereunder.
    (3) Executive Order 11222 as amended, and any regulations 
promulgated thereunder.
    (4) Any other related statute or regulation applicable to the 
employees of the agency.
    3. The supervisor need not audit the report to ascertain whether the 
disclosures are correct; disclosures are to be taken at ``face value'' 
unless there is a patent omission or ambiguity or the official has 
independent knowledge of matters outside the report. The supervisor's 
signature shall signify that he or she has found that the information in 
the report discloses no conflict of interest under applicable laws and 
regulations and that the report fulfills the requirements set out in 
IIIF2, above.
    4. If the supervisor believes that additional information is 
required, the reporting individual shall be notified of the additional 
information required and the date by which it must be submitted.
    5. Whenever the supervisor's review of a DD Form 1555 discloses a 
conflict or an apparent conflict of interest, the employee concerned 
will be given an opportunity to explain the conflict or apparent 
conflict to the immediate supervisor. Resolution of a conflict or 
apparent conflict will be made under Sec. 1293.7(b). If the conflict or 
apparent conflict cannot be resolved by the supervisor, it will be 
forwarded, along with a copy of the employee's current position 
description, to the Designated Agency Ethics Official or Deputy Ethics 
Official, as appropriate, for resolution.
    6. If the supervisor concludes that the report is completed properly 
and that no item violates, or appears to violate, applicable statute or 
regulation, then such official shall sign and date the report.
    G. Remedial action.
    1. Whenever the designated Agency Ethics Official or Deputy Ethics 
Official concludes that the filing individual is not in compliance with 
applicable laws or regulations, the Designated Agency Ethics Official or 
Deputy Ethics Official shall do the following:
    a. Notify the reporting individual of the preliminary determination.
    b. Afford the reporting individual an opportunity for personal 
consultation, if practicable.
    c. Determine what remedial action should be taken to bring the 
reporting individual into compliance.

such periods equals one year, he shall be deemed to have resided in the 
United States for one year. In computing the length of such periods, any 
portion of one day shall be counted as a day. Upon establishing a one 
year residency, the alien registrant will be assigned to the age 
selection group corresponding to his age.

of learning, is ordered to report for induction shall, upon the 
presentation of appropriate facts in the manner prescribed by the 
Director of Selective Service, have his induction postponed:

inducted into the Armed Forces during the period of any such 
postponement. A postponement of induction shall not render invalid the 
Order to Report for Induction which has been issued to the registrant, 
but shall operate only to postpone the reporting date, and the 
registrant shall report on the new date scheduled without having issued 
to him a new Order to Report for Induction.
    (i) Any registrant receiving a postponement under the provisions of 
this section, shall, after the expiration of such postponement, be 
rescheduled to report for induction at the place to which he was 
originally ordered.
    (j) The initial determination of claims for all postponements is

Sec. 1633.1  Classifying authority.

    The following officials are authorized to classify registrants into 
the indicated classes established by part 1630 of this chapter:
    (a) The Director of Selective Service may in accord with the 
provisions of this chapter classify a registrant into any class for 
which he is eligible except Classes 1-A-0, 1-0, 2-D, 3-A, and 4-D: 
Provided, That, the Director may not reclassify a registrant other than 
a volunteer for induction, into Class 1-A out of another class prior to 
the expiration of the registrant's entitlement to such classification. 
The Director may, before issuing an induction order to a registrant, 
appropriately classify him if the Secretary of Defense has certified him 
to be a member of an armed force or reserve component thereof.
    (b) The National Selective Service Appeal Board may in accord with 
part 1653 of this chapter classify a registrant into any class for which 
he is eligible.
    (c) A district appeal board may in accord with part 1651 of this 
chapter classify a registrant into any class for which he is eligible.
    (d) A local board may in accord with part 1648 of this chapter 
classify a registrant into Class 1-A-0, 1-0, 2-D, 3-A, or 4-D for which 
he is eligible.
    (e) A local board may also classify a registrant into Class 1-C, 1-
D-D, 1-D-E, 1-O-S, 1-W, 3-A-S, 4-A, 4-A-A, 4-B, 4-C, 4-F, 4-G, 4-T or 4-
W for which he is eligible upon request by the registrant for a review 
of a classification denial action under Sec. 1633.1(f). No individual 
shall be classified into Class 4-F unless the Secretary of Defense has 
determined that he is unacceptable for military service.
    (f) Compensated employees of an area office may in accord with 
Sec. 1633.2 may classify a registrant into an administrative class for 
which he is eligible. No individual shall be classified into Class 4-F 
unless the Secretary of Defense has determined that he is unacceptable 
for military service.

<R05>
Sec. 1633.2  Claim for other than Class 1-A.

    (a) Any registrant who has received an order to report for induction 
may, prior to the day he is scheduled to report, submit to the Selective 
Service System a claim that he is eligible to be classified into any 
class other than Class 1-A. The registrant may assert a claim that he is 
eligible for more than one class other than Class 1-A. The registrant 
cannot subsequently file a claim with respect to a class for which he 
was eligible prior to the day he was originally scheduled to report. 
Information and documentation in support of claims for reclassification 
and postponement of induction shall be filed in accordance with 
instructions from the Selective Service System.
    (b) Any registrant who has received an order to report for induction 
that has not been canceled may, at any time before his induction, submit 
a claim that he is eligible to be classified into any class other than 
Class 1-A based upon events over which he has no control that occurred 
on or after the day he was originally scheduled to report for induction.
    (c)(1) Claims will be filed with the area office supporting the 
local board of jurisdiction.
    (2) Claims will be considered by the local board identified in 
paragraph (c)(1) or its supporting area office as prescribed in this 
part.
    (d) The initial determination of claims for all administrative 
classifications are made by area office compensated personnel. After a 
denial of a claim for an administrative classification the registrant 
may request the local board to consider the claim.
    (e) The initial determination of a judgmental classification is made 
by a local board.
    (f) A registrant may request and shall be granted a personal 
appearance whenever a local or appeal board considers his claim for 
reclassification. Personal appearances will be held in accord with parts 
1648, 1651 and 1653 of this chapter.
    (g) A registrant who has filed a claim for classification in Class 
1-A-O or Class 1-0 shall be scheduled for a personal appearance in 
accord with Sec. 1648.4 before his claim is considered.

[[Page 356]]

    (h) If granted, a deferment or exemption supersedes the original 
order to report for induction. When a deferment or exemption expires or 
ends, a new order to report for induction will be issued.

[52 FR 24457, July 1, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 1633.3  Submission of claims.

    Except as otherwise expressly provided by the Director, no document 
relating to any registrant's claims or potential claims will be retained 
by the Selective Service System and no file relating to a registrant's 
possible classification status will be established prior to that 
registrant being ordered to report for induction.


<R05>
Sec. 1633.4  Information relating to claims for deferment or exemption.

    The registrant shall be entitled to present all relevant written 
information which he believes to be necessary to assist the classifying 
authority in determining his proper classification; such information may 
include documents, affidavits, and depositions. The affidavits and 
depositions shall be as concise and brief as possible.


<R05>
Sec. 1633.5  Securing information.

    The classifying authority is authorized to request and receive 
information whenever such information will assist in determining the 
proper classification of a registrant.


<R05>
Sec. 1633.6  Consideration of classes.

    Claims of a registrant will be considered in inverse order of the 
listing of the classes below. When grounds are established to place a 
registrant in one or more of the classes listed in the following table, 
the registrant shall be classified in the lowest class for which he is 
determined to be eligible, with Class 1-A-O considered the highest class 
and Class 1-H considered the lowest class, according to the following 
table:

    Class 1-A-O: Conscientious Objector Available for Noncombatant

    Class 1-C: Member of the Armed Forces of the United States, the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or the Public Health 
Service.
    Class 1-W: Conscientious Objector Ordered to Perform Alternative

[52 FR 24457, July 1, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 1633.7  General principles of classification.

    (a) Each classified registrant in a selection group is available for 
unrestricted military service until his eligibility for noncombatant 
service, alternative service, or deferment or exemption from service has 
been determined by a classifying authority.
    (b) The classifying authority in considering a registrant's claim 
for classification shall not discriminate for or against him because of 
his race, creed, color or ethnic background and shall not discriminate 
for or against him because of his membership or activity in any labor, 
political, religious, or other organization.

[47 FR 4654, Feb. 1, 1982, as amended at 52 FR 24457, July 1, 1987]

[[Page 357]]


<R05>
Sec. 1633.8  Basis of classification.

    The registrant's classification shall be determined on the basis of 
the official forms of the Selective Service System and other written 
information in his file, oral statements, if made by the registrant at 
his personal appearance before the board, and oral statements, if made 
by the registrant's witnesses at his personal appearance. Any 
information in any written summary of the oral information presented at 
a registrant's personal appearance that was prepared by an official of 
the Selective Service System or by the registrant will be placed in the 
registrant's file. The file shall be subject to review by the registrant 
during normal business hours.


<R05>
Sec. 1633.9  Explanation of classification action.

    Whenever a classifying authority denies the request of a registrant 
for classification into a particular class or classifies a registrant in 
a class other than that which he requested, it shall record the reasons 
therefor in the registrant's file.


<R05>
Sec. 1633.10  Notification to registrant of classification action.

    The Director will notify the registrant of any classification 
action.

[52 FR 24457, July 1, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 1633.11  Assignment of registrant to a local board.

    (a) A registrant is assigned to the local board that has 
jurisdiction over his permanent address that he last furnished the 
Selective Service System prior to the issuance of his induction order.
    (b) The Director may change a registrant's assignment when he deems 
it necessary to assure the fair and equitable administration of the 
Selective Service Law.

[52 FR 24457, July 1, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 1633.12  Reconsideration of classification.

    No classification is permanent. The Director of Selective Service 
may order the reconsideration of any classification action when the 
facts, upon which the classification is based, change or when he finds 
that the registrant made a misrepresentation of any material fact 
related to his claim for classification. No action may be taken under 
the preceding sentence of this paragraph unless the registrant is 
notified in writing of the impending action and the reasons thereof, and 
is given an opportunity to respond in writing within 10 days of the 
mailing of the notice. If the Director orders a reconsideration of a 
classification in accord with this paragraph, the claim will be treated 
in all respects as if it were the original claim for that 
classification.

<R05>
Sec. 1636.1  Purpose; definitions.

    (a) The provisions of this part govern the consideration of a claim 
by a registrant for classification in Class 1-A-0 (Sec. 1630.11 of this 
chapter), or Class 1-0 (Sec. 1630.17 of this chapter).
    (b) The definitions of this paragraph shall apply in the 
interpretation of the provisions of this part:
    (1) Crystallization of a Registrant's Beliefs. The registrant's 
becoming conscious of the fact that he is opposed to participation in 
war in any form.
    (2) Noncombatant Service. Service in any unit of the Armed Forces 
which is unarmed at all times; any other military assignment not 
requiring the bearing of arms or the use of arms in combat or training 
in the use of arms.

[[Page 358]]

    (3) Noncombatant Training. Any training which is not concerned with 
the study, use, or handling of arms or other implements of warfare 
designed to destroy human life.


<R05>
Sec. 1636.2  The claim of conscientious objection.

    A claim to classification in Class 1-A-0 or Class 1-0, must be made 
by the registrant in writing. Claims and documents in support of claims 
may only be submitted after the registrant has received an order to 
report for induction or after the Director has made a specific request 
for submission of such documents. All claims or documents in support of 
claims received prior to a registrant being ordered to report for 
induction or prior to the Director's specific request for such 
documentation will be returned to the registrant and no file or record 
of such submission will be established.


<R05>
Sec. 1636.3  Basis for classification in Class 1-A-0.

    (a) A registrant must be conscientiously opposed to participation in 
combatant training and service in the Armed Forces.
    (b) A registrant's objection may be founded on religious training 
and belief; it may be based on strictly religious beliefs, or on 
personal beliefs that are purely ethical or moral in source or content 
and occupy in the life of a registrant a place parallel to that filled 
by belief in a Supreme Being for those holding more traditionally 
religious views.
    (c) A registrant's objection must be sincere.

[47 FR 4655, Feb. 1, 1982, as amended at 52 FR 24457, July 1, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 1636.4  Basis for classification in Class 1-0.

    (a) A registrant must be conscientiously opposed to participation in 
war in any form and conscientiously opposed to participation in both 
combatant and noncombatant training and service in the Armed Forces.
    (b) A registrant's objection may be founded on religious training 
and belief; it may be based on strictly religious beliefs, or on 
personal beliefs that are purely ethical or moral in source or centent 
and occupy in the life of a registrant a place parallel to that filled 
by belief in a Supreme Being for those holding more traditionally 
religious views.
    (c) A registrant's objection must be sincere.


<R05>
Sec. 1636.5  Exclusion from Class 1-A-0 and Class 1-0.

    A registrant shall be excluded from Class 1-A-0 or Class 1-0:
    (a) Who asserts beliefs which are of a religious, moral or ethical 
nature, but who is found not to be sincere in his assertions; or
    (b) Whose stated objection to participation in war does not rest at 
all upon moral, ethical, or religious principle, but instead rests 
solely upon considerations of policy, pragmatism, expediency, or his own 
self-interest or well-being; or
    (c) Whose objection to participation in war is directed against a 
particular war rather than against war in any form (a selective 
objection). If a registrant objects to war in any form, but also 
believes in a theocratic, spiritual war between the forces of good and 
evil, he may not by reason of that belief alone be considered a 
selective conscientious objector.


<R05>
Sec. 1636.6  Analysis of belief.

    (a) A registrant claiming conscientious objection is not required to 
be a member of a peace church or any other church, religious 
organization, or religious sect to qualify for a 1-A-0 or 1-0 
classification; nor is it necessary that he be affiliated with any 
particular group opposed to participation in war in any form.
    (b) The registrant who identifies his beliefs with those of a 
traditional church or religious organization must show that he basically 
adheres to beliefs of that church or religious organization whether or 
not he is actually affiliated with the institution whose teachings he 
claims as the basis of his conscientious objection. He need not adhere 
to all beliefs of that church or religious organization.
    (c) A registrant whose beliefs are not religious in the traditional 
sense, but are based primarily on moral or ethical principle should hold 
such beliefs with

[[Page 359]]

the same strength or conviction as the belief in a Supreme Being is held 
by a person who is religious in the traditional sense. Beliefs may be 
mixed; they may be a combination of traditional religious beliefs and 
nontraditional religious, moral or ethical beliefs. The registrant's 
beliefs must play a significant role in his life but should be evaluated 
only insofar as they pertain to his stated objection to his 
participation in war.
    (d) Where the registrant is or has been a member of a church, 
religious organization, or religious sect, and where his claim of a 
conscientious objection is related to such membership, the board may 
properly inquire as to the registrant's membership, the religious 
teachings of the church, religious organization, or religious sect, and 
the registrant's religious activity, insofar as each relates to his 
objection to participation in war. The fact that the registrant may 
disagree with or not subscribe to some of the tenets of his church or 
religious sect does not necessarily discredit his claim.
    (e)(1) The history of the process by which the registrant acquired 
his beliefs, whether founded on religious, moral, or ethical principle 
is relevant to the determination whether his stated opposition to 
participation in war in any form is sincere.
    (2) The registrant must demonstrate that his religious, ethical, or 
moral convictions were acquired through training, study, contemplation, 
or other activity comparable to the processes by which traditional 
religious convictions are formulated. He must show that these religious, 
moral, or ethical convictions, once acquired, have directed his life in 
the way traditional religious convictions of equal strength, depth, and 
duration have directed the lives of those whose beliefs are clearly 
founded in traditional religious conviction.
    (f) The registrant need not use formal or traditional language in 
describing the religious, moral, or ethical nature of his beliefs. Board 
members are not free to reject beliefs because they find them 
incomprehensible or inconsistent with their own beliefs.
    (g) Conscientious objection to participation in war in any form, if 
based on moral, ethical, or religious beliefs, may not be deemed 
disqualifying simply because those beliefs may influence the registrant 
concerning the Nation's domestic or foreign policy.

[47 FR 4655, Feb. 1, 1982, as amended at 52 FR 24457, July 1, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 1636.7  Impartiality.

    Boards may not give preferential treatment to one religion over 
another, and all beliefs whether of a religious, ethical, or moral 
nature are to be given equal consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 1636.8  Considerations relevant to granting or denying a claim for classification as a conscientious objector.

    (a) After the registrant has submitted a claim for classification as 
a conscientious objector and his file is complete, a determination of 
his sincerity will be made based on:
    (1) All documents in the registrant's file folder; and
    (2) The oral statements of the registrant at his personal 
appearance(s) before the local and/or appeal board; and
    (3) The oral statements of the registrant's witnesses, if any, at 
his personal appearance(s) before the local board; and
    (4) The registrant's general demeanor during his personal 
appearance(s).
    (b) The registrant's stated convictions should be a matter of 
conscience.
    (c) The board should be convinced that the registrant's personal 
history since the crystallization of his conscientious objection is not 
inconsistent with his claim and demonstrates that the registrant's 
objection is not solely a matter of expediency. A recent crystallization 
of beliefs does not in itself indicate expediency.
    (d) The information presented by the registrant should reflect a 
pattern of behavior in response to war and weapons which is consistent 
with his stated beliefs. Instances of violent acts or conviction for 
crimes of violence, or employment in the development or manufacturing of 
weapons of war, if the claim is based upon or supported by a life of 
nonviolence, may be indicative of inconsistent conduct.

[[Page 360]]

    (e) The development of a registrant's opposition to war in any form 
may bear on his sincerity. If the registrant claims a recent 
crystallization of beliefs, his claim should be supported by evidence of 
a religious or educational experience, a traumatic event, an historical 
occasion, or some other special situation which explains when and how 
his objection to participation in war crystallized.
    (f) In the event that a registrant has previously worked in the 
development of or manufacturing of weapons of war or has served as a 
member of a military reserve unit, it should be determined whether such 
activity was prior to the stated crystallization of the registrant's 
conscientious objector beliefs. Inconsistent conduct prior to the actual 
crystallization of conscientious objector beliefs is not necessarily 
indicative of insincerity. But, inconsistent conduct subsequent to such 
crystallization may indicate that registrant's stated objection is not 
sincere.
    (g) A registrant's behavior during his personal appearance before a 
board may be relevant to the sincerity of his claim.
    (1) Evasive answers to questions by board members or the use of 
hostile, belligerent, or threatening words or actions, for example, may 
in proper circumstances be deemed inconsistent with a claim in which the 
registrant bases his objection on a belief in nonviolence.
    (2) Care should be exercised that nervous, frightened, or 
apprehensive behavior at the personal appearance is not misconstrued as 
a reflection of insincerity.
    (h) Oral response to questions posed by board members should be 
consistent with the written statements of the registrant and should 
generally substantiate the submitted information in the registrant's 
file folder; any inconsistent material should be explained by the 
registrant. It is important to recognize that the registrant need not be 
eloquent in his answers. But, a clear inconsistency between the 
registrant's oral remarks at his personal appearance and his written 
submission to the board may be adequate grounds, if not satisfactorily 
explained, for concluding that his claim is insincere.
    (i) The registrant may submit letters of reference and other 
supporting statements of friends, relatives and acquaintances to 
corroborate the sincerity of his claim, although such supplemental 
documentation is not essential to approval of his claim. A finding of 
insincerity based on these letters or supporting statements must be 
carefully explained in the board's decision, specific mention being made 
of the particular material relied upon for denial of classification in 
Class 1-A-0 or Class 1-0.

[47 FR 4655, Feb. 1, 1982, as amended at 52 FR 24457, July 1, 1987; 60 
FR 13908, Mar. 15, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 1636.9  Types of decisions.

    The following are the types of decisions which may be made by a 
board when a claim for classification in Class 1-A-0 or Class 1-0 has 
been considered.
    (a) Decision to grant a claim for classification in Class 1-A-0 or 
Class 1-0, as requested, based on a determination that the truth or 
sincerity of the registrant's claim is not refuted by any information 
contained in the registrant's file or obtained during his personal 
appearance.
    (b) Decision to deny a claim for classification in Class 1-A-0 or 
Class 1-0 based on all information before the board, and a finding that 
such information fails to meet the tests specified in Sec. 1636.3 or 
1636.4 of this part. If supported by information contained in the 
registrant's file or obtained during his personal appearance the board 
may find that the facts presented by the registrant in support of his 
claim are untrue.

[47 FR 4655, Feb. 1, 1982, as amended at 53 FR 25328, July 6, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 1636.10  Statement of reasons for denial.

    (a) Denial of a conscientious objector claim by a board must be 
accompanied by a statement specifying the reason(s) for such denial as 
prescribed in Secs. 1633.9, 1651.4 and 1653.3 of this chapter. The 
reason(s) must, in turn, be supported by evidence in the registrant's 
file.
    (b) If a board's denial is based on statements by the registrant or 
on a

[[Page 361]]

determination that the claim is inconsistent or insincere, this should 
be fully explained in the statement of reasons accompanying the denial.

statements, if made by the registrant's witnesses at his personal 
appearance.

<R05>
Sec. 1642.1  Purpose; definitions.

    (a) The provisions of this part govern the consideration of a claim 
by a registrant for classification in Class 3-A (Sec. 1630.30 of this 
chapter).
    (b) The following definitions apply to the interpretation of the 
provisions of this part.
    (1) The term dependent shall apply to the wife, child, parent, 
grandparent, brother or sister of a registrant.
    (2) The term child includes an unborn child, a stepchild, a foster 
child or a legally adopted child, who is legitimate or illegitimate, but 
shall not include any person 18 years of age or older unless he or she 
is physically or mentally handicapped.
    (3) The term parent shall include any person who has stood in the 
place of a parent to the registrant for at least 5 years preceding the 
18th anniversary of the registrant's date of birth and is now supported 
in good faith by the registrant.
    (4) The term brother or sister shall include a person having one or 
both parents in common with the registrant, who is either under 18 years 
of age or is physically or mentally handicapped.
    (5) The term support includes but is not limited to financial 
assistance.
    (6) Hardship is the unreasonable deprivation of a dependent of the 
financial assistance, personal care or companionship furnished by the 
registrant when that deprivation would be caused by the registrant's 
induction.


<R05>
Sec. 1642.2  The claim for classification in Class 3-A.

    A claim for classification in Class 3-A must be made by the 
registrant in writing. Prior to the consideration of the claim, the 
registrant shall submit supporting documentation, such documents being 
placed in his file folder.


<R05>
Sec. 1642.3  Basis for classification in Class 3-A.

    (a) In Class 3-A shall be placed any registrant:
    (1) Whose induction would result in extreme hardship to his wife 
when she alone is dependent upon him for support; or
    (2) Whose deferment is advisable because his child(ren), parent(s), 
grandparent(s), brother(s), or sister(s) is dependent upon him for 
support; or
    (3) Whose deferment is advisable because his wife and child(ren), 
parent(s), grandparent(s), brother(s), or sister(s) are dependent upon 
him for support.
    (b) In its consideration of a claim by a registrant for 
classification in Class 3-A, the board will first determine whether the 
registrant's wife, child(ren), parent(s), grandparent(s), brother(s), or 
sister(s) is dependent upon the registrant for support. Support may be 
financial assistance, personal care or companionship. If financial 
assistance is the basis of support, the registrant's contribution must 
be a substantial portion of the necessities of the dependent. Under most 
circumstances 40 to 50% of the cost of the necessities may be considered 
substantial. If that determination is affirmative, the board will 
determine whether the registrant's induction would result in extreme 
hardship to his wife when she is the only dependent, or whether the 
registrant's deferment is advisable because his child(ren), parent(s), 
grandparent(s), brother(s), or sister(s) is dependent upon him for 
support, or because his wife and his child(ren), parent(s), 
grandparent(s), brother(s), or sister(s) are dependent upon him for 
support. A deferment is advisable whenever the registrant's induction 
would result in hardship to his dependents.
    (c) The registrant's classification shall be determined on the basis 
of the written information in his file, oral statements, if made by the 
registrant at his personal appearance before a board, and oral 
statements, if made by the registrant's witnesses at his personal 
appearances.

[52 FR 24458, July 1, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 1642.4  Ineligibility for Class 3-A.

    (a) A registrant is ineligible for Class 3-A when:
    (1) He assumed an obligation to his dependents specifically for the 
purpose of evading training and service; or
    (2) He acquired excessive financial obligations primarily to 
establish his dependency claim; or

[[Page 364]]

    (3) His dependents would not be deprived of reasonable support if 
the registrant is inducted; or
    (4) There are other persons willing and able to assume the support 
of his dependents; or
    (5) The dependents would suffer only normal anguish of separation 
from the registrant if he is inducted; or
    (6) The hardship to a dependent is based solely on financial 
conditions and can be removed by payment and allowances which are 
payable by the United States to the dependents of persons who are 
serving in the Armed Forces; or
    (7) The hardship to the dependent is based upon considerations that 
can be eliminated by payments and allowances which are payable by the 
United States to the dependents of persons who are serving in the Armed 
Forces.
    (b) [Reserved]

<R05>
Sec. 1642.5  Impartiality.

    (a) Boards shall consider all questions in a claim for 
classification in Class 3-A with equal consideration of race, creed, 
color, sex or ethnic background.
    (b) Boards may not give precedence to one type of dependency 
hardship over another.

<R05>
Sec. 1642.6  Considerations relevant to granting or denying claims for Class 3-A.

    (a) The registrant's claim for Class 3-A must include the following, 
with documentation, as applicable:
    (1) Registrant's and his dependent's marital status;
    (2) Physician's statement concerning any dependent who is physically 
or mentally handicapped;
    (3) Employment status of registrant and his dependents; and
    (b) Each case must be weighed carefully and decided on its own 
merits.


<R05>
Sec. 1642.7  Types of decisions.

    (a) A board may grant a classification into Class 3-A for such 
period of time it deems appropriate but in no event the period exceed 
one year.
    (b) Upon the expiration of a 3-A classification a board shall review 
any request for an extension of the classification as if it were the 
first request for that classification, and the fact that the registrant 
was placed in Class 3-A under apparently similar circumstances will not 
be a factor in the decision of the board. This section does not relieve 
a registrant from his duties under Sec. 1621.1 of this chapter.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) A board shall deny a claim for Class 3-A when the evidence fails 
to meet the criteria established in this part.

Sec. 1642.8  Statement of reason for denial.

    (a) Denial of a claim for Class 3-A by a board must be accompanied 
by a statement specifying the reason(s) for such denial as prescribed in 
Secs. 1633.9, 1651.4 and 1653.3 of this chapter. The reason must in 
turn, be supported by evidence in the registrant's file.
    (b) If a board's denial is based on statements by the registrant or 
his witnesses at a personal appearance, this must be fully explained in 
the statement of reasons accompanying the denial.

    (a) The provisions of this part govern the consideration of a claim 
by a registrant for classification in Class 4-D (Sec. 1630.43 of this

[[Page 365]]

teaches the principles of religion; and
    (v) Who administers the ordinances of public worship as embodied in

    (2) The term regular minister of religion means one who as his 
customary vocation preaches and teaches the principles of religion of a

without having been formally ordained as a minister of religion, and who 
is recognized by such church, sect, or organization as a regular

the principles of religion of a church, religious sect, or organization; 
or
    (ii) Any person who has been duly ordained a minister in accordance

    (b) Regular minister of religion.


<R05>

that:
    (a) He is not a regular minister or a duly ordained minister; or
    (b) He is a duly ordained minister of religion in accordance with 
the ceremonial rite or discipline of a church, religious sect or 
organization, but who does not regularly as his bona fide vocation, 
teach and preach the principles of religion and administer the 
ordinances of public worship, as embodied in the creed or principles of

<R05>
Sec. 1645.5  Impartiality.

<R05>
Sec. 1645.6  Considerations relevant to granting or denying a claim for Class 4-D.

    (a) The board shall first determine whether the registrant is 
requesting classification in Class 4-D because he is a regular minister 
of religion or because he is a duly ordained minister of religion.
    (b) If the registrant claims to be a duly ordained minister of 
religion, the board will:

[[Page 366]]

    (1) Determine whether the registrant has been ordained, in 
accordance with the ceremonial ritual or discipline of a church, 
religious sect, or organization established on the basis of a community 
of faith and belief, doctrines and practices of religious character, to 
preach and teach the doctrines of such church, sect, or organization and 
to administer the rites and ceremonies thereof in public worship; and
    (2) Determine whether the registrant as his regular, customary, and 
bona fide vocation, preaches and teaches the principles of religion and 
administers the ordinances of public worship, as embodied in the creed 
or principles of the church, sect, or organization by which the 
registrant was ordained.
    (c) If the registrant claims to be a regular minister of religion, 
the board will:
    (1) Determine whether the registrant as his customary and regular 
calling or customary and regular full-time profession, preaches and 
teaches the principles of religion of a church, a religious sect, or 
organization of which he is a member, without having been formally 
ordained as a minister of religion; and
    (2) Determine whether the registrant is recognized by such church, 
sect, or organization as a regular minister.
    (d) If the board determines that the registrant is a regular 
minister of religion or duly ordained minister of religion he shall be 
classified in Class 4-D.


<R05>
Sec. 1645.7  Evaluation of claim.

    (a) In evaluating a claim for classification in Class 4-D, the board 
will not consider:
    (1) The training or abilities of the registrant for duty as a 
minister; or
    (2) The motive or sincerity of the registrant in serving as a 
minister.
    (b) The board should be careful to ascertain the actual duties and 
functions of registrants seeking classification in Class 4-D, such 
classification being appropriate only for leaders of the various 
religious groups, not granted to members of such groups generally.
    (c) Preaching and teaching the principles of one's sect, if 
performed part-time or half-time, occasionally or irregularly, are 
insufficient to establish eligiblity for Class 4-D. These activities 
must be regularly performed and must comprise the registrant's regular 
calling or full-time profession. The mere fact of some secular 
employment on the part of a registrant requesting classification in 
Class 4-D does not in itself make him ineligible for that class.
    (d) The board should request the registrant to furnish any 
additional information that it believes will be of assistance in the 
consideration of the registrant's claim for classification in Class 4-D.


<R05>
Sec. 1645.8  Types of decisions.

    (a) If the board determines that the registrant is a regular 
minister of religion or a duly ordained minister of religion, he shall 
be classified in Class 4-D.
    (b) The board will deny a claim for Class 4-D when the evidence 
fails to meet the criteria established in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1645.9  Statement of reason for denial.

    (a) Denial of a 4-D claim by a board must be accompanied by a 
statement specifying the reason(s) for such denial as prescribed in 
Secs. 1633.9, 1651.4 and 1653.3 of this chapter. The reason(s) must in 
turn, be supported by evidence in the registrant's file.
    (b) If the board's denial is based on statements by the registrant 
or his witnesses at a personal appearance or on documentation in the 
registrant's file, such basis will be fully explained in the statement 
of reasons accompanying the denial.

accord with Sec. 1648.4 before his claim is considered.
    (b) A registrant who has filed a claim for classification in Class 
2-D, Class 3-A, or Class 4-D, shall, upon his written request, be 
afforded an opportunity to appear in person before the board before his 
claim for classification is considered.

<R05>
Sec. 1648.4  Appointment for personal appearances.

    (a) Not less than 10 days (unless the registrant requests an earlier 
appointment) in advance of the meeting at which he may appear, the 
registrant shall be informed of the time and place of such meeting and 
that he may present evidence, including witnesses, bearing on his 
classification.
    (b) Should the registrant who has filed a claim for classification 
in Class 1-A-O or Class 1-O fail to appear at his scheduled personal 
appearance, the board will not consider his claim for classification in 
Class 1-A-O or Class 1-O. The board shall consider any written 
explanation of such failure that has been filed within 5 days (or 
extension thereof granted by the board) after such failure to appear. It 
the board determines that the registrant's failure to appear was for 
good cause it shall reschedule the registrant's personal appearance. If 
the board does not receive a timely written explanation of the 
registrant's failure to appear for his scheduled personal appearance or 
if the board determines that the registrant's failure to appear was not 
for good cause, the registrant will be deemed to have abandoned his 
claim for Class 1-A-O or 1-O and will be notified that his claim will 
not be considered. The board will notify the registrant in writing of 
its action under this paragraph.
    (c) Whenever a registrant who has filed a claim for a class other 
than Class 1-A-0 or Class 1-0 for whom a personal appearance has been 
scheduled, fails to appear in accord with such schedule, the board shall 
consider any written explanation of such failure that has been filed 
within 5 days (or extension thereof granted by the board) after such 
failure to appear. If the board determines that the registrant's failure 
to appear was for good cause it shall reschedule the registrant's 
personal appearance. If the board does not receive a timely written 
explanation of the registrant's failure to appear for his scheduled 
personal appearance or if the board determines that the registrant's 
failure to appear was not for good cause, the registrant will be deemed 
to have abandoned his request for personal appearance and the board will 
proceed to classify him on the basis of the material in his file. The 
board will notify the registrant in writing of its action under this 
paragraph.

[47 FR 4661, Feb. 1, 1982, as amended at 52 FR 24458, July 1, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 1648.5  Procedures during personal appearance before the local board.

    (a) A quorum of the prescribed membership of a board shall be 
present during all personal appearances. Only those members of the board 
before whom the registrant appears shall classify him.
    (b) At any such appearance, the registrant may present evidence, 
including witnesses; discuss his classification; direct attention to any 
information in his file; and present such further information as he 
believes will assist the board in determing his proper classification. 
The information furnished should be as concise as possible.

[[Page 368]]

    (c) The registrant may present the testimony of not more than three 
witnesses unless it is the judgment of the board that the testimony of 
additional witnesses is warranted. The registrant may summarize in 
writing, the oral information that he or his witnesses presented. Such 
summary shall be placed in the registrant's file.
    (d) A summary will be made of all oral testimony given by the 
registrant and his witnesses at his personal appearance and such summary 
shall be placed in the registrant's file.
    (e) If the registrant does not speak English adequately he may 
appear with a person to act as interpreter for him. The interpreter 
shall be sworn in accordance with Sec. 1605.81(b). Such interpreter will 
not be deemed to be a witness unless he testifies in behalf of the 
registrant.
    (f) During the personal appearance only the registrant or his 
witnesses may address the board or respond to questions of the board and 
only the registrant and the board will be allowed to address questions 
to witnesses. A registrant may, however, be accompanied by an advisor of 
his choosing and may confer with the advisor before responding to an 
inquiry or statement by the board: Provided, That, those conferences do 
not substantially interfere with or unreasonably delay the orderly 
process of the personal appearance.
    (g) If, in the opinion of the board, the informal, administrative 
nature of the personal appearance is unduly disrupted by the presence of 
an advisor, the board chairman may require the advisor to leave the 
hearing room. In such case, the board chairman shall put a statement of 
reasons for his action in the registrant's file.
    (h) The making of verbatim transcripts, and the using of cameras or 
other recording devices are prohibited in proceedings before the board. 
This does not prevent the registrant or Selective Service from making a 
written summary of all testimony presented.
    (i) Proceedings before the local boards shall be open to the public 
only upon the request of or with the permission of the registrant. The

appeal period prescribed in Sec. 1651.2.
    (b) The registrant may appeal to a district appeal board the denial

[47 FR 4662, Feb. 1, 1982, as amended at 52 FR 24459, July 1, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 1651.2  Time within which registrants may appeal.

    The registrant who wishes to appeal must file the appeal with his 
local board within 15 days after the date he is mailed a notice of 
classification action. The registrant who wishes a personal appearance 
before the district appeal board must file the request at the same time 
he files the appeal.


<R05>
Sec. 1651.3  Procedures for taking an appeal.

    (a) When the Director of Selective Service appeals to a district 
appeal board he shall place in the registrant's file a written statement 
of his reasons for taking such appeal. When an appeal is taken by the 
Director, the registrant will be notified that the appeal has been 
taken, the reason therefor, and that the registrant may appear in person 
before the appeal board in accord with Sec. 1651.4(e).
    (b) The registrant may appeal the classification action of the local 
board by filing with it a written notice of appeal. The registrant's 
notice of appeal need not be in a particular form but must include the 
name of the registrant and his request. Any notice shall be liberally 
construed so as to permit the appeal.
    (c) The registrant may also request an opportunity to appear in 
person before the district appeal board and such appeal will be 
considered by the board having jurisdiction over the local board which 
last classified him.
    (d) The registrant may attach to his appeal a statement specifying 
the reasons he believes the classification action that he is appealing 
is inappropriate, directing attention to any information in his file, 
and setting out any information relevant to his claim.


<R05>
Sec. 1651.4  Review by district appeal board.

    (a) An appeal to the district appeal board is determined by the 
classification of the registrant in a class other than 1-A or by its 
refusal to take such action. No action shall be taken by the board in 
the absence of a quorum of its prescribed membership.
    (b) Prior to the adjudication of an appeal, the clerk of the appeal 
board or any compensated employee authorized to perform the 
administrative duties of the board shall review the file to insure that 
no procedural errors have occurred during the history of the current 
claim. Files containing procedural errors will be returned to the local 
board that classified the registrant for any additional processing 
necessary to correct such errors.
    (c) Files containing procedural errors that were not detected during 
the initial screening but which subsequently surfaced during processing 
by the appeal board, will be acted on and the board will take such 
action necessary to correct the errors and process the appeal to 
completion.
    (d) A board shall consider appeals in the order of their having been 
filed.
    (e) Upon receipt of the registrant's file, a board shall ascertain 
whether the registrant has requested a personal appearance before the 
board. If no such request has been made, the board may classify the 
registrant on the bases of the material in his file.
    (f) Not less than 10 days (unless the registrant requests an earlier 
appointment) in advance of the meeting at which his classification will 
be considered, the board shall inform any registrant with respect to 
whom the Director of Selective Service has appealed or who has requested 
a personal appearance that he may appear at such meeting and present 
written evidence bearing on his classification.

[[Page 370]]

    (g) During the personal appearance, only the registrant may address 
the board or respond to questions of the board. The registrant will not 
be permitted to present witnesses at the personal appearance before the 
district appeal board. A registrant may, however, be accompanied by an 
advisor of his choosing and may confer with the advisor before 
responding to an inquiry or statement by the board: Provided, That, 
those conferences do not substantially interfere with or unreasonably 
delay the orderly process of the personal appearance.
    (h) If, in the opinion of the board, the informal, administrative 
nature of the hearing is unduly disrupted by the presence of an advisor 
during the personal appearance, the board chairman may require the 
advisor to leave the hearing room. In such case, the board chairman 
shall put a statement of reasons for his action in the registrant's 
file.
    (i) Whenever a registrant who has filed a claim for whom a personal 
appearance has been scheduled, fails to appear in accord with such 
schedule, the board shall consider any written explanation of such 
failure that has been filed within 5 days (or extension thereof granted 
by the board) after such failure to appear. If the board determines that 
the registrant's failure to appear was for good cause it shall 
reschedule the registrant's personal appearance. If the board does not 
receive a timely written explanation of the registrant's failure to 
appear for his scheduled personal appearance or if the board determines 
that the registrant's failure to appear was not for good cause, the 
registrant will be deemed to have abandoned his request for personal 
appearance and he will be classified on the basis of the material in his 
file. The board will notify the registrant in writing of its action 
under this paragraph.
    (j) A quorum of the prescribed membership of a board shall be 
present during all personal appearances. Only those members of the board 
before whom the registrant appears shall classify him.
    (k) At any personal appearance, the registrant may: Present his oral 
testimony; point out the class or classes in which he thinks he should 
have been placed; and direct attention to any information in his file. 
The registrant may present any additional written information he 
believes will assist the board in determining his proper classification. 
The information furnished should be as concise as possible.
    (l) The registrant may summarize in writing the oral information 
that he presented. Such summary shall be placed in the registrant's 
file.
    (m) A summary will be made of oral testimony given by the registrant 
at his personal appearance and such summary shall be placed in the 
registrant's file.
    (n) A district appeal board shall classify a registrant who has 
requested a personal appearance after he:
    (1) Has appeared before the board; or
    (2) Has withdrawn his request to appear; or
    (3) Has abandoned his right to an opportunity to appear; or
    (4) Has failed to appear.
    (o) In considering a registrant's appeal, a board shall not receive 
or consider any information other than the following:
    (1) Information contained in the registrant's file; and
    (2) Oral statements by the registrant during the registrant's 
personal appearance; and
    (3) Written evidence submitted by the registrant to the board during 
his personal appearance.
    (p) In the event a board classifies the registrant in a class other 
than that which he requested, it shall record its reasons therefor in 
the file.
    (q) The making of verbatim transcripts, and the using of cameras or 
other recording devices are prohibited in proceedings before the board. 
This does not prevent the registrant or Selective Service from making a 
written summary of his testimony.
    (r) Proceedings before the appeal boards shall be open to the public 
only upon the request of or with the permission of the registrant. The 
board chairman may limit the number of persons attending the hearing in 
order to maintain order. If during the hearing the

[[Page 371]]

presence of non-participants in the proceedings becomes disruptive the 
chairman may close the hearing.

<R05>
Sec. 1653.3  Review by the National Appeal Board.

    (a) An appeal to the President is determined by the National Appeal

    (h) During the personal appearance only the registrant may address 
the board or respond to questions of the board. The registrant will not 
be permitted to present witnesses at the personal appearance before the 
National Appeal Board. A registrant may, however, be accompanied by an 
advisor of his choosing and may confer with the advisor before 
responding to an inquiry or statement by the board: Provided, That,

appearance and the board will proceed to classify him on the basis of 
the material in his file. The registrant will be notified in writing of 
its action under this paragraph.

date scheduled without having issued to him a new order to report for 
alternative service.

<R05>
Sec. 1656.7  Employer responsibilities.

    Employers participating in the Alternative Service Program are 
responsible for:

[[Page 377]]

    (a) Complying with the employment agreement with Selective Service;
    (b) Providing a clear statement of duties, responsibilities, 
compensation and employee benefits to the ASW;
    (c) Providing full-time employment for ASWs;

    (e) Providing adequate supervision of ASWs in their employ; and
    (f) Providing nondiscriminatory treatment of ASWs in their employ.


<R05>
Sec. 1656.8  Employment agreements.

    (a) Nature of Agreement. Before any ASW is placed with an employer, 
Selective Service and the employer shall enter into an employment 
agreement that specifies their respective duties and responsibilities 
under the Alternative Service Program.
    (b) Restrictions on Selective Service. The Selective Service System 
shall not act in any controversy involving ASW's wages, hours and 
working conditions except to the extent any of these subjects is 
specifically covered in Sec. 1656.7, Sec. 1656.9, or the employment 
agreement between Selective Service and the employer.
    (c) Investigating and Negotiating. Whenever there is evidence that 
an employer appears to be in violation of Sec. 1656.7, Selective Service 
will investigate the matter. If the investigation produces substantial 
evidence of violations of Sec. 1656.7, Selective Service will resolve 
the matter.
    (d) Termination of Employment Agreement. If a resolution of a 
dispute cannot be reached by negotiation within a reasonable time, the 
Selective Service System shall terminate the employment agreement and 
shall reassign the ASW.


<R05>
Sec. 1656.9  Alternative service worker's responsibilities.

    (a) A registrant classified in Class 1-W is required to comply with 
all orders issued under this part.
    (b) A registrant classified in Class 1-W is liable to perform 24 
months of creditable time toward completion of Alternative Service, 
unless released earlier by the Director.


<R05>
Sec. 1656.10  Job placement.

    (a) Selective Service will maintain a job bank for the exclusive 
purpose of placing ASWs in alternative service jobs.
    (b) An ASW who has identified his own job in accordance with 
Sec. 1656.5(e) of this part may be assigned by the ASO in that job 
pending review of the job by Selective Service. If the job is then 
approved as Alternative Service Work in accordance with Sec. 1656.5(a) 
the ASW will receive creditable time beginning with the date he was 
placed on the job by Selective Service. If the job is not approved he 
will not receive creditable time and will be placed by Selective Service 
in a position approved for Alternative Service Work. Selective Service 
must review the job within 30 calendar days of the time it assigned the 
ASW to begin work. If the elapsed time from date of placement to the 
date of Selective Service review exceeds 30 days, the ASW will receive 
creditable time from the date of placement regardless of the final 
determination of employer eligibility made by Selective Service. If the 
placement is ultimately determined to be inappropriate for Alternative 
Service the ASW will be reassigned in accordance with Sec. 1656.12.
    (c) In making job interview referrals and in making assignments of 
ASWs to jobs, Selective Service will consider the compatibility of the 
ASW's skills, work experience, and preferences with the qualification 
criteria for the job.
    (d) When An ASW is hired, the ASO will issue a Job Placement Order 
specifying the employer, the time, date and place to report for his 
alternative service work.

job within 30 calendar days after classification in Class 1-W.


<R05>
Sec. 1656.11  Job performance standards and sanctions.

    (a) Standards of Performance. An ASW is responsible for adhering to 
the standards of conduct, attitude, appearance and performance demanded 
by the employer of his other employees in similar jobs. If there are no 
other employees, the standards shall conform to

[[Page 378]]

those that are reasonable and customary in a similar job.
    (b) Failure to Perform. An ASW will be deemed to have failed to 
perform satisfactorily whenever:
    (1) He refuses to comply with an order of the Director issued under 
this part;
    (2) He refuses employment by an approved employer who agrees to hire 
him;
    (3) His employer terminates the ASW's employment because his 
conduct, attitude, appearance or performance violates reasonable 
employer standards; or
    (4) He quits or leaves his job without reasonable justification, and 
has not submitted an appeal of his job assignment to the Civil Review 
Board.
    (c) Sanctions for ASW's Failure to Perform. (1) The sanctions for 
failure to meet his Alternative Service obligation are job reassignment, 
loss of creditable time during such period and referral to the 
Department of Justice for failure to comply with the Military Selective 
Service Act.
    (2) Prior to invoking any of the sanctions discussed herein, the ASO 
will conduct a review as prescribed in Sec. 1656.17 of all allegations 
that an ASW has failed to perform pursuant to any of the provisions of 
Sec. 1656.11(b).


<R05>
Sec. 1656.12  Job reassignment.

    (a) Grounds for Reassignment. The Director may reassign an ASW 
whenever the Director determines that:
    (1) The job assignment violates the ASW's religious, moral or 
ethical beliefs or convictions as to participation in a war that led to 
his classification as a conscientious objector or violates 
Sec. 1656.5(a) of this part.
    (2) An ASW experiences a change in his mental or physical condition 
which renders him unfit or unable to continue performing satisfactorily 
in his assigned job;
    (3) An ASW's dependents incur a hardship which is not so severe as 
to justify a suspension of the Order to Perform Alternative Service 
under Sec. 1656.15;
    (4) The ASW's employer ceases to operate an approved program or 
activity;
    (5) The ASW's employer fails to comply with terms and conditions of 
these regulations or;
    (6) Continual and severe differences between the ASW's employer and 
ASW remain unresolved.
    (7) The sanctions authorized in Sec. 1656.11 should be applied.
    (b) Who May Request Reassignment. Any ASW may request reassignment 
to another job. An employer may request job reassignment of an ASW who 
is in his employ.
    (c) Method for Obtaining a Reassignment. All requests for 
reassignment must be in writing with the reasons specified. The request 
may be filed with the ASO of jurisdiction at any time during an ASW's 
alternative service employment. An ASW must continue in his assigned 
job, if available, until the request for assignment is approved.


<R05>
Sec. 1656.13  Review of alternative service job assignments.

    (a) Review of ASW job assignments will be accomplished in accordance 
with the provisions of this subsection.
    (b) Whenever the ASW believes that his job assignment violates his 
religious, moral or ethical beliefs or convictions as to participation 
in war that led to his classification as a conscientious objector or is 
in violation of the provisions of this part he may request a 
reassignment by the ASOM, as provided for in Sec. 1656.12.
    (c) The ASOM shall reassign the ASW if the ASOM concludes that the 
ASW's work assignment violates his religious, moral or ethical beliefs 
or convictions as to participation in war which led to his 
classification as a CO or is in violation of the provisions of this 
part.
    (d) If the ASOM does not reassign the ASW, the ASW may, within 15 
days after the date of mailing of the decision of the ASOM, request a 
review of his job assignment by a Civilian Review Board.
    (e) The Director shall establish a Civilian Review Board for each 
ASO in whose area ASW's are working. The Civilian Review Board shall 
consist of not less than three members who will serve without 
compensation. The Director may establish panels. No person will be 
appointed to a Civilian Review

[[Page 379]]

Board who would be ineligible for appointment to a District Appeal 
Board. A member of a Civilian Review Board would be disqualified in any 
case that a member of a District Appeal Board would be disqualified 
under the provisions of Sec. 1605.25(a), (b) of this chapter. Each 
Board, or panel thereof, shall elect a chairman and a vice-chairman at 
least every two years. A majority of the members of the Board when 
present at any meeting shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of 
business. A majority of the members present at any meeting at which a 
quorum is present shall decide any question. Every member, unless 
disqualified, shall vote on every question. In case of a tie vote on a 
question, the Board shall postpone action until the next meeting. If the 
question remains unresolved at the next meeting, the Director will 
transfer the case to another board. If, through death, resignation, or 
other causes, the membership of the Board falls below the prescribed 
number of members, the Board or panel shall continue to function, 
provided a quorum of the prescribed membership is present at each 
official meeting.
    (f) It shall be the function of the Civilian Review Board to 
determine whether or not an ASW's job assignment violates the ASW's 
religious, moral, or ethical beliefs of convictions as to participation 
in war which led to his classification as a conscientious objector or is 
in violation of the provisions Sec. 1656.5(a) of this part. In making 
the former determination, the Review Board must be convinced by the ASW 
that if the ASW performed the job, his convictions as to participation 
in war would be violated in a similar way as if the ASW had participated 
in war.
    (g) The Civilian Review Board may affirm the assignment or order the 
reassignment of the ASW in any matter considered by it.
    (h) Procedures of the Civilian Review Board are:
    (1) Appeals to the Board shall be in writing, stating as clearly as 
possible the ground for the appeal.
    (2) The ASW may appear before the Board at his request. He may not 
be represented by counsel or present witnesses. The ASOM or his 
representative may represent the Selective Service System at the hearing 
and present evidence.
    (3) The Board's determination will be based on all documents in the 
ASW's file folder and statements made at the hearing.
    (4) The decision of the Board will be binding only in the case 
before it. A decision of a Board will not be relied upon by a Board in 
any other case.
    (5) A decision of the Board is not subject to review within the 
Selective Service System.


<R05>
Sec. 1656.14  Postponement of reporting date.

    (a) General. The reporting date in any of the following orders may 
be postponed in accord with this section.
    (1) Report for Job Placement;
    (2) Report for a Job Interview; or
    (3) Report to an Employer to Commence Employment.
    (b) Requests for Postponement. A request for postponement of a 
reporting date specified in an order listed in paragraph (a) must be 
made in writing and filed prior to the reporting date with the office 
which issued the order. Such requests must include a statement of the 
nature of the emergency and the expected period of its duration.
    (c) Grounds for Postponement. An ASW may, upon presentation of the 
appropriate facts in his request, be granted a postponement based on one 
or more of the following conditions:
    (1) The death of a member of his immediate family;
    (2) An extreme emergency involving a member of his immediate family;
    (3) His serious illness or injury; or
    (4) An emergency condition directly affecting him which is beyond 
his control.
    (d) Basis for Considering Request. The ASW's eligibility for a 
postponement shall be determined by the office of jurisdiction based 
upon official documents and other written information contained in his 
file. Oral statements made by the ASW or made by another person in 
support of the ASW shall be reduced to writing and placed in the ASW's 
file.
    (e) Duration of Postponement. The initial postponement shall not 
exceed 60 days from the reporting date in the order. When necessary, the 
Director

[[Page 380]]

may grant one further postponement, but the total postponement period 
shall not exceed 90 days from the reporting date in the order invovled.
    (f) Termination of Postponement. (1) A postponement may be 
terminated by the Director for cause upon no less than ten days written 
notice to the ASW.
    (2) Any postponement shall be terminated when the basis for the 
postponement has ceased to exist.
    (3) It is the responsibility of the ASW promptly to notify in 
writing the office that granted the postponement whenever the basis for 
which his postponement was granted ceases to exist.
    (g) Effect of Postponement. A postponement of the reporting date in 
an order shall not render the order invalid, but shall only serve to 
postpone the date on which the ASW is to report. The ASW shall report at 
the expiration or termination of the postponement.
    (h) Religious Holiday. The Director may authorize a delay of 
reporting under any of the orders specified for an ASW whose date to 
report conflicts with a religious holiday historically observed by a 
recognized church, religious sect or religious organization of which he 
is a member. Any ASW so delayed shall report on the next business day 
following the religious holiday.


<R05>
Sec. 1656.15  Suspension of order to perform alternative service because of hardship to dependents.

    (a) Whenever, after an ASW has begun work, a condition develops that 
results in hardship to his dependent as contemplated by Sec. 1630.30(a) 
of this chapter which cannot be alleviated by his reassignment under 
Sec. 1656.12 (a)(3) of this part, the ASW may request a suspension of 
Order to Perform Alternative Service. If the local board that ordered 
the ASW to report for Alternative Service determines he would be 
entitled to classification in Class 3-A, assuming that the ASW were 
eligible to file a claim for that class, further compliance with his 
order shall be suspended for a period not to exceed 365 days, as the 
local board specifies. Extensions of not more than 365 days each may be 
granted by the local board so long as the hardship continues until the 
ASW's liability for training and service under the Military Selective 
Service Act terminates.
    (b) An ASW may file a request for the suspension of his Order to 
Perform Alternative Service with the ASO. This request must be in 
writing, state as clearly as possible the basis for the request, and be 
signed and dated by the ASW. The ASW must continue working in his 
assigned job until his request for the suspension of his Order to 
Perform Alternative Service has been approved.
    (c) Local boards shall follow the procedures established in parts 
1642 and 1648 of this chapter to the extent they are applicable in 
considering a request for the suspension of an Order to Perform 
Alternative Service.


<R05>

    (a) General Rule of Service Completion. An ASW will not be released 
from alternative service prior to completion of 24 months of creditable 
service unless granted an early release.
    (b) Reasons For Early Release. The Director may authorize the early 
release of an ASW whenever the ASO determines that the ASW:
    (1) Has failed to meet the performance standards of available 
alternative service employment because of physical, mental or moral 
reasons;
    (2) No longer meets the physical, mental or moral standards that are 
required for retention in the Armed Forces based on a physical or mental

school and scheduled to enter within 30 days prior to the scheduled 
completion of his alternative service obligation;

months. Such early release shall not occur more than 30 days before the 
scheduled completion of his alternative service obligation; or
    (5) Has enlisted in or has been inducted into the Armed Forces of 
the United States.
    (c) Reclassification and Records. Upon granting an early release to 
an ASW,

accordance with Sec. 1656.19 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1656.17  Administrative complaint process.

    (a) Whenever the ASOM learns that the ASW may have failed to perform 
satisfactorily his work (see Sec. 1656.11(b)) or he receives a complaint 
by an employer or an ASW involving the ASW's work other than matters 
described in Sec. 1656.8(b) of this part, he shall take necessary action 
to:
    (1) Interview, as appropriate, all parties concerned to obtain 
information relevant to the problems or complaints;
    (2) Place a written summary of each interview in the ASW's file and 
employer's file;
    (3) Inform the persons interviewed that they may prepare and submit 
to him within ten days after the interview their personal written 
statements concerning the problem;
    (4) Place such statements in the ASW's file; and
    (5) Resolve the matter.

to Sec. 1656.17(a)(5). Such request must be filed in writing with the 
ASO, for action by the State Director of Selective Service, within ten 
days after the date the notice of the decision is transmitted to the ASW 
and employer.


<R05>
Sec. 1656.18  Computation of creditable time.

    (a) Creditable time starts when the ASW begins work pursuant to an 
Order to Perform Alternative Service or 30 days after the issuance of 
such order, whichever occurs first. Creditable time will accumulate 
except for periods of:
    (1) Work of less than 35 hours a week or an employer's full-time 
work week whichever is greater;
    (2) Leaves of absence in a calendar year of more than 5 days in the 
aggregate granted by the employer to the ASW to attend to his personal 
affairs unless such absence is approved by the ASOM;
    (3) Time during which an ASW fails or neglects to perform 
satisfactorily his assigned Alternative Service;
    (4) Time during which the ASOM determines that work of the ASW is 
unsatisfactory because of his failure to comply with reasonable 
requirements of his employer;
    (5) Time during which the ASW is not employed in an approved job 
because of his own fault; or
    (6) Time during which the ASW is in a postponement period or his 
Order to Perform Alternative Service has been suspended.
    (b) Creditable time will be awarded for periods of travel, job 
placement and job interviews performed under orders issued by Selective 
Service. Creditable time may be awarded for normal employer leave 
periods.
    (c) Creditable time will be awarded to an ASW for the time lost 
after he leaves his job assignment following his request for 
reassignment on the basis of Sec. 1656.13(b) of this part until he is 
reassigned pursuant to Sec. 1656.13 (c) or (g) of this part. Creditable 
time for the corresponding period will be lost if neither the ASOM nor 
the Civilian Review Board orders the ASW's reassignment on the basis of 
Sec. 1656.12(a)(1) of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1656.19  Completion of alternative service.

    Upon completion of 24 months of creditable time served in 
alternative service or when released early in accordance with 
Sec. 1656.16(b) (3) or (4):
    (a) The ASW shall be released from the Alternative Service Program; 
and
    (b) The Director shall issue to the ASW a Certificate of Completion 
and the registrant shall be reclassified in Class 4-W in accordance with 
Sec. 1630.47 of this chapter, and

jurisdiction after the ASW has completed his obligation or has been 
separated from the Alternative Service Program for any reason.


<R05>
Sec. 1656.20  Expenses for emergency medical care.

    (a) Claims for payment of actual and reasonable expenses for 
emergency medical care, including hospitalization, of ASWs who suffer 
illness or injury, and the transportation and burial of the remains of 
ASWs who suffer

[[Page 382]]

death as a direct result of such illness or injury will be paid in 
accordance with the provisions of this section.
    (b) The term ``emergency medical care, including hospitalization'', 
as used in this section, means such medical care or hospitalization that 
normally must be rendered promptly after occurrence of the illness or 
injury necessitating such treatment. Discharge by a physician or 
facility subsequent to such medical care or hospitalization shall 
terminate the period of emergency.
    (c) Claims will be considered only for expenses:
    (1) For which only the ASW is liable and for which there is no legal 
liability for his reimbursement except in accord with the provisions of 
this section; and
    (2) That are incurred as a result of illness or injury that occurs 
while the ASW is acting in accord with orders of Selective Service to 
engage in travel or perform work for his Alternative Service employer.
    (d) No claim shall be allowed in any case in which the Director 
determines that the injury, illness, or death occurred because of the 
negligence or misconduct of the ASW.
    (e) No claim shall be paid unless it is presented to the Director 
within one year after the date on which the expense was incurred.
    (f) Cost of emergency medical care including hospitalization greater 
than usual and customary fees for service established by the Social 
Security Administration, will prima facie be considered unreasonable. 
Payment for burial expenses shall not exceed the maximum that the 
Administrator of Veteran's Affairs may pay under the provisions of 38 
U.S.C. 902(a) in any one case.
    (g) Payment of claims when allowed shall be made only directly to 
the ASW or his estate unless written authorization of the ASW or the 
personal representative of his estate has been received to pay another 
person.

Sec. 1659.1  Claims.

    (a) Claims for payment of actual and reasonable expenses of:
    (1) Emergency medical care, including hospitalization of registrants 
who suffer illness or injury; and
    (2) The transportation and burial of the remains of registrants who 
suffer death while acting under orders issued by or under the authority

forth in paragraph (a) of this section shall be presented to the 
Director of Selective Service.
    (c)(1) The term emergency medical care, including hospitalization, 
as used in this section, shall be construed to mean such medical care or 
hospitalization that normally must be rendered promptly after an 
occurrence of illness or injury. Discharge by a physician or facility 
subsequent to such medical care or hospitalization shall be 
justification to terminate the period of emergency.
    (2) The death of a registrant shall be deemed to have occurred while 
acting under orders issued by or under the authority of the Director of 
Selective Service if it results directly from an illness or injury 
suffered by the registrant while so acting and occurs prior to the 
completion of an emergency medical care, including hospitalization, 
occasioned by such illness or injury.
    (d) No such claim shall be paid unless it is presented within the 
period of one year from the date on which the expenses were incurred.
    (e) No such claim shall be allowed in case it is determined that the 
cause of injury, illness, or death was due to negligence or misconduct 
of the registrant.
    (f) Burial expenses shall not exceed the maximum prescribed in 
Section 11 of the Military Selective Service Act in any one case.
    (g) Payment of such claims when allowed shall be made only:
    (1) Directly to the person or facility with which the expenses were 
incurred; or
    (2) By reimbursement to the registrant, a relative of the 
registrant, or the legal representative of the registrant's estate, for 
original payment of such expenses.

<R05>
Sec. 1662.1  Applicability of this part.

    The provisions of this part prescribe the procedures for requests 
for information under 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended (Freedom of Information 
Act).


<R05>
Sec. 1662.2  Procedure for requesting information.

    Requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) 
shall be in writing and should be addressed to the Director, Selective 
Service System, ATTN: Records Manager, Washington, DC 20435.


<R05>
Sec. 1662.3  Identification of information requested.

    Any person who requests information under FOIA shall provide a 
reasonably specific description of the information sought so that it may 
be located without undue search. If the description is not sufficient, 
the records manager will notify the requester and, to the extent 
possible, indicate the additional information required. Every reasonable 
effort shall be made to assist a requester in the identification and 
location of the record or records sought.


<R05>
Sec. 1662.4  Consideration of requests for information.

    (a) Upon receipt of any request for information or records, the 
records manager will determine within 10 days (excepting Saturdays, 
Sundays, and legal federal holidays) whether it is appropriate to grant 
the request and will immediately provide written notification to the 
person making the request. If the request is denied, the written 
notification to the person making the request will include the reasons 
therefor and a notice that an appeal may be lodged with the Director of 
Selective Service.
    (b) Appeals shall be in writing and addressed to the Director of 
Selective Service at the address specified in Sec. 1662.2 of this part. 
The appeal shall include a statement explaining the basis for the 
appeal. Determinations of appeals will be in writing and signed by the 
Director, or his designee, within 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, 
and legal federal holidays). If, on appeal, the denial is in whole or in 
part upheld, the written determination will include the reasons therefor 
and also contain a notification of the provisions for judicial review.


<R05>
Sec. 1662.5  Inspection, copying, and obtaining copies.

    When a request for information has been approved in accord with 
Sec. 1662.4, the person making the request may make an appointment to 
inspect or copy the materials requested during regular business hours by 
writing or telephoning the records manager at the address listed in 
Sec. 1662.2. Such materials may be copied manually without charge, and 
reasonable facilities will be made available for that purpose. Also, 
copies of individual pages of such materials will be made available as 
specified in Sec. 1662.6; however, the right is reserved to limit to a 
reasonable quantity the copies of such materials which may be made 
available in this manner.


<R05>
Sec. 1662.6  Fee schedule; waiver of fees.

    (a) Definitions--For the purposes of this section:
    (1) Direct costs mean those expenditures which the Selective Service 
System (SSS) actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in 
the case of commercial requesters, reviewing) documents to respond to a 
FOIA request. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the 
employee performing work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 
percent of the rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating 
duplicating machinery. Not included in direct costs are overhead 
expenses such as costs of space, and heating or lighting the facility in 
which the records are stored.
    (2) The term search includes all time spent looking for material 
that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line 
identification of material within documents. Search should be 
distinguished from review of material in order to determine whether the 
material is exempt from disclosure (see paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section). Searches may be done manually or by computer using existing 
programming.
    (3) Duplication refers to the process of making a copy of a document 
necessary to respond to an FOIA request. Such copies may take the form 
of paper copy, microform, audio-visual

[[Page 385]]

materials, or machine readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or 
disk), among others.
    (4) Review refers to the process of examining documents located in 
response to a commercial use request to determine whether any portion of 
any document located is permitted to be withheld. It also includes 
processing any documents for disclosure, e.g., doing all that is 
necessary to excise them and otherwise to prepare them for release. 
Review does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy 
issues regarding the application of exemptions.
    (5) The term `commercial use' request refers to a request from or on 
behalf of one who seeks information for the use or purpose that furthers 
the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the 
person on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a 
request properly belongs in this category the agency must determine the 
use to which a requester will put the documents requested. Moreover 
where there is reasonable cause to doubt the use to which a requester 
will put the records sought, or where that use is not clear from the 
request itself, the agency may seek additional clarification before 
assigning the request to a specific category.
    (6) The term educational institution refers to a preschool, a public 
or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate 
higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an 
institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational 
education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.
    (7) The term non-commercial scientific institution refers to an 
institution that is not operated on a commercial basis as that term is 
referenced in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, and which is operated 
solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of 
which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.
    (8) The term representative of the news media refers to any person 
actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to 
publish or broadcast news to the public. The term news means information 
that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the 
public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio 
stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of 
periodicals (but only in those instances when they can qualify as 
disseminators of news) who make their products available for purchase or 
subscription by the general public. These examples are not intended to 
be all-inclusive. Moreover, as traditional methods of news delivery 
evolve (e.g., electronic dissemination of newspapers through 
telecommunications services), such alternative media would be included 
in this category. In the case of freelance journalists, they may be 
regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a 
solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, even 
though not actually employed by it. A publication contract would be the 
clearest proof, but the agency may also look to the past publication 
record of a requester in making this determination.
    (b) Fees to be charged--categories of requesters. There are four 
categories of FOIA requesters: Commercial use requesters; education and 
non-commercial scientific institutions; representatives of the news 
media; and other requesters. The FOI Reform Act prescribes specific 
levels of fees for each of these categories:
    (1) Commercial use requesters. A request for documents for 
commercial use will be assessed charges which recover the full direct 
costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the 
records sought. Requesters must reasonably describe the record sought. 
Commercial use requesters are not entitled to two hours of free search 
time nor 100 free pages of reproduction of documents. The cost of 
searching for and reviewing records will be recovered even if there is 
ultimately no disclosure of records (see paragraph (c)(5) of this 
section).
    (2) Educational and non-commercial scientific institution 
requesters. Documents to requesters in this category will be provided 
for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 
pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, a requester must 
show

[[Page 386]]

that the request is being made as authorized by and under the auspices 
of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a 
commercial use, but are sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the 
request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if the 
request is from a non-commercial scientific institution) research. 
Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought.
    (3) Requesters who are representatives of the news media. Documents 
will be provided to requesters in this category for the cost of 
reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be 
eligible for inclusion in this category, a requester must meet the 
criteria in paragraph (a)(8) of this section, and his or her request 
must not be made for a commercial use. A request for records supporting 
the news dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered 
to be a request that is for a commercial use. Requesters must reasonably 
describe the records sought.
    (4) All other requesters. The agency will charge requesters who do 
not fit into any of the categories above fees which recover the full 
reasonable direct cost of searching for and reproducing records that are 
responsive to the request, except that the first 100 pages of 
reproduction and the first two hours of search time shall be furnished 
without charge. Moreover, requests from record subjects for records 
about themselves filed in the agency's systems of records will continue 
to be treated under the fee provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 which 
permit fees only for reproduction.
    (c) Assessment and collection of fees--(1) Aggregated requests. If 
the Records Manager reasonably believes that a requester or group of 
requesters is attempting to break a request down into a series of 
requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the Records 
Manager may aggregate any such requests accordingly.
    (2) Payment procedures--(i) Fee payment. The Records Manager may 
assume that a person requesting records pursuant to this part will pay 
the applicable fees, unless a request includes a limitation on fees to 
be paid or seeks a waiver or reduction of fees pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(4) of this section. Unless applicable fees are paid, the agency may 
use the authorities of the Debt Collection Act (Pub. L. 97-365), 
including disclosure to consumer reporting agencies and use of 
collection agencies, where appropriate, to encourage payment.
    (ii) Advance payment. (A) The Records Manager may require advance 
payment of any fee estimated to exceed $250. The Records Manager may 
also require full payment in advance where a requester has previously 
failed to pay fees in a timely fashion.
    (B) If the Records Manager estimates that the fees will likely 
exceed $25, he will notify the requester of the estimated amount of 
fees, unless the requester has indicated in advance his willingness to 
pay fees as high as those anticipated. Such a notice shall offer a 
requester the opportunity to confer with agency personnel with the 
object of reformulating the request to meet his or her needs at a lower 
cost.
    (3) Late charges. The Records Manager may assess interest charges 
when fee payment is not made within 30 days of the date on which the 
billing was sent. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in section 
3717 of title 31 U.S.C.A.
    (4) Waiver or reduction of fees--(i) Standards for determining 
waiver or reduction. The Records Manager shall grant a waiver or 
reduction of fees chargeable under this section where it is determined 
that disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it 
is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the 
operations or activities of the Selective Service System and is not 
primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The Records 
Manager shall also waive fees that are less than the average cost of 
collecting fees. In determining whether disclosure is in the public 
interest, the following factors may be considered:
    (A) The relation of the records to the operations or activities of 
the System;
    (B) The information value of the information to be disclosed;
    (C) Any contribution to an understanding of the subject by the 
general public likely to result from disclosure;

[[Page 387]]

    (D) The significance of that contribution to the public 
understanding of the subject;
    (E) The nature of the requester's personal interest, if any, in the 
disclosure requested; and
    (F) Whether the disclosure would be primarily in the requester's 
commercial interest.
    (ii) Contents of request for waiver. The Records Manager will 
normally deny a request for a waiver of fees that does not include:
    (A) A clear statement of the requester's interest in the requested 
documents;
    (B) The use proposed for the documents and whether the requester 
will derive income or other benefit from such use;
    (C) A statement of how the public will benefit from such use and 
from the release of the requested documents; and
    (D) If specialized use of the documents or information is 
contemplated, a statement of the requester's qualifications that are 
relevant to the specialized use.
    (iii) Burden of proof. In all cases the burden shall be on the 
requester to present evidence or information in support of a request for 
a waiver of fees.
    (5) Fees for nonproductive search. Fees for record searches and 
review may be charged even if not responsive documents are located or if 
the request is denied, particularly if the requester insists upon a 
search after being informed that it is likely to be nonproductive or 
that any records found are likely to be exempt from disclosure. The 
Records Manager shall apply the standards set out in paragraph (c)(4) of 
this section in determining whether to waive or reduce fees.

     Appendix A to Sec. 1662.6--Freedom of Information Fee Schedule

                              Duplication:

Photocopy, per standard page........................................$.10
Paper Copies of microfiche, per frame...............................$.10

                           Search and review:

    Salary of the employee (the basic rate of pay of the employee plus 
16 percent of that rate to cover benefits), performing the work of 
manual search and review.

                     Computer search and production:

    For each request the Records Manager will separately determine the 
actual direct costs of providing the service, including computer search 
time, tape or printout production, and operator salary.

                            Special services:

    The Records Manager may agree to provide and set fees to recover the 
costs of special services not covered by the Freedom of Information Act, 
such as certifying records or information, packaging and mailing 
records, and sending records by special methods such as express mail. 
The Records Manager may provide self-service photocopy machines and 
microfiche printers as a convenience to requesters and set separate 
perpage fees reflecting the cost of operation and maintenance of those 
machines.

                              Fee waivers:

    For qualifying educational and noncommercial scientific institution 
requesters and representatives of the news media the Records Manager 
will not assess fees for review time, for the first 100 pages of 
reproduction, or, when the records sought are reasonably described, for 
search time. For other noncommercial use requests no fees will be 
assessed for review time, for the first 100 pages of reproduction, or 
for the first two hours of search time.
    The Records Manager will waive in full fees that total less than 
$1.00 or that are less than the average cost of collecting fees.
    The Records Manager will also waive or reduce fees, upon proper 
request, if disclosure of the information is in the public interest 
because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding 
of the operations or activities of the System and is not primarily in 
the commercial interest of the requester.

<R05>
Sec. 1665.1  Rules for determining if an individual is the subject of a record.

    (a) Individuals desiring to know if a specific system of records 
maintained by the Selective Service System (SSS) contains a record 
pertaining to them should address their inquiries to the Director, 
Selective Service System, ATTN: Records Manager, Washington, DC 20435. 
The written inquiry should contain a specific reference to the system of 
records maintained by Selective Service listed in the SSS Notices of 
Systems of Records or it should describe the type of record in 
sufficient detail to reasonably identify the system of records. Notice 
of SSS Systems of Records subject to the Privacy Act is in the Federal 
Register and copies of the notices will be available upon request to the 
records manager. A compilation of such notices will also be made and 
published by the Office of Federal Register, in accord with section 5 
U.S.C. 552a(f).
    (b) At a minimum, the request should also contain sufficient 
information to identify the requester in order to allow SSS to determine 
if there is a record pertaining to that individual in a particular 
system of records. In instances when the information is insufficient to 
insure that disclosure will be to the individual to whom the information 
pertains, in view of the sensitivity of the information, SSS reserves 
the right to ask the requester for additional identifying information.
    (c) Ordinarily the requester will be informed whether the named 
system of records contains a record pertaining to the requester within 
10 days of receipt of such a request (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and 
legal federal holidays). Such a response will also contain or reference 
the procedures which must be followed by the individual making the 
request in order to gain access to the record.
    (d) Whenever a response cannot be made within the 10 days, the 
records manager will inform the requester of the reason for the delay 
and the date by which a response may be anticipated.


<R05>
Sec. 1665.2  Requests for access.

    (a) Requirement for written requests. Individuals desiring to gain 
access to a record pertaining to them in a system of records maintained 
by SSS must submit their request in writing in accord with the 
procedures set forth in paragraph (b) below.
    (b) Procedures--(1) Content of the request. (i) The request for 
access to a record in a system of records shall be addressed to the 
records manager, at the address cited above, and shall name the system 
of records or contain a description of such system of records. The 
request should state that the request is pursuant to the Privacy Act of 
1974. In the absence of specifying solely the Privacy Act of 1974 and, 
if the request may be processed under both the Freedom of Information 
Act and the Privacy Act and the request specifies both or neither act, 
the procedures under the Privacy Act of 1974 will be employed. The 
individual will be advised that the procedures of the Privacy Act will 
be utilized, of the existence and the general effect of the Freedom of 
Information Act, and the difference between procedures under the two 
acts (e.g. fees, time limits, access). The request should contain 
necessary information to verify the identity of the requester (see 
Sec. 1665.2(b)(2)(vi)). In addition, the requester should include any 
other information which may assist in the rapid identification of the 
record for which access is being requested (e.g., maiden name, dates of 
employment, etc.) as well as any other identifying information contained 
in and required by SSS Notice of Systems of Records.
    (ii) If the request for access follows a prior request under 
Sec. 1665.1, the same identifying information need not be included in 
the request for access if a reference is made to that prior 
correspondence, or a copy of the SSS response to that request is 
attached.
    (iii) If the individual specifically desires a copy of the record, 
the request should so specify.
    (2) SSS action on request. A request for access will ordinarily be 
answered within 10 days, except when the records manager determines that 
access cannot be afforded in that time, in which case the requester will 
be informed of the

[[Page 389]]

reason for the delay and an estimated date by which the request will be 
answered. Normally access will be granted within 30 days from the date 
the request was received by the Selective Service System. At a minimum, 
the answer to the request for access shall include the following:
    (i) A statement that there is a record as requested or a statement 
that there is not a record in the system of records maintained by SSS;
    (ii) A statement as to whether access will be granted only by 
providing copy of the record through the mail; or the address of the 
location and the date and time at which the record may be examined. In 
the event the requester is unable to meet the specified date and time, 
alternative arrangements may be made with the official specified in 
Sec. 1665.2(b)(1);
    (iii) A statement, when appropriate, that examination in person will 
be the sole means of granting access only when the records manager has 
determined that it would not unduly impede the requester's right of 
access;
    (iv) The amount of fees charged, if any (see Sec. 1665.6) (Fees are 
applicable only to requests for copies);
    (v) The name, title, and telephone number of the SSS official having 
operational control over the record; and
    (vi) The documentation required by SSS to verify the identity of the 
requester. At a minimum, SSS's verification standards include the 
following:
    (A) Current or former SSS employees. Current or former SSS employees 
requesting access to a record pertaining to them in a system of records 
maintained by SSS may, in addition to the other requirements of this 
section, and at the sole discretion of the official having operational 
control over the record, have his or her identity verified by visual 
observation. If the current or former SSS employee cannot be so 
identified by the official having operational control over the records, 
identification documentation will be required. Employee identification 
cards, annuitant identification, drivers licenses, or the employee copy 
of any official personnel document in the record are examples of 
acceptable identification validation.
    (B) Other than current or former SSS employees. Individuals other 
than current or former SSS employees requesting access to a record 
pertaining to them in a system of records maintained by SSS must produce 
identification documentation of the type described herein, prior to 
being granted access. The extent of the identification documentation 
required will depend on the type of record to be accessed. In most 
cases, identification verification will be accomplished by the 
presentation of two forms of identification. Any additional requirements 
are specified in the system notices published pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552a(e)(4).
    (C) Access granted by mail. For records to be accessed by mail, the 
records manager shall, to the extent possible, establish identity by a 
comparison of signatures in situations where the data in the record is 
not so sensitive that unauthorized access could cause harm or 
embarrassment to the individual to whom they pertain. No identification 
documentation will be required for the disclosure to the requester of 
information required to be made available to the public by 5 U.S.C. 552. 
When in the opinion of the records manager the granting of access 
through the mail could reasonably be expected to result in harm or 
embarrassment if disclosed to a person other than the individual to whom 
the record pertains, a notarized statement of identity or some similar 
assurance of identity will be required.
    (D) Unavailability of identification documentation. If an individual 
is unable to produce adequate identification documentation the 
individual will be required to sign a statement asserting identity and 
acknowledging that knowingly or willfully seeking or obtaining access to 
a record about another person under false pretenses may result in a fine 
of up to $5,000. In addition, depending upon the sensitivity of the 
records sought to be accessed, the official having operational control 
over the records may require such further reasonable assurances as may 
be considered appropriate e.g., statements of other individuals who can 
attest to the identity of the requester. No verification of identity 
will be required of individuals seeking access to records which

[[Page 390]]

are otherwise available to any person under 5 U.S.C. 552, Freedom of 
Information Act.
    (E) Access by the parent of a minor, or legal guardian. A parent of 
a minor, upon presenting suitable personal identification, may access on 
behalf of the minor any record pertaining to the minor maintained by SSS 
in a system of records. A legal guardian may similarly act on behalf of 
an individual declared to be incompetent due to physical or mental 
incapacity or age by a court of competent jurisdiction. Absent a court 
order or consent, a parent or legal guardian has no absolute right to 
have access to a record about a child. Minors are not precluded from 
exercising on their own behalf rights given to them by the Privacy Act.
    (F) Granting access when accompanied by another individual. When an 
individual requesting access to his or her record in a system of records 
maintained by SSS wishes to be accompanied by another individual during 
the course of the examination of the record, the individual making the 
request shall submit to the official having operational control of the 
record, a signed statement authorizing that person access to the record.
    (G) Denial of access for inadequate identification documentation. If 
the official having operational control over the records in a system of 
records maintained by SSS determines that an individual seeking access 
has not provided sufficient identification documentation to permit 
access, the official shall consult with the records manager prior to 
finally denying the individual access.
    (H) Review of decision to deny access. Whenever the records manager 
determines, in accordance with the procedures herein, that access cannot 
be granted the response will also include a statement of the procedures 
to obtain a review of the decision to deny in accord with Sec. 1665.5.
    (vii) Exceptions. (A) Nothing in these regulations shall be 
construed to entitle an individual the right to access to any 
information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or 
proceeding. The mere fact that records in a system of records are 
frequently the subject of litigation does not bring those systems of 
records within the scope of this provision. This provision is not 
intended to preclude access by an individual to the records which are 
available to that individual under the other processes such as the 
Freedom of Information Act or the rules of civil procedure.
    (B) Within any system of records pertaining to possible violations 
of the Military Selective Service Act, the identity of or any 
information pertaining to any individual who provides information 
relating to a suspected violator will not be revealed to the suspected 
violator. This exemption is made under the provision of 5 U.S.C. 
552a(k)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 1665.3  Access to the accounting of disclosures from records.

    Rules governing the granting of access to the accounting of 
disclosure are the same as those for granting accesses to the records 
(including verification of identity) outlined in Sec. 1665.2.


<R05>
Sec. 1665.4  Requests to amend records.

    (a) Requirement for written requests. Individuals desiring to amend 
a record that pertains to them in a system of records maintained by SSS 
must submit their request in writing in accord with the procedures set 
forth herein. Records not subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 will not be 
amended in accord with these provisions. However, individuals who 
believe that such records are inaccurate may bring this to the attention 
of SSS.
    (b) Procedures. (1)(i) The requests to amend a record in a system of 
records shall be addressed to the records manager. Included in the 
request shall be the name of the system and a brief description of the 
record proposed for amendment. In the event the request to amend the 
record is the result of the individual's having gained access to the 
record in accordance with the provisions concerning access to records as 
set forth above, copies of previous correspondence between the requester 
and SSS will serve in lieu of a separate description of the record.
    (ii) When the individual's identity has been previously verified 
pursuant to Sec. 1665.2(b)(2)(vi), further verification of identity is 
not required as long as

[[Page 391]]

the communication does not suggest that a need for verification is 
present. If the individual's identity has not been previously verified, 
SSS may require identification validation as described in 
Sec. 1665.2(b)(2)(vi). Individuals desiring assistance in the 
preparation of a request to amend a record should contact the records 
manager at the address cited above.
    (iii) The exact portion of the record the individual seeks to have 
amended should be clearly indicated. If possible, the proposed 
alternative language should also be set forth, or at a minimum, the 
facts which the individual believes are not accurate, relevant, timely, 
or complete should be set forth with such particularity as to permit SSS 
not only to understand the individual's basis for the request, but also 
to make an appropriate amendment to the record.
    (iv) The request must also set forth the reasons why the individual 
believes his record is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. In 
order to avoid the retention by SSS of personal information merely to 
permit verification of records, the burden of persuading SSS to amend a 
record will be upon the individual. The individual must furnish 
sufficient facts to persuade the official in charge of the system of the 
inaccuracy, irrelevancy, timeliness or incompleteness of the record.
    (v) Incomplete or inaccurate requests will not be rejected 
categorically. The individual will be asked to clarify the request as 
needed.
    (2) SSS action on the request. To the extent possible, a decision, 
upon a request to amend a record will be made within 10 days, (excluding 
Saturdays, Sundays, and legal Federal holidays). The response reflecting 
the decisions upon a request for amendment will include the following:
    (i) The decision of the Selective Service System whether to grant in 
whole, or deny any part of the request to amend the record.
    (ii) The reasons for determination for any portion of the request 
which is denied.
    (iii) The name and address of the official with whom an appeal of 
the denial may be lodged.
    (iv) The name and address of the official designated to assist, as 
necessary and upon request of, the individual making the request in 
preparation of the appeal.
    (v) A description of the review of the appeal with SSS (see 
Sec. 1665.5).
    (vi) A description of any other procedures which may be required of 
the individual in order to process the appeal.
    (3) If the nature of the request for the correction of the system of 
records precludes a decision within 10 days, the individual making the 
request will be informed within 10 days of the extended date for a 
decision. Such a decision will be issued as soon as it is reasonably 
possible, normally within 30 days from the receipt of the request 
(excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal Federal holidays) unless 
unusual circumstances preclude completing action within that time. If 
the expected completion date for the decision indicated cannot be met, 
the individual will be advised of the delay of a revised date when the 
decision may be expected to be completed.


<R05>
Sec. 1665.5  Request for review.

    (a) Individuals wishing to request a review of the decision by SSS 
with regard to any initial request to access or amend a record in accord 
with the provisions of Secs. 1665.2 and 1665.4, should submit the 
request for review in writing and, to the extent possible, include the 
information specified in Sec. 1665.5(b). Individuals desiring assistance 
in the preparation of their request for review should contact the 
records manager at the address provided herein.
    (b) The request for review should contain a brief description of the 
record involved or in lieu thereof, copies of the correspondence from 
SSS in which the request to access or to amend was denied and also the 
reasons why the requester believes that access should be granted or the 
disputed information amended. The request for review should make 
reference to the information furnished by the individual in support of 
his claim and the reasons as required by Secs. 1665.2 and 1665.4 set 
forth by SSS in its decision denying access or amendment. Appeals filed 
without a complete statement by the requester setting forth the reasons 
for review

[[Page 392]]

will, of course, be processed. However, in order to make the appellate 
process as meaningful as possible, the requester's disagreement should 
be set forth in an understandable manner. In order to avoid the 
unnecessary retention of personal information, SSS reserves the right to 
dispose of the material concerning the request to access or amend a 
record if no request for review in accord with this section is received 
by SSS within 180 days of the mailing by SSS of its decision upon an 
initial request. A request for review received after the 180 day period 
may, at the discretion of the records manager, be treated as an initial 
request to access or amend a record.
    (c) The request for review should be addressed to the Director of 
Selective Service.
    (d) The Director of Selective Service will inform the requester in 
writing of the decision on the request for review within 20 days 
(excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal federal holidays) from the date 
of receipt by SSS of the individual's request for review unless the 
Director extends the 20 days period for good cause. The extension and 
the reasons therefor will be sent by SSS to the requester within the 
initial 20 day period. Such extensions should not be routine and should 
not normally exceed an additional thirty days. If the decision does not 
grant in full the request for amendment, the notice of the decision will 
provide a description of the steps the individual may take to obtain 
judicial review of such a decision, a statement that the individual may 
file a concise statement with SSS setting forth the individual's reasons 
for his disagreement with the decision and the procedures for filing 
such a statement of disagreement. The Director of Selective Service has 
the authority to determine the conciseness of the statement, taking into 
account the scope of the disagreement and the complexity of the issues. 
Upon the filing of a proper, concise statement by the individual, any 
subsequent disclosure of the information in dispute will be clearly 
noted so that the fact that the record is disputed is apparent, a copy 
of the concise statement furnished and a concise statement by SSS 
setting forth its reasons for not making the requested changes, if SSS 
chooses to file such a statement. A notation of a dispute is required to 
be made only if an individual informs the agency of his disagreement 
with SSS's determination in accord with Sec. 1665.5(a), (b) and (c). A 
copy of the individual's statement, and if it chooses, SSS's statement 
will be sent to any prior transferee of the disputed information who is 
listed on the accounting required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(c). If the reviewing 
official determines that the record should be amended in accord with the 
individual's request, SSS will promptly correct the record, advise the 
individual, and inform previous recipients if an accounting of the 
disclosure was made pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(c). The notification of 
correction pertains to information actually disclosed.


<R05>
Sec. 1665.6  Schedule of fees.

    (a) Prohibitions against charging fees. Individuals will not be 
charged for:
    (1) The search and review of the record.
    (2) Any copies of the record produced as a necessary part of the 
process of making the record available for access, or
    (3) Any copies of the requested record when it has been determined 
that access can only be accomplished by providing a copy of the record 
through the mail.
    (4) Where a registrant has been charged under the Military Selective 
Service Act and must defend himself in a criminal prosecution, or where 
a registrant submits to induction and thereafter brings habeas corpus 
proceedings to test the validity of his induction, the Selective Service 
System will furnish to him, or to any person he may designate, one copy 
of his Selective Service file free of charge.
    (b) Waiver. The Director of Selective Service may at no charge, 
provide copies of a record if it is determined the production of the 
copies is in the interest of the Government.
    (c) Fee schedule and method of payment. Fees will be charged as 
provided below except as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section.
    (1) Duplication of records. Records will be duplicated at a rate of

[[Page 393]]

    (2) Fees should be paid in full prior to issuance of requested 
copies. In the event the requester is in arrears for previous requests, 
copies will not be provided for any subsequent request until the arrears 
have been paid in full.
    (3) Remittance shall be in the form of cash, a personal check or 
bank draft drawn on a bank in the United States, or postal money order. 
Remittances shall be made payable to the order of the Selective Service 
System and mailed or delivered to the records manager, Selective Service 
System, Washington, DC 20435.
    (4) A receipt of fees paid will be given upon request.


<R05>
Sec. 1665.7  Information available to the public or to former employers of registrants.

    (a) Each area office maintains a classification record which 
contains the name, Selective Service number, and the current and past 
classifications for each person assigned to that board. Information in 
this record may be inspected at the area office at which it is 
maintained.
    (b) Any compensated employee of the Selective Service System may 
disclose to the former employer of a registrant who is serving in or who 
has been discharged from the Armed Forces whether the registrant has or 
has not been discharged and, if discharged, the date thereof, upon 
reasonable proof that the registrant left a position in the employ of 
the person requesting such information in order to serve in the Armed 
Forces.
    (c) Whenever an office referred to in this section is closed, the 
request for information that otherwise would be submitted to it should 
be submitted to the National Headquarters, Selective Service System, 
Washington, DC 20435.


<R05>
Sec. 1665.8  Systems of records exempted from certain provisions of this act.

    Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), the Selective Service System will 
not reveal to the suspected violator the informant's name or other 
identifying information relating to the informant.

appropriate:

[[Page 396]]

    (i) Arrange for a hearing upon the proper petitioning by the

    (ii) Certify in writing to the paying agency that the employee owes 
the debt, the amount and basis of the debt, the date on which payment is 
due, the date the government's right to collect the debt accrued, and 
that Selective Service System regulations for salary offset have been 
approved by the Office of Personnel Management;
    (iii) If collection must be made in installments, the Director must 
advise the paying agency of the amount or percentage of disposable pay 
to be collected in each installment;

provided in this part. The paying agency must certify any amounts 
already collected, notify the employee and send a copy of the 
certification and notice of the employee's separation to the creditor 
agency. If the creditor agency is aware that the employee is entitled to 
Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or similar payments, it 
must certify to the agency responsible for making such payments the 
amount of the debt and that the provisions of this part have been 
followed; and
    (vi) If the employee has already separated and all payments due from 
the paying agency have been paid, the Director may request, unless 
otherwise prohibited, that money payable to the employee from the Civil 
Service Retirement and Disability Fund or other similar funds be 
collected by administrative offset as provided under 5 CFR 831.1801 or 
other provisions of law or regulation.
    (b) The Selective Service System as the paying agency. (1) Upon 
receipt of a properly certified debt claim from another agency, 
deductions will be scheduled to begin at the next established pay 
interval. The employee must receive written notice that the Selective 
Service System has received a certified debt claim from the creditor 
agency, the amount of the debt, the date salary offset will begin, and 
the amount of the deduction(s). The Selective Service System shall not 
review the merits of the creditor agency's determination of the validity 
or the amount of the certified claim.
    (2) If the employee transfers to another agency after the creditor 
agency has submitted its debt claim to the Selective Service System and 
before the debt is collected completely, the Selective Service System 
must certify the total amount collected. One copy of the certification 
must be furnished to the employee. A copy must be furnished the creditor 
agency with notice of the employee's transfer.


<R05>
Sec. 1697.8  Procedures for salary offset.

    (a) Deductions to liquidate an employee's debt will be by the method 
and in the amount stated in the Director's notice of intention to offset 
as provided in Sec. 1697.4. Debts will be collected in one lump sum 
where possible. If the employee is financially unable to pay in one lum 
sum, collection must be made in installments.
    (b) Debts will be collected by deduction at officially established 
pay intervals from an employee's current pay account unless alternative 
arrangements for repayment are made with the approval of the Director.
    (c) Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater 
than the anticipated period of employment. The size of installment 
deductions must bear a reasonable relationship to the size of the debt 
and the employee's ability to pay. The deduction for the pay intervals 
for any period must not exceed 15% of disposable pay unless the employee 
has agreed in writing to a deduction of a greater amount.
    (d) Unliquidated debts may be offset against any financial payment 
due to a separated employee including but not limited to final salary or 
leave payment in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716.


<R05>
Sec. 1697.9  Refunds.

    (a) The Selective Service System will refund promptly any amounts 
deducted

[[Page 397]]

waived, found not owed to the Selective Service System, or when directed 
by an administrative or judicial order.
    (b) The creditor agency will promptly return any amounts deducted by 
the Selective Service System to satisfy debts owed to the creditor 
agency when the debt is waived, found not owed, or when directed by an 
administrative or judicial order.
    (c) Unless required by law, refunds under this subsection shall not 
bear interest.


<R05>
Sec. 1697.10  Statute of Limitations.

    If a debt has been outstanding for more than 10 years after the 
agency's right to collect the debt first accrued, the agency may not 
collect by salary offset unless facts material to the government's right 
to collect were not known and could not reasonably have been known by 
the official or officials who were charged with the responsibility for 
discovery and collection of such debts.


<R05>
Sec. 1697.11  Non-waiver of rights.

    An employee's involuntary payment of all or any part of a debt 
collected under these regulations will not be construed as a waiver of 
any rights that employee may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514 or any other 
provision of contract or law unless there are statutes or contract(s) to 
the contrary.


<R05>
Sec. 1697.12  Interest, penalties, and administrative costs.

    Charges may be assessed for interest, penalties, and administrative 
costs in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 4 CFR

<R05>
Sec. 1699.140  Employment.

    No qualified handicapped person shall, on the basis of handicap, be 
subjected to discrimination in employment under any program or activity 
conducted by the agency. The definitions, requirements and procedures of

Secs. 1699.141--1699.148  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1699.149  Program accessibility: discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 1699.150, no qualified 
handicapped persons shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subject 
to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1699.150  Program accessibility: existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does 
not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;
    (2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 1699.150(a) would result in such 
alterations or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in 
such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head after 
considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and 
operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied 
by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If 
an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency 
shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration 
or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons 
receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
    (b) Methods. The agency may comply with the requirements of this 
section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of 
services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, 
home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, 
alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, 
use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in 
making

[[Page 402]]

its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural 
changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in 
achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making 
alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements 
to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as 
amended (42 U.S.C. 4141 through 4157), and any regulations implementing 
it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of 
this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer 
programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most 
integrated setting appropriate.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section within sixty days of the 
effective date of this part except that where structural changes in 
facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made within three years 
of the effective date of this part, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, within six months of the effective date of this 
part, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete 
such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested 
persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing 
handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition 
by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition 
plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a 
minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped 
persons;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, at the time, identify steps that will 
be taken during each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the officials responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 1699.151  Program accessibility: new construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
handcapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the 
Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), as established 
in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 14-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this 
section.
Secs. 1699.152--1699.159  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1699.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aid where 
necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
handicapped person.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunications devices for deaf persons (TDD's), or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signs at a primary entrance to each of 
its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they 
can obtain information about accessible facilities.

[[Page 403]]

The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 1699.160 would 
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head 
after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding 
and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would 
result in such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that 
would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would 
nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped 
persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
Secs. 1699.161--1699.169  [Reserved]


<R05>

jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make 
reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate government 
entity.
    (f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation 
Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a 
building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), or section 502 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 792), is not readily 
accessible and usable to handicapped persons.
    (g) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which 
it has jurisdiction, the agency shall notify the complainant of the 
results of the investigation in a letter containing--
    (1) Findings of fact and conclusion of law;
    (2) A description of a remedy of each violation found; and
    (3) A notice of the right to appeal.
    (h) Appeals of the findings of fact and conclusions of law or

<R05>
Sec. 1900.03  Contact for general information and requests.

    For general information on this part, to inquire about the FOIA 
program at CIA, or to file a FOIA request (or expression of interest), 
please direct your communication in writing to the Information and 
Privacy Coordinator, Central Intelligence Agency, Washington, DC 20505. 
Such inquiries will also be accepted by facsimile at (703) 613-3007. For 
general information or status information on pending cases only, the 
telephone number is (703) 613-1287. Collect calls cannot be accepted.


<R05>
Sec. 1900.04  Suggestions and complaints.

    The Agency welcomes suggestions or complaints with regard to its 
administration of the Freedom of Information Act. Many requesters will 
receive pre-paid, customer satisfaction survey cards. Letters of 
suggestion or complaint should identify the specific purpose and the 
issues for consideration. The Agency will respond to all substantive 
communications and take such actions as determined feasible and 
appropriate.

                         Filing of FOIA Requests


<R05>
Sec. 1900.11  Preliminary Information.

    Members of the public shall address all communications to the CIA 
Coordinator as specified at 32 CFR 1900.03 and clearly delineate the 
communication as a request under the Freedom of Information Act and this 
regulation. CIA employees receiving a communication in the nature of a 
FOIA request shall expeditiously forward same to the Coordinator. 
Requests and appeals on requests, referrals, or coordinations received 
from members of the public who owe outstanding fees for information 
services at this or other federal agencies will not be accepted and 
action on all pending requests shall be terminated in such 
circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 1900.12  Requirements as to form and content.

    (a) Required information. No particular form is required. A request 
need only reasonably describe the records of interest. This means that 
documents must be described sufficiently to enable a professional 
employee familiar with the subject to locate the documents with a 
reasonable effort. Commonly this equates to a requirement that the 
documents must be locatable through the indexing of our various systems. 
Extremely broad or vague requests or requests requiring research do not 
satisfy this requirement.
    (b) Additional information for fee determination. In addition, a 
requester should provide sufficient personal identifying information to 
allow us to determine the appropriate fee category. A requester should 
also provide an agreement to pay all applicable fees or fees not to 
exceed a certain amount or request a fee waiver.
    (c) Otherwise. Communications which do not meet these requirements 
will be considered an expression of interest and the Agency will work 
with, and offer suggestions to, the potential requester in order to 
define a request properly.

[[Page 409]]


<R05>
Sec. 1900.13  Fees for record services.

    (a) In general. Search, review, and reproduction fees will be 
charged in accordance with the provisions below relating to schedule, 
limitations, and category of requester. Applicable fees will be due even 
if our search locates no responsive records or some or all of the 
responsive records must be denied under one or more of the exemptions of 
the Freedom of Information Act.
    (b) Fee waiver requests. Records will be furnished without charge or 
at a reduced rate whenever the Agency determines:
    (1) That, as a matter of administrative discretion, the interest of 
the United States Government would be served, or
    (2) That it is in the public interest because it is likely to 
contribute significantly to the public understanding of the operations 
or activities of the United States Government and is not primarily in 
the commercial interest of the requester; the Agency shall consider the 
following factors when making this determination:
    (i) Whether the subject of the request concerns the operations or 
activities of the United States Government; and, if so,
    (ii) Whether the disclosure of the requested documents is likely to 
contribute to an understanding of United States Government operations or 
activities; and, if so,
    (iii) Whether the disclosure of the requested documents will 
contribute to public understanding of United States Government 
operations or activities; and, if so,
    (iv) Whether the disclosure of the requested documents is likely to 
contribute significantly to public understanding of United States 
Government operations and activities; and
    (v) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be 
furthered by the requested disclosure; and, if so,
    (vi) Whether the disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest 
of the requester.
    (c) Fee waiver appeals. Denials of requests for fee waivers or 
reductions may be appealed to the Chair of the Agency Release Panel via 
the Coordinator. A requester is encouraged to provide any explanation or 
argument as to how his or her request satisfies the statutory 
requirement set forth above.
    (d) Time for fee waiver requests and appeals. It is suggested that 
such requests and appeals be made and resolved prior to the initiation 
of processing and the incurring of costs. However, fee waiver requests 
will be accepted at any time prior to the release of documents or the 
completion of a case, and fee waiver appeals within forty-five (45) days 
of our initial decision subject to the following condition: If 
processing has been initiated, then the requester must agree to be 
responsible for costs in the event of an adverse administrative or 
judicial decision.
    (e) Agreement to pay fees. In order to protect requesters from large 
and/or unanticipated charges, the Agency will request specific 
commitment when it estimates that fees will exceed $100.00. The Agency 
will hold in abeyance for forty-five (45) days requests requiring such 
agreement and will thereafter deem the request closed. This action, of 
course, would not prevent an individual from refiling his or her FOIA 
request with a fee commitment at a subsequent date.
    (f) Deposits. The Agency may require an advance deposit of up to 100 
percent of the estimated fees when fees may exceed $250.00 and the 
requester has no history of payment, or when, for fees of any amount, 
there is evidence that the requester may not pay the fees which would be 
accrued by processing the request. The Agency will hold in abeyance for 
forty-five (45) days those requests where deposits have been requested.
    (g) Schedule of fees--(1) In general. The schedule of fees for 
services performed in responding to requests for records is established 
as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Application of schedule. Personnel search time includes time 
expended in either manual paper records searches, indices searches, 
review of computer search results for relevance, personal computer 
system searches, and various reproduction services. In any event where 
the actual cost to the Agency of a particular item is less than the 
above schedule (e.g., a large production run of a document resulted in a 
cost less than $5.00 per hundred pages), then the actual lesser cost 
will be charged. Items published and available at the National Technical 
Information Service (NTIS) are also available from CIA pursuant to this 
part at the NTIS price as authorized by statute.
    (3) Other services. For all other types of output, production, or 
reproduction (e.g., photographs, maps, or published reports), actual 
cost or amounts authorized by statute. Determinations of actual cost 
shall include the commercial cost of the media, the personnel time 
expended in making the item to be released, and an allocated cost of the 
equipment used in making the item, or, if the production is effected by 
a commercial service, then that charge shall be deemed the actual cost 
for purposes of this part.
    (h) Limitations on collection of fees--(1) In general. No fees will 
be charged if the cost of collecting the fee is equal to or greater than 
the fee itself. That cost includes the administrative costs to the 
Agency of billing, receiving, recording, and processing the fee for 
deposit to the Treasury Department and, as of the date of these 
regulations, is deemed to be $10.00.
    (2) Requests for personal information. No fees will be charged for 
requesters seeking records about themselves under the FOIA; such 
requests are processed in accordance with both the FOIA and the Privacy 
Act in order to ensure the maximum disclosure without charge.
    (i) Fee categories. There are four categories of FOIA requesters for 
fee purposes: ``Commercial use'' requesters, ``educational and non-
commercial scientific institution'' requesters, ``representatives of the 
news media'' requesters, and ``all other'' requesters. The categories 
are defined in Sec. 1900.02, and applicable fees, which are the same in 
two of the categories, will be assessed as follows:
    (1) ``Commercial use'' requesters: Charges which recover the full 
direct costs of searching for, reviewing, and duplicating responsive 
records (if any);
    (2) ``Educational and non-commercial scientific institution'' 
requesters as well as ``representatives of the news media'' requesters: 
Only charges for reproduction beyond the first 100 pages;
    (3) ``All other'' requesters: Charges which recover the full direct 
cost of searching for and reproducing responsive records (if any) beyond 
the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two hours of search 
time which will be furnished without charge.
    (j) Associated requests. A requester or associated requesters may 
not file a series of multiple requests, which are merely discrete 
subdivisions of the information actually sought for the purpose of 
avoiding or reducing applicable

[[Page 411]]

fees. In such instances, the Agency may aggregate the requests and 
charge the applicable fees.


<R05>
Sec. 1900.14  Fee estimates (pre-request option).

    In order to avoid unanticipated or potentially large fees, a 
requester may submit a request for a fee estimate. The Agency will 
endeavor within ten (10) days to provide an accurate estimate, and, if a 
request is thereafter submitted, the Agency will not accrue or charge 
fees in excess of our estimate without the specific permission of the 
requester. Effective October 2, 1997, the ten (10) day provision is 
modified to twenty (20) days pursuant to the Electronic Freedom of 
Information Act Amendments of 1996.

                       CIA Action on FOIA Requests


<R05>
Sec. 1900.21  Processing of requests for records.

    (a) In general. Requests meeting the requirements of Secs. 1900.11 
through 1900.13 shall be accepted as formal requests and processed under 
the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, and these regulations. 
Upon receipt, the Agency shall within ten (10) days record each request, 
acknowledge receipt to the requester in writing, and thereafter effect 
the necessary taskings to the CIA components reasonably believed to hold 
responsive records. Effective October 2, 1997, the ten (10) day 
provision is modified to twenty (20) days pursuant to the Electronic 
Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996.
    (b) Database of ``officially released information.'' As an 
alternative to extensive tasking and as an accommodation to many 
requesters, the Agency maintains a database of ``officially released 
information'' which contains copies of documents released by this 
Agency. Searches of this database, containing currently in excess of 
500,000 pages, can be accomplished expeditiously. Moreover, requests 
that are specific and well-focused will often incur minimal, if any, 
costs. Requesters interested in this means of access should so indicate 
in their correspondence. Effective November 1, 1997 and consistent with 
the mandate of the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 
1996, on-the public. Detailed information regarding such access will 
line electronic access to these records will be available to be 
available at that time from the point of contact specified in 
Sec. 1900.03.
    (c) Effect of certain exemptions. In processing a request, the 
Agency shall decline to confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of 
any responsive records whenever the fact of their existence or 
nonexistence is itself classified under Executive Order 12958 or 
revealing of intelligence sources and methods protected pursuant to 
section 103(c)(5) of the National Security Act of 1947. In such 
circumstances, the Agency, in the form of a final written response, 
shall so inform the requester and advise of his or her right to an 
administrative appeal.
    (d) Time for response. The Agency will utilize every effort to 
determine within the statutory guideline of ten (10) days after receipt 
of an initial request whether to comply with such a request. However, 
the current volume of requests require that the Agency seek additional 
time from a requester pursuant to 32 CFR 1900.33. In such event, the 
Agency will inform the requester in writing and further advise of his or 
her right to file an administrative appeal of any adverse determination. 
Effective October 2, 1997, the ten (10) day provision is modified to 
twenty (20) days pursuant to the Electronic Freedom of Information Act 
Amendments of 1996.


<R05>
Sec. 1900.22  Action and determination(s) by originator(s) or any interested party.

    (a) Initial action for access. CIA components tasked pursuant to a 
FOIA request shall search all relevant record systems within their 
cognizance which have not been excepted from search by the provisions of 
the CIA Information Act of 1984. They shall:
    (1) Determine whether a record exists;
    (2) Determine whether and to what extent any FOIA exemptions apply;
    (3) Approve the disclosure of all non-exempt records or portions of 
records for which they are the originator; and

[[Page 412]]

    (4) Forward to the Coordinator all records approved for release or 
necessary for coordination with or referral to another originator or 
interested party. In making these decisions, the CIA component officers 
shall be guided by the applicable law as well as the procedures 
specified at 32 CFR 1900.31 and 32 CFR 1900.32 regarding confidential 
commercial information and personal information (about persons other 
than the requester).
    (b) Referrals and coordinations. As applicable and within ten (10) 
days of receipt by the Coordinator, any CIA records containing 
information originated by other CIA components shall be forwarded to 
those entities for action in accordance with paragraph (a) of this 
section and return. Records originated by other federal agencies or CIA 
records containing other federal agency information shall be forwarded 
to such agencies within ten (10) days of our completion of initial 
action in the case for action under their regulations and direct 
response to the requester (for other agency records) or return to the 
CIA (for CIA records). Effective October 2, 1997, the ten (10) day 
provision is modified to twenty (20) days pursuant to the Electronic 
Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996.


<R05>
Sec. 1900.23  Payment of fees, notification of decision, and right of appeal.

    (a) Fees in general. Fees collected under this part do not accrue to 
the Central Intelligence Agency and shall be deposited immediately to 
the general account of the United States Treasury.
    (b) Notification of decision. Upon completion of all required review 
and the receipt of accrued fees (or promise to pay such fees), the 
Agency will promptly inform the requester in writing of those records or 
portions of records which may be released and which must be denied. With 
respect to the former, the Agency will provide copies; with respect to 
the latter, the Agency shall explain the reasons for the denial, 
identify the person(s) responsible for such decisions by name and title, 
and give notice of a right of administrative appeal.
    (c) Availability of reading room. As an alternative to receiving 
records by mail, a requester may arrange to inspect the records deemed 
releasable at a CIA ``reading room'' in the metropolitan Washington, DC 
area. Access will be granted after applicable and accrued fees have been 
paid. Requests to review or browse documents in our database of 
``officially released records'' will also be honored in this manner to 
the extent that paper copies or electronic copies in unclassified 
computer systems exist. All such requests shall be in writing and 
addressed pursuant to 32 CFR 1900.03. The records will be available at 
such times as mutually agreed but not less than three (3) days from our 
receipt of a request. The requester will be responsible for reproduction 
charges for any copies of records desired.

                    Additional Administrative Matters


<R05>
Sec. 1900.31  Procedures for business information.

    (a) In general. Business information obtained by the Central 
Intelligence Agency by a submitter shall not be disclosed pursuant to a 
Freedom of Information Act request except in accordance with this 
section. For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
    (1) Business information means commercial or financial information 
in which a legal entity has a recognized property interest;
    (2) Confidential commercial information means such business 
information provided to the United States Government by a submitter 
which is reasonably believed to contain information exempt from release 
under exemption (b)(4) of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, 
because disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause substantial 
competitive harm;
    (3) Submitter means any person or entity who provides confidential 
commercial information to the United States Government; it includes, but 
is not limited to, corporations, businesses (however organized), state 
governments, and foreign governments; and
    (b) Designation of confidential commercial information. A submitter 
of business information will use good-faith efforts to designate, by 
appropriate

[[Page 413]]

markings, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time 
thereafter, any portions of its submission that it considers to be 
confidential commercial information and hence protected from required 
disclosure pursuant to exemption (b)(4). Such designations shall expire 
ten (10) years after the date of the submission unless the submitter 
requests, and provides justification for, a longer designation period.
    (c) Process in event of FOIA request.--(1) Notice to submitters. The 
Agency shall provide a submitter with prompt written notice of receipt 
of a Freedom of Information Act request encompassing business 
information whenever:
    (i) The submitter has in good faith designated the information as 
confidential commercial information, or
    (ii) The Agency believes that disclosure of the information could 
reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm, and
    (iii) The information was submitted within the last ten (10) years 
unless the submitter requested and provided acceptable justification for 
a specific notice period of greater duration.
    (2) Form of notice. This notice shall either describe the exact 
nature of the confidential commercial information at issue or provide 
copies of the responsive records containing such information.
    (3) Response by submitter. (i) Within seven (7) days of the above 
notice, all claims of confidentiality by a submitter must be supported 
by a detailed statement of any objection to disclosure. Such statement 
shall:
    (A) Specify that the information has not been disclosed to the 
public;
    (B) Explain why the information is contended to be a trade secret or 
confidential commercial information;
    (C) Explain how the information is capable of competitive damage if 
disclosed;
    (D) State that the submitter will provide the Agency and the 
Department of Justice with such litigation defense as requested; and
    (E) Be certified by an officer authorized to legally bind the 
corporation or similar entity.
    (ii) It should be noted that information provided by a submitter 
pursuant to this provision may itself be subject to disclosure under the 
FOIA.
    (4) Decision and notice of intent to disclose. (i) The Agency shall 
consider carefully a submitter's objections and specific grounds for 
nondisclosure prior to its final determination. If the Agency decides to 
disclose a document over the objection of a submitter, the Agency shall 
provide the submitter a written notice which shall include:
    (A) A statement of the reasons for which the submitter's disclosure 
objections were not sustained;
    (B) A description of the information to be disclosed; and
    (C) A specified disclosure date which is seven (7) days after the 
date of the instant notice.
    (ii) When notice is given to a submitter under this section, the 
Agency shall also notify the requester and, if the Agency notifies a 
submitter that it intends to disclose information, then the requester 
shall be notified also and given the proposed date for disclosure.
    (5) Notice of FOIA lawsuit. If a requester initiates a civil action 
seeking to compel disclosure of information asserted to be within the 
scope of this section, the Agency shall promptly notify the submitter. 
The submitter, as specified above, shall provide such litigation 
assistance as required by the Agency and the Department of Justice.
    (6) Exceptions to notice requirement. The notice requirements of 
this section shall not apply if the Agency determines that:
    (i) The information should not be disclosed in light of other FOIA 
exemptions;
    (ii) The information has been published lawfully or has been 
officially made available to the public;
    (iii) The disclosure of the information is otherwise required by law 
or federal regulation; or
    (iv) The designation made by the submitter under this section 
appears frivolous, except that, in such a case, the Agency will, within 
a reasonable time prior to the specified disclosure date, give the 
submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the 
information.

<R05>
Sec. 1900.32  Procedures for information concerning other persons.

    (a) In general. Personal information concerning individuals other 
than the requester shall not be disclosed under the Freedom of 
Information Act if the proposed release would constitute a clearly 
unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. See 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6). For 
purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
    (1) personal information means any information about an individual 
that is not a matter of public record, or easily discernible to the 
public, or protected from disclosure because of the implications that 
arise from Government possession of such information.
    (2) public interest means the public interest in understanding the 
operations and activities of the United States Government and not simply 
any matter which might be of general interest to the requester or 
members of the public.
    (b) Determination to be made. In making the required determination 
under this section and pursuant to exemption (b)(6) of the FOIA, the 
Agency will balance the privacy interests that would be compromised by 
disclosure against the public interest in release of the requested 
information.
    (c) Otherwise. A requester seeking information on a third person is 
encouraged to provide a signed affidavit or declaration from the third 
person waiving all or some of their privacy rights. However, all such 
waivers shall be narrowly construed and the Coordinator, in the exercise 
of his discretion and administrative authority, may seek clarification 
from the third party prior to any or all releases.


<R05>
Sec. 1900.33  Allocation of resources; agreed extensions of time.

    (a) In general. Agency components shall devote such personnel and 
other resources to the responsibilities imposed by the Freedom of 
Information Act as may be appropriate and reasonable considering:
    (1) The totality of resources available to the component,
    (2) The business demands imposed on the component by the Director of 
Central Intelligence or otherwise by law,
    (3) The information review and release demands imposed by the 
Congress or other governmental authority, and
    (4) The rights of all members of the public under the various 
information review and disclosure laws.
    (b) Discharge of FOIA responsibilities. Components shall exercise 
due diligence in their responsibilities under the FOIA and must allocate 
a reasonable level of resources to requests under the Act in a strictly 
``first-in, first-out'' basis and utilizing two or more processing 
queues to ensure that smaller as well as larger (i.e., project) cases 
receive equitable attention. The Information and Privacy Coordinator is 
responsible for management of the Agency-wide program defined by this 
part and for establishing priorities for cases consistent with 
established law. The Director, Information Management through the Agency 
Release Panel shall provide policy and resource direction as necessary 
and render decisions on administrative appeals.
    (c) Requests for extension of time. When the Agency is unable to 
meet the statutory time requirements of the FOIA, it will inform the 
requester that the request cannot be processed within the statutory time 
limits, provide an opportunity for the requester to limit the scope of 
the request so that it can be processed within the statutory time 
limits, or arrange with the requester an agreed upon time frame for 
processing the request, or determine that exceptional circumstances 
mandate additional time. In such instances the Agency will, however, 
inform a requester of his or her right to decline our request and 
proceed with an administrative appeal or judicial review as appropriate. 
Effective October 2 1997, the definition of exceptional circumstances is 
modified per section 552(a)(6)(C) of the Freedom of Information Act, as 
amended.


<R05>
Sec. 1900.34  Requests for expedited processing.

    (a) In general. All requests will be handled in the order received 
on a strictly ``first-in, first-out'' basis. Exceptions to this rule 
will only be made in accordance with the following procedures. In all 
circumstances, however,

[[Page 415]]

and consistent with established judicial precedent, requests more 
properly the scope of requests under the Federal Rules of Civil or 
Criminal Procedure (or other federal, state, or foreign judicial or 
quasi-judicial rules) will not be granted expedited processing under 
this or related (e.g., Privacy Act) provisions unless expressly ordered 
by a federal court of competent jurisdiction.
    (b) Procedure prior to October 2, 1997. Requests for expedited 
processing shall be granted only in circumstances that the Agency deems 
to be exceptional. In making this determination, the Agency shall 
consider and must decide in the affirmative on all of the following 
factors:
    (i) That there is a genuine need for the specific requested records; 
and
    (ii) That the personal need is exceptional; and
    (iii) That there are no alternative forums for the records or 
information sought; and
    (iv) That it is reasonably believed that substantive records 
relevant to the stated needs may exist and be deemed releasable.
    (2) In sum, requests shall be considered for expedited processing 
only when health, humanitarian, or due process considerations involving 
possible deprivation of life or liberty create circumstances of 
exceptional urgency and extraordinary need.
    (c) Procedure on or after October 2, 1997. Requests for expedited 
processing will be approved only when a compelling need is established 
to the satisfaction of the Agency. A requester may make such a request 
with a certification of ``compelling need'' and, within ten (10) days of 
receipt, the Agency will decide whether to grant expedited processing 
and will notify the requester of its decision. The certification shall 
set forth with specificity the relevant facts upon which the requester 
relies and it appears to the Agency that substantive records relevant to 
the stated needs may exist and be deemed releasable. A ``compelling 
need'' is deemed to exist:
    (1) When the matter involves an imminent threat to the life or 
physical safety of an individual; or
    (2) When the request is made by a person primarily engaged in 
disseminating information and the information is relevant to a subject 
of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government 
activity.

                CIA Action on FOIA Administrative Appeals


<R05>
Sec. 1900.41  Establishment of appeals structure.

    (a) In general. Two administrative entities have been established by 
the Director of Central Intelligence to facilitate the processing of 
administrative appeals under the Freedom of Information Act. Their 
membership, authority, and rules of procedure are as follows.
    (b) Historical Records Policy Board (``HRPB'' or ``Board''). This 
Board, the successor to the CIA Information Review Committee, acts as 
the senior corporate board in the CIA on all matters of information 
review and release.
    (1) Membership. The HRPB is composed of the Executive Director, who 
serves as its Chair, the Deputy Director for Administration, the Deputy 
Director for Intelligence, the Deputy Director for Operations, the 
Deputy Director for Science and Technology, the General Counsel, the 
Director of Congressional Affairs, the Director of the Public Affairs 
Staff, the Director, Center for the Study of Intelligence, and the 
Associate Deputy Director for Administration/Information Services, or 
their designees.
    (2) Authorities and activities. The HRPB, by majority vote, may 
delegate to one or more of its members the authority to act on any 
appeal or other matter or authorize the Chair to delegate such 
authority, as long as such delegation is not to the same individual or 
body who made the initial denial. The Executive Secretary of the HRPB is 
the Director, Information Management. The Chair may request interested 
parties to participate when special equities or expertise are involved.
    (c) Agency Release Panel (``ARP'' or ``Panel''). The HRPB, pursuant 
to its delegation of authority, has established a subordinate Agency 
Release Panel.

[[Page 416]]

    (1) Membership. The ARP is composed of the Director, Information 
Management, who serves as its Chair; the Information Review Officers 
from the Directorates of Administration, Intelligence, Operations, 
Science and Technology, and the Director of Central Intelligence Area; 
the CIA Information and Privacy Coordinator; the Chief, Historical 
Review Group; the Chair, Publications Review Board; the Chief, Records 
Declassification Program; and representatives from the Office of General 
Counsel, the Office of Congressional Affairs, and the Public Affairs 
Staff.
    (2) Authorities and activities. The Panel shall meet on a regular 
schedule and may take action when a simple majority of the total 
membership is present. The Panel shall advise and assist the HRPB on all 
information release issues, monitor the adequacy and timeliness of 
Agency releases, set component search and review priorities, review 
adequacy of resources available to and planning for all Agency release 
programs, and perform such other functions as deemed necessary by the 
Board. The Information and Privacy Coordinator also serves as Executive 
Secretary of the Panel. The Chair may request interested parties to 
participate when special equities or expertise are involved. The Panel, 
functioning as a committee of the whole or through individual members, 
will make final Agency decisions from appeals of initial adverse 
decisions under the Freedom of Information Act and such other 
information release decisions made under 32 CFR parts 1901, 1907, and 
1908. Issues shall be decided by a majority of members present; in all 
cases of a divided vote, any member of the ARP then present may refer 
such matter to the HRPB by written memorandum to the Executive Secretary 
of the HRPB. Matters decided by the Panel or Board will be deemed a 
final decision by the Agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1900.42  Right of appeal and appeal procedures.

    (a) Right of Appeal. A right of administrative appeal exists 
whenever access to any requested record or any portion thereof is 
denied, no records are located in response to a request, or a request 
for a fee waiver is denied. The Agency will apprise all requesters in 
writing of their right to appeal such decisions to the CIA Agency 
Release Panel through the Coordinator.
    (b) Requirements as to time and form. Appeals of decisions must be 
received by the Coordinator within forty-five (45) days of the date of 
the Agency's initial decision. The Agency may, for good cause and as a 
matter of administrative discretion, permit an additional thirty (30) 
days for the submission of an appeal. All appeals shall be in writing 
and addressed as specified in 32 CFR 1900.03. All appeals must identify 
the documents or portions of documents at issue with specificity and may 
present such information, data, and argument in support as the requester 
may desire.
    (c) Exceptions. No appeal shall be accepted if the requester has 
outstanding fees for information services at this or another federal 
agency. In addition, no appeal shall be accepted if the information in 
question has been the subject of a review within the previous two (2) 
years or is the subject of pending litigation in the federal courts.
    (d) Receipt, recording, and tasking. The Agency shall promptly 
record each request received under this part, acknowledge receipt to the 
requester in writing, and thereafter effect the necessary taskings to 
the Deputy Director(s) in charge of the directorate(s) which originated 
or has an interest in the record(s) subject to the appeal. As used 
herein, the term Deputy Director includes an equivalent senior official 
in the DCI-area as well as a designee known as the Information Review 
Officer for a directorate or area.
    (e) Time for response. The Agency shall attempt to complete action 
on an appeal within twenty (20) days of the date of receipt. The current 
volume of requests, however, often requires that the Agency request 
additional time from the requester pursuant to 32 CFR 1900.33. In such 
event, the Agency will inform the requester of the right to judicial 
review.


<R05>
Sec. 1900.43  Determination(s) by Deputy Director(s).

    Each Deputy Director in charge of a directorate which originated or 
has an

[[Page 417]]

interest in any of the records subject to the appeal, or designee, is a 
required party to any appeal; other interested parties may become 
involved through the request of the Coordinator when it is determined 
that some or all of the information is also within their official 
cognizance. These parties shall respond in writing to the Coordinator 
with a finding as to the exempt status of the information. This response 
shall be provided expeditiously on a ``first-in, first-out'' basis 
taking into account the business requirements of the parties and 
consistent with the information rights of members of the general public 
under the various information review and release laws.


<R05>
Sec. 1900.44  Action by appeals authority.

    (a) Preparation of docket. The Coordinator, acting in the capacity 
of Executive Secretary of the Agency Release Panel, shall place 
administrative appeals of FOIA requests ready for adjudication on the 
agenda at the next occurring meeting of that Panel. The Executive 
Secretary shall provide a summation memorandum for consideration of the 
members; the complete record of the request consisting of the request, 
the document(s) (sanitized and full text) at issue, and the findings of 
the concerned Deputy Director(s) or designee(s).
    (b) Decision by the Agency Release Panel. The Agency Release Panel 
shall meet and decide requests sitting as a committee of the whole. 
Decisions are by majority vote of those present at a meeting and shall 
be based on the written record and their deliberations; no personal 
appearances shall be permitted without the express permission of the 
Panel.
    (c) Decision by the Historical Records Policy Board. In any cases of 
divided vote by the ARP, any member of that body is authorized to refer 
the request to the CIA Historical Records Policy Board which acts as the 
senior corporate board for the Agency. The record compiled (the request, 
the memoranda filed by the originator and interested parties, and the 
previous decision(s)) as well as any memorandum of law or policy the 
referent desires to be considered, shall be certified by the Executive 
Secretary of the Agency Release Panel and shall constitute the official 
record of the proceedings and must be included in any subsequent 
filings.


<R05>
Sec. 1900.45  Notification of decision and right of judicial review.

    The Executive Secretary of the Agency Release Panel shall promptly 
prepare and communicate the decision of the Panel or Board to the 
requester. With respect to any decision to deny information, that 
correspondence shall state the reasons for the decision, identify the 
officer responsible, and include a notice of a right to judicial review.

Act program at CIA, or to file a Privacy Act request, please direct your 
communication in writing to the Information and Privacy Coordinator, 
Central Intelligence Agency, Washington, DC. 20505. Requests with the

<R05>
Sec. 1901.04  Suggestions and complaints.

    The Agency welcomes suggestions or complaints with regard to its 
administration of the Privacy Act. Many requesters will receive pre-
paid, customer satisfaction survey cards. Letters of suggestion or 
complaint should identify the specific purpose and the issues for 
consideration. The Agency will respond to all substantive communications 
and take such actions as determined feasible and appropriate.

                     Filing of Privacy Act Requests


<R05>
Sec. 1901.11  Preliminary information.

    Members of the public shall address all communications to the 
contact specified at Sec. 1901.03 and clearly delineate the 
communication as a request under the Privacy Act and this regulation. 
Requests and administrative appeals on requests, referrals, and 
coordinations received from members of the public who owe outstanding 
fees for information services at this or other federal agencies will not 
be accepted and action on existing requests and appeals will be 
terminated in such circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 1901.12  Requirements as to form.

    (a) In general. No particular form is required. All requests must 
contain the identification information required at Sec. 1901.13.
    (b) For access. For requests seeking access, a requester should, to 
the extent possible, describe the nature of the record sought and the 
record system(s) in which it is thought to be included. Requesters may 
find assistance from information described in the Privacy Act Issuances 
Compilation which is published biannually by the Federal Register. In 
lieu of this, a requester may simply describe why and under what 
circumstances it is believed that this Agency maintains responsive 
records; the Agency will undertake the appropriate searches.
    (c) For amendment. For requests seeking amendment, a requester 
should identify the particular record or portion subject to the request, 
state a justification for such amendment, and provide the desired 
amending language.


<R05>
Sec. 1901.13  Requirements as to identification of requester.

    (a) In general. Individuals seeking access to or amendment of 
records concerning themselves shall provide their full (legal) name, 
address, date and place of birth, and current citizenship status 
together with a statement that such information is true under penalty of 
perjury or a notarized statement swearing to or affirming identity. If 
the Agency determines that this information is not sufficient, the 
Agency may request additional or clarifying information.
    (b) Requirement for aliens. Only aliens lawfully admitted for 
permanent residence (PRAs) may file a request pursuant to the Privacy 
Act and this part. Such individuals shall provide, in addition to the 
information required under paragraph (a) of this section, their Alien 
Registration Number and the date that status was acquired.
    (c) Requirement for representatives. The parent or guardian of a 
minor individual, the guardian of an individual under judicial 
disability, or an attorney retained to represent an individual

[[Page 420]]

shall provide, in addition to establishing the identity of the minor or 
individual represented as required in paragraph (a) or (b) of this 
section, evidence of such representation by submission of a certified 
copy of the minor's birth certificate, court order, or representational 
agreement which establishes the relationship and the requester's 
identity.
    (d) Procedure otherwise. If a requester or representative fails to 
provide the information in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section 
within forty-five (45) days of the date of our request, the Agency will 
deem the request closed. This action, of course, would not prevent an 
individual from refiling his or her Privacy Act request at a subsequent 
date with the required information.


<R05>
Sec. 1901.14  Fees.

    No fees will be charged for any action under the authority of the 
Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, irrespective of the fact that a request is 
or may be processed under the authority of both the Privacy Act and the 
Freedom of Information Act.

                     Action on Privacy Act Requests


<R05>
Sec. 1901.21  Processing requests for access to or amendment of records.

    (a) In general. Requests meeting the requirements of 32 CFR 1901.11 
through 1901.13 shall be processed under both the Freedom of Information 
Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, and the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and the 
applicable regulations, unless the requester demands otherwise in 
writing. Such requests will be processed under both Acts regardless of 
whether the requester cites one Act in the request, both, or neither. 
This action is taken in order to ensure the maximum possible disclosure 
to the requester.
    (b) Receipt, recording and tasking. Upon receipt of a request 
meeting the requirements of Secs. 1901.11 through 1901.13, the Agency 
shall within ten (10) days record each request, acknowledge receipt to 
the requester, and thereafter effect the necessary taskings to the 
components reasonably believed to hold responsive records.
    (c) Effect of certain exemptions. In processing a request, the 
Agency shall decline to confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of 
any responsive records whenever the fact of their existence or 
nonexistence is itself classified under Executive Order 12958 or 
revealing of intelligence sources and methods protected pursuant to 
section 103(c)(5) of the National Security Act of 1947. In such 
circumstances, the Agency, in the form of a final written response, 
shall so inform the requester and advise of his or her right to an 
administrative appeal.
    (d) Time for response. Although the Privacy Act does not mandate a 
time for response, our joint treatment of requests under both the 
Privacy Act and the FOIA means that the Agency should provide a response 
within the FOIA statutory guideline of ten (10) days on initial requests 
and twenty (20) days on administrative appeals. However, the current 
volume of requests require that the Agency often seek additional time 
from a requester pursuant to 32 CFR 1901.33. In such event, the Agency 
will inform the requester in writing and further advise of his or her 
right to file an administrative appeal.


<R05>
Sec. 1901.22  Action and determination(s) by originator(s) or any interested party.

    (a) Initial action for access. CIA components tasked pursuant to a 
Privacy Act access request shall search all relevant record systems 
within their cognizance. They shall:
    (1) Determine whether responsive records exist;
    (2) Determine whether access must be denied in whole or part and on 
what legal basis under both Acts in each such case;
    (3) Approve the disclosure of records for which they are the 
originator; and
    (4) Forward to the Coordinator all records approved for release or 
necessary for coordination with or referral to another originator or 
interested party as well as the specific determinations with respect to 
denials (if any).
    (b) Initial action for amendment. CIA components tasked pursuant to 
a Privacy Act amendment request shall review the official records 
alleged to be

[[Page 421]]

inaccurate and the proposed amendment submitted by the requester. If 
they determine that the Agency's records are not accurate, relevant, 
timely or complete, they shall promptly:
    (1) Make the amendment as requested;
    (2) Write to all other identified persons or agencies to whom the 
record has been disclosed (if an accounting of the disclosure was made) 
and inform of the amendment; and
    (3) Inform the Coordinator of such decisions.
    (c) Action otherwise on amendment request. If the CIA component 
records manager declines to make the requested amendment or declines to 
make the requested amendment but agrees to augment the official records, 
that manager shall promptly:
    (1) Set forth the reasons for refusal; and
    (2) Inform the Coordinator of such decision and the reasons 
therefore.
    (d) Referrals and coordinations. As applicable and within ten (10) 
days of receipt by the Coordinator, any CIA records containing 
information originated by other CIA components shall be forwarded to 
those entities for action in accordance with paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) 
of this section and return. Records originated by other federal agencies 
or CIA records containing other federal agency information shall be 
forwarded to such agencies within ten (10) days of our completion of 
initial action in the case for action under their regulations and direct 
response to the requester (for other agency records) or return to the 
CIA (for CIA records).
    (e) Effect of certain exemptions. This section shall not be 
construed to allow access to systems of records exempted by the Director 
of Central Intelligence pursuant to subsections (j) and (k) of the 
Privacy Act or where those exemptions require that the CIA can neither 
confirm nor deny the existence or nonexistence of responsive records.


<R05>
Sec. 1901.23  Notification of decision and right of appeal.

    Within ten (10) days of receipt of responses to all initial taskings 
and subsequent coordinations (if any), and dispatch of referrals (if 
any), the Agency will provide disclosable records to the requester. If a 
determination has been made not to provide access to requested records 
(in light of specific exemptions) or that no records are found, the 
Agency shall so inform the requester, identify the denying official, and 
advise of the right to administrative appeal.

                    Additional Administrative Matters


<R05>
Sec. 1901.31  Special procedures for medical and psychological records.

    (a) In general. When a request for access or amendment involves 
medical or psychological records and when the originator determines that 
such records are not exempt from disclosure, the Agency will, after 
consultation with the Director of Medical Services, determine:
    (1) Which records may be sent directly to the requester and
    (2) Which records should not be sent directly to the requester 
because of possible medical or psychological harm to the requester or 
another person.
    (b) Procedure for records to be sent to physician. In the event that 
the Agency determines, in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, that records should not be sent directly to the requester, the 
Agency will notify the requester in writing and advise that the records 
at issue can be made available only to a physician of the requester's 
designation. Upon receipt of such designation, verification of the 
identity of the physician, and agreement by the physician:
    (1) To review the documents with the requesting individual,
    (2) To explain the meaning of the documents, and
    (3) To offer counseling designed to temper any adverse reaction, the 
Agency will forward such records to the designated physician.
    (c) Procedure if physician option not available. If within sixty 
(60) days of the paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the requester has 
failed to respond or designate a physician, or the physician fails to 
agree to the release conditions, the Agency will hold the documents in 
abeyance and advise the requester that

[[Page 422]]

this action may be construed as a technical denial. The Agency will also 
advise the requester of the responsible official and of his or her 
rights to administrative appeal and thereafter judicial review.


<R05>
Sec. 1901.32  Requests for expedited processing.

    (a) All requests will be handled in the order received on a strictly 
``first-in, first-out'' basis. Exceptions to this rule will only be made 
in circumstances that the Agency deems to be exceptional. In making this 
determination, the Agency shall consider and must decide in the 
affirmative on all of the following factors:
    (1) That there is a genuine need for the records; and
    (2) That the personal need is exceptional; and
    (3) That there are no alternative forums for the records sought; and
    (4) That it is reasonably believed that substantive records relevant 
to the stated needs may exist and be deemed releasable.
    (b) In sum, requests shall be considered for expedited processing 
only when health, humanitarian, or due process considerations involving 
possible deprivation of life or liberty create circumstances of 
exceptional urgency and extraordinary need. In accordance with 
established judicial precedent, requests more properly the scope of 
requests under the Federal Rules of Civil or Criminal Procedure (or 
equivalent state rules) will not be granted expedited processing under 
this or related (e.g., Freedom of Information Act) provisions unless 
expressly ordered by a federal court of competent jurisdiction.


<R05>
Sec. 1901.33  Allocation of resources; agreed extensions of time.

    (a) In general. Agency components shall devote such personnel and 
other resources to the responsibilities imposed by the Privacy Act as 
may be appropriate and reasonable considering:
    (1) The totality of resources available to the component,
    (2) The business demands imposed on the component by the Director of 
Central Intelligence or otherwise by law,
    (3) The information review and release demands imposed by the 
Congress or other governmental authority, and
    (4) The rights of all members of the public under the various 
information review and disclosure laws.
    (b) Discharge of Privacy Act responsibilities. Components shall 
exercise due diligence in their responsibilities under the Privacy Act 
and must allocate a reasonable level of resources to requests under the 
Act in a strictly ``first-in, first-out'' basis and utilizing two or 
more processing queues to ensure that smaller as well as larger (i.e., 
project) cases receive equitable attention. The Information and Privacy 
Coordinator is responsible for management of the Agency-wide program 
defined by this Part and for establishing priorities for cases 
consistent with established law. The Director, Information Management 
through the Agency Release Panel shall provide policy and resource 
direction as necessary and shall make determinations on administrative 
appeals.
    (c) Requests for extension of time. While the Privacy Act does not 
specify time requirements, our joint treatment of requests under the 
FOIA means that when the Agency is unable to meet the statutory time 
requirements of the FOIA, the Agency may request additional time from a 
requester. In such instances the Agency will inform a requester of his 
or her right to decline our request and proceed with an administrative 
appeal or judicial review as appropriate.

              Action on Privacy Act Administrative Appeals


<R05>
Sec. 1901.41  Establishment of appeals structure.

    (a) In general. Two administrative entities have been established by 
the Director of Central Intelligence to facilitate the processing of 
administrative appeals under the Freedom of Information Act. Their 
membership, authority, and rules of procedure are as follows.
    (b) Historical Records Policy Board (``HRPB'' or ``Board''). This 
Board, the successor to the CIA Information Review Committee, acts as 
the senior corporate board in the CIA on all matters of information 
review and release.

[[Page 423]]

    (1) Membership. The HRPB is composed of the Executive Director, who 
serves as its Chair, the Deputy Director for Administration, the Deputy 
Director for Intelligence, the Deputy Director for Operations, the 
Deputy Director for Science and Technology, the General Counsel, the 
Director of Congressional Affairs, the Director of the Public Affairs 
Staff, the Director, Center for the Study of Intelligence, and the 
Associate Deputy Director for Administration/Information Services, or 
their designees.
    (2) Authorities and activities. The HRPB, by majority vote, may 
delegate to one or more of its members the authority to act on any 
appeal or other matter or authorize the Chair to delegate such 
authority, as long as such delegation is not to the same individual or 
body who made the initial denial. The Executive Secretary of the HRPB is 
the Director, Information Management. The Chair may request interested 
parties to participate when special equities or expertise are involved.
    (c) Agency Release Panel (``ARP'' or ``Panel''). The HRPB, pursuant 
to its delegation of authority, has established a subordinate Agency 
Release Panel.
    (1) Membership. The ARP is composed of the Director, Information 
Management, who serves as its Chair; the Information Review Officers 
from the Directorates of Administration, Intelligence, Operations, 
Science and Technology, and the Director of Central Intelligence Area; 
the CIA Information and Privacy Coordinator; the Chief, Historical 
Review Group; the Chair, Publications Review Board; the Chief, Records 
Declassification Program; and representatives from the Office of General 
Counsel, the Office of Congressional Affairs, and the Public Affairs 
Staff.
    (2) Authorities and activities. The Panel shall meet on a regular 
schedule and may take action when a simple majority of the total 
membership is present. The Panel shall advise and assist the HRPB on all 
information release issues, monitor the adequacy and timeliness of 
Agency releases, set component search and review priorities, review 
adequacy of resources available to and planning for all Agency release 
programs, and perform such other functions as deemed necessary by the 
Board. The Information and Privacy Coordinator also serves as Executive 
Secretary of the Panel. The Chair may request interested parties to 
participate when special equities or expertise are involved. The Panel, 
functioning as a committee of the whole or through individual members, 
will make final Agency decisions from appeals of initial adverse 
decisions under the Freedom of Information Act and such other 
information release decisions made under 32 CFR parts 1901, 1907, and 
1908. Issues shall be decided by a majority of members present; in all 
cases of a divided vote, any member of the ARP then present may refer 
such matter to the HRPB by written memorandum to the Executive Secretary 
of the HRPB. Matters decided by the Panel or Board will be deemed a 
final decision by the Agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1901.42  Right of appeal and appeal procedures.

    (a) Right of Appeal. A right of administrative appeal exists 
whenever access to any requested record or any portion thereof is 
denied, no records are located in response to a request, or a request 
for amendment is denied. The Agency will apprise all requesters in 
writing of their right to appeal such decisions to the CIA Agency 
Release Panel through the Coordinator.
    (b) Requirements as to time and form. Appeals of decisions must be 
received by the Coordinator within forty-five (45) days of the date of 
the Agency's initial decision. The Agency may, for good cause and as a 
matter of administrative discretion, permit an additional thirty (30) 
days for the submission of an appeal. All appeals to the Panel shall be 
in writing and addressed as specified in 32 CFR 1901.03. All appeals 
must identify the documents or portions of documents at issue with 
specificity, provide the desired amending language (if applicable), and 
may present such information, data, and argument in support as the 
requester may desire.
    (c) Exceptions. No appeal shall be accepted if the requester has 
outstanding fees for information services at this or

[[Page 424]]

another federal agency. In addition, no appeal shall be accepted if the 
information in question has been the subject of an administrative review 
within the previous two (2) years or is the subject of pending 
litigation in the federal courts.
    (d) Receipt, recording, and tasking. The Agency shall promptly 
record each administrative appeal, acknowledge receipt to the requester 
in writing, and thereafter effect the necessary taskings to the Deputy 
Director(s) in charge of the directorate(s) which originated or has an 
interest in the record(s) subject to the appeal. As used herein, the 
term Deputy Director includes an equivalent senior official within the 
DCI-area as well as a designee known as the Information Review Officer 
for a directorate or area.


<R05>
Sec. 1901.43  Determination(s) by Deputy Director(s).

    Each Deputy Director in charge of a directorate which originated or 
has an interest in any of the records subject to the appeal, or 
designee, is a required party to any appeal; other interested parties 
may become involved through the request of the Coordinator when it is 
determined that some or all of the information is also within their 
official cognizance. These parties shall respond in writing to the 
Coordinator with a finding as to the exempt or non-exempt status of the 
information including citations to the applicable exemption and/or their 
agreement or disagreement as to the requested amendment and the reasons 
therefore. Each response shall be provided expeditiously on a ``first-
in, first-out'' basis taking into account the business requirements of 
the parties and consistent with the information rights of members of the 
general public under the various information review and release laws.


<R05>
Sec. 1901.44  Action by appeals authority.

    (a) Preparation of docket. The Coordinator, acting as the Executive 
Secretary of the Agency Release Panel, shall place administrative 
appeals of Privacy Act requests ready for adjudication on the agenda at 
the next occurring meeting of that Panel. The Executive Secretary shall 
provide a summation memorandum for consideration of the members; the 
complete record of the request consisting of the request, the 
document(s) (sanitized and full text) at issue, and the findings of the 
concerned Deputy Director(s) or designee(s).
    (b) Decision by the Agency Release Panel. The Agency Release Panel 
shall meet and decide requests sitting as a committee of the whole. 
Decisions are by majority vote of those present at a meeting and shall 
be based on the written record and their deliberations; no personal 
appearances shall be permitted without the express permission of the 
Panel.
    (c) Decision by the Historical Records Policy Board. In any cases of 
divided vote by the ARP, any member of that body is authorized to refer 
the request to the CIA Historical Records Policy Board which acts as the 
senior corporate board for the Agency. The record compiled (the request, 
the memoranda filed by the originator and interested parties, and the 
previous decision(s)) as well as any memorandum of law or policy the 
referent desires to be considered, shall be certified by the Executive 
Secretary of the Agency Release Panel and shall constitute the official 
record of the proceedings and must be included in any subsequent 
filings.


<R05>
Sec. 1901.45  Notification of decision and right of judicial review.

    (a) In general. The Executive Secretary of the Agency Release Panel 
shall promptly prepare and communicate the decision of the Panel or 
Board to the requester. With respect to any decision to deny information 
or deny amendment, that correspondence shall state the reasons for the 
decision, identify the officer responsible, and include a notice of the 
right to judicial review.
    (b) For amendment requests. With further respect to any decision to 
deny an amendment, that correspondence shall also inform the requester 
of the right to submit within forty-five (45) days a statement of his or 
her choice which shall be included in the official records of the CIA. 
In such cases, the applicable record system manager shall clearly note 
any portion of the official record which is disputed, append the

[[Page 425]]

requester's statement, and provide copies of the statement to previous 
recipients (if any are known) and to any future recipients when and if 
the disputed information is disseminated in accordance with a routine 
use.

                              Prohibitions


<R05>
Sec. 1901.51  Limitations on disclosure.

    No record which is within a system of records shall be disclosed by 
any means of communication to any individual or to another agency, 
except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written 
consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains, unless 
disclosure of the record would be:
    (a) To those officers and employees of this Agency which maintains 
the record who have a need for the record in the performance of their 
duties;
    (b) Required under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552;
    (c) For a routine use as defined in Sec. 1901.02(m), as contained in 
the Privacy Act Issuances Compilation which is published biennially in 
the Federal Register, and as described in Secs. (a)(7) and (e)(4)(D) of 
the Act;
    (d) To the Bureau of the Census for purposes of planning or carrying 
out a census or survey or related activity pursuant to the provisions of 
U.S.C. Title 13;
    (e) To a recipient who has provided the Agency with advance adequate 
written assurance that the record will be used solely as a statistical 
research or reporting record, and the record is to be transferred in a 
form that is not individually identifiable;
    (f) To the National Archives and Records Administration as a record 
which has sufficient historical or other value to warrant its continued 
preservation by the United States Government, or for evaluation by the 
Archivist of the United States or designee to determine whether the 
record has such value;
    (g) To another agency or to an instrumentality of any governmental 
jurisdiction within or under the control of the United States for a 
civil or criminal law enforcement activity if the activity is authorized 
by law, and if the head of that agency or instrumentality has made a 
written request to the CIA specifying the particular information desired 
and the law enforcement activity for which the record is sought;
    (h) To a person pursuant to a showing of compelling circumstances 
affecting the health or safety of an individual if upon such disclosure 
notification is transmitted to the last known address of such 
individual;
    (i) To either House of Congress, or, to the extent of matter within 
its jurisdiction, any committee or subcommittee thereof, any joint 
committee of Congress or subcommittee of any such joint committee;
    (j) To the Comptroller General or any of his authorized 
representatives in the course of the performance of the duties of the 
General Accounting Office; or
    (k) To any agency, government instrumentality, or other person or 
entity pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction of the 
United States or constituent states.


<R05>
Sec. 1901.52  Criminal penalties.

    (a) Unauthorized disclosure. Criminal penalties may be imposed 
against any officer or employee of the CIA who, by virtue of employment, 
has possession of or access to Agency records which contain information 
identifiable with an individual, the disclosure of which is prohibited 
by the Privacy Act or by these rules, and who, knowing that disclosure 
of the specific material is so prohibited, willfully discloses the 
material in any manner to any person or agency not entitled to receive 
same.
    (b) Unauthorized maintenance. Criminal penalties may be imposed 
against any officer or employee of the CIA who willfully maintains a 
system of records without meeting the requirements of section (e)(4) of 
the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C.552a. The Coordinator and the Inspector General 
are authorized independently to conduct such surveys and inspect such 
records as necessary from time to time to ensure that these requirements 
are met.
    (c) Unauthorized requests. Criminal penalties may be imposed upon 
any person who knowingly and willfully requests or obtains any record 
concerning an individual from the CIA under false pretenses.

[[Page 426]]

                               Exemptions


<R05>
Sec. 1901.61  Purpose and authority.

    Purpose of exemptions. This Part sets forth those systems of records 
or portions of systems of records which the Director of Central 
Intelligence has determined to exempt from the procedures established by 
this regulation and from certain provisions of the Privacy Act:
    (a) The purpose of the following specified general exemption of 
polygraph records is to prevent access and review of records which 
intimately reveal CIA operational methods. The purpose of the general 
exemption from the provisions of sections (c)(3) and (e)(3) (A)-(D) of 
the Privacy Act is to avoid disclosures that may adversely affect 
ongoing operational relationships with other intelligence and related 
organizations and thus reveal or jeopardize intelligence sources and 
methods or risk exposure of intelligence sources and methods in the 
processing of covert employment applications.
    (b) The purpose of the general exemption from sections (d), 
(e)(4)(G), (f)(1), and (g) of the Privacy Act is to protect only those 
portions of systems of records which if revealed would risk exposure of 
intelligence sources and methods or hamper the ability of the CIA to 
effectively use information received from other agencies or foreign 
governments.
    (c) It should be noted that by subjecting information which would 
consist of, reveal, or pertain to intelligence sources and methods to 
separate determinations by the Director of Central Intelligence under 
the provision entitled ``General exemptions,'' 32 CFR 1901.62 regarding 
access and notice, an intent is established to apply the exemption from 
access and notice only in those cases where notice in itself would 
constitute a revelation of intelligence sources and methods; in all 
cases where only access to information would reveal such source or 
method, notice will be given upon request.
    (d) The purpose of the general exemption for records that consist 
of, pertain to, or would otherwise reveal the identities of employees 
who provide information to the Office of the Inspector General is to 
implement section 17 of the CIA Act of 1949, as amended, 50 U.S.C. 
403q(e)(3), and to ensure that no action constituting a reprisal or 
threat of reprisal is taken because an employee has cooperated with the 
Office of Inspector General.
    (e) The purpose of the specific exemptions provided for under 
section (k) of the Privacy Act is to exempt only those portions of 
systems of records which would consist of, reveal, or pertain to that 
information which is enumerated in that section of the Act.
    (f) In each case, the Director of Central Intelligence currently or 
then in office has determined that the enumerated classes of information 
should be exempt in order to comply with dealing with the proper 
classification of national defense or foreign policy information; 
protect the identification of persons who provide information to the CIA 
Inspector General; protect the privacy of other persons who supplied 
information under an implied or express grant of confidentiality in the 
case of law enforcement or employment and security suitability 
investigations (or promotion material in the case of the armed 
services); protect information used in connection with protective 
services under 18 U.S.C. 3056; protect the efficacy of testing 
materials; and protect information which is required by statute to be 
maintained and used solely as statistical records.


<R05>
Sec. 1901.62  General exemptions.

    (a) Pursuant to authority granted in section (j) of the Privacy Act, 
the Director of Central Intelligence has determined to exempt from all 
sections of the Act--except sections 552a(b); (c) (1) and (2); (e) (1), 
(4) (A)-(F), (5), (6), (7), (9), (10), and (11); and (i)--the following 
systems of records or portions of records in a system of record:

    (1) Polygraph records.
    (2) [Reserved].

    (b) Pursuant to authority granted in section (j) of the Privacy Act, 
the Director of Central Intelligence has determined to exempt from 
sections (c)(3) and (e)(3) (A)-(D) of the Act all systems of records 
maintained by this Agency.

[[Page 427]]

    (c) Pursuant to authority granted in section (j) of the Privacy Act, 
the Director of Central Intelligence has determined to exempt from 
notification under sections (e)(4)(G) and (f)(1) those portions of each 
and all systems of records which have been exempted from individual 
access under section (j) in those cases where the Coordinator determines 
after advice by the responsible components that confirmation of the 
existence of a record may jeopardize intelligence sources and methods. 
In such cases the Agency must neither confirm nor deny the existence of 
the record and will advise a requester that there is no record which is 
available pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974.
    (d) Pursuant to authority granted in section (j) of the Privacy Act, 
the Director of Central Intelligence has determined to exempt from 
access by individuals under section (d) of the Act those portions and 
only those portions of all systems of records maintained by the CIA 
that:
    (1) Consist of, pertain to, or would otherwise reveal intelligence 
sources and methods;
    (2) Consist of documents or information provided by any foreign 
government entity, international organization, or, any United States 
federal, state, or other public agency or authority; and
    (3) Consist of information which would reveal the identification of 
persons who provide information to the CIA Inspector General.
    (e) Pursuant to authority granted in section (j) of the Privacy Act, 
the Director of Central Intelligence has determined to exempt from 
judicial review under section (g) of the Act all determinations to deny 
access under section (d) of the Act and all decisions to deny notice 
under sections (e)(4)(G) and (f)(1) of the Act pursuant to determination 
made under paragraph (c) of this section when it has been determined by 
an appropriate official of the CIA that such access would disclose 
information which would:
    (1) Consist of, pertain to, or otherwise reveal intelligence sources 
and methods;
    (2) Consist of documents or information provided by any foreign 
government entity, international organization, or, any United States 
federal, state, or other public agency or authority; and
    (3) Consist of information which would reveal the identification of 
persons who provide information to the CIA Inspector General.


<R05>
Sec. 1901.63  Specific exemptions.

    Pursuant to authority granted in section (k) of the Privacy Act, the 
Director of Central Intelligence has determined to exempt from section 
(d) of the Privacy Act those portions and only those portions of all 
systems of records maintained by the CIA that would consist of, pertain 
to, or otherwise reveal information that is:
    (a) Classified pursuant to Executive Order 12958 (or successor or 
prior Order) and thus subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1) 
and 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1);
    (b) Investigatory in nature and compiled for law enforcement 
purposes, other than material within the scope of section (j)(2) of the 
Act; provided however, that if an individual is denied any right, 
privilege, or benefit to which they are otherwise eligible, as a result 
of the maintenance of such material, then such material shall be 
provided to that individual except to the extent that the disclosure 
would reveal the identity of a source who furnished the information to 
the United States Government under an express promise of 
confidentiality, or, prior to the effective date of this section, under 
an implied promise of confidentiality;
    (c) Maintained in connection with providing protective services to 
the President of the United States or other individuals pursuant to 18 
U.S.C. 3056;
    (d) Required by statute to be maintained and used solely as 
statistical records;
    (e) Investigatory in nature and compiled solely for the purpose of 
determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for federal 
civilian employment, military service, federal contracts, or access to 
classified information, but only to the extent that the disclosure of

               Subpart F--Declassification and Downgrading

    Authority: Sec. 5-402 of Executive Order 12065.


<R05>
Sec. 1902.13  Declassification and Downgrading Policy.

    (a)--(b) [Reserved]
    (c) The Executive Order provides that in some cases the need to 
protect properly classified information ``may be outweighed by the 
public interest in disclosure of the information,'' and that ``when such 
questions arise'' the competing interests in protection and disclosure 
are to be balanced. The Order further provides that the information is 
to be declassified in such cases if the balance is struck in favor of 
disclosure. The drafters of the Order recognized that such cases would 
be rare and that declassification decisions in such cases would remain 
the responsibility of the Executive Branch. For purposes of these 
provisions, a question as to whether the public interest favoring the 
continued protection of properly classified information is outweighed by 
a public interest in the disclosure of that information will be deemed 
to exist only in circumstances where, in the judgment of the agency, 
nondisclosure could reasonably be expected to:
    (1) Place a person's life in jeopardy.
    (2) Adversely affect the public health and safety.
    (3) Impede legitimate law enforcement functions.
    (4) Impede the investigative or oversight functions of the Congress.
    (5) Obstruct the fair administration of justice.
    (6) Deprive the public of information indispensable to public 
decisions on issues of critical national importance (effective for 
declassification reviews conducted on or after 1 February 1980).
    (d) When a case arises that requires a balancing of interests under 
paragraph (c) above, the reviewing official shall refer the matter to an 
Agency official having Top Secret classification authority, who shall 
balance. If it appears that the public interest in disclosure of the 
information may outweigh any continuing need for its protection, the 
case shall be referred with a recommendation for decision to the 
appropriate Deputy Director or Head of Independent Office. If those 
officials believe disclosure may be warranted, they, in coordination 
with OGC, as appropriate, shall refer the matter and a recommendation to 
the DDCI. If the DDCI determines that the public interest in disclosure 
of the information outweighs any damage to national security that might 
reasonably be expected to result from disclosure, the information shall 
be declassified.

responsibility of the Director of Central Intelligence to protect 
intelligence sources and methods;
    (iii) Disclosure would violate a specific CIA regulation or 
directive;

    (vi) Disclosure would unduly interfere with the orderly conduct of 
CIA's functions.
    (d) If oral or written testimony is sought by a demand in a case or 
matter in which the CIA is not a party, a reasonably detailed 
description of the testimony sought, in the form of an affidavit or, if 
that is not feasible, a written statement, by the party seeking the 
testimony or by the party's attorney must be furnished to the CIA Office

attorney from the Office of General Counsel, after consultation with the 
Department of Justice, shall appear before and furnish the court or 
other competent authority with a copy of this Regulation and state that 
the demand has been or is being, as the case may be, referred for the 
prompt consideration of the appropriate CIA officials, and shall

pending receipt of the requested instructions.
    (g) If the court or other authority declines to stay the demand

accordance with Sec. 1905.4(g), or rules that the demand must be 
complied with irrespective of instructions rendered in accordance with 
this part not to produce the material or disclose the information 
sought, the employee upon whom the demand has been made shall, if so

    (iii) The decision that compliance would result in that alteration 
or those burdens must be made by the Director after considering all of 
the Agency's resources available for use in the funding and operation of 
the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written 
statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion.
    (iv) If an action would result in that alteration or those burdens, 
the Agency shall take any other action that would not result in the 
alteration or burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals 
with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or 
activity.
    (b) Methods. (1) The Agency may comply with the requirements of this 
section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of 
services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, 
home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, 
alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, 
use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in 
making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps.

existing facilities if other methods are effective in achieving 
compliance with this section.
    (3) The Agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall

of this section, the Agency shall give priority to those methods that 
offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in 
the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The Agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section within 60 days of the 
effective date of this part except that if structural changes in 
facilities are undertaken, the changes shall be made within 3

[[Page 439]]

years of the effective date of this part, but in any event as 
expeditiously as possible.
    (d) Transition plan. (1) In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
Agency shall develop, within 6 months of the effective date of this 
part, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete 
those changes.
    (2) The Agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, 
including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing 
individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the 
transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy 
of the transition plan must be made available for public inspection.
    (3) The plan must, at a minimum--
    (i) Identify physical obstacles in the Agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals 
with handicaps;
    (ii) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (iii) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition

plan.


<R05>

established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19-607, apply to buildings 
covered by this section.

communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public as follows:
    (1)(i) The Agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids if 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the Agency.
    (ii) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
Agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the

by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate 
with persons with impaired hearing.

persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The Agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the Agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where Agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the Agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 1906.160 would 
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Agency head or 
his or her designee after considering all Agency resources available for 
use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity 
and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for 
reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply

[[Page 440]]

with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, 
the Agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an 
alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the 
maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits 
and services of the program or activity.

the Director of Central Intelligence to facilitate the processing of 
administrative appeals under the mandatory declassification review 
provisions of this Order. Their membership, authority, and rules of 
procedure are as follows.
    (b) Historical Records Policy Board (``HRPB'' or ``Board''). This 
Board, the successor to the CIA Information Review Committee, acts as 
the senior corporate board in the CIA on all matters of information 
review and release. It is composed of the Executive Director, who serves 
as its Chair, the Deputy Director for Administration, the Deputy 
Director for Intelligence, the Deputy Director for Operations, the 
Deputy Director for Science and Technology, the General Counsel, the 
Director of Congressional Affairs, the Director of the Public Affairs 
Staff, the Director, Center for the Study of Intelligence, and the 
Associate Deputy Director for Administration/Information Services, or 
their designees. The Board, by majority vote, may delegate to one or 
more of its members the authority to act on any appeal or other matter 
or authorize the Chair to delegate such authority, as long as such 
delegation is not to the same individual or body who made the initial 
denial. The Executive Secretary of the HRPB is the Director, Information 
Management. The Chair may request interested parties to participate when 
special equities or expertise are involved.
    (c) Agency Release Panel (``ARP'' or ``Panel''). The HRPB, pursuant 
to its delegation of authority, has established a subordinate Agency 
Release Panel. This Panel is composed of the Director, Information 
Management, who serves as its Chair; the Information Review Officers 
from the Directorates of Administration, Intelligence, Operations, 
Science and Technology, and the Director of Central Intelligence Area; 
the CIA Information and Privacy Coordinator; the Chief, Historical 
Review Group; the Chair, Publications Review Board; the Chief, Records 
Declassification Program; and representatives from the Offices of 
General Counsel and Congressional Affairs, and the Public Affairs Staff. 
The Information and Privacy Coordinator also serves as the Executive 
Secretary of the Panel. The Panel advises and assists the HRPB on all 
information release issues, monitors the adequacy and timeliness of 
Agency releases, sets component search and review priorities, reviews 
adequacy of resources available to and planning for all Agency release 
programs, and performs such other functions as deemed necessary by the 
Board. The Chair may request interested parties to participate when 
special equities or expertise are involved. The Panel, functioning as a 
committee of the whole or through individual members, will make final 
Agency decisions from appeals of initial denial decisions under E.O. 
12958. Issues not resolved by the Panel will be referred by the Panel to 
the HRPB. Matters decided by the Panel or Board will be deemed a final 
decision by the Agency.


<R05>
Sec. 1908.35  Action by appeals authority.

    (a) Action by Agency Release Panel. The Coordinator, in his or her 
capacity as Executive Secretary of the Agency Release Panel, shall place 
appeals of mandatory declassification review requests ready for 
adjudication on the agenda at the next occurring meeting of the Agency 
Release Panel. The Executive Secretary shall provide a summation 
memorandum for consideration of the members, the complete record of the 
request consisting of the request, the document(s) (sanitized and full 
text) at issue, and the findings of the originator and interested 
parties. The Panel shall meet and decide requests sitting as a committee 
of the whole. Decisions are by majority vote of those present at a 
meeting and shall be based on the written record and their 
deliberations; no personal appearances shall be permitted without the 
express permission of the Panel.
    (b) Action by Historical Records Policy Board. In any cases of 
divided vote by

[[Page 448]]

the ARP, any member of that body is authorized to refer the request to 
the CIA Historical Records Policy Board which acts as the senior 
corporate board for the Agency. The record compiled (the request, the 
memoranda filed by the originator and interested parties, and the 
previous decision(s)) as well as any memorandum of law or policy the 
referent desires to be considered, shall be certified by the Executive 
Secretary of the Agency Release Panel and shall constitute the official 
record of the proceedings and must be included in any subsequent 
filings.


<R05>
Sec. 1908.36  Notification of decision and right of further appeal.

    The Coordinator shall communicate the decision of the Panel or Board 
to the requester, NARA, or the particular Presidential Library within 
ten (10) days of such decision. That correspondence shall include a 
notice that an appeal of the decision may be made to the Interagency 
Security Classification Appeals Panel (ISCAP) established pursuant to 
Sec. 5.4 of this Order.

Sec. 1909.04  Suggestions and complaints.

    The Agency welcomes suggestions or complaints with regard to its 
administration of the historical access program established pursuant to 
Executive Order 12958. Letters of suggestion or complaint should 
identify the specific purpose and the issues for consideration. The 
Agency will respond to all substantive communications and take such 
actions as determined feasible and appropriate.

                     Requests for Historical Access


<R05>
Sec. 1909.11  Requirements as to who may apply.

    (a) Historical researchers--(1) In general. Any historian engaged in 
a historical research project as defined above may submit a request in 
writing to the Coordinator to be given access to classified information 
for purposes of that research. Any such request shall indicate the 
nature, purpose, and scope of the research project.
    (2) Additional considerations. In light of the very limited 
resources for the Agency's various historical programs, it is the policy 
of the Agency to consider applications for historical research 
privileges only in those instances where the researcher's needs cannot 
be satisfied through requests for access to reasonably described

[[Page 450]]

records under the Freedom of Information Act or the mandatory 
declassification review provisions of Executive Order 12958 and where 
issues of internal resource availability and fairness to all members of 
the historical research community militate in favor of a particular 
grant.
    (b) Former Presidential appointees. Any former Presidential 
appointee as defined herein may also submit a request to be given access 
to any classified records which they originated, reviewed, signed, or 
received while serving in that capacity. Such appointees may also 
request approval for a research associate but there is no entitlement to 
such enlargement of access and the decision in this regard shall be in 
the sole discretion of the Agency. Requests from appointees shall be in 
writing to the Coordinator and shall identify the records of interest.


<R05>
Sec. 1909.12  Designations of authority to hear requests.

    The Deputy Director for Administration has designated the 
Coordinator, the Agency Release Panel, and the Historical Records Policy 
Board, established pursuant to 32 CFR 1900.41, as the Agency authorities 
to decide requests for historical and former Presidential appointee 
access under Executive Order 12958 (or successor Orders) and these 
regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 1909.13  Receipt, recording, and tasking.

    The Information and Privacy Coordinator shall within ten (10) days 
record each request for historical access received under this Part, 
acknowledge receipt to the requester in writing and take the following 
action:
    (a) Compliance with general requirements. The Coordinator shall 
review each request under this part and determine whether it meets the 
general requirements as set forth in 32 CFR 1909.11; if it does not, the 
Coordinator shall so notify the requester and explain the legal basis 
for this decision.
    (b) Action on requests meeting general requirements. For requests 
which meet the requirements of 32 CFR 1909.11, the Coordinator shall 
thereafter task the D/CSI, the originator(s) of the materials for which 
access is sought, and other interested parties. Additional taskings, as 
required during the review process, shall be accomplished within ten 
(10) days of notification.


<R05>
Sec. 1909.14  Determinations by tasked officials.

    (a) Required determinations. The tasked parties as specified below 
shall respond in writing to the Coordinator with recommended findings to 
the following issues:
    (1) That a serious professional or scholarly research project by the 
requester is contemplated (by D/CSI);
    (2) That such access is clearly consistent with the interests of 
national security (by originator and interested party, if any);
    (3) That a non-disclosure agreement has been or will be executed by 
the requester (or research associate, if any) and other appropriate 
steps have been taken to assure that classified information will not be 
disclosed or otherwise compromised (by Director of Personnel Security 
and representative of the Office of General Counsel);
    (4) That a pre-publication agreement has been or will be executed by 
the requester (or research associate, if any) which provides for a 
review of notes and any resulting manuscript (by Director of Personnel 
Security and representative of the Office of General Counsel);
    (5) That the information requested is reasonably accessible and can 
be located and compiled with a reasonable effort (by D/CSI and 
originator);
    (6) That it is reasonably expected that substantial and substantive 
government documents and/or information will be amenable to 
declassification and release and/or publication (by D/CSI and 
originator);
    (7) That sufficient resources are available for the administrative 
support of the researcher given current mission requirements (by D/CSI 
and originator); and,
    (8) That the request cannot be satisfied to the same extent through 
requests for access to reasonably described records under the Freedom of 
Information Act or the mandatory declassification review provisions of 
Executive Order 12958 (by Coordinator, D/CSI and originator).

[[Page 451]]

    (b) Time. These responses shall be provided expeditiously on a 
``first-in, first-out'' basis taking into account the business 
requirements of the tasked offices and consistent with the information 
rights of members of the general public under the Freedom of Information 
Act and the Privacy Act. The Agency will utilize its best efforts to 
complete action on requests under this part within thirty (30) days of 
date of receipt.


<R05>
Sec. 1909.15  Action by hearing authority.

    Action by Agency Release Panel. The Coordinator, in his or her 
capacity as Executive Secretary of the Agency Release Panel, shall place 
historical access requests ready for adjudication on the agenda at the 
next occurring meeting of the Agency Release Panel. The Executive 
Secretary shall provide a summation memorandum for consideration of the 
members, the complete record of the request consisting of the request 
and the findings of the tasked parties. The Panel shall meet and decide 
requests sitting as a committee of the whole on the basis of the eight 
factors enumerated at 32 CFR 1909.14(a). Decisions are by majority vote 
of those present at a meeting and shall be based on the written record 
and their deliberations; no personal appearances shall be permitted 
without the express permission of the Panel.


<R05>
Sec. 1909.16  Action by appeal authority.

    In any cases of divided vote by the ARP, any member of that body is 
authorized to refer the request to the CIA Historical Records Policy 
Board which acts as the senior corporate board for the Agency. The 
record compiled (the request, the memoranda filed by the originator and 
interested parties, and the previous decision(s)) as well as any 
memorandum of law or policy the referent desires to be considered, shall 
be certified by the Executive Secretary of the Agency Release Panel and 
shall constitute the official record of the proceedings and must be 
included in any subsequent filings. In such cases, the factors to be 
determined as specified in 32 CFR 1909.14(a) will be considered by the 
Board de novo and that decision shall be final.


<R05>
Sec. 1909.17  Notification of decision.

    The Coordinator shall inform the requester of the decision of the 
Agency Release Panel or the Historical Records Policy Board within ten 
(10) days of the decision and, if favorable, shall manage the access for 
such period as deemed required but in no event for more than two (2) 
years unless renewed by the Panel or Board in accordance with the 
requirements of 32 CFR 1909.14(a).


<R05>
Sec. 1909.18  Termination of access.

    The Coordinator shall cancel any authorization whenever the Director 
of Personnel Security cancels the security clearance of a requester (or 
research associate, if any) or whenever the Agency Release Panel 
determines that continued access would not be in compliance with one or 
more of the requirements of 32 CFR 1909.14(a).

                        Subpart A--Classification


<R05>
Sec. 2001.10  Classification definitions and standards [1.1 and 1.2].\1\

    (a) Definitions. (1) An original classification authority with 
jurisdiction over the information includes:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Bracketed references pertain to related sections of Executive 
Order 12958.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) The official who authorized the original classification, if that 
official is still serving in the same position;
    (ii) The originator's current successor in function;
    (iii) A supervisory official of either; or
    (iv) The senior agency official under Executive Order 12958 (``the 
Order'').
    (2) Permanently valuable information or permanent historical value 
refers to information contained in:
    (i) Records that have been accessioned into the National Archives of 
the United States;
    (ii) Records that have been scheduled as permanent under a records 
retention schedule approved by the National Archives and Records 
Administration (NARA); and
    (iii) Presidential historical materials, presidential records or 
donated historical materials located in the National Archives of the 
United States, a presidential library, or any other approved repository.
    (b) Identifying or describing damage to the national security. 
Section 1.2(a) of the Order sets forth the conditions for classifying 
information in the first instance. One of these conditions, the ability 
to identify or describe the damage to the national security, is critical 
to the process of making an original classification decision. There is 
no requirement, at the time of the decision, for the original 
classification authority to prepare a written description of such 
damage. However, the original classification authority must be able to 
support the decision in writing, including identifying or describing the 
damage, should the classification decision become the subject of a 
challenge or access demand.

[[Page 455]]


<R05>
Sec. 2001.11  Classification authority [1.4].

    (a) General. Agencies with original classification authority shall 
establish a training program for original classifiers in accordance with 
subpart D of this part.
    (b) Requests for original classification authority. Agencies not 
possessing such authority shall forward requests to the Director of the 
Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO). The agency head must make 
the request and shall provide a specific justification of the need for 
this authority. The Director of ISOO shall forward the request, along 
with the Director's recommendation, to the President through the 
Director of the Office of Management and Budget within 30 days. Agencies 
wishing to increase their assigned level of original classification 
authority shall forward requests in accordance with the procedures of 
this section.


<R05>
Sec. 2001.12  Duration of classification [1.6].

    (a) Determining duration of classification for information 
originally classified under the Order--(1) Establishing duration of 
classification. When determining the duration of classification for 
information originally classified under this Order, an original 
classification authority shall follow the sequence listed in paragraphs 
(a)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section.
    (i) The original classification authority shall attempt to determine 
a date or event that is less than 10 years from the date of original 
classification and which coincides with the lapse of the information's 
national security sensitivity, and shall assign such date or event as 
the declassification instruction.
    (ii) If unable to determine a date or event of less than 10 years, 
the original classification authority shall ordinarily assign a 
declassification date that is 10 years from the date of the original 
classification decision.
    (iii) The original classification authority may assign an exemption 
designation to the information only if the information qualifies for 
exemption from automatic declassification as described in section 1.6(d) 
of the Order. Unless declassified earlier, such information contained in 
records determined by the Archivist of the United States to be 
permanently valuable shall remain classified for 25 years from the date 
of its origin, at which time it will be subject to section 3.4 of the 
Order.
    (2) Extending duration of classification for information originally 
classified under the Order. Extensions of classification are not 
automatic. If an original classification authority with jurisdiction 
over the information does not extend the classification of information 
assigned a date or event for declassification, the information is 
automatically declassified upon the occurrence of the date or event. If 
an original classification authority has assigned a date or event for 
declassification that is 10 years or less from the date of 
classification, an original classification authority with jurisdiction 
over the information may extend the classification duration of such 
information for additional periods not to exceed 10 years at a time.
    (i) For information in records determined to have permanent 
historical value, successive extensions may not exceed a total of 25 
years from the date of the information's origin. Continued 
classification of this information beyond 25 years is governed by 
section 3.4 of the Order.
    (ii) For information in records not determined to have permanent 
historical value, successive extensions may exceed 25 years from the 
date of the information's origin.
    (3) Conditions for extending classification. When extending the 
duration of classification, the original classification authority must:
    (i) Be an original classification authority with jurisdiction over 
the information;
    (ii) Ensure that the information continues to meet the standards for 
classification under the Order; and
    (iii) Make reasonable attempts to notify all known holders of the 
information.
    (b) Information classified under prior orders--(1) Specific date or 
event. Unless declassified earlier, information marked with a specific 
date or event for declassification under a prior order is automatically 
declassified upon that

[[Page 456]]

date or event. However, if the information is contained in records 
determined by the Archivist of the United States to be permanently 
valuable, and the prescribed date or event will take place more than 25 
years from the information's origin, the declassification of the 
information will instead be subject to section 3.4 of the Order.
    (2) Indefinite duration of classification. For information marked 
``Originating Agency's Determination Required,'' its acronym ``OADR,'' 
or with some other marking indicating an indefinite duration of 
classification under a prior order:
    (i) A declassification authority, as defined in section 3.1 of the 
Order, may declassify it;
    (ii) An authorized original classification authority with 
jurisdiction over the information may re-mark the information to 
establish a duration of classification consistent with the requirements 
for information originally classified under the Order, as provided in 
paragraph (a) of this section; or
    (iii) Unless declassified earlier, such information contained in 
records determined by the Archivist of the United States to be 
permanently valuable shall remain classified for 25 years from the date 
of its origin, at which time it will be subject to section 3.4 of the 
Order.
    (c) Foreign government information. The declassifying agency is the 
agency that initially received or classified the information. When 
foreign government information is being considered for declassification 
or appears to be subject to automatic declassification, the 
declassifying agency shall determine whether the information is subject 
to a treaty or international agreement that would prevent its 
declassification at that time. Depending on the age of the information 
and whether it is contained in permanently valuable records, the 
declassifying agency shall also determine if another exemption under 
section 1.6(d) (other than section 1.6(d)(5)) or 3.4(b) of the Order, 
such as the exemptions that pertain to United States foreign relations, 
may apply to the information. If the declassifying agency believes such 
an exemption may apply, it should consult with any other concerned 
agencies in making its declassification determination. The declassifying 
agency or the Department of State, as appropriate, should consult with 
the foreign government prior to declassification.
    (d) Determining when information is subject to automatic 
declassification. The ``date of the information's origin'' or ``the 
information's origin,'' as used in the Order and this part, pertains to 
the date that specific information, which is contemporaneously or 
subsequently classified, is first recorded in an agency's records, or in 
presidential historical materials, presidential records or donated 
historical materials. The following examples illustrate this process:

    Example 1. An agency first issues a classification guide on the F-99 
aircraft on October 20, 1995. The guide states that the fact that the F-
99 aircraft has a maximum velocity of 500 m.p.h. shall be classified at 
the ``Secret'' level for a period of ten years. A document dated July 
10, 1999, is classified because it includes the maximum velocity of the 
F-99. The document should be marked for declassification on October 20, 
2005, ten years after the specific information was first recorded in the 
guide, not on July 10, 2009, ten years after the derivatively classified 
document was created.
    Example 2. An agency classification guide issued on October 20, 
1995, states that the maximum velocity of any fighter aircraft shall be 
classified at the ``Secret'' level for a period of ten years. The agency 
first records the specific maximum velocity of the new F-88 aircraft on 
July 10, 1999. The document should be marked for declassification on 
July 10, 2009, ten years after the specific information is first 
recorded, and not on October 20, 2005, ten years after the date of the 
guide's generic instruction.


<R05>
Sec. 2001.13  Classification challenges [1.9].

    (a) Challenging classification. Authorized holders wishing to 
challenge the classification status of information shall present such 
challenges to an original classification authority with jurisdiction 
over the information. An authorized holder is any individual, including 
an individual external to the agency, who has been granted access to 
specific classified information in accordance with section 4.2(g) of the 
Order. A formal challenge under this provision must be in writing, but 
need not be any more specific than to question why information is or is 
not classified, or is classified at a certain level.

[[Page 457]]

    (b) Agency procedures. (1) Because the Order encourages authorized 
holders to challenge classification as a means for promoting proper and 
thoughtful classification actions, agencies shall ensure that no 
retribution is taken against any authorized holders bringing such a 
challenge in good faith.
    (2) Agencies shall establish a system for processing, tracking and 
recording formal classification challenges made by authorized holders. 
Agencies shall consider classification challenges separately from 
Freedom of Information Act or other access requests, and shall not 
process such challenges in turn with pending access requests.
    (3) The agency shall provide an initial written response to a 
challenge within 60 days. If the agency is unable to respond to the 
challenge within 60 days, the agency must acknowledge the challenge in 
writing, and provide a date by which the agency will respond. The 
acknowledgment must include a statement that if no agency response is 
received within 120 days, the challenger has the right to forward the 
challenge to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel for a 
decision. The challenger may also forward the challenge to the 
Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel if an agency has not 
responded to an internal appeal within 90 days of the agency's receipt 
of the appeal. Agency responses to those challenges it denies shall 
include the challenger's appeal rights to the Interagency Security 
Classification Appeals Panel.
    (4) Whenever an agency receives a classification challenge to 
information that has been the subject of a challenge within the past two 
years, or that is the subject of pending litigation, the agency is not 
required to process the challenge beyond informing the challenger of 
this fact and of the challenger's appeal rights, if any.
    (c) Additional considerations. (1) Challengers and agencies shall 
attempt to keep all challenges, appeals and responses unclassified. 
However, classified information contained in a challenge, an agency 
response, or an appeal shall be handled and protected in accordance with 
the Order and its implementing directives. Information being challenged 
for classification shall remain classified unless and until a final 
decision is made to declassify it.
    (2) The classification challenge provision is not intended to 
prevent an authorized holder from informally questioning the 
classification status of particular information. Such informal inquiries 
should be encouraged as a means of holding down the number of formal 
challenges.


<R05>
Sec. 2001.14  Classification guides [2.3].

    (a) Preparation of classification guides. Originators of 
classification guides are encouraged to consult users of guides for 
input when developing or updating guides. When possible, originators of 
classification guides are encouraged to communicate within their 
agencies and with other agencies that are developing guidelines for 
similar activities to ensure the consistency and uniformity of 
classification decisions. Each agency shall maintain a list of its 
classification guides in use.
    (b) General content of classification guides. Classification guides 
shall, at a minimum:
    (1) Identify the subject matter of the classification guide;
    (2) Identify the original classification authority by name or 
personal identifier, and position;
    (3) Identify an agency point-of-contact or points-of-contact for 
questions regarding the classification guide;
    (4) Provide the date of issuance or last review;
    (5) State precisely the elements of information to be protected;
    (6) State which classification level applies to each element of 
information, and, when useful, specify the elements of information that 
are unclassified;
    (7) State, when applicable, special handling caveats;
    (8) Prescribe declassification instructions or the exemption 
category from automatic declassification for each element of 
information;
    (9) Specify, when citing the exemption category listed in section 
1.6(d)(8) of the Order, the applicable statute, treaty or international 
agreement; and
    (10) State a concise reason for classification which, at a minimum, 
cites the applicable classification category or categories in section 
1.5 of the Order.

[[Page 458]]

    (c) Dissemination of classification guides. Classification guides 
shall be disseminated as widely as necessary to ensure the proper and 
uniform derivative classification of information.
    (d) Reviewing and updating classification guides. (1) Classification 
guides, including guides created under prior orders, shall be reviewed 
and updated as circumstances require, but, in any event, at least once 
every five years. Updated instructions for guides first created under 
prior orders shall comply with the requirements of the Order and this 
part.
    (2) Originators of classification guides are encouraged to consult 
the users of guides for input when reviewing or updating guides. Also, 
users of classification guides are encouraged to notify the originator 
of the guide when they acquire information that suggests the need for 
change in the instructions contained in the guide.


<R04>
                 Subpart B--Identification and Markings


<R05>
Sec. 2001.20  General [1.7].

    A uniform security classification system requires that standard 
markings be applied to classified information. Except in extraordinary 
circumstances, or as approved by the Director of ISOO, the marking of 
classified information created after October 14, 1995, shall not deviate 
from the following prescribed formats. If markings cannot be affixed to 
specific classified information or materials, the originator shall 
provide holders or recipients of the information with written 
instructions for protecting the information. Markings shall be uniformly 
and conspicuously applied to leave no doubt about the classified status 
of the information, the level of protection required, and the duration 
of classification.


<R05>
Sec. 2001.21  Original classification [1.7(a)].

    (a) Primary markings. On the face of each originally classified 
document, including electronic media, the classifier shall apply the 
following markings.
    (1) Classification authority. The name or personal identifier, and 
position title of the original classifier shall appear on the 
``Classified By'' line. An example might appear as:

Classified By: David Smith, Chief, Division 5 or
Classified By: ID#IMNO1, Chief, Division 5

    (2) Agency and office of origin. If not otherwise evident, the 
agency and office of origin shall be identified and placed below the 
name on the ``Classified By'' line. An example might appear as:

Classified By: David Smith, Chief, Division 5 Department of Good Works, 
Office of Administration

    (3) Reason for classification. The original classifier shall 
identify the reason(s) for the decision to classify. The classifier 
shall include, at a minimum, a brief reference to the pertinent 
classification category(ies), or the number 1.5 plus the letter(s) that 
corresponds to that classification category in section 1.5 of the Order.
    (i) These categories, as they appear in the Order, are as follows:

    (a) military plans, weapons, or operations;
    (b) foreign government information;
    (c) intelligence activities (including special activities), 
intelligence sources or methods, or cryptology;
    (d) foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, 
including confidential sources;
    (e) scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to the 
national security;
    (f) United States Government programs for safeguarding nuclear 
materials or facilities; or
    (g) vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, 
projects or plans relating to the national security.

    (ii) An example might appear as:

Classified By: David Smith, Chief, Division 5, Department of Good Works, 
Office of Administration
Reason: Vulnerabilities or capabilities of plans relating to the 
national security or
Reason: 1.5(g)

    (iii) When the reason for classification is not apparent from the 
content of the information, e.g., classification by compilation, the 
classifier shall provide a more detailed explanation of the reason for 
classification.
    (4) Declassification instructions. The duration of the original 
classification

decision shall be placed on the ``Declassify On'' line. The classifier 
will apply one of the following instructions.
    (i) The classifier will apply a date or event for declassification 
that corresponds to the lapse of the information's national security 
sensitivity, which may not exceed 10 years from the date of the original 
decision. When linking the duration of classification to a specific date 
or event, mark that date or event as:

Classified By: David Smith, Chief, Division 5, Department of Good Works, 
Office of Administration
Reason: 1.5(g)
Declassify On: October 14, 2004 or
Declassify On: Completion of Operation

    (ii) When a specific date or event within 10 years cannot be 
established, the classifier will apply the date that is 10 years from 
the date of the original decision. For example, on a document that 
contains information classified on October 14, 1995, mark the 
``Declassify On'' line as:

Classified By: David Smith, Chief, Division 5, Department of Good Works, 
Office of Administration
Reason: 1.5(g)
Declassify On: October 14, 2005

    (iii) Upon the determination that the information must remain 
classified beyond 10 years, the classifier will apply the letter ``X'' 
plus a brief recitation of the exemption category(ies), or the letter 
``X'' plus the number that corresponds to that exemption category(ies) 
in section 1.6(d) of the Order.
    (A) Exemption categories in E.O. 12958.

    X1: reveal an intelligence source, method, or activity, or a 
cryptologic system or activity;
    X2: reveal information that would assist in the development or use 
of weapons of mass destruction;
    X3: reveal information that would impair the development or use of 
technology within a United States weapons system;
    X4: reveal United States military plans, or national security 
emergency preparedness plans;
    X5: reveal foreign government information;
    X6: damage relations between the United States and a foreign 
government, reveal a confidential source, or seriously undermine 
diplomatic activities that are reasonably expected to be ongoing for a 
period greater than that provided in paragraph (b) above, [section 
1.6(b) of the Order];
    X7: impair the ability of responsible United States Government 
officials to protect the President, the Vice President, and other 
individuals for whom protection services, in the interest of national 
security, are authorized; or
    X8: violate a statute, treaty, or international agreement.

    (B) Example. A document containing information exempted from 
automatic declassification may appear as:

Classified By: David Smith, Chief, Division 5, Department of Good Works, 
Office of Administration
Reason: 1.5(g)
Declassify On: X-U.S. military plans or
Declassify On: X4

    (b) Overall marking. The highest level of classified information 
contained in a document shall appear in a way that will distinguish it 
clearly from the informational text.
    (1) Conspicuously place the overall classification at the top and 
bottom of the outside of the front cover (if any), on the title page (if 
any), on the first page, and on the outside of the back cover (if any).
    (2) For documents containing information classified at more than one 
level, the overall marking shall be the highest level. For example, if a 
document contains some information marked ``Secret'' and other 
information marked ``Confidential,'' the overall marking would be 
``Secret.''
    (3) Each interior page of a classified document shall be marked at 
the top and bottom either with the highest level of classification of 
information contained on that page, including the designation 
``Unclassified'' when it is applicable, or with the highest overall 
classification of the document.
    (c) Portion marking. Each portion of a document, ordinarily a 
paragraph, but including subjects, titles, graphics and the like, shall 
be marked to indicate its classification level by placing a 
parenthetical symbol immediately preceding or following the portion to 
which it applies.
    (1) To indicate the appropriate classification level, the symbols 
``(TS)'' for Top Secret, ``(S)'' for Secret, ``(C)'' for Confidential, 
and ``(U)'' for Unclassified shall be used.

[[Page 460]]

    (2) Unless the original classification authority indicates otherwise 
on the document, each classified portion of a document exempted from 
automatic declassification shall be presumed to be exempted from 
automatic declassification also.
    (3) An agency head or senior agency official may request a waiver 
from the portion marking requirement for a specific category of 
information. Such a request shall be submitted to the Director of ISOO 
and should include the reasons that the benefits of portion marking are 
outweighed by other factors. Statements citing administrative burden 
alone will ordinarily not be viewed as sufficient grounds to support a 
waiver.
    (d) Classification extensions. (1) An original classification 
authority may extend the duration of classification for successive 
periods not to exceed 10 years at a time. For information contained in 
records determined to be permanently valuable, multiple extensions shall 
not exceed 25 years from the date of the information's origin.
    (2) The ``Declassify On'' line shall be revised to include the new 
declassification instructions, and shall include the identity of the 
person authorizing the extension and the date of the action.
    (3) The office of origin shall make reasonable attempts to notify 
all holders of such information. Classification guides shall be updated 
to reflect such revisions.
    (4) An example of an extended duration of classification may appear 
as:

Classified By: David Smith, Chief, Division 5, Department of Good Works, 
Office of Administration
Reason: 1.5(g)
    Declassify On: Classification extended on December 1, 2000, until 
December 1, 2010, by David Jones, Chief, Division 5

    (e) Marking information exempted from automatic declassification at 
25 years. (1) When an agency head or senior agency official exempts 
permanently valuable information from automatic declassification at 25 
years, the ``Declassify On'' line shall be revised to include the symbol 
``25X'' plus a brief reference to the pertinent exemption category(ies) 
or the number(s) that corresponds to that category(ies) in section 
3.4(b) of the Order. Other than when the exemption pertains to the 
identity of a confidential human source, or a human intelligence source, 
the revised ``Declassify On'' line shall also include the new date or 
event for declassification.
    (2) The pertinent exemptions, using the language of section 3.4(b) 
of the Order, are:

    25X1: reveal the identity of a confidential human source, or reveal 
information about the application of an intelligence source or method, 
or reveal the identity of a human intelligence source when the 
unauthorized disclosure of that source would clearly and demonstrably 
damage the national security interests of the United States;
    25X2: reveal information that would assist in the development or use 
of weapons of mass destruction;
    25X3: reveal information that would impair U.S. cryptologic systems 
or activities;
    25X4: reveal information that would impair the application of state-
of-the-art technology within a U.S. weapon system;
    25X5: reveal actual U.S. military war plans that remain in effect;
    25X6: reveal information that would seriously and demonstrably 
impair relations between the United States and a foreign government, or 
seriously and demonstrably undermine ongoing diplomatic activities of 
the United States;
    25X7: reveal information that would clearly and demonstrably impair 
the current ability of United States Government officials to protect the 
President, Vice President, and other officials for whom protection 
services, in the interest of national security, are authorized;
    25X8: reveal information that would seriously and demonstrably 
impair current national security emergency preparedness plans; or
    25X9: violate a statute, treaty, or international agreement.

    (3) The pertinent portion of the marking would appear as:

Declassify On: 25X-State-of-the-art technology within U.S. weapon 
system, October 1, 2010 or
Declassify On: 25X4, October 1, 2010

    (4) Documents should not be marked with a ``25X'' marking until the 
agency has been informed that the President or the Interagency Security 
Classification Appeals Panel concurs with the proposed exemption.
    (5) Agencies need not apply a ``25X'' marking to individual 
documents contained in a file series exempted from

[[Page 461]]

automatic declassification under section 3.4(c) of the Order until the 
individual document is removed from the file.


<R05>
Sec. 2001.22  Derivative classification [2.2].

    (a) General. Information classified derivatively on the basis of 
source documents or classification guides shall bear all markings 
prescribed in Sec. 2001.20 and Sec. 2001.21, except as provided in this 
section. Information for these markings shall be carried forward from 
the source document or taken from instructions in the appropriate 
classification guide.
    (b) Source of derivative classification. (1) The derivative 
classifier shall concisely identify the source document or the 
classification guide on the ``Derived From'' line, including the agency 
and, where available, the office of origin, and the date of the source 
or guide. An example might appear as:

Derived From: Memo, ``Funding Problems,'' October 20, 1995, Ofc. of 
Admin., Department of Good Works or
Derived From: CG No. 1, Department of Good Works, dated October 20, 1995

    (i) When a document is classified derivatively on the basis of more 
than one source document or classification guide, the ``Derived From'' 
line shall appear as:

Derived From: Multiple Sources

    (ii) The derivative classifier shall maintain the identification of 
each source with the file or record copy of the derivatively classified 
document. When practicable, this list should be included in or with all 
copies of the derivatively classified document.
    (2) A document derivatively classified on the basis of a source 
document that is itself marked ``Multiple Sources'' shall cite the 
source document on its ``Derived From'' line rather than the term 
``Multiple Sources.'' An example might appear as:

Derived From: Report entitled, ``New Weapons,'' dated October 20, 1995, 
Department of Good Works, Office of Administration

    (c) Reason for classification. The reason for the original 
classification decision, as reflected in the source document(s) or 
classification guide, is not required to be transferred in a derivative 
classification action. If included, however, it shall conform to the 
standards in Sec. 2001.21(a)(3).
    (d) Declassification instructions. (1) The derivative classifier 
shall carry forward the instructions on the ``Declassify On'' line from 
the source document to the derivative document, or the duration 
instruction from the classification guide.
    (2) When a document is classified derivatively on the basis of more 
than one source document or more than one element of a classification 
guide, the ``Declassify On'' line shall reflect the longest duration of 
any of its sources.
    (i) When a document is classified derivatively from a source 
document(s) or classification guide that contains the declassification 
instruction, ``Originating Agency's Determination Required,'' or 
``OADR,'' unless otherwise instructed by the original classifier, the 
derivative classifier shall carry forward:
    (A) The fact that the source document(s) was marked with this 
instruction; and
    (B) The date of origin of the most recent source document(s), 
classification guide, or specific information, as appropriate to the 
circumstances.
    (ii) An example might appear as:

Declassify On: Source marked ``OADR'', Date of source: October 20, 1990

    (iii) This marking will permit the determination of when the 
classified information is 25 years old and, if permanently valuable, 
subject to automatic declassification under section 3.4 of the Order.
    (e) Overall marking. The derivative classifier shall conspicuously 
mark the classified document with the highest level of classification of 
information included in the document, as provided in Sec. 2001.21(b).
    (f) Portion marking. Each portion of a derivatively classified 
document shall be marked in accordance with its source, and as provided 
in Sec. 2001.21(c).


<R05>
Sec. 2001.23  Additional requirements [1.7].

    (a) Marking prohibitions. Markings other than ``Top Secret,'' 
``Secret,'' and ``Confidential,'' such as ``For Official Use Only,'' or 
``Limited Official

[[Page 462]]

Use,'' shall not be used to identify classified national security 
information. No other term or phrase shall be used in conjunction with 
these markings, such as ``Secret Sensitive'' or ``Agency Confidential,'' 
to identify classified national security information. The terms ``Top 
Secret,'' ``Secret,'' and ``Confidential'' should not be used to 
identify non-classified executive branch information.
    (b) Agency prescribed special markings. Agencies shall refrain from 
the use of special markings when they merely restate or emphasize the 
principles and standards of the Order and this part. Upon request, the 
senior agency official shall provide the Director of ISOO with a written 
explanation for the use of agency special markings.
    (c) Transmittal documents. A transmittal document shall indicate on 
its face the highest classification level of any classified information 
attached or enclosed. The transmittal shall also include conspicuously 
on its face the following or similar instructions, as appropriate:

Unclassified When Classified Enclosure Removed or Upon Removal of 
Attachments, This Document is (Classification Level)

    (d) Foreign government information. Documents that contain foreign 
government information shall include the marking, ``This Document 
Contains (indicate country of origin) Information.'' The portions of the 
document that contain the foreign government information shall be marked 
to indicate the government and classification level, e.g., ``(UK-C).'' 
If the identity of the specific government must be concealed, the 
document shall be marked, ``This Document Contains Foreign Government 
Information,'' and pertinent portions shall be marked ``FGI'' together 
with the classification level, e.g., ``(FGI-C).'' In such cases, a 
separate record that identifies the foreign government shall be 
maintained in order to facilitate subsequent declassification actions. 
When classified records are transferred to the National Archives and 
Records Administration for storage or archival purposes, the 
accompanying documentation shall, at a minimum, identify the boxes that 
contain foreign government information. If the fact that information is 
foreign government information must be concealed, the markings described 
in this paragraph shall not be used and the document shall be marked as 
if it were wholly of U.S. origin.
    (e) Working papers. A working paper is defined as documents or 
materials, regardless of the media, which are expected to be revised 
prior to the preparation of a finished product for dissemination or 
retention. Working papers containing classified information shall be 
dated when created, marked with the highest classification of any 
information contained in them, protected at that level, and destroyed 
when no longer needed. When any of the following conditions applies, 
working papers shall be controlled and marked in the same manner 
prescribed for a finished document at the same classification level:
    (1) Released by the originator outside the originating activity;
    (2) Retained more than 180 days from the date of origin; or
    (3) Filed permanently.
    (f) Other material. Bulky material, equipment and facilities, etc., 
shall be clearly identified in a manner that leaves no doubt about the 
classification status of the material, the level of protection required, 
and the duration of classification. Upon a finding that identification 
would itself reveal classified information, such identification is not 
required. Supporting documentation for such a finding must be maintained 
in the appropriate security facility and in any applicable 
classification guide.
    (g) Unmarked materials. Information contained in unmarked records, 
or presidential or related materials, and which pertains to the national 
defense or foreign relations of the United States and has been 
maintained and protected as classified information under prior orders 
shall continue to be treated as classified information under the Order, 
and is subject to its provisions regarding declassification.

branch agencies that create or handle classified information. Pursuant 
to Executive Order 12829, the National Industrial Security Program 
Operating Manual (NISPOM) prescribes the security requirements, 
restrictions and safeguards applicable to industry, including the 
conduct of contractor self-inspections. The standards established in the 
NISPOM should be consistent with the standards prescribed in Executive 
Order 12958 and this part.
    (c) Responsibility. The senior agency official is responsible for 
the agency's self-inspection program. The senior agency official shall 
designate agency personnel to assist in carrying out this 
responsibility.
    (d) Approach. The official(s) responsible for the program shall 
determine the means and methods for the conduct of self-inspections. 
These may include:
    (1) A review of relevant security directives, guides and 
instructions;
    (2) Interviews with producers and users of classified information;
    (3) A review of access and control records and procedures; and
    (4) A review of a sample of classified documents generated by agency 
activities.
    (e) Frequency. The official(s) responsible for the program shall set 
the frequency of self-inspections on the basis of program needs and the 
degree of classification activity. Activities that originate significant 
amounts of classified information should conduct at least one document 
review per year.
    (f) Reporting. The format for documenting findings shall be set by 
the official(s) responsible for the program.


<R05>
Sec. 2001.31  Coverage [5.6(c)(4)].

    (a) General. These standards are not all-inclusive. Each agency may 
expand upon the coverage according to program and policy needs. Each 
self-inspection of an agency activity need not include all the elements

justified.
    (iii) Assess original classifiers' familiarity with the duration of 
classification requirements, including:
    (A) Assigning a specific date or event for declassification when 
possible;
    (B) Establishing ordinarily a maximum 10-year duration of 
classification when an earlier date or event cannot be determined;
    (C) Limiting extensions of classification for specific information 
for successive periods not to exceed 10 years at a time; and
    (D) Exempting from declassification within 10 years specific 
information as provided in section 1.6 of the Order.

[[Page 464]]

    (iv) Conduct a review of a sample of classified information 
generated by the inspected activity to determine the propriety of 
classification and the application of proper and full markings.
    (v) Evaluate classifiers' actions to comply with the standards 
specified in Sec. 2001.14 and Sec. 2001.53 of this part, relating to 
classification and declassification guides, respectively.

including the requirement to:
    (A) Comply with the automatic declassification provisions regarding 
historically valuable records over 25 years old;
    (B) Declassify, when possible, historically valuable records prior 
to accession into the National Archives;
    (C) Provide the Archivist with adequate and current declassification 
guides;
    (D) Ascertain that the agency's mandatory review program conforms to 
established requirements; and
    (E) Determine whether responsible agency officials are cooperating 
with the Archivist in the development and maintenance of a Government-
wide database of information that has been declassified.
    (4) Safeguarding.
    (i) Monitor agency adherence to established safeguarding standards.
    (ii) Assess compliance with controls for access to classified 
information.
    (iii) Evaluate the effectiveness of the agency's program in 
detecting and processing security violations and preventing recurrences.
    (iv) Assess compliance with the procedures for identifying, 
reporting and processing unauthorized disclosures of classified 
information.
    (v) Evaluate the effectiveness of procedures to ensure that:

               Subpart D--Security Education and Training


<R05>
Sec. 2001.40  General [5.6].

    (a) Purpose. This subpart sets standards for agency security 
education and training programs. Implementation of these standards 
should:
    (1) Ensure that all executive branch employees who create, process 
or handle classified information have a satisfactory knowledge and 
understanding about classification, safeguarding, and declassification 
policies and procedures;
    (2) Increase uniformity in the conduct of agency security education 
and training programs; and
    (3) Reduce improper classification, safeguarding and 
declassification practices.
    (b) Applicability. These standards are binding on all executive 
branch departments and agencies that create or handle classified 
information. Pursuant to Executive Order 12829, the NISPOM prescribes 
the security requirements, restrictions, and safeguards applicable to 
industry, including the conduct of contractor security education and 
training. The standards established in the NISPOM should be consistent 
with the standards prescribed in Executive Order 12958 and of this part.
    (c) Responsibility. The senior agency official is responsible for 
the agency's security education and training program. The senior agency 
official shall designate agency personnel to assist in carrying out this 
responsibility.
    (d) Approach. Security education and training should be tailored to 
meet the specific needs of the agency's security program, and the 
specific roles employees are expected to play in that program. The 
agency official(s) responsible for the program shall determine the means 
and methods for providing security education and training. Training 
methods may include briefings, interactive videos, dissemination of 
instructional materials, and other media and methods. Agencies shall 
maintain records about the programs it has offered and employee 
participation in them.
    (e) Frequency. The frequency of agency security education and 
training will vary in accordance with the needs of the agency's security 
classification program. Each agency shall provide some form of refresher 
security education and training at least annually.


<R05>
Sec. 2001.41  Coverage [5.6(c)(3)].

    (a) General. Each department or agency shall establish and maintain 
a formal security education and training program which provides for 
initial and refresher training, and termination briefings. This subpart 
establishes security education and training standards for original 
classifiers, declassification authorities, security managers, 
classification management officers, security specialists, and all other 
personnel whose duties significantly involve the creation or handling of 
classified information. These standards are not intended to be all-
inclusive. The official responsible for the security education and 
training program may expand or modify the coverage provided in this part 
according to the agency's program and policy needs.
    (b) Elements of initial coverage. All cleared agency personnel shall 
receive initial training on basic security policies, principles and 
practices. Such training must be provided in conjunction with the 
granting of a security clearance, and prior to granting access to 
classified information. The following areas should be considered for 
inclusion in initial briefings.
    (1) Roles and responsibilities.

    (3) Individuals specifically designated as responsible for 
derivative classification, security managers, classification management 
officers, security specialists or any other personnel whose duties 
significantly involve the management and oversight of classified 
information.
    (i) What are the original and derivative classification processes 
and the standards applicable to each?
    (ii) What are the proper and complete classification markings, as 
described in subpart B of this part?
    (iii) What are the authorities, methods and processes for 
downgrading and declassifying information?
    (iv) What are the methods for the proper use, storage, reproduction, 
transmission, dissemination and destruction of classified information?
    (v) What are the requirements for creating and updating 
classification and declassification guides?
    (vi) What are the requirements for controlling access to classified 
information?
    (vii) What are the procedures for investigating and reporting 
instances of security violations, and the penalties associated with such 
violations?
    (viii) What are the requirements for creating, maintaining, and 
terminating

[[Page 467]]

special access programs, and the mechanisms for monitoring such 
programs?
    (ix) What are the procedures for the secure use, certification and 
accreditation of automated information systems and networks which use, 
process, store, reproduce, or transmit classified information?
    (x) What are the requirements for oversight of the security 
classification program, including agency self-inspections?
    (d) Refresher security education and training. Agencies shall 
provide refresher training to employees who create, process or handle 
classified information. Refresher training should reinforce the 
policies, principles and procedures covered in initial and specialized 
training. Refresher training should also address the threat and the 
techniques employed by foreign intelligence activities attempting to 
obtain classified information, and advise personnel of penalties for 
engaging in espionage activities. Refresher training should also address 
issues or concerns identified during agency self-inspections. When other 
methods are impractical, agencies may satisfy the requirement for 
refresher training by means of audiovisual products or written 
materials.
    (e) Termination briefings. Each agency shall ensure that each 
employee granted access to classified information who leaves the service 
of the agency receives a termination briefing. Also, each agency 
employee whose clearance is withdrawn must receive such a briefing. At a 
minimum, termination briefings must impress upon each employee: The 
continuing responsibility not to disclose any classified information to 
which the employee had access and the potential penalties for non-
compliance; and the obligation to return to the appropriate agency 
official all classified documents and materials in the employee's 
possession.
    (f) Other security education and training. Agencies are encouraged 
to develop additional security education and training according to 
program and policy needs. Such security education and training could 
include:
    (1) Practices applicable to U.S. officials traveling overseas;
    (2) Procedures for protecting classified information processed and 
stored in automated information systems;
    (3) Methods for dealing with uncleared personnel who work in 
proximity to classified information;
    (4) Responsibilities of personnel serving as couriers of classified 
information; and
    (5) Security requirements that govern participation in international 
programs.


<R04>
                       Subpart E--Declassification


<R05>
Sec. 2001.50  Definition [3.1].

    A file series is a body of related records created or maintained by 
an agency, activity, office or individual. The records may be related by 
subject, topic, form, function, or filing scheme. An agency, activity, 
office, or individual may create or maintain several different file 
series, each serving a different function. Examples may include a 
subject file, alphabetical name index, chronological file, or a record 
set of agency publications. File series frequently correspond to items 
on a NARA-approved agency records schedule. Some very large series may 
contain several identifiable sub-series, and it may be appropriate to 
treat sub-series as discrete series for the purposes of the Order.


<R05>
Sec. 2001.51  Automatic declassification [3.4].

    (a) General. All departments and agencies that have original 
classification authority, or previously had original classification 
authority, and maintain records appraised as having permanent historical 
value that contain information classified by that agency shall comply 
with the automatic declassification provisions of the Order. All 
agencies with original classification authority shall cooperate with 
NARA in carrying out an automatic declassification program involving 
accessioned Federal records, presidential papers and records, and 
donated historical materials under the control of the Archivist of the 
United States. The Archivist will not declassify information created by 
another agency without the prior consent of that agency.

[[Page 468]]

    (b) Presidential records. The Archivist of the United States shall 
establish procedures for the declassification of presidential or White 
House materials accessioned into the National Archives of the United 
States or maintained in the presidential libraries.
    (c) Transferred information. In the case of classified information 
transferred in conjunction with a transfer of functions, and not merely 
for storage or archival purposes, the receiving agency shall be deemed 
to be the originating agency.
    (d) Unofficially transferred information. In the case of classified 
information that is not officially transferred as described in paragraph 
(c), of this section, but that originated in an agency that has ceased 
to exist and for which there is no successor agency, the Director of 
ISOO will designate an agency or agencies to act on provisions of the 
Order.
    (e) Processing records originated by another agency. When an agency 
uncovers classified records originated by another agency that appear to 
meet the criteria for the application of the automatic declassification 
provisions of the Order, the finding agency should alert the originating 
agency and seek instruction regarding the handling and disposition of 
pertinent records.
    (f) Unscheduled records. Classified information in records that have 
not been scheduled for disposal or retention by NARA is not subject to 
section 3.4 of the Order. Classified information in records that are 
scheduled as permanently valuable when that information is already more 
than 20 years old shall be subject to the automatic declassification 
provisions of section 3.4 of the Order five years from the date the 
records are scheduled. Classified information in records that are 
scheduled as permanently valuable when that information is less than 20 
years old shall be subject to the automatic declassification provisions 
of section 3.4 of the Order when the information is 25 years old.
    (g) Foreign government information. The declassifying agency is the 
agency that initially received or classified the information. When 
foreign government information appears to be subject to automatic 
declassification, the declassifying agency shall determine whether the 
information is subject to a treaty or international agreement that would 
prevent its declassification at that time. The declassifying agency 
shall also determine if another exemption under section 3.4(b) of the 
Order, such as the exemption that pertains to United States foreign 
relations, may apply to the information. If the declassifying agency 
believes such an exemption may apply, it should consult with any other 
concerned agencies in making its declassification determination. The 
declassifying agency or the Department of State, as appropriate, should 
consult with the foreign government prior to declassification.
    (h) Assistance to the Archivist of the United States. Agencies shall 
consult with NARA before establishing automatic declassification 
programs. Agencies shall cooperate with NARA in developing schedules for 
the declassification of records in the National Archives of the United 
States and the presidential libraries to ensure that declassification is 
accomplished in a timely manner. NARA will provide information about the 
records proposed for automatic declassification. Agencies shall consult 
with NARA before reviewing records in their holdings to ensure that 
appropriate procedures are established for maintaining the integrity of 
the records and that NARA receives accurate information about agency 
declassification actions when records are transferred to NARA. NARA will 
provide guidance to the agencies about the requirements for notification 
of declassification actions on transferred records, box labeling, and 
identifying exempt information in the records.
    (i) Use of approved declassification guides. Approved 
declassification gui- 
des may be used as a tool to assist in the exemption from automatic 
declassification of specific information as provided in section 3.4(d) 
of the Order. These guides must include additional pertinent detail 
relating to the exemptions described in section 3.4(b) of the Order, and 
follow the format required of declassification guides for systematic 
review as described in Sec. 2001.53 of this part. In order for such 

[[Page 469]]

guides to be used in place of the identification of specific information 
within individual documents, the information to be exempted must be 
narrowly defined, with sufficient specificity to allow the user to 
identify the information with precision. Exemptions for general 
categories of information will not be acceptable. The actual items to be 
exempted are specific documents. All such declassification guides used 
in conjunction with section 3.4(d) of the Order must be submitted to the 
Director of ISOO, serving as Executive Secretary of the Interagency 
Security Classification Appeals Panel, for approval by the Panel.
    (j) Automatic declassification date. No later than April 17, 2000, 
information over 25 years old in unreviewed permanently valuable records 
in non-exempt file series will be automatically declassified.
    (k) Redaction standard. Agencies are encouraged but are not required 
to redact documents that contain information that is exempt from 
automatic declassification under section 3.4 of the Order, especially if 
the information that must remain classified comprises a relatively small 
portion of the document.
    (l) Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data. (1) Restricted 
Data (RD) and Formerly Restricted Data (FRD) are exempt from the 
automatic declassification requirements in section 3.4 of the Order 
because they are classified under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended. Restricted Data concerns:
    (i) The design, manufacture, or utilization of atomic weapons;
    (ii) The production of special nuclear material, e.g., enriched 
uranium or plutonium; or
    (iii) The use of special nuclear material in the production of 
energy.
    (2) Formerly Restricted Data is information that is still classified 
but which has been removed from the Restricted Data category because it 
is related primarily to the military utilization of atomic weapons.
    (3) Any document marked as containing Restricted Data or Formerly 
Restricted Data shall remain classified indefinitely or shall be 
referred to the Department of Energy or the Department of Defense for a 
classification review.


<R05>
Sec. 2001.52  Systematic declassification review [3.5].

    (a) Listing of declassification authorities. Agencies shall maintain 
a current listing of officials delegated declassification authority by 
name, position, or other identifier. If possible, this listing shall be 
unclassified.
    (b) Responsibilities. Agencies shall establish systematic review 
programs for those records containing information that is exempt from 
automatic declassification. Agencies may also conduct systematic review 
of information contained in permanently valuable records that is less 
than 25 years old.


<R05>
Sec. 2001.53  Declassification guides [3.5(b)].

    (a) Preparation of declassification guides. Declassification guides 
shall be prepared to facilitate the declassification of information 
contained in records determined to be of permanent historical value. 
When it is sufficiently detailed and understandable, and identified for 
both purposes, a classification guide may also be used as a 
declassification guide.
    (b) General content of declassification guides. Declassification 
guides shall, at a minimum:
    (1) Identify the subject matter of the declassification guide;
    (2) Identify the original declassification authority by name or 
personal identifier, and position;
    (3) Provide the date of issuance or last review;
    (4) State precisely the categories or elements of information:
    (i) To be declassified;
    (ii) To be downgraded; or
    (iii) Not to be declassified.
    (5) Identify any related files series that have been exempted from 
automatic declassification pursuant to section 3.4(c) of the Order;
    (6) To the extent a guide is used in conjunction with the automatic 
declassification provisions in section 3.4 of the Order, state precisely 
the elements of information to be exempted from declassification to 
include:
    (i) The appropriate exemption category listed in section 3.4(b) of 
the Order, and, when citing the exemption category listed in section 
3.4(b)(9) of

[[Page 470]]

the Order, specify the applicable statute, treaty or international 
agreement; and
    (ii) A date or event for declassification.
    (c) External review. Agencies shall submit declassification guides 
for review to the Director of ISOO. To the extent such guides are used 
in conjunction with the automatic declassification provisions in section 
3.4 of the Order, the Director shall submit them for approval by the 
Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel.
    (d) Internal review and update. Agency declassification guides shall 
be reviewed and updated as circumstances require, but at least once 
every five years. Each agency shall maintain a list of its 
declassification guides in use.


<R05>
Sec. 2001.54  Mandatory review for declassification [3.6, 3.7].

    (a) U.S. originated information--(1) Receipt of requests. Each 
agency shall publish in the Federal Register the identity of the 
person(s) or office(s) to which mandatory declassification review 
requests should be addressed.
    (2) Processing. (i) Requests for classified records in the custody 
of the originating agency. A valid mandatory declassification review 
request need not identify the requested information by date or title of 
the responsive records, but must be of sufficient specificity to allow 
agency personnel to locate the records containing the information sought 
with a reasonable amount of effort. In responding to mandatory 
declassification review requests, agencies shall either make a prompt 
declassification determination and notify the requester accordingly, or 
inform the requester of the additional time needed to process the 
request. Agencies shall ordinarily make a final determination within 180 
days from the date of receipt. When information cannot be declassified 
in its entirety, agencies will make reasonable efforts to release, 
consistent with other applicable law, those declassified portions of the 
requested information that constitute a coherent segment. Upon denial of 
an initial request, the agency shall also notify the requester of the 
right of an administrative appeal, which must be filed within 60 days of 
receipt of the denial.
    (ii) Requests for classified records in the custody of an agency 
other than the originating agency. When an agency receives a mandatory 
declassification review request for records in its possession that were 
originated by another agency, it shall refer the request and the 
pertinent records to the originating agency. However, if the originating 
agency has previously agreed that the custodial agency may review its 
records, the custodial agency shall review the requested records in 
accordance with declassification guides or guidelines provided by the 
originating agency. Upon receipt of a request from the referring agency, 
the originating agency shall process the request in accordance with this 
section. The originating agency shall communicate its declassification 
determination to the referring agency.
    (iii) Appeals of denials of mandatory declassification review 
requests. The agency appellate authority shall normally make a 
determination within 60 working days following the receipt of an appeal. 
If additional time is required to make a determination, the agency 
appellate authority shall notify the requester of the additional time 
needed and provide the requester with the reason for the extension. The 
agency appellate authority shall notify the requester in writing of the 
final determination and of the reasons for any denial.
    (iv) Appeals to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals 
Panel. In accordance with section 5.4 of the Order, the Interagency 
Security Classification Appeals Panel shall publish in the Federal 
Register no later than February 12, 1996, the rules and procedures for 
bringing mandatory declassification appeals before it.
    (b) Foreign government information. Except as provided in this 
paragraph, agency heads shall process mandatory declassification review 
requests for classified records containing foreign government 
information in accordance with this section. The declassifying agency is 
the agency that initially received or classified the information. When 
foreign government information is being considered for declassification,

[[Page 471]]

the declassifying agency shall determine whether the information is 
subject to a treaty or international agreement that would prevent its 
declassification at that time. The declassifying agency shall also 
determine if another exemption under section 1.6(d) of the Order (other 
than section 1.6(b)(5)), such as the exemption that pertains to United 
States foreign relations, may apply to the information. If the 
declassifying agency believes such an exemption may apply, it should 
consult with any other concerned agencies in making its declassification 
determination. The declassifying agency or the Department of State, as 
appropriate, should consult with the foreign government prior to 
declassification.
    (c) Cryptologic and intelligence information. Mandatory 
declassification review requests for cryptologic information and 
information concerning intelligence activities (including special 
activities) or intelligence sources or methods shall be processed solely 
in accordance with special procedures issued by the Secretary of Defense 
and the Director of Central Intelligence, respectively.
    (d) Fees. In responding to mandatory declassification review 
requests for classified records, agency heads may charge fees in 
accordance with section 9701 of title 31, United States Code. The 
schedules of fees published in the Federal Register by agencies in 
implementation of Executive Order 12356 shall remain in effect until 
revised.
    (e) Assistance to the Department of State. Heads of agencies should 
assist the Department of State in its preparation of the Foreign 
Relations of the United States (FRUS) series by facilitating access to 
appropriate classified materials in their custody and by expediting 
declassification review of documents proposed for inclusion in the FRUS.
    (f) Requests filed under mandatory declassification review and the 
Freedom of Information Act. When a requester submits a request both 
under mandatory review and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the 
agency shall require the requester to elect one process or the other. If 
the requester fails to elect one or the other, the request will be 
treated as a FOIA request unless the requested materials are subject 
only to mandatory review.
    (g) FOIA and Privacy Act requests. Agency heads shall process 
requests for declassification that are submitted under the provisions of 
the FOIA, as amended, or the Privacy Act of 1974, in accordance with the 
provisions of those Acts.
    (h) Redaction standard. Agencies shall redact documents that are the 
subject of an access demand unless the overall meaning or informational 
value of the document is clearly distorted by redaction.


<R04>
                          Subpart F--Reporting


<R05>
Sec. 2001.60  Statistical reporting [5.3].

    Each agency that creates or handles classified information shall 
report annually to the Director of ISOO statistics related to its 
security classification program. The Director shall solicit 
recommendations from the member agencies of the Security Policy Forum 
regarding the reporting requirements. The Director will instruct 
agencies what data elements are required, and how and when they are to 
be reported.


<R05>
Sec. 2001.61  Accounting for costs [5.6(c)(8)].

    (a) Information on the costs associated with the implementation of 
the Order will be collected from the agencies by the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB). OMB will provide data to ISOO on the cost 
estimates for classification-related activities. ISOO will include these 
cost estimates in its annual report to the President. The agency senior 
official should work closely with the agency comptroller to ensure that 
the best estimates are collected.
    (b) The Secretary of Defense, acting as the executive agent for the 
National Industrial Security Program under Executive Order 12829, and 
consistent with agreements entered into under section 202 of E.O. 12829, 
will collect cost estimates for classification-related activities of 
contractors, licensees, certificate holders, and grantees, and report 
them to ISOO annually. ISOO will include these cost estimates in its 
annual report to the President.

[[Page 472]]


<R05>
Sec. 2001.62  Effective date [6.2].

    Part 2001 shall become effective October 14, 1995.

Information.''

                          Article II. Authority

    Executive Order 12958, ``Classified National Security Information'' 
(hereafter the ``Order''), and its implementing directives.

                         Article III. Membership

    A. Primary Membership. Appointments under section 5.4(a) of the 
Order establish the primary membership of the ISCAP.
    B. Alternate Membership.
    1. Primary members are expected to participate fully in the 
activities of the ISCAP. The Executive Secretary shall request that each 
agency or office head represented on the ISCAP also designate in writing 
addressed to the Chair an alternate to represent his or her agency or 
office on all occasions when the primary member is unable to 
participate. When serving for a primary member, an alternate member 
shall assume all the rights and responsibilities of that primary member, 
including voting.
    2. When a vacancy in the primary membership occurs, the designated 
alternate shall represent the agency or office until the agency or 
office head fills the vacancy. The Chair, working through the Executive 
Secretary, shall take all appropriate measures to encourage the agency 
or office head to fill a vacancy in the primary membership as quickly as 
possible.
    C. Chair. As provided in section 5.4(a) of the Order, the President 
shall select the Chair from among the primary members.
    D. Vice Chair. The members may elect from among the primary members 
a Vice Chair who shall:
    1. Chair meetings that the Chair is unable to attend; and
    2. Serve as Acting Chair during a vacancy in the Chair of the ISCAP.

                          Article IV. Meetings

    A. Purpose. The primary purpose of ISCAP meetings is to discuss and 
bring formal resolution to matters before the ISCAP.
    B. Frequency. As provided in section 5.4(a) of the Order, the ISCAP 
shall meet at the call of the Chair, who shall schedule meetings as may 
be necessary for the ISCAP to fulfill its functions in a timely manner. 
The Chair shall also convene the ISCAP when requested by a majority of 
its primary members.
    C. Quorum. Meetings of the ISCAP may be held only when a quorum is 
present. For this purpose, a quorum requires the presence of at least 
five primary or alternate members.
    D. Attendance. As determined by the Chair, attendance at meetings of 
the ISCAP shall be limited to those persons necessary for the ISCAP to 
fulfill its functions in a complete and timely manner.
    E. Agenda. The Chair shall establish the agenda for all meetings. 
Potential items for the agenda may be submitted to the Chair by any 
member or the Executive Secretary. Acting through the Executive 
Secretary, the Chair will distribute the agenda and supporting materials 
to the members as soon as possible before a scheduled meeting.
    F. Minutes. The Executive Secretary shall be responsible for the 
preparation of each meeting's minutes, and the distribution of draft 
minutes to each member. The minutes will include a record of the members 
present at the meeting and the result of each vote. At the subsequent 
meeting of the ISCAP, the Chair will read or reference the draft minutes 
of the previous meeting. At that time the minutes will be corrected, as 
necessary, and approved by the membership and certified by the Chair. 
The approved minutes will be maintained among the records of the ISCAP.

                            Article V. Voting

    A. Motions. When a decision or recommendation of the ISCAP is 
required to resolve a matter before it, the Chair shall request or 
accept a motion for a vote. Any member, including the Chair, may make a 
motion for a vote. No second shall be required to bring any motion to a 
vote. A quorum must be present when a vote is taken.
    B. Eligibility. Only the members, including the Chair, may vote on a 
motion before the ISCAP, with each agency or office represented having 
one vote.
    C. Voting Procedures. Votes shall ordinarily be taken and tabulated 
by a show of hands.
    D. Passing a Motion. In response to a motion, members may vote 
affirmatively, negatively, or abstain from voting. Except as otherwise 
provided in these bylaws, a motion passes when it receives a majority of 
affirmative votes of the members voting. However, in no instance will 
the ISCAP reverse an agency's decision without the affirmative vote of 
at least a majority of the members present.
    E. Votes in a Non-meeting Context. In extraordinary circumstances, 
the Chair may call for a vote of the membership outside the

[[Page 473]]

context of a formal ISCAP meeting. An alternate member may also 
participate in such a vote if the primary member cannot. The Executive 
Secretary shall record and retain such votes in a documentary form and 
immediately report the results to the Chair and other primary and 
alternate members.

   Article VI. First Function: Appeals of Agency Decisions Regarding 
                        Classification Challenges

    In accordance with section 5.4(b) of the Order, the ISCAP shall 
decide on appeals by authorized persons who have filed classification 
challenges under section 1.9 of the Order.
    A. Jurisdiction. The ISCAP will consider appeals from classification 
challenges that otherwise meet the standards of the Order if:
    1. The appeal is filed in accordance with these bylaws;
    2. The appellant has previously challenged the classification action 
at the agency that originated or is otherwise responsible for the 
information in question in accordance with the agency's procedures or, 
if the agency has failed to establish procedures for classification 
challenges, by filing a written challenge directly with the agency head 
or designated senior agency official, as defined in section 1.1(j) of 
the Order;
    3. The appellant has
    (a) Received a final agency decision denying his or her challenge; 
or
    (b) Not received (i) an initial written response to the 
classification challenge from the agency within 120 days of its filing, 
or (ii) a written response to an internal agency appeal within 90 days 
of the filing of the appeal;
    4. There is no action pending in the federal courts regarding the 
information in question; and
    5. The information in question has not been the subject of review by 
the federal courts or the ISCAP within the past two years.
    B. Addressing of Appeals. Appeals should be addressed to: Executive 
Secretary, Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel, Attn: 
Classification Challenge Appeals, c/o Information Security Oversight 
Office, National Archives and Records Administration, 7th and 
Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Room 5W, Washington, DC 20408.
    The appeal must contain enough information for the Executive 
Secretary to be able to obtain all pertinent documents about the 
classification challenge from the affected agency. No classified 
information should be included within the initial appeal document. The 
Executive Secretary will arrange for the transmittal of classified 
information from the agency after receiving the appeal. If it is 
impossible for the appellant to file an appeal without including 
classified information, prior arrangements must be made by contacting 
the Information Security Oversight Office.
    C. Timeliness of Appeals. An appeal to the ISCAP must be filed 
within 60 days of:
    1. The date of the final agency decision; or
    2. The agency's failure to meet the time frames established in 
paragraph (A)(3)(b) of this Article.
    D. Rejection of Appeal. If the Executive Secretary determines that 
the appeal does not meet the requirements of the Order or these bylaws, 
the Executive Secretary shall notify the appellant in writing that the 
appeal will not be considered by the ISCAP. The notification shall 
include an explanation of why the appeal is deficient.
    E. Preparation. The Executive Secretary shall notify the Chair and 
the designated senior agency official(s) of the affected agency(ies) 
when an appeal is lodged. Under the direction of the ISCAP, the 
Executive Secretary shall supervise the preparation of an appeal file, 
pertinent portions of which will be presented to the members of the 
ISCAP for their review prior to a vote on the appeal. The appeal file 
will eventually include all records pertaining to the appeal.
    F. Resolution of Appeals. The ISCAP may vote to affirm the agency's 
decision, to reverse the agency's decision in whole or in part, or to 
remand the matter to the agency for further consideration. A decision to 
reverse an agency's decision requires the affirmative vote of at least a 
majority of the members present.
    G. Notification. The Executive Secretary shall promptly notify in 
writing the appellant, the agency head, and designated senior agency 
official of the ISCAP's decision.
    H. Agency Appeals. Within 60 days of receipt of an ISCAP decision 
that reverses a final agency decision, the agency head may petition the 
President through the Assistant to the President for National Security 
Affairs to overrule the decision of the ISCAP.
    I. Protection of Classified Information. All persons involved in the 
appeal shall make every effort to minimize the inclusion of classified 
information in the appeal file. Any classified information contained in 
the appeal file shall be handled and protected in accordance with the 
Order and its implementing directives. Information being challenged for 
classification shall remain classified unless and until a final decision 
is made to declassify it. In no instance will the ISCAP declassify 
properly classified information solely because of an agency's failure to 
prescribe or follow appropriate procedures for handling classification 
challenges.
    J. Maintenance of File. The Executive Secretary shall maintain the 
appeal file among the records of the ISCAP.

Article VII. Second Function: Review of Agency Exemptions From Automatic 
                            Declassification

    In accordance with section 5.4(b) of the Order, the ISCAP shall 
approve, deny or amend agency exemptions from automatic declassification 
as provided in section 3.4(d) of the Order.
    A. Agency Notification of Exemptions. The agency head or designated 
senior agency official shall notify the Executive Secretary of agency 
exemptions in accordance with the requirements of the Order and its 
implementing directives. Agencies shall provide any additional 
information or justification that the Executive Secretary believes is 
necessary or helpful in order for the ISCAP to review and decide on the 
exemption. The agency head may seek relief from the ISCAP from any 
request for information by the Executive Secretary to which the agency 
objects.
    B. Preparation. The Executive Secretary shall notify the Chair of 
the agency submission. At the direction of the ISCAP, the Executive 
Secretary shall supervise the preparation of an exemption file, 
pertinent portions of which will be presented to the members of the 
ISCAP for their review prior to a vote on the exemptions. The exemption 
file will eventually include all records pertaining to the ISCAP's 
consideration of the agency's exemptions.
    C. Resolution. The ISCAP may vote to approve an agency exemption, to 
deny an agency exemption, to amend an agency exemption, or to remand the 
matter to the agency for further consideration. A decision to deny or 
amend an agency exemption requires the affirmative vote of a majority of 
the members present.
    D. Notification. The Executive Secretary shall promptly notify in 
writing the agency head and designated senior agency official of the 
ISCAP's decision.
    E. Agency Appeals. Within 60 days of receipt of an ISCAP decision 
that denies or amends an agency exemption, the agency head may petition 
the President through the Assistant to the President for National 
Security Affairs to overrule the decision of the ISCAP.
    F. Protection of Classified Information. Any classified information 
contained in the exemption file shall be handled and protected in 
accordance with the Order and its implementing directives. Information 
that the agency maintains is exempt from declassification shall remain 
classified unless and until a final decision is made to declassify it.
    G. Maintenance of File. The Executive Secretary shall maintain the 
exemption file among the records of the ISCAP.

   Article VIII. Third Function: Appeals of Agency Decisions Denying 
     Declassification Under Mandatory Review Provisions of the Order

    In accordance with section 5.4(b) of the Order, the ISCAP shall 
decide on appeals by parties whose requests for declassification under 
section 3.6 of the Order have been denied.
    A. Jurisdiction. The ISCAP will consider appeals from denials of 
mandatory review for declassification requests that otherwise meet the 
standards of the Order if:
    1. The appeal is filed in accordance with these bylaws;
    2. The appellant has previously filed a request for mandatory 
declassification review at the agency that originated or is otherwise 
responsible for the information in question in accordance with the 
agency's procedures or, if the agency has failed to establish procedures 
for mandatory review, by filing a written request directly with the 
agency head or designated senior agency official;
    3. The appellant has
    (a) Received a final agency decision denying his or her request; or
    (b) Not received (i) an initial decision on the request for 
mandatory declassification review from the agency within one year of its 
filing, or (ii) a final decision on an internal agency appeal within 180 
days of the filing of the appeal;
    4. There is no action pending in the federal courts regarding the 
information in question; and
    5. The information in question has not been the subject of review by 
the federal courts or the ISCAP within the past two years.
    B. Addressing of Appeals. Appeals should be addressed to: Executive 
Secretary, Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel, Attn: 
Mandatory Review Appeals, c/o Information Security Oversight Office, 
National Archives and Records Administration, 7th and Pennsylvania 
Avenue, NW., Room 5W, Washington, DC 20408.
    The appeal must contain enough information for the Executive 
Secretary to be able to obtain all pertinent documents about the request 
for mandatory declassification review from the affected agency.
    C. Timeliness of Appeals. An appeal to the ISCAP must be filed 
within 60 days of:
    1. The date of the final agency decision; or
    2. The agency's failure to meet the time frames established in 
paragraph (A)(3)(b) of this Article.
    D. Rejection of Appeal. If the Executive Secretary determines that 
the appeal does not meet the requirements of the Order or these bylaws, 
the Executive Secretary shall notify the appellant in writing that the 
appeal will not be considered by the ISCAP.

[[Page 475]]

The notification shall include an explanation of why the appeal is 
deficient.
    E. Preparation. The Executive Secretary shall notify the Chair and 
the designated senior agency official(s) of the affected agency(ies) 
when an appeal is lodged. Under the direction of the ISCAP, the 
Executive Secretary shall supervise the preparation of an appeal file, 
pertinent portions of which will be presented to the members of the 
ISCAP for their review prior to a vote on the appeal. The appeal file 
will eventually include all records pertaining to the appeal.
    F. Narrowing Appeals. To expedite the resolution of appeals and 
minimize backlogs, the Executive Secretary is authorized to consult with 
appellants with the objective of narrowing or prioritizing the 
information subject to the appeal.
    G. Resolution of Appeals. The ISCAP may vote to affirm the agency's 
decision, to reverse the agency's decision in whole or in part, or to 
remand the matter to the agency for further consideration. A decision to 
reverse an agency's decision requires the affirmative vote of at least a 
majority of the members present.
    H. Notification. The Executive Secretary shall promptly notify in 
writing the appellant, the agency head, and designated senior agency 
official of the ISCAP's decision.
    I. Agency Appeals. Within 60 days of receipt of an ISCAP decision 
that reverses a final agency decision, the agency head may petition the 
President through the Assistant to the President for National Security 
Affairs to overrule the decision of the ISCAP.
    J. Protection of Classified Information. All persons involved in the 
appeal shall make every effort to minimize the inclusion of classified 
information in the appeal file. Any classified information contained in 
the appeal file shall be handled and protected in accordance with the 
Order and its implementing directives. Information that is subject to an 
appeal from an agency decision denying declassification under the 
mandatory review provisions of the Order shall remain classified unless 
and until a final decision is made to declassify it. In no instance will 
the ISCAP declassify properly classified information solely because of 
an agency's failure to prescribe or follow appropriate procedures for 
handling mandatory review for declassification requests and appeals.
    K. Maintenance of File. The Executive Secretary shall maintain the 
appeal file among the records of the ISCAP. All information declassified 
as a result of ISCAP action shall be available for inclusion within the 
database established by the Archivist of the United States in accordance 
with section 3.8 of the Order.

                    Article IX. Additional Functions

    In its consideration of the matters before it, the ISCAP shall 
perform such additional advisory functions as are consistent with and 
supportive of the successful implementation of the Order.

                        Article X. Support Staff

    As provided in section 5.4(a) of the Order, the Director of the 
Information Security Oversight Office will serve as Executive Secretary 
to the ISCAP, and the staff of the Information Security Oversight Office 
will provide program and administrative support for the ISCAP. The 
Executive Secretary will supervise the staff in this function pursuant 
to the direction of the Chair and ISCAP. On an as needed basis, the 
ISCAP may seek detailees from its member agencies to augment the staff 
of the Information Security Oversight Office in support of the ISCAP.

                           Article XI. Records

    A. Integrity of ISCAP Records. The Executive Secretary shall 
maintain separately documentary materials, regardless of their physical 
form or characteristics, that are produced by or presented to the ISCAP 
or its staff in the performance of the ISCAP's functions, consistent 
with applicable federal law.
    B. Referrals. Any Freedom of Information Act request or other access 
request for a document that originated within an agency other than the 
ISCAP shall be referred to that agency for processing.

              Article XII. Annual Reports to the President

    The ISCAP has been established for the sole purpose of advising and 
assisting the President in the discharge of his constitutional and 
discretionary authority to protect the national security of the United 
States (section 5.4(e) of the Order). As provided in section 5.4(a) of 
the Order, pertinent information and data about the activities of the 
ISCAP shall be included in the Reports to the President issued by the 
Information Security Oversight Office. The Chair, in coordination with 
the other members of the ISCAP and the Executive Secretary, shall 
determine what information and data to include in each Report.

      Article XIII. Approval, Amendment, and Publication of Bylaws

    The approval and amendment of these bylaws shall require the 
affirmative vote of at least four of the ISCAP's members. In accordance 
with the Order, the Executive Secretary shall submit the approved bylaws

    Source: 48 FR 4402, Jan. 31, 1983, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 2002.1  Purpose.

    These general guidelines for the systematic declassification review 
of foreign government information have been developed in accordance with 
the provisions of section 3.3 of Executive Order 12356, ``National 
Security Information,'' and Sec. 2001.31 of Information Security 
Oversight Office Directive No. 1. All foreign government information 
that has been incorporated into the permanently valuable records of the 
United States Government and that has been accessioned into the National 
Archives of the United States shall be systematically reviewed for 
declassification by the Archivist of the United States. Declassification 
reviews shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of these 
general guidelines or, if available, in accordance with specific 
systematic review guidelines for foreign government information provided 
by the agency heads who have declassification authority over that 
information. All foreign government information--
    (a) Not identified in Sec. 2002.6 of these general guidelines or in 
specific agency guidelines as requiring item-by-item declassification 
review and final determination by an agency declassification authority, 
and
    (b) For which a prior declassification date has not been 
established, shall be declassified as that information becomes thirty 
years old.


<R05>
Sec. 2002.2  Definition.

    Foreign government information as used in these guidelines means:
    (a) Information provided by a foreign government or governments, an 
international organization of governments, or any element thereof with 
the expectation, expressed or implied, that the information, the source 
of the information, or both, are to be held in confidence; or
    (b) Information produced by the United States pursuant to or as a 
result of a joint arrangement with a foreign government or governments 
or an international organization of governments, or any element thereof, 
requiring that the information, the arrangement, or both, are to be held 
in confidence.


<R05>
Sec. 2002.3  Scope.

    (a) These guidelines apply to foreign government information that 
has been received or classified by the United States Government or its 
agents, and has been incorporated into records determined by the 
Archivist of the United States to have permanent value.
    (b) Atomic energy information (including information originated 
prior to 1947 and not marked as such; information received from the 
United Kingdom or Canada marked ``Atomic,'' or information received from 
NATO marked ``Atomal'') that is defined and identified as ``Restricted 
Data'' or ``Formerly Restricted Data'' in Sections 11y and 142d of the 
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, is outside the scope of these 
guidelines. Such information is not subject to systematic review and may 
not be automatically downgraded or declassified. Any document containing 
information within the definition of ``Restricted Data'' or ``Formerly 
Restricted Data'' that is not so marked shall be referred to the 
Department of Energy Office of Classification for review and appropriate 
marking, except for licensing and related regulatory matters which shall 
be referred to the Division of Security, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission.

[[Page 477]]


<R05>
Sec. 2002.4  Responsibilities.

    (a) Foreign government information transferred to the General 
Services Administration for accession into the National Archives of the 
United States shall be reviewed by the Archivist of the United States 
for declassification in accordance with Executive Order 12356, the 
directives of the Information Security Oversight Office, these general 
guidelines, and any specific systematic declassification guidelines 
provided by the agency with declassification authority over the 
information.
    (b) Accessioned foreign government information in file series 
concerning intelligence activities (including special activities), or 
intelligence sources or methods created after 1945, and cryptology 
records created after 1945, shall be subject to review by the Archivist 
for declassification as it becomes 50 years old. All other accessioned 
foreign government information shall be subject to review by the 
Archivist for declassification as it becomes 30 years old.
    (c) Agency heads who have declassification jurisidiction over 
permanently valuable foreign government information in agency records 
not yet accessioned into the National Archives of the United States are 
encouraged to conduct systematic declassification reviews of it in 
accordance with the time limits specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section. These reviews shall comply with the provisions of Executive 
Order 12356, the directives of the Information Security Oversight 
Office, these general guidelines, and specific agency systematic review 
guidelines that have been issued in consultation with the Archivist of 
the United States and the ISOO Director.
    (d) Foreign government information falling within any of the 
categories listed in Sec. 2002.6 of these guidelines shall be 
declassified or downgraded only upon specific authorization of the 
agency that has declassification authority over it. Such information 
shall be referred to the responsible agency(ies) for review. Information 
so referred shall remain classified until the responsible agency(ies) 
has declassified it. If the responsible agency cannot be readily 
identified from the document or material, referral shall be made in 
accordance with Sec. 2002.7 of these guidelines.
    (e) When required, the agency having declassification authority over 
the information shall consult with foreign governments concerning its 
proposed declassification.


<R05>
Sec. 2002.5  Effect of publication.

    (a) Foreign government information shall be considered declassified 
when published in an unclassified United States Government executive 
branch publication (e.g., the Foreign Relations of the United States 
series) or when cleared for publication by United States Government 
executive branch officials authorized to declassify the information; or 
if officially published as unclassified by the foreign government(s) or 
international organization(s) of governments that furnished the 
information unless the fact of the U.S. Government's possession of the 
information requires continued protection.
    (b) The unofficial publication, in the United States or abroad, of 
foreign government information contained in classified United States or 
foreign documents does not in or of itself constitute or permit the 
declassification of such information. Although prior unofficial 
publication is a factor to be considered in the systematic review 
process, there may be valid reasons for continued protection of the 
information which could preclude its declassification. In particular, 
the classification status of foreign government information which 
concerns or derives from intelligence activities (including special 
activities), intelligence sources or methods shall not be affected by 
any unofficial publication of identical or related information. The 
final declassification determination shall be made by the agency or 
agencies having declassification authority over it.


<R05>
Sec. 2002.6  Categories requiring item-by-item review.

                       Subpart B--Prescribed Forms


<R05>
Sec. 2003.20  Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement: SF 312; Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement: SF 189; Classified Information 
          Nondisclosure Agreement (Industrial/Commercial/Non-
          Government): SF 189-A.

    (a) SF 312, SF 189, and SF 189-A are nondisclosure agreements 
between the United States and an individual. The prior execution of at 
least one of these agreements, as appropriate, by an individual is 
necessary before the United States Government may grant that individual 
access to classified information. From the effective date of this rule, 
September 29, 1988, the SF 312 shall be used in lieu of both the SF 189 
and the SF 189-A for this purpose. In any instance in which the language 
in the SF 312 differs from the language in either the SF 189 or SF 189-
A, agency heads shall interpret and enforce the SF 189 or SF 189-A in a 
manner that is fully consistent with the interpretation and enforcement 
of the SF 312.
    (b) All employees of executive branch departments, and independent 
agencies or offices, who have not previously signed the SF 189, must 
sign the SF 312 before being granted access to classified information. 
An employee who has previously signed the SF 189 is permitted, at his or 
her own choosing, to substitute a signed SF 312 for the SF 189. In these 
instances, agencies shall take all reasonable steps to dispose of the 
superseded nondisclosure agreement or to indicate on it that it has been 
superseded.
    (c) All Government contractor, licensee, and grantee employees, or

[[Page 482]]

other non-Government personnel requiring access to classified 
information in the performance of their duties, who have not previously 
signed either the SF 189 or the SF 189-A, must sign the SF 312 before 
being granted access to classified information. An employee who has 
previously signed either the SF 189 or the SF 189-A is permitted, at his 
or her own choosing, to substitute a signed SF 312 for either the SF 189 
or the SF 189-A. In these instances, agencies, with the cooperation of 
the pertinent contractor, licensee or grantee, shall take all reasonable 
steps to dispose of the superseded nondisclosure agreement or to 
indicate on it that it has been superseded.
    (d) Agencies may require other persons, who are not included under 
paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section, and who have not previously 
signed either the SF 189 or the SF 189-A, to execute SF 312 before 
receiving access to classified information. A person in such 
circumstances who has previously signed either the SF 189 or the SF 189-
A is permitted, at his or her own choosing, to substitute a signed SF 
312 for either the SF 189 or the SF 189-A. In these instances, agencies 
shall take all reasonable steps to dispose of the superseded 
nondisclosure agreement or to indicate on it that it has been 
superseded.
    (e) The use of the ``Security Debriefing Acknowledgement'' portion 
of the SF 312 is optional at the discretion of the implementing agency.
    (f) An authorized representative of a contractor, licensee, grantee, 
or other non-Government organization, acting as a designated agent of 
the United States, may witness the execution of the SF 312 by another 
non-Government employee, and may accept it on behalf of the United 
States. Also, an employee of a United States agency may witness the 
execution of the SF 312 by an employee, contractor, licensee or grantee 
of another United States agency, provided that an authorized United 
States Government official or, for non-Government employees only, a 
designated agent of the United States subsequently accepts by signature 
the SF 312 on behalf of the United States.
    (g) The provisions of the SF 312, the SF 189, and the SF 189-A do 
not supersede the provisions of section 2302, title 5, United States 
Code, which pertain to the protected disclosure of information by 
Government employees, or any other laws of the United States.
    (h)(1) Modification of the SF 189. The second sentence of paragraph 
1 of every executed copy of the SF 189 is clarified to read:

    As used in this Agreement, classified information is marked or 
unmarked classified information, including oral communications, that is 
classified under the standards of Executive Order 12356, or under any 
other Executive order or statute that prohibits the unauthorized 
disclosure of information in the interest of national security; and 
unclassified information that meets the standards for classification and 
is in the process of a classification determination as provided in 
sections 1.1(c) and 1.2(e) of Executive Order 12356, or under any other 
Executive order or statute that requires protection for such information 
in the interest of national security.

    (2) Scope of ``classified information''. As used in the SF 312, the 
SF 189, and the SF 189-A, ``classified information'' is marked or 
unmarked classified information, including oral communications; and 
unclassified information that meets the standards for classification and 
is in the process of a classification determination, as provided in 
sections 1.1(c) and 1.2(e) of Executive Order 12356 or any other statute 
or Executive order that requires interim protection for certain 
information while a classification determination is pending. 
``Classified information'' does not include unclassified information 
that may be subject to possible classification at some future date, but 
is not currently in the process of a classification determination.
    (3) Basis for liability. A party to the SF 312, SF 189 or SF 189-A 
may be liable for disclosing ``classified information'' only if he or 
she knows or reasonably should know that: (i) The marked or unmarked 
information is classified, or meets the standards for classification and 
is in the process of a classification determination; and (ii) his or her 
action will result, or reasonably could result in the unauthorized 
disclosure of that information.

In no instance may a party to the SF 312, SF 189 or SF 189-A be liable 
for violating its nondisclosure provisions by disclosing information 
when, at the

[[Page 483]]

time of the disclosure, there is no basis to suggest, other than pure 
speculation, that the information is classified or in the process of a 
classification determination.
    (4) Modification of the SF 312, SF 189 and SF 189-A.
    (i) Each executed copy of the SF 312, SF 189 and SF 189-A, whether 
executed prior to or after the publication of this rule, is amended to 
include the following paragraphs 10 and 11.

    10. These restrictions are consistent with and do not supersede, 
conflict with or otherwise alter the employee obligations, rights or 
liabilities created by Executive Order 12356; section 7211 of title 5 
U.S.C. (governing disclosures to Congress); section 1034 of title 10 
U.S.C., as amended by the Military Whistleblower Protection Act 
(governing disclosure to Congress by members of the military); section 
2302(b)(8) of title 5 U.S.C., as amended by the Whistleblower Protection 
Act (governing disclosures of illegality, waste, fraud, abuse or public 
health or safety threats); the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 
1982 (50 U.S.C. 421 et seq.) (governing disclosures that could expose 
confidential Government agents), and the statutes which protect against 
disclosure that may compromise the national security, including sections 
641, 793, 794, 798, and 952 of title 18 U.S.C., and section 4(b) of the 
Subversive Activities Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. section 783(b)). The 
definitions, requirements, obligations, rights, sanctions and 
liabilities created by said Executive Order and listed statutes are 
incorporated into this Agreement and are controlling.
    11. I have read this Agreement carefully and my questions, if any, 
have been answered. I acknowledge that the briefing officer has made 
available to me the Executive Order and statutes referenced in this 
Agreement and its implementing regulation (32 CFR 2003.20) so that I may 
read them at this time, if I so choose.

    (ii) The first sentence of paragraph 7 of each executed copy of the 
SF 312, SF 189 and SF 189-A, whether executed prior to or after the 
publication of this rule, is amended to read:

    I understand that all classified information to which I have access 
or may obtain access by signing this Agreement is now and will remain 
the property of, or under the control of the United States Government 
unless and until otherwise determined by an authorized official or final 
ruling of a court of law.

The second sentence of paragraph 7 of each executed copy of the SF 312 
(September 1988 version), SF 189 and SF 189-A, which reads, ``I do not 
now, nor will I ever, possess any right, interest, title or claim 
whatsoever to such information,'' and whether executed prior to or after 
the publication of this rule, is deleted.
    (i) Points of clarification. (1) As used in paragraph 3 of SF 189 
and SF-189-A, the word ``indirect'' refers to any situation in which the 
knowing, willful or negligent action of a party to the agreement results 
in the unauthorized disclosure of classified information even though the 
party to the agreement does not directly communicate, deliver or 
transmit classified information to a person who is not authorized to 
receive it.
    (2) As used in paragraph 7 of SF 189, ``information'' refers to 
``classified information,'' exclusively.
    (3) As used in the third sentence of paragraph 7 of SF 189 and SF 
189-A, the words ``all materials which have, or may have, come into my 
possession,'' refer to ``all classified materials which have or may come 
into my possession,'' exclusively.
    (j) Each agency must retain its executed copies of the SF 312, SF 
189, and SF 189-A in file systems from which an agreement can be 
expeditiously retrieved in the event that the United States must seek 
its enforcement or a subsequent employer must confirm its prior 
execution. The original, or a legally enforceable facsimile that is 
retained in lieu of the original, such as microfiche, microfilm, 
computer disk, or electronic storage medium, must be retained for 50 
years following its date of execution. For agreements executed by 
civilian employees of the United States Government, an agency may store 
the executed copy of the SF 312 and SF 189 in the United States Office 
of Personnel Management's Official Personnel Folder (OPF) as a long-term 
(right side) document for that employee. An agency may permit its 
contractors, licensees and grantees to retain the executed agreements of 
their employees during the time of employment. Upon the termination of 
employment, the contractors, licensee or grantee shall deliver the 
original or legally enforceable facsimile of the executed SF 312, SF 189 
or SF 189-A of that employee to the Government agency

[[Page 484]]

primarily responsible for his or her classified work. A contractor, 
licensee or grantee of an agency participating in the Defense Industrial 
Security Program shall deliver the copy or legally enforceable facsimile 
of the executed SF 312, SF 189 or SF 189-A of a terminated employee to 
the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office. Each agency shall 
inform ISOO of the file systems that it uses to store these agreements 
for each category of affected individuals.
    (k) Only the National Security Council may grant an agency's request 
for a waiver from the use of the SF 312. To apply for a waiver, an 
agency must submit its proposed alternative nondisclosure agreement to 
the Director of ISOO, along with a justification for its use. The 
Director of ISOO will request a determination about the alternative 
agreement's enforceability from the Department of Justice prior to 
making a recommendation to the National Security Council. An agency that 
has previously received a waiver from the use of the SF 189 or the SF 
189-A need not seek a waiver from the use of the SF 312.
    (l) The national stock number for the SF 312 is 7540-01-280-5499.

DATA DESCRIPTOR Label. Agency-wide use of SF 711 shall begin when 
supplies of existing forms are exhausted or January 31, 1988, whichever 
occurs earlier.
    (c) SF 711 is affixed to the ADP medium containing classified 
information in a manner that would not adversely affect operation of 
equipment in which the medium is used. SF 711 is ordinarily used in 
conjunction with the SF 706, SF 707, SF 708 or SF 709, as appropriate. 
Once the Label has been applied, it cannot be removed. The SF 711 
provides spaces for information that should be completed as required.
    (d) Only the Director of ISOO may grant a waiver from the use of SF 
711. To apply for a waiver, an agency must submit its proposed 
alternative form to the Director of ISOO along with its justification 
for use. The Director of ISOO will review the request and notify the 
agency of the decision.
    (e) The national stock number of the SF 711 is 7540-01-207-5541.

<R04>
                         Subpart A--Introduction


<R05>
Sec. 2101.1  The amended Freedom of Information Act.

    The amended Freedom of Information Act, Pub. L. 93-502 (5 U.S.C. 
552), provided, and to the extent, it is applicable to the National 
Security Council Staff, provides expanded opportunities for the public 
to secure the release of classified material under the control of, or of 
primary interest to, the NSC Staff. The amended Act sets more 
restrictive time periods within which requests must be processed, 
modifies the criteria upon which denials of such requests can be based, 
and permits appeals to district courts of denials of requests. As a 
result of these changes, modified procedures are required from those 
followed in the case of requests for the release of classified material 
over ten years old made under Executive Order 11652. These regulations 
are intended to guide the NSC Staff response to requests for classified 
material under the amended Freedom of Information Act, insofar as it is 
applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 2101.2  Purpose of amended Act.

    The underlying purpose of the amended Freedom of Information Act is 
to insure that the public is informed to the fullest extent possible 
about governmental policies and actions, consistent with the requirement 
to protect certain categories of sensitive information. In the case of 
classified material, the Act is intended to protect the public against 
the improper classification of information, particularly to conceal 
inefficiency or administrative error or to prevent embarrassment to a 
person or department. These goals are fully consistent with the 
provisions of Executive Order 11652 and the implementing NSC Directive 
of May 17, 1972, which regulate and control the protection and 
management of national security information. The provisions of these 
documents relating to the criteria, authority and procedures for 
classifying and safeguarding national security material remain 
unaffected by the amended Act.

[[Page 491]]


<R04>
         Subpart B--Processing Requests for Classified Material


<R05>
Sec. 2101.11  Receipt of requests.

    (a) Request for classified documents under the FOI Act should be 
addressed to:

National Security Council
ATTN: Staff Secretary
Old Executive Office Building
Washington, DC 20506

Oral requests received by the Staff Secretary or other members of the 
NSC Staff will be rejected and the requester informed that his request 
should be made in writing and directed to the Staff Secretary.
    (b) All time limits are based on the date of receipt by the NSC 
Staff of a request. Consequently, this ``key date'' must in all cases be 
accurately recorded.
    (c) If a request is misdirected to the NSC Staff, the requestor will 
be promptly notified in writing.
    (d) Requests for declassification of material forwarded by the 
National Archives and Records Service (or other Agencies) should be 
submitted with three copies of the requested material attached.


<R05>

    (a) Requested material will be rapidly gathered (when not received 
with the request) screened, and disseminated to appropriate reviewing 
officers.
    (1) Initial dissemination of material to reviewing officers will be 
made by the Secretariat, with review by the Staff Secretary.
    (2) Material to be reviewed will be disseminated utilizing ``highly 
visible'' and clearly distinguishable orange folders.
    (3) Deadline for submitting recommendations will be indicated in all 
cases and must be adhered to.
    (b) Dissemination of material to other Agencies for comment will be 
made by the Staff Secretary to responsible officials of these Agencies.

Sec. 2101.13  Requests for time extensions.

    (a) Requestors will be promptly notified by the Staff Secretary of a 
time extension (indicating the new date by which a determination will be 
dispatched) due to the following three ``unusual circumstances'':
    (1) Need to search for or collect records from field facilities or 
other establishments separate from the office of request;
    (2) Need to search for, collect and examine voluminous amounts of 
records;
    (3) Need to consult with other agencies because of their having 
substantial subject-matter interests.
    (b) Time extensions will not exceed ten working days in the 
aggregate, either solely in the initial or the review stage, or divided 
between them.
    (c) The Staff Secretary will authorize all time extensions.
    (d) Prior to requesting a court authorized time extension, 
requestors will be contacted by the Staff Secretary in an attempt to 
arrange informal agreement on a time extension (any verbal agreement 
will be quickly formalized in writing).
    (e) The Staff Secretary will authorize all requests to courts for 
time extensions based on ``exceptional circumstances'' and ``due 
diligence''. Formal approaches to courts for time extensions will be 
conducted by the Department of Justice.


<R05>
Sec. 2101.14  Initial review period.

    (a) A total of ten working days is available for submitting an 
initial response to requests.
    (1) Time period allowed reviewing officers will be the maximum 
period consistent with time required for administrative processing and 
final review of recommendations and preparation of reply by Staff 
Secretary.
    (2) Reviewing officers will be periodically reminded of approaching 
due dates in order to insure recommendations are received in a timely 
manner.
    (b) Primary reviewing officers will delegate reviewing authority in 
the event they are unavailable to conduct reviews.

[[Page 492]]


<R05>
Sec. 2101.15  Initial reply to request.

    (a) The Staff Secretary will review the recommendations of primary 
reviewing officers and approve initial replies.
    (b) An initial response will always be made even if processing has 
not been completed.
    (c) If processing has not been completed but an interim negative 
reply has been dispatched, processing will continue.
    (d) Accurate record of replies will be maintained by Secretariat.
    (e) If a negative or partial denial response is dispatched, 
requester will be notified of his right to appeal.
    (f) If some or all material is approved for release, the Staff 
Secretary will insure it is expeditiously dispatched to the requestor or 
grant authority to NARS or other Agency to release the material.


<R05>
Sec. 2101.16  Processing of appeals to ``Head of Agency''.

    (a) Replies to appeals will be approved by the Assistant to the 
President for National Security Affairs, or the Deputy Assistant acting 
in the name of the Assistant to the President.
    (b) The Staff Secretary will be responsible for preparing material 
required by the above appeal review officer in making a final 
determination.
    (1) Views of primary reviewing officers will again be solicited.
    (2) Opinion of Office of the White House Counsel and/or Department 
of Justice on legal ramifications will be solicited.

<R05>
Sec. 2101.17  Appeals to Federal District Courts.

    (a) Staff Secretary will coordinate the NSC Staff's support (to 
include background data, affidavits, etc.) to USG lawyers defending 
against court appeals for denied NSC classified documents.
    (b) If court judgment is against USG, Staff Secretary will arrange 
release of documents to litigant.


<R04>
 Subpart C--Schedule of Fees and Method of Payment for Services Rendered


<R05>
Sec. 2101.21  Fees schedule.

    (a) Fees schedule for the search and reproduction of information 
available under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), as 
amended:
    (1) Search for records. $5.00 per hour when the search is conducted 
by a clerical employee. $8.00 per hour when the search is conducted by a 
professional employee. No charge for searches of less than 1 hour.
    (2) Duplication of records. Records will be duplicated at a rate of 
$.25 per page for all copying of 4 pages or more. There is no charge for 
duplicating documents of 3 or less pages or the first three pages of 
documents of greater length.
    (3) Other. When no specific fee has been established for a service, 
or the request for a service does not fall under one of the above 
categories due to the amount or type thereof, the Staff Secretary is 
authorized to establish an appropriate fee based on ``direct costs'' as 
provided in the Freedom of Information Act. Examples of services covered 
by this provision include searches involving computer time or special 
travel, transportation, or communications costs.
    (b) If records requested under the Act are stored elsewhere than the 
headquarters of the National Security Council Staff at Washington, DC, 
the special costs of returning such records to the headquarters for 
review will be added to the search costs. Search costs are due and 
payable even if the record which was requested cannot be located after 
all reasonable efforts have been made, or if the NSC Staff determines 
that a record which has been requested, but which is exempt from 
disclosure under the Act, is to be withheld. Processing of a request for 
records will not be undertaken until a requestor has paid in full for 
search and duplication charges for any previous document request under 
the Act.
    (c) Where it is anticipated that the fees chargeable under this 
section will amount to more than $25, and the requestor has not 
indicated in advance his willingness to pay fees as high as

[[Page 493]]

are anticipated, the requestor shall be promptly notified of the amount 
of the anticipated fee or such portion thereof as can readily be 
estimated. In instances where the estimated fees will greatly exceed 
$25, an advance deposit may be required. The notice or request for an 
advance deposit shall extend an offer to the requestor to consult with 
knowledgeable NSC Staff personnel--designated by the Staff Secretary--in 
an attempt to reformulate the request in a manner which will reduce the 
fees and meet the needs of the requestor. Dispatch of such a notice or 
request shall suspend the running of the period for response by the NSC 
Staff until a reply is received from the requestor.
    (d) Fees must be paid in full prior to issuance of requested copies.


<R05>
Sec. 2101.22  Fee payments.

    (a) Remittances shall be in the form either of a personal check or 
bank draft drawn on a bank in the United States, or a postal money 
order. Remittances shall be made payable to the Treasury of the United 
States and mailed to the Staff Secretary, National Security Council, 
Washington, DC 20506.
    (b) A receipt for fees paid will be given only upon request. Refund 
of fees paid for services actually rendered will not be made.
    (c) The Staff Secretary, National Security Council, may in 
accordance with the Freedom of Information Act, as amended, waive all or 
part of any fee provided for in this section when it is deemed to be in 
either the interest of the NSC Staff or of the general public.


<R04>
                           Subpart D--Reports


<R05>
Sec. 2101.31  Quarterly Index of Publications.

    (a) The NSC Staff is required to publish and distribute to the 
public on a quarterly basis an index of the following material 
promulgated after July 4, 1967:
    (1) Final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as 
well as orders, made in the adjudication of cases;
    (2) Those statements of policy and interpretations which have been 
adopted and are not published in the Federal Register; and
    (3) Administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that 
affect a member of the public.
    (b) A final order, opinion, statement of policy, interpretation, or 
staff manual or instruction that affects a member of the public may be 
relied on, used, or cited as precedent against a party other than an 
agency only if:
    (1) It has been indexed and either made available or published as 
provided by the Act; or
    (2) The party has actual and timely notice of the terms thereof.
    (c) The legislative history of this requirement indicated that only 
material having ``precedential significance'' are to be included in the 
Index.
    (d) Matters specifically excluded from release under the Freedom of 
Information Act are not required to be included in the Index. In the 
case of the NSC Staff, this particularly includes matters that are:
    (1) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an 
Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or 
foreign policy and are in fact properly classified pursuant to such 
Executive Order (see paragraph (d)(5) of this section);
    (2) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of 
an agency;
    (3) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (see part VII);
    (4) Inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would 
not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation 
with the agency;
    (5) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of 
which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy.
    (e) Because of the considerations outlined under paragraphs (c) and 
(d) of this section, it is anticipated that the NSC Staff will normally 
have little or nothing to report in its quarterly index.


<R05>
Sec. 2101.32  Annual Report to Congress.

    (a) On or before March 1st of each calendar year, a report of the 
NSC Staff's activities over the preceding calendar year relating to the 
Freedom

[[Page 494]]

of Information Act will be submitted to the Speaker of the House of 
Representatives and the President of the Senate.
    (b) The above report will include:
    (1) The number of determinations made by the NSC Staff not to comply 
with requests for records made to it under the Act and the reasons for 
each such determination;
    (2) The number of appeals made by persons under the Act, the results 
of such appeals, and the reason for the action by the NSC Staff upon 
each appeal that results in a denial of information;
    (3) The names and titles or positions of each person responsible for 
the denial of records requested under the Act, and the number of 
instances of participation for each;
    (4) The results of each (Civil Service Commission) proceeding 
conducted pursuant to the Act, including a report of the disciplinary 
action taken against the officer or employee who was primarily 
responsible for improperly withholding records or an explanation of why 
disciplinary action was not taken;
    (5) A copy of every rule made by the NSC Staff regarding the Act;
    (6) A copy of the fee schedule and the total amount of fees 
collected by the NSC Staff for making records available under the Act; 
and
    (7) Such other information as indicates efforts by the NSC Staff to 
administer fully the Act. (This should include, to the extent possible, 
data on the costs to the NSC Staff of administering the Act.)
    (c) The NSC Staff, based in part on the information compiled for its 
annual report to Congress will provide--upon request--assistance to the 
Department of Justice in the preparation of its annual report (also due 
each March 1st) to Congress concerning judicial cases arising under the 
provisions of the Act.


<R04>
                     Subpart E--Applicable Material


<R05>
Sec. 2101.41  Primary review by NSC staff.

    (a) The NSC Staff will have primary and authoritative review 
responsibility for Freedom of Information Act requests for the following 
types of classified material.
    (1) Material originally classified by a properly authorized member 
of the NSC Staff and maintained under its control;
    (2) Material produced for and processed by the NSC Staff even if not 
originally classified by an authorized member of the Staff;
    (3) Material classified by a President, his White House Staff, the 
NSC Staff on his behalf, or special committee or commission appointed by 
him and which the Archivist of the United States has in his custody at 
any archival depository, including a Presidential Library, and which is 
concerned with ``national defense or foreign policy'' matters of 
``primary subject-matter interest'' to the NSC Staff;
    (4) Verbatim or extensively paraphrased NSC material appearing in 
documents originally classified by another agency.
    (b) Requests received by other agencies for the material described 
above should be forwarded to the NSC Staff for action.


<R05>
Sec. 2101.42  Recommendations to other agencies.

    The NSC Staff will, at the request of another agency, make 
recommendations on the release of material concerning ``national defense 
or foreign policy'' originally classified by another agency but which is 
of significant subject-matter interest of the NSC Staff.


<R04>
                  Subpart F--Declassification Criteria


<R05>
Sec. 2101.51  Criteria for denying a request for release of classified material.

    (a) The amended Freedom of Information Act does not apply to matters 
that are:
    (1) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an 
Executive Order (E.O. 11652) to be kept secret in the interest of 
national defense or foreign policy;
    (2) Are in fact properly classified pursuant to (both procedural and 
substantive criteria contained in) such Executive Order;
    (3) Or, are specifically exempted from disclosure by statute.

[[Page 495]]


<R05>
Sec. 2101.52  Procedural criteria under E.O. 11652.

    (a) The material must have been classified by a properly authorized 
individual;
    (b) The material must have been properly marked. For documents 
prepared after the effective date of Executive Order 11652 (June 1, 
1972), this must especially include its classification, whether it is 
subject to or exempt from the General Declassification Schedule, and the 
highest level individual that authorized classification in each case. 
Documents prepared prior to June 1, 1972, must have been properly marked 
pursuant to the rules of the appropriate Executive Order then 
applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 2101.53  Substantive criteria under E.O. 11652 for material under ten years old.

    (a) Material must be classified ``solely on the basis of national 
security considerations. In no case (may material be classified) in 
order to conceal inefficiency or administrative error, to prevent 
embarrassment to a person or Department, to restrain competition or 
independent initiative, or to prevent for any other reason the release 
of information which does not require protection in the interest of 
national security.''
    (b) To be classified ``Top Secret,'' it must reasonably be expected 
that unauthorized disclosure of the material would ``cause exceptionally 
grave damage to the national security.'' Examples are:
    (1) Armed hostilities against the United States or its allies;
    (2) Disruption of foreign relations vitally affecting the national 
security;
    (3) The compromise of vital national defense plans or complex 
cryptologic and communications intelligence systems;
    (4) The revelation of sensitive intelligence operations; and
    (5) The disclosure of scientific or technological developments vital 
to the national security.
    (c) To be classified ``Secret,'' it must reasonably be expected that 
unauthorized disclosure of the material would ``cause serious damage to 
the national security.'' Examples are:
    (1) Disruption of foreign relations significantly affecting the 
national security;
    (2) Significant impairment of a program or policy directly related 
to the national security;
    (3) Revelation of significant military plans or intelligence 
operations; and
    (4) Compromise of significant scientific or technological 
developments relating to national security.
    (d) To be classified ``Confidential,'' it must be reasonably 
expected that unauthorized disclosure of the material would ``cause 
damage to the national security.''
    (e) Examples of material exempt from release because it is 
classified pursuant to a statute are:
    (1) Restricted Data (42 U.S.C. 2162);
    (2) Communication information (18 U.S.C. 798);
    (3) Material relating to intelligence sources and methods (50 U.S.C. 
403(d) (3) and (9)).


<R05>
Sec. 2101.54  Substantive criteria under E.O. 11652 for material over ten years old.

    (a) Classified information or material furnished by foreign 
governments or international organizations and held by the United States 
on the understanding that it be kept in confidence;
    (b) Classified information or material specifically covered by 
statute, or pertaining to cryptography, or disclosing intelligence 
sources or methods;
    (c) Classified information or material disclosing a system, plan, 
installation, project or specific foreign relations matter the 
continuing protection of which is essential to the national security;
    (d) Classified information or material the disclosure of which would 
place a person in immediate jeopardy.


<R04>
                       Subpart G--Partial Release


<R05>
Sec. 2101.61  Release of ``reasonably segregable portion'' of requested classified material.

    (a) The amended Freedom of Information Act requires that ``any 
reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided * * * after 
deletion of the portions which are exempt.''

[[Page 496]]

    (b) Determination of which portion(s) of classified material are to 
be released, and what portion(s) are to remain classified, will be made 
on the basis of the criteria outlined in subpart F of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 2101.62  Downgrading of classified material reviewed under the FOI Act.

    (a) Classified material reviewed for release under the Freedom of 
Information Act which no longer meets the criteria established for its 
original classification should be recommended for downgrading to a lower 
classification if appropriate.
    (b) Downgraded material which retains a classification will be 
exempted from release.

<R05>
Sec. 2102.1  Introduction.

    (a) Insofar as the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) applies to 
the National Security Council (hereafter NSC), it provides the American 
public with expanded opportunities to gain access to records maintained 
by the NSC Staff which may pertain to them as individuals. These 
regulations are the exclusive means by which individuals may request 
personally identifiable records and information from the National 
Security Council.
    (b) The NSC Staff, in addition to performing the functions 
prescribed in the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (50 U.S.C. 
401), also serves as the supporting staff to the President in the 
conduct of foreign affairs. In doing so the NSC Staff is acting not as 
an agency but as an extension of the White House Office. In that the 
White House Office is not considered an agency for the purposes of this 
Act, the materials which are used by NSC Staff personnel in their role 
as supporting staff to the President are not subject to the provisions 
of the Privacy Act of 1974. A description of these White House Office 
files is, nevertheless, appended to the NSC notices of systems of files

record or system of records maintained by the NSC Staff should address 
their inquiries, marking them plainly as a PRIVACY ACT REQUEST, to:

Staff Secretary, National Security Council, Room 374, Old Executive 
Office Building, Washington, DC 20506.

All requests must be made in writing and should contain:
    (1) A specific reference to the system of records maintained by the 
NSC as listed in the NSC Notices of Systems and Records (copies 
available upon request); or
    (2) A description of the record or systems of records in sufficient 
detail to allow the NSC to determine whether the record does, in fact, 
exist in an NSC system of records.
    (b) All requests must contain the printed or typewritten name of the 
individual to whom the record pertains, the signature of the individual 
making the request, and the address to which the reply should be sent. 
In instances when the identification is insufficient to insure 
disclosure to the individual to whom the information pertains in view of 
the sensitivity of the information, NSC reserves the right to solicit 
from the requestor additional identifying information.
    (c) Responses to all requests under the Act will be made by the 
Staff Secretary, or by another designated member of the NSC Staff 
authorized to act in the name of the Staff Secretary in responding to a 
request under this Act. Every effort will be made to inform the 
requestor if he or she is the subject of a specific record or system of 
records within ten working days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal 
Federal Holidays) of receipt of the request. Such a response will also 
contain the procedures to be followed in order to gain access to any 
record which may exist and a copy of the most recent NSC notice, as 
published in the Federal Register, on the system of records in which the 
record is contained.
    (d) Whenever it is not possible to respond in the time period 
specified above, the NSC Staff Secretary or a designated alternate will, 
within ten working days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal Federal 
Holidays), inform the requestor of the reasons for the delay (e.g.,

timely identification of the record. Verification of the requestor's 
identity will be determined under the same procedures used in requests 
for learning of the existence of a record.

will be answered within ten working days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, 
and legal Federal holidays) of the receipt of the request. In the event 
that a response cannot be made within this time, the requestor will be 
notified by mail of the reasons for the delay and the date upon which a 
reply can be expected. A final response to a request for amendment will 
include the NSC Staff determination on whether to grant or deny the 
request. If the request is denied, the response will include:
    (1) The reasons for the decision;
    (2) The name and address of the individual to whom an appeal should

reasons therefor and the date on which a final response is expected.
    (c) If the original request was for access and the initial 
determination is reversed, a copy of the records sought will be sent to 
the individual. If the initial determination is upheld, the requestor 
will be so advised and informed

Directive No. 1.

    Source: 44 FR 2384, Jan. 11, 1979, unless otherwise noted.


<R04>
                         Subpart A--Introduction


<R05>
Sec. 2103.1  References.

    (a) Executive Order 12065, ``National Security Information,'' dated 
June 28, 1978.
    (b) Information Security Oversight Office, Directive No. 1, 
``National Security Information,'' dated October 2, 1978.


<R05>
Sec. 2103.2  Purpose.

    The purpose of this regulation is to ensure, consistent with the 
authorities listed in Sec. 2103.1, that national security information 
processed by the National Security Council Staff is protected from 
unauthorized disclosure, but only to the extent, and for such period, as 
is necessary to safeguard the national security.


<R05>
Sec. 2103.3  Applicability.

    This regulation governs the National Security Council Staff 
Information Security Program. In consonance with the authorities listed 
in Sec. 2103.1, it establishes the policy and procedures for the 
security classification, downgrading, declassification, and safeguarding 
of information that is owned by, is produced for or by, or is under the 
control of the National Security Council Staff.


<R04>
                   Subpart B--Original Classification


<R05>
Sec. 2103.11  Basic policy.

    It is the policy of the National Security Council Staff to make 
available to the public as much information concerning its activities as 
is possible, consistent with its responsibility to protect the national 
security.


<R05>
Sec. 2103.12  Level of original classification.

    Unnecessary classification, and classification at a level higher 
than is necessary, shall be avoided. If there is reasonable doubt as to 
which designation in section 1-1 of Executive Order 12065 is 
appropriate, or whether information should be classified at all, the 
less restrictive designation should be used, or the information should 
not be classified.


<R05>
Sec. 2103.13  Duration of original classification.

    Original classification may be extended beyond six years only by 
officials with Top Secret classification authority. This extension 
authority shall be used only when these officials determine that the 
basis for original classification will continue throughout the entire 
period that the classification will be in effect and only for the 
following reasons:
    (a) The information is ``foreign government information'' as defined 
by the authorities in Sec. 2301.1;
    (b) The information reveals intelligence sources and methods;
    (c) The information pertains to communication security;

[[Page 501]]

    (d) The information reveals vulnerability or capability data, the 
unauthorized disclosure of which can reasonably be expected to render 
ineffective a system, installation, or project important to the national 
security;
    (e) The information concerns plans important to the national 
security, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably can be 
expected to nullify the effectiveness of the plan;
    (f) The information concerns specific foreign relations matters, the 
continued protection of which is essential to the national security;
    (g) Disclosure of the information would place a person's life in 
immediate jeopardy; or
    (h) The continued protection of the information is specifically 
required by statute.

Even when the extension authority is exercised, the period of original 
classification shall not be greater than twenty years from the date or 
original classification, except that the original classification of 
``foreign government information'' pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section may be for a period of thirty years.


<R05>
Sec. 2103.14  Challenges to classification.

    If holders of classified information believe that the information is 
improperly or unnecessarily classified, or that original classification 
has been extended for too long a period, they should discuss the matter 
with their immediate superiors or the classifier of the information. If 
these discussions do not satisfy the concerns of the challenger, the 
matter should be brought to the attention of the chairperson of the NSC 
Information Security Oversight Committee (see Sec. 2103.51 of this 
part).


<R04>
                  Subpart C--Derivative Classification


<R05>
Sec. 2103.21  Definition and application.

    Derivative classification is the act of assigning a level of 
classification to information that is determined to be the same in 
substance as information that is currently classified. Thus, derivative 
classification may be accomplished by any person cleared for access to 
that level of information, regardless of whether the person has original 
classification authority at that level.


<R04>
               Subpart D--Declassification and Downgrading


<R05>
Sec. 2103.31  Declassification authority.

    The Staff Secretary, Staff Counsel, and Director of Freedom of

    (2) Where it is anticipated that the fees chargeable under this 
section will amount to more than $25, and the requestor has not 
indicated in advance a willingness to pay fees as high as are 
anticipated, the requestor shall be promptly notified of the amount of 
the anticipated fee or such portion thereof as can readily be estimated. 
In instances where the estimated fees will greatly exceed $25, an 
advance deposit may be required. Dispatch of such a notice or request 
shall suspend the running of the period for response by the NSC Staff 
until a reply is received from the requestor.
    (3) Remittances shall be in the form either of a personal check or 
bank draft drawn on a bank in the United States, or a postal money

Washington, DC 20506.
    (4) [Reserved]
    (5) A receipt for fees paid will be given only upon request. Refund

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 2400.1  Authority.

    (a) Executive Order 12356 ``National Security Information,'' dated 
April 2, 1982, 47 FR 14874 (Apr. 6, 1982); 47 FR 15557 (Apr. 12, 1982) 
and Order of Designation of May 7, 1982, 47 FR 20105 (May 11,1982).
    (b) Information Security Oversight Office, Directive No. 1, 
``National Security Information,'' dated June 23, 1982, 47 FR 27836 
(June 25, 1982) (Directive No. 1).


<R05>
Sec. 2400.2   Purpose.

    The purpose of this Regulation is to ensure, consistent with the 
authorities of Sec. 2400.1 that information of the Office of Science and 
Technology Policy (OSTP) relating to national security is protected from 
unauthorized disclosure, but only to the extent and for such period as 
is necessary to safeguard the national security.

[[Page 505]]


<R05>
Sec. 2400.3   Applicability.

    This Regulation governs the Office of Science and Technology Policy 
Information Security Program. In accordance with the provisions of 
Executive Order 12356 and Directive No. 1 it establishes, for uniform 
application throughout the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the 
policies and procedures for the security classification, downgrading, 
declassification and safeguarding of information that is owned by, 
produced for or by, or under the control of the office of Science and 
Technology Policy.


<R05>
Sec. 2400.4   Atomic Energy Material.

    Nothing in this Regulation supersedes any requirement made by or 
under the Atomic Energy act of 1954, as amended. ``Restricted Data'' and 
information designated as ``Formerly Restricted Data'' shall be handled, 
protected, classified, downgraded, and declassified in conformity with 
the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and 
regulations issued pursuant thereto by the Department of Energy.


<R04>
                   Subpart B--Original Classification


<R05>
Sec. 2400.5  Basic policy.

    Except as provided in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, 
Executive Order 12356, as implemented by Directive No. 1 and this 
Regulation, provides the only basis for classifying information. The 
policy of the Office of Science and Technology Policy is to make 
available to the public as much information concerning its activities as 
is possible, consistent with its responsibility to protect the national 
security. Information may not be classified unless its disclosure 
reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security.


<R05>
Sec. 2400.6  Classification levels.

    (a) National security information (hereinafter ``classified 
information'') shall be classified at one of the following three levels:
    (1) ``Top Secret'' shall be applied to information, the unauthorized 
disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally 
grave damage to the national security.
    (2) ``Secret'' shall be applied to information, the unauthorized 
disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage 
to the national security.
    (3) ``Confidential'' shall be applied to information, the 
unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause 
damage to the national security.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided by statute, no other terms shall be 
used to identify classified information. Markings other than ``Top 
Secret,'' ``Secret,'' and ``Confidential,'' such as ``For Official Use 
Only,'' shall not be used to identify national security information. In 
addition, no other term or phrase shall be used in conjunction with one 
of the three authorized classification levels, such as ``Secret 
Sensitive'' or ``Agency Confidential.'' The terms ``Top Secret'', 
``Secret'', and ``Confidential'' should not be used to identify 
nonclassified executive branch information.
    (c) Unnecessary classification, and classification at a level higher 
than is necessary shall be scrupulously avoided.
    (d) If there is reasonable doubt about the need to classify 
information, it shall be safeguarded as if it were classified 
``Confidential'' pending a determination by an original classification 
authority, who shall make this determination within thirty (30) days. If 
there is reasonable doubt about the appropriate level of classification 
the originator of the information shall safeguard it at the higher level 
of classification pending a determination by an original classification 
authority, who shall make this determination within thirty (30) days. 
Upon the determination of a need for classification and/or the proper 
classification level, the information that is classified shall be marked 
as provided in Sec. 2400.12 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 2400.7  Original classification authority.

    (a) Authority for original classification of information as Top 
Secret shall be exercised within OSTP only by the

[[Page 506]]

Director and by such principal subordinate officials having frequent 
need to exercise such authority as the Director shall designate in 
writing.
    (b) The authority to classify information originally as Secret shall 
be exercised within OSTP only by the Director, other officials delegated 
in writing to have original Top Secret classification authority, and any 
other officials delegated in writing to have original Secret 
classification authority.
    (c) The authority to classify information originally as Confidential 
shall be exercised within OSTP only by officials with original Top 
Secret or Secret classification authority and any officials delegated in 
writing to have original Confidential classification authority.


<R05>
Sec. 2400.8  Limitations on delegation of original classification authority.

    (a) The Director, OSTP is the only official authorized to delegate 
original classification authority.
    (b) Delegations of original classification authority shall be held 
to an absolute minimum.
    (c) Delegations of original classification authority shall be 
limited to the level of classification required.
    (d) Original classification authority shall not be delegated to OSTP 
personnel who only quote, restate, extract or paraphrase, or summarize 
classified information or who only apply classification markings derived 
from source material or as directed by a classification guide.
    (e) The Executive Director, OSTP, shall maintain a current listing 
of persons or positions receiving any delegation of original 
classification authority. If possible, this listing shall be 
unclassified.
    (f) Original classification authority may not be redelegated.
    (g) Exceptional Cases. When an employee, contractor, licensee, or 
grantee of OSTP that does not have original classification authority 
originates information believed by that person to require 
classification, the information shall be protected in a manner 
consistent with these Regulations as provided in Sec. 2400.6(d) of this 
part. The information shall be transmitted promptly as provided in these 
Regulations to the official in OSTP who has appropriate subject matter 
interest and classification authority with respect to this information. 
That official shall decide within thirty (30) days whether to classify 
this information. If the information is not within OSTP's area of 
classification responsibility, OSTP shall promptly transmit the 
information to the responsible agency. If it is not clear which agency 
has classification responsibility for this information, it shall be sent 
to the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office. The 
Director shall determine the agency having primary subject matter 
interest and forward the information, with appropriate recommendations, 
to that agency for a classification determination.


<R05>
Sec. 2400.9  Classification requirements.

    (a) Information may be classified only if it concerns one or more of 
the categories cited in Executive Order 12356, as subcategorized below, 
and an official having original classification authority determines that 
its unauthorized disclosure, either by itself or in the context of other 
information, reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the 
national security.
    (1) Military plans, weapons or operations;
    (2) The vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, 
projects, or plans relating to the national security;
    (3) Foreign government information;
    (4) Intelligence activities (including special activities), or 
intelligence sources or methods;
    (5) Foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States;
    (6) Scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to the 
national security;
    (7) United States Government programs for safe-guarding nuclear 
materials or facilities;
    (8) Cryptology;
    (9) A confidential source; or
    (10) Other categories of information which are related to national 
security and that require protection against unauthorized disclosure as 
determined by the Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy. 
Each such determination shall be reported promptly to

[[Page 507]]

the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office.
    (b) Foreign government information need not fall within any other 
classification category listed in paragraph (a) of this section to be 
classified.
    (c) Certain information which would otherwise be unclassified may 
require classification when combined or associated with other 
unclassified or classified information. Classification on this basis 
shall be fully supported by a written explanation that, at a minimum, 
shall be maintained with the file or referenced on the record copy of 
the information.
    (d) Information classified in accordance with this section shall not 
be declassified automatically as a result of any unofficial publication 
or inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure in the United States or abroad 
of identical or similar information. Following an inadvertent or 
unauthorized publication or disclosure of information identical or 
similar to information that has been classified in accordance with 
Executive Order 12356 or predecessor orders, OSTP, if the agency of 
primary interest, shall determine the degree of damage to the national 
security, the need for continued classification, and in coordination 
with the agency in which the disclosure occurred, what action must be 
taken to prevent similar occurrences. If the agency of primary interest 
is other than OSTP, the matter shall be referred to that agency.


<R05>
Sec. 2400.10  Presumption of damage.

    Unauthorized disclosure of foreign government information, the 
identity of a confidential foreign source, or intelligence sources or 
methods, is presumed to cause damage to the national security.


<R05>
Sec. 2400.11  Duration of classification.

    (a) Information shall be classified as long as required by national 
security considerations. When it can be determined, a specific date or 
event for declassification shall be set by the original classification 
authority at the time the information is originally classified.
    (b) Automatic declassification determinations under predecessor 
Executive Orders shall remain valid unless the classification is 
extended by an authorized official of the originating agency. These 
extensions may be by individual documents or categories of information. 
The originating agency shall be responsible for notifying holders of the 
information of such extensions.
    (c) Information classified under predecessor Executive Orders and 
marked for declassification review shall remain classified until 
reviewed for declassification under the provisions of Executive Order 
12356.
    (d) Information classified under predecessor Executive Orders that 
does not bear a specific date or event for declassification shall remain 
classified until reviewed for declassification. The authority to extend 
the classification of information subject to automatic declassification 
under predecessor Orders is limited to those officials who have 
classification authority over the information and are designated in 
writing to have original classification authority at the level of the 
information to remain classified. Any decision to extend this 
classification on other than a document-by-document basis shall be 
reported to the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office.


<R05>
Sec. 2400.12  Identification and markings.

    (a) At the time of original classification, the following 
information shall be shown on the face of all classified documents, or 
clearly associated with other forms of classified information in a 
manner appropriate to the medium involved, unless this information 
itself would reveal a confidential source or relationship not otherwise 
evident in the document or information:
    (1) One of the three classification levels defined in Sec. 2400.6 of 
this part;
    (2) The identity of the original classification authority if other 
than the person whose name appears as the approving or signing official;
    (3) The agency and office of origin; and
    (4) The date or event for declassification, or the notation 
``Originating Agency's Determination Required.''
    (b) Each classified document shall, by marking or other means, 
indicate which portions are classified, with the applicable 
classification level, and which portions are not classified. The 
Director OSTP may, for good cause,

[[Page 508]]

grant and revoke waivers of this requirement for specified classes of 
documents or information. The Director of the Information Security 
Oversight Office shall be notified of any waivers.
    (c) Marking designations implementing the provisions of Executive 
Order 12356, including abbreviations, shall conform to the standards 
prescribed in Directive No. 1 issued by the Information Security 
Oversight Office.
    (d) Foreign government information shall either retain its original 
classification or be assigned a United States classification that shall 
ensure a degree of protection at least equivalent to that required by 
the entity that furnished the information.
    (e) Information assigned a level of classification under predecessor 
Executive Orders shall be considered as classified at that level of 
classification despite the omission of other required markings. Omitted 
markings may be inserted on a document by the officials specified in 
Sec. 2400.18 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 2400.13  Limitations on classification.

    (a) In no case shall information be classified in order to conceal 
violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error; to prevent 
embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency; to restrain 
competition; or to prevent or delay the release of information that does 
not require protection in the interest of national security.
    (b) Basic scientific research information not clearly related to the 
national security may not be classified.
    (c) The Director may reclassify information previously declassified 
and disclosed if it is determined in writing that (1) the information 
requires protection in the interest of national security; and (2) the 
information may reasonably be recovered. These reclassification actions 
shall be reported promptly to the Director of the Information Security 
Oversight Office. Before reclassifying any information, the Director 
shall consider the factors listed in Sec. 2001.6 of Directive No. 1, 
which shall be addressed in the report to the Director of the 
Information Security Oversight Office.
    (d) Information may be classified or reclassified after OSTP has 
received a request for it under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 
552a) or the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552), or the mandatory review 
provisions of Executive Order 12356 (section 3.4) if such classification 
meets the requirements of this Order and is accomplished personally and 
on a document-by-document basis by the Director.


<R04>
                  Subpart C--Derivative Classification


<R05>
Sec. 2400.14  Use of derivative classification.

    (a) Derivative classification is (1) the determination that 
information is in substance the same as information currently 
classified, and (2) the application of the same classification markings. 
Persons who only reproduce, extract, or summarize classified 
information, or who only apply classification markings derived from 
source material or as directed by a classification guide, need not 
possess original classification authority. If a person who applies 
derivative classification markings believes that the paraphrasing, 
restating, or summarizing of classified information has changed the 
level of or removed the basis for classification, that person must 
consult an appropriate official of the originating agency or office of 
origin who has the authority to declassify, downgrade or upgrade the 
information.
    (b) Persons who apply derivative classification markings shall:
    (1) Observe and respect original classification decisions; and
    (2) Carry forward to any newly created documents any assigned 
authorized markings. The declassification date or event that provides 
the longest period of classification shall be used for documents 
classified on the basis of multiple sources.


<R05>
Sec. 2400.15  Classification guides.

    (a) OSTP shall issue and maintain classification guides to 
facilitate the proper and uniform derivative classification of 
information. These guides shall be used to direct derivative 
classification.
    (b) The classification guides shall be approved, in writing, by the 
Director or by officials having Top Secret original classification 
authority. Such approval

[[Page 509]]

constitutes an original classification decision.
    (c) Each classification guide shall specify the information subject 
to classification in sufficient detail to permit its ready and uniform 
identification and categorization and shall set forth the classification 
level and duration in each instance. Additionally, each classification 
guide shall prescribe declassification instructions for each element of 
information in terms of (1) a period of time, (2) the occurrence of an 
event, or (3) a notation that the information shall not be automatically 
declassified without the approval of OSTP.
    (d) The classification guides shall be kept current and shall be 
fully reviewed at least every two years. The Executive Director, OSTP 
shall maintain a list of all OSTP classification guides in current use.
    (e) The Executive Director, OSTP shall receive and maintain the 
record copy of all approved classification guides and changes thereto. 
He will assist the originator in determining the required distribution.
    (f) The Director may, for good cause, grant and revoke waivers of 
the requirement to prepare classification guides for specified classes 
of documents or information. The Director of the Information Security 
Oversight Office shall be notified of any waivers. The Director's 
decision to waive the requirement to issue classification guides for 
specific classes of documents or information will be based, at a 
minimum, on an evaluation of the following factors:
    (1) The ability to segregate and describe the elements of 
information;
    (2) The practicality of producing or disseminating the guide because 
of the nature of the information;
    (3) The anticipated usage of the guide as a basis for derivative 
classification; and
    (4) The availability of alternative sources for derivatively 
classifying the information in a uniform manner.


<R05>
Sec. 2400.16  Derivative classification markings.

    (a) Documents classified derivatively on the basis of source 
documents or classification guides shall bear all markings prescribed in 
Sec. 2400.12 of this part and Directive No. 1 as are applicable. 
Information for these markings shall be taken from the source document 
or instructions in the appropriate classification guide. When markings 
are omitted because they may reveal a confidential source or 
relationship not otherwise evident, as described in Sec. 2400.12 of this 
part, the information may not be used as a basis for derivative 
classification.
    (b) The authority for classification shall be shown as directed in 
Directive No. 1.


<R04>
               Subpart D--Declassification and Downgrading


<R05>
Sec. 2400.17  Policy.

    Declassification of information shall be given emphasis comparable 
to that accorded classification. Information classified pursuant to 
Executive Order 12356 and prior orders shall be declassified or 
downgraded as soon as national security considerations permit. Decisions 
concerning declassification shall be based on the loss of sensitivity of 
the information with the passage of time or on the occurrence of an 
event which permits declassification. When information is reviewed for 
declassification pursuant to this regulation, that information shall be 
declassified unless the designated declassification authority determines 
that the information continues to meet the classification requirements 
prescribed in Sec. 2400.9 of this part despite the passage of time. The 
Office of Science and Technology Policy officials shall coordinate their 
review of classified information with other agencies that have a direct 
interest in the subject matter.


<R05>
Sec. 2400.18  Declassification and downgrading authority.

    Information shall be declassified or downgraded by the official who 
authorized the original classification, if that official is still 
serving the same position; the originator's successor; a supervisory 
official of either; or officials delegated such authority in writing by 
the Director, OSTP. The Executive Director, OSTP shall maintain a 
current listing of persons or positions receiving

[[Page 510]]

those delegations. If possible, these listings shall be unclassified.


<R05>
Sec. 2400.19  Declassification by the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office.

    If the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) 
determines that information is classified in violation of Executive 
Order 12356, the Director, ISOO may require the information to be 
declassified by the agency that originated the classification. Any such 
decision by the Director ISOO may be appealed by the Director, OSTP to 
the National Security Council. The information shall remain classified, 
pending a prompt decision on the appeal.


<R05>
Sec. 2400.20  Systematic review for declassification.

    (a) Permanent records. Systematic review is applicable only to those 
classified records, and presidential papers or records that the 
Archivist of the United States, acting under the Federal Records Act, 
has determined to be of sufficient historical or other value to warrant 
permanent retention.
    (b) Non-permanent records. Non-permanent classified records shall be 
disposed of in accordance with schedules approved by the Administrator 
of General Services under the Records Disposal Act. These schedules 
shall provide for the continued retention of records subject to an 
ongoing mandatory review for declassification request.
    (c) Office of Science and Technology Policy Responsibility. The 
Director, OSTP, shall:
    (1) Issue guidelines for systematic declassification review and, if 
applicable, for downgrading. These guidelines shall be developed in 
consultation with the Archivist and the Director of the Information 
Security Oversight Office and be designated to assist the Archivist in 
the conduct of systematic reviews;
    (2) Designate experienced personnel to provide timely assistance to 
the Archivist in the systematic review process;
    (3) Review and update guidelines for systematic declassification 
review and downgrading at least every five years unless earlier review 
is requested by the Archivist.
    (d) Foreign Government Information. Systematic declassification 
review of foreign government information shall be in accordance with 
guidelines issued by the Director of the Information Security Oversight 
Office.
    (e) Special procedures. The Office of Science and Technology Policy 
shall be bound by the special procedures for systematic review of 
classified cryptologic records and classified records pertaining to 
intelligence activities (including special activities) or intelligence 
sources or methods issued by the Secretary of Defense and the Director 
of Central Intelligence, respectively.


<R05>
Sec. 2400.21  Mandatory review for declassification.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, all 
information classified under Executive Order 12356 or predecessor orders 
shall be subject to a review for declassification by the Office of 
Science and Technology Policy, if:
    (1) The request is made by a United States citizen or permanent 
resident alien, a federal agency, or a State or local government; and
    (2) The request is made in writing and describes the document or 
material containing the information with sufficient specificity to 
enable the Office of Science and Technology Policy to locate it with a 
reasonable amount of effort.
    (b) Requests should be addressed to: Executive Director, Office of 
Science and Technology Policy, Executive Office of the President, 
Washington, DC 20506.
    (c) If the request does not reasonably describe the information 
sought to allow identification of documents containing such information, 
the requester shall be notified that unless additional information is 
provided or the request is made more specific, no further action will be 
taken.
    (d) Information originated by a President, the White House Staff, by 
committees, commissions, or boards appointed by the President, or others 
specifically providing advice and counsel to a President or acting on 
behalf of a

[[Page 511]]

President is exempted from the mandatory review provisions of 
Sec. 2400.24(a) of this part. The Archivist of the United States shall 
have the authority to review, downgrade and declassify information under 
the control of the Administrator of General Services or the Archivist 
pursuant to sections 2107, 2107 note, or 2203 of title 44, United States 
Code. Review procedures developed by the Archivist shall provide for 
consultation with agencies having primary subject matters interest and 
shall be consistent with the provisions of applicable laws or lawful 
agreements that pertain to the respective presidential papers or 
records. Any decision by the Archivist may be appealed to the Director 
of the Information Security Oversight Office. Agencies with primary 
subject matter interest shall be notified promptly of the Director's 
decision on such appeals and may further appeal to the National Security 
Council. The information shall remain classified pending a prompt 
decision on the appeal.
    (e) Office of Science and Technology Policy officials conducting a 
mandatory review for declassification shall declassify information no 
longer requiring protection under Executive Order 12356. They shall 
release this information unless withholding is otherwise authorized 
under applicable law.
    (f) Office of Science and Technology Policy responses to mandatory 
review requests shall be governed by the amount of search and review 
time required to process the request. Normally the requester shall be 
informed of the Office of Science and Technology Policy determination 
within thirty days of receipt of the original request (or within thirty 
days of the receipt of the required amplifying information in accordance 
with paragraph (c) of this section). In the event that a determination 
cannot be made within thirty days, the requester shall be informed of 
the additional time needed to process the request. However, OSTP, shall 
make a final determination within one year from the date of receipt of 
the request except in unusual circumstances.
    (g) When information cannot be declassified in its entirety, OSTP 
will make a reasonable effort to release, consistent with other 
applicable law, those declassified portions of that requested 
information the constitute a coherent segment.
    (h) If the information may not be released in whole or in part, the 
requester shall be given a brief statement as to the reason for denial, 
and notice of the right to appeal the determination in writing within 
sixty days of receipt of the denial to the chairperson of the Office of 
Science and Technology Policy Review Committee. If appealed, the 
requester shall be informed in writing of the appellate determination 
within thirty days of receipt of the appeal.
    (i) When a request is received for information originated by another 
agency, the Executive Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, 
shall:
    (1) Forward the request to such agency for review together with a 
copy of the document containing the information requested, where 
practicable, and where appropriate, with the Office of Science and 
Technology Policy recommendation to withhold or declassify and release 
any of the information;
    (2) Notify the requester of the referral unless the agency to which 
the request is referred objects to such notice on grounds that its 
association with the information requires protection; and
    (3) Request, when appropriate, that the agency notify the Office of 
Science and Technology Policy of its determination.
    (j) If the request requires the rendering of services for which fees 
may be charged under title 5 of the Independent Offices Appropriation 
Act, 31 U.S.C. 483a, the Executive Director, Office of Science and 
Technology Policy, may calculate the anticipated amount of fees to be 
charged.
    (1) Fees for the location and reproduction of information that is 
the subject of a mandatory review request shall be assessed according to 
the following schedule:
    (i) Search for records. $5.00 per hour when the search is conducted 
by a clerical employee; $8.00 per hour when the search is conducted by a 
professional employee. No fee shall be assessed for searches of less 
than one hour.
    (ii) Reproduction of documents. Documents will be reproduced at a 
rate of

[[Page 512]]

$.25 per page for all copying of four pages or more. No fee shall be 
assessed for reproducing documents that are three pages or less, or for 
the first three pages of longer documents.
    (2) Where it is anticipated that the fees chargeable under this 
section will amount to more than $25, and the requestor has not 
indicated in advance a willingness to pay fees as high as are 
anticipated, the requester shall be promptly notified of the amount of 
the anticipated fee or such portion thereof as can readily be estimated. 
In instances where the estimated fees will greatly exceed $25, an 
advance deposit may be required. Dispatch of such a notice or request 
shall suspend the running of the period for response by OSTP until a 
reply is received from the requester.
    (3) Remittances shall be in the form either of a personal check or 
bank draft drawn on a bank in the United States, or a postal money 
order. Remittances shall be made to the Treasury of the United States 
and mailed to the Executive Director, Office of Science and Technology 
Policy, Executive Office of the President, Washington, DC 20506.
    (4) A receipt for fees paid will be given only upon request. Refund 
of fees paid for services actually rendered will not be made.
    (5) If a requester fails to pay within thirty days for services 
rendered, further action on any other requests submitted by that 
requestor shall be suspended.
    (6) The Executive Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy 
may waive all or part of any fee provided for in this section when it is 
deemed to be in either the interest of the OSTP or the general public.


<R05>
Sec. 2400.22  Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act requests.

    The Office of Science and Technology Policy shall process requests 
for declassification that are submitted under the provisions of the 
Freedom of Information Act, as amended, or the Privacy Act of 1974, in 
accordance with the provisions of those Acts.


<R05>
Sec. 2400.23  Prohibition.

    In response to a request for information under the Freedom of 
Information Act, the Privacy Act of 1974, or the mandatory review 
provisions of Executive Order 12356 and Directive No. 1, or this 
regulation:
    (a) The Office of Science and Technology Policy shall refuse to 
confirm or deny the existence or non-existence of requested information 
whenever the fact of its existence or non-existence is itself 
classifiable under Executive Order 12356.
    (b) When the Office of Science and Technology Policy receives any 
request for documents in its custody that were classified by another 
agency, it shall refer copies of the request and the requested documents 
to the originating agency for processing, and may, after consultation 
with the originating agency, inform the requester of the referral. In 
cases which the originating agency determines in writing that a response 
under paragraph (a) of this section is required, the Office of Science 
and Technology Policy shall respond to the requester in accordance with 
that paragraph.


<R05>
Sec. 2400.24  Downgrading.

    (a) When it will serve a useful purpose, original classification 
authorities may, at the time of original classification, specify that 
downgrading of the assigned classification will occur on a specified 
date or upon the occurrence of a stated event.
    (b) Classified information marked for automatic downgrading is 
downgraded accordingly without notification to holders.
    (c) Classified information not marked for automatic downgrading may 
be assigned a lower classification designation by the originator or by 
an official authorized to declassify the same information. Prompt notice 
of such downgrading shall be provided to known holders of the 
information.


<R04>
                         Subpart E--Safeguarding


<R05>
Sec. 2400.25  Access.

    (a) A person is eligible for access to classified information 
provided that a determination of trustworthiness has

[[Page 513]]

been made by agency heads or designated officials and provided that such 
access is essential to the accomplishment of lawful and authorized 
Government purposes. A personnel security clearance is an indication 
that the trustworthiness decision has been made. Procedures shall be 
established by the head of each office to prevent access to classified 
information before a personnel security clearance has been granted. The 
number of people cleared and granted access to classified information 
shall be maintained at the minimum number that is consistent with 
operational requirements and needs. No one has a right to have access to 
classified information solely by virtue of rank or position. The final 
responsibility for determinating whether an individual's official duties 
require possession of or access to any element or item of classified 
information, and whether the individual has been granted the appropriate 
security clearance by proper authority, rests with the individual who 
has authorized possession, knowledge, or control of the information and 
not with the prospective recipient. These principles are equally 
applicable if the prospective recipient is an organizational entity, 
other Federal agencies, contractors, foreign governments, and others.
    (b) When access to a specific classification category is no longer 
required for the performance of an individual's assigned duties, the 
security clearance will be administratively adjusted, without prejudice 
to the individual, to the classification category, if any, required.
    (c) The Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy may create 
special access programs to control access, distribution, and protection 
of particularly sensitive information classified pursuant to Executive 
Order 12356 or predecessor orders if:
    (1) Normal management and safeguarding procedures do not limit 
access sufficiently;
    (2) The number of persons with access is limited to the minimum 
necessary to meet the objective of providing extra protection for the 
information;
    (3) The special access program is established in writing; and
    (4) A system of accounting for the program is established and 
maintained.


<R05>
Sec. 2400.26  Access by historical researchers and former Presidential appointees.

    (a) The requirement in Section 4.1(a) of Executive Order 12356 that 
access to classified information may be granted only as is essential to 
the accomplishment of authorized and lawful Government purposes may be 
waived as provided in paragraph (b) of this section for persons who:
    (1) Are engaged in historical research projects, or
    (2) Previously have occupied policy-making positions to which they 
were appointed by the President.
    (b) Waivers under paragraph (a) of this section may be granted only 
if the Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy:
    (1) Determines in writing that access is consistent with the 
interest of national security;
    (2) Takes appropriate steps to protect classified information from 
unauthorized disclosure or compromise, and ensures that the information 
is safeguarded in a manner consistent with Executive Order 12356;
    (3) Limits the access granted to former presidential appointees to 
items that the person originated, reviewed, signed, or received while 
serving as a presidential appointee; and
    (4) Has received a written agreement from the researcher or former 
presidential appointee that his notes can be reviewed by OSTP for a 
determination that no classified material is contained therein.


<R05>
Sec. 2400.27  Storage of classification information.

    Whenever classified information is not under the personal control 
and observation of an authorized person, it will be guarded or stored in 
a locked security container approved for the storage and protection of 
the appropriate level of classified information as prescribed in 
Sec. 2001.43 of Directive No. 1.

[[Page 514]]


<R05>
Sec. 2400.28  Dissemination of classified information.

    Heads of OSTP offices shall establish procedures consistent with 
this Regulation for dissemination of classified material. The 
originating official may prescribe specific restrictions on 
dissemination of classified information when necessary.
    (a) Classified information shall not be disseminated outside the 
executive branch except under conditions that ensure that the 
information will be given protection equivalent to that afforded within 
the executive branch.
    (b) Except as provided by directives issued by the President through 
the National Security Council, classified information originating in one 
agency may not be disseminated outside any other agency to which it has 
been made available without the consent of the originating agency. For 
purposes of this Section, the Department of Defense shall be considered 
one agency.

of all classified documents covered by special access programs, and of 
all Secret and Confidential documents which are marked with special 
dissemination and reproduction limitations.
    (h) The Security Officer will develop procedures for the 
accountability and control of Secret and Confidential information. These 
procedures shall require all Secret and Confidential material originated 
or received by OSTP to be controlled. Control shall be accomplished by 
the ATSCO.


<R05>
Sec. 2400.30  Reproduction of classified information.

    Documents or portions of documents and materials that contain Top 
Secret information shall not be reproduced without the consent of the 
originator or higher authority. Any stated prohibition against 
reproduction shall be strictly observed. Copying of documents containing 
classified information at any level shall be minimized. Specific 
reproduction equipment shall be designated for the reproduction of 
classified information and rules for reproduction of classified 
information shall be posted on or near the designated equipment. Notices 
prohibiting reproduction of classified information shall be posted on 
equipment used only for the reproduction of unclassified information. 
All copies of classified documents reproduced for any purpose including 
those incorporated in a working paper are subject to the same controls 
prescribed for the document from which the reproduction is made.


<R05>
Sec. 2400.31  Destruction of classified information.

    (a) Classified information no longer needed in current working files 
or for reference or record purposes shall be processed for appropriate 
disposition in accordance with the provisions of chapters 21 and 33 of 
title 44, U.S.C., which governs disposition of classified records. 
Classified information approved for destruction shall be destroyed in 
accordance with procedures and methods prescribed by the Director, OSTP, 
as implemented by the Security Officer. These procedures and methods 
must provide adequate protection to prevent access by unauthorized 
persons and must preclude recognition

[[Page 515]]

or reconstruction of the classified information or material.
    (b) All classified information to be destroyed will be provided to 
the ATSCO for disposition. Controlled documents will be provided whole 
so that accountability records may be corrected prior to destruction by 
the ATSCO.


<R05>
Sec. 2400.32  Transmittal of classified information.

    The transmittal of classified information outside of the Office of 
Science and Technology Policy shall be in accordance with procedures of 
Sec. 2001.44 of Directive No. 1. The Security Officer shall be 
responsible for resolving any questions relative to such transmittal.


<R05>
Sec. 2400.33  Loss or possible compromise.

    (a) Any person who has knowledge of the loss or possible compromise 
of classified information shall immediately report the circumstances to 
the Security Officer. The Security Officer shall notify the Director and 
the agency that originated the information as soon as possible so that a 
damage assessment may be conducted and appropriate measures taken to 
negate or minimize any adverse effect of the compromise.
    (b) The Security Officer shall initiate an inquiry to:
    (1) Determine cause,
    (2) Place responsibility, and
    (3) Take corrective measures and appropriate administrative, 
disciplinary, or legal action.
    (c) The Security Officer shall keep the Director advised on the 
details of the inquiry.


<R04>
                Subpart F--Foreign Government Information


<R05>
Sec. 2400.34  Classification.

    (a) Foreign government information classified by a foreign 
government or international organization of governments shall retain its 
original classification designation or be assigned a United States 
classification designation that will ensure a degree of protection 
equivalent to that required by the government or organization that 
furnished the information. Original classification authority is not 
required for this purpose.
    (b) Foreign government information that was not classified by a 
foreign entity but was provided with the expectation, expressed or 
implied, that it be held in confidence must be classified because 
Executive Order 12356 states a presumption of damage to the national 
security in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information.


<R05>
Sec. 2400.35  Duration of classification.

    Foreign government information shall not be assigned a date or event 
for automatic declassification unless specified or agreed to by the

Sec. 2400.37  Mandatory review.

    Except as provided in this paragraph, OSTP shall process mandatory 
review requests for classified records containing foreign government 
information in accordance with Sec. 2400.21. The agency that initially 
received or classified the foreign government information shall be 
responsible for making a declassification determination after 
consultation with concerned agencies. If OSTP receives a request for 
mandatory review and is not the agency that received or classified the 
foreign government information, it shall refer the request to the 
appropriate agency for action. Consultation with the foreign originator 
through appropriate channels may be necessary prior to final action on 
the request.


<R05>
Sec. 2400.38  Protection of foreign government information.

<R04>
                         Subpart A--Introduction


<R05>
Sec. 2700.1  References.

    (a) Executive Order 12065, ``National Security Information,'' June 
28, 1978, (hereinafter E.O. 12065).
    (b) Information Security Oversight Office, Directive No. 1, 
``National Security Information,'' October 2, 1978, (hereinafter ISOO 
Directive No. 1).


<R05>
Sec. 2700.2  Purpose.

    The purpose of this Regulation is to ensure, consistent with the 
authorities listed in Sec. 2700.1, that national security information 
originated and/or held by the Office for Micronesian Status Negotiations 
(OMSN), which includes the Status Liaison Office, Saipan, Northern 
Mariana Islands (SLNO), is protected. To ensure that such information is 
protected, but only to the extent and for such period as is necessary, 
this regulation identifies the information to be protected and 
prescribes certain classification, declassification and safeguarding 
procedures to be followed.


<R05>
Sec. 2700.3  Applicability.

    This Regulation supplements E.O. 12065 within OMSN with regard to 
National Security Information. In consonance with the authorities listed 
in Sec. 2700.1, it establishes general policies and certain procedures 
for the classification, declassification and safeguarding of information 
which is owned by, is produced for or by, or is under the control of 
OMSN.


<R04>
                   Subpart B--Original Classification


<R05>
Sec. 2700.11  Basic policy.

    (a) General. It is the policy of OMSN to make available to the 
public as much information concerning its activities as is possible, 
consistent with its responsibility to protect the national security.
    (b) Safeguarding national security information. Within the Federal 
Government there is some information which because it bears directly on 
the effectiveness of our national defense and the conduct of our foreign 
relations, must be subject to some constraints for the security of our 
nation.
    (c) Balancing test. To balance the public's interest in access to 
government information with the need to protect certain national 
security information from disclosure, these regulations indentify the 
information to be protected, prescribe classification, downgrading, 
declassification, and safeguarding procedures to be followed, and 
establish education, monitoring and

[[Page 521]]

sanctioning systems to insure their effectiveness. When questions arise 
as whether the need to protect information may be outweighed by the 
public interest in disclosure of the information, they shall be referred 
to OMSN pursuant to Sec. 2700.32(b) for a determination whether the 
public interest in disclosure outweighs the damage to national security 
that might reasonably be expected from disclosure.


<R05>
Sec. 2700.12  Criteria for and level of original classification.

    (a) General Policy. Documents or other material are to be classified 
only when protecting the national security requires that the information 
they contain be withheld from public disclosure. Information may not be 
classified to conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative 
error, or to prevent embarrassment to a person, organization or agency, 
or to restrain competition. No material may be classified to limit 
dissemination, or to prevent or delay public release, unless its 
classification is consistent with E.O. 12065.
    (b) Criteria. To be eligible for classification, information must 
meet two requirements:
    (1) First, it must deal with one of the criteria set forth in 
section 1-301 of E.O. 12065;
    (2) Second, the President's Personal Representative for Micronesian 
Status Negotiations or his delegate who has original classification 
authority must determine that unauthorized disclosure of the information 
or material can reasonably be expected to cause at least identifiable 
harm to the national security.
    (c) Classification designations. Only three designations of 
classification are authorized--``Top Secret,'' ``Secret,'' 
``Confidential.'' No other classification designation is authorized or 
shall have force.
    (d) Unnecessary classification, and classification at a level higher 
than is necessary, shall be avoided. If there is reasonable doubt as to 
which designation in section 1-1 of E.O. 12065 is appropriate, or 
whether information should be classified at all, the less restrictive 
designation should be used, or the information should not be classified.


<R05>
Sec. 2700.13  Duration of original classification.

    (a) Information or material which is classified after December 1, 
1978, shall be marked at the time of classification with the date or 
event for declassification or a date for review for declassification. 
This date or event shall be as early as national security permits and 
shall be no more than six years after original classification except as 
provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Only the President's Personal Representative for Micronesian 
Status Negotiations may authorize a classification period exceeding six 
years. Originally classified information that is so designated shall be 
identified with the authority and reason for extension. This authority 
shall be used sparingly. In those cases where extension of 
classification is warranted, a declassification date or event, or a date 
for review shall be set. This date or event shall be early as national 
security permits and shall be no more than twenty years after original 
classification except that for foreign information the date or event may 
be up to thirty years after original classification.


<R05>
Sec. 2700.14  Challenges to classification.

    If holders of classified information believe the information is 
improperly or unnecessarily classified, or that original classification 
has been extended for too long a period, they should discuss the matter 
with their immediate superiors or the classifier of the information. If 
these discussions do not satisfy the concerns of the challenger, the 
matter should be brough to the attention of the chairman of the OMSN 
Information Security Oversight Committee, established pursuant to 
Sec. 2700.51. Action on such challenges shall be taken within 30 days 
from date of receipt and the challenger shall be notified of the 
results. When requested, anonymity of the challenger shall be preserved.

[[Page 522]]


<R04>
                  Subpart C--Derivative Classification


<R05>
Sec. 2700.21  Definition and application.

    Derivative classification is the act of assigning a level of 
classification to information which is determined to be the same in 
substance as information which is currently classified. Thus, derivative 
classification may be accomplished by any person cleared for access to 
that level of information, regardless of whether the person has original 
classification authority at that level.


<R05>
Sec. 2700.22  Classification guides.

    OMSN shall issue classification guides pursuant to section 2-2 of 
E.O. 12065. These guides, which shall be used to direct derivative 
classification, shall identify the information to be protected in 
specific and uniform terms so that the information involved can be 
readily identified. The classification guides shall be approved in 
writing by the President's Personal Representative for Micronesian 
Status Negotiations. Such approval constitutes an original 
classification decision. The classification guides shall be kept current 
and shall be reviewed at least every two years.


<R04>
               Subpart D--Declassification and Downgrading


<R05>
Sec. 2700.31  Declassification authority.

    The Director, OMSN, is authorized to declassify OMSN originated 
documents after consultation with the appropriate OMSN staff members.


<R05>
Sec. 2700.32  Declassification general.

    Declassification of classified information shall be given emphasis 
comparable to that accorded to classification. The determination to 
declassify information shall not be made on the basis of the level of 
classification assigned, but on the loss of the sensitivity of the 
information with the passage of time, and with due regard for the public 
interest in access to official information. At the time of review, any 
determination not to declassify shall be based on a determination that 
despite the passage of time since classification, release of information 
reasonably could still be expected to cause at least identifiable damage 
to the national security.


<R05>
Sec. 2700.33  Mandatory review for declassification.

    (a) General. All information classified under the Order or prior 
orders, except as provided for in section 3-503 of E.O. 12065 shall be 
subject to review for declassification upon request of a member of the 
public, a government employee, or an agency.
    (b) Receipt. (1) Requests for mandatory review for declassification 
under section 3-501 of E.O. 12065 must be in writing and should be 
addressed to: Office for Micronesian Status Negotiations, ATTN: Security 
Officer (Mandatory Review Request), Room 3356, Department of the 
Interior, Washington, DC 20240.
    (2) The requestor shall be informed of the date of receipt of the 
request at OMSN. This date will be the basis for the time limits 
specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (3) If the request does not reasonably describe the information 
sought, the requestor shall be notified that, unless additional 
information is provided or the request is made more specific, no further 
action will be taken.
    (4) Subject to paragraph (b)(7) of this section, if the information 
requested is in the custody of and under the exclusive declassification 
authority of OMSN, OMSN shall determine whether the information or any 
reasonably segregable portion of it no longer requires protection. If 
so, OMSN shall promptly make such information available to the 
requester, unless withholding it is otherwise warranted under applicable 
law. If the information may not be released, in whole or in part, OMSN 
shall give the requester a brief statement of the reasons, a notice of 
the right to appeal the determination to the agency review committee, 
and notice that such an appeal must be filed with the review committee 
within 60 days.
    (5) When OMSN receives a request for information in a document which 
is in its custody, but which was classified by

[[Page 523]]

another agency, it shall refer the request to the appropriate agency for 
review, together with a copy of the document containing the information 
requested, where practicable. OMSN shall also notify the requester of 
the referral, unless the association of the reviewing agency with the 
information requires protection. The reviewing agency shall review a 
document in coordination with any other agency involved with the 
classification or having a direct interest in the subject matter. The 
reviewing agency shall respond directly to the requester in accordance 
with the pertinent procedures described above and, if requested, shall 
notify OMSN of its determination.
    (6) Requests for declassification of classified documents originated 
by OMSN or another agency but in the possession and control of the 
Administrator of General Services, pursuant to 44 U.S.C 2107 or 2107 
Note, shall be referred by the Archivist to the agency of origin for 
processing and for direct response to the requests. The Archivist will 
inform requesters of such referrals.
    (7) In the case of requests for documents containing foreign 
government information, OMSN, if it is also the agency which initially 
received the foreign government information, shall determine whether the 
foreign government information in the document may be declassified and 
released in accordance with agency policies or guidelines, consulting 
with other agencies of subject matter interest as necessary. If OMSN is 
not the agency which received the foreign government information, it 
shall refer the request to the latter agency, which shall take action on 
the request. In those cases where available agency policies or 
guidelines do not apply, consultation with the foreign originator 
through appropriate channels may be advisable prior to final action on 
the request.
    (8) If any agency makes a request on behalf of a member of the 
public, the request shall be considered as a request by that member of 
the public and handled accordingly.
    (c) Review. (1) Within sixty days from its receipt, OMSN shall 
inform the requestor of the determination of the mandatory review for 
declassification.
    (2) If the determination is to withhold some or all of the material 
requested, the requestor may appeal the determination. The requestor 
shall be informed that an appeal must be made in writing within sixty 
days of receipt of the denial and should be addressed to the chairperson 
of the OMSN Classification Review Committee established pursuant to 
Sec. 2700.52.
    (3) No agency in possession of a classified document may, in 
response to a request for the document made under the Freedom of 
Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) or under section 3-5 of E.O. 12065, 
refuse to confirm the existence or non-existence of the document, unless 
the fact of its existence or non-existence would itself be classifiable.
    (4) The requestor shall be informed of the appellate determination 
within thirty days of receipt of the appeal.
    (5) In considering requests for mandatory review, OMSN may decline 
to review again any request for material which has been recently 
reviewed and denied, except insofar as the request constitutes an appeal 
under paragraph (f) of this section.
    (d) Processing of Requests. The processing of requests by OMSN shall 
be as follows:
    (1) The Security Officer or his designee shall record the request, 
and arrange for search and review of the documents. The documents will 
be reviewed for declassification in accordance with these regulations or 
any applicable guidelines. If the documents remain classified and are 
not to be released, in whole or in part, the reviewing office will also 
prepare a letter informing the requester as described in paragraph 
(b)(4) of this section. The letter to the requester shall be signed by 
the President's Personal Representative for Micronesian Status 
Negotiations, his Deputy or the Status Liaison Officer. The Security 
Officer or his designee shall record disposition of the case and forward 
the letter of denial to the requester.
    (2) If any request requires obtaining the views of other agencies, 
the receiving office shall arrange coordination of review with such 
other agencies.
    (3) When all documents involved in the request are declassified and 
released, the receiving office will send a

[[Page 524]]

release statement, to the requester, and shall inform the requester of 
any fees due before releasing documents.
    (4) In the case of documents of agency origin requested by a 
Presidential Library on behalf of a member of the public, if there is a 
partial denial, the letter will advise the requester as described in 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section, but the requester will be referred to 
the Archivist for copies of the released document, with portions 
excised. The receiving office will transmit such documents, with 
portions marked to be excised, to Archives which will transmit them with 
portions excised to the Presidential Library for its records and for use 
in the case of further similar requests.
    (5) The Security Officer or his designee shall also coordinate 
requests from other agencies seeking the views of OMSN as to 
declassification of documents originated by such other agencies but 
involving information of primary subject matter interest to OMSN. The 
Security Officer or his designee will transmit the documents to the 
reviewing individual for a determination as to declassification and will 
coordinate the reply of OMSN to the requesting agency.
    (e) Appeals. (1) The President's Personal Representative for 
Micronesian Status Negotiations shall receive appeals for denial of 
documents by OMSN. Such appeals shall be addressed to President's 
Personal Representative for Micronesian Status Negotiations, Suite 3356, 
Interior Department Building, Washington, DC 20240. The appeal must be 
received in OMSN within 60 days of the date of the original denial 
letter or the final release of documents, whichever is later.
    (2) Appeals shall be decided within 30 days of their receipt.
    (f) Fees. (1) Fees for the location and reproduction of information 
which is the subject of a mandatory review request shall be assessed 
according to the following schedule:
    (i) Search for records: $5.00 per hour when the search is conducted 
by a clerical employee; $8.00 per hour when the search is conducted by a 
professional employee. No fee shall be assessed for searches of less 
than one hour.
    (ii) Reproduction of documents: Documents will be reproduced at a 
rate of $.25 per page for all copying of four pages or more. No fee 
shall be assessed for reproducing documents which are three pages or 
less, or for the first three pages of longer documents.
    (2) Where it is anticipated that the fees chargeable under this 
section will amount to more than $25.00, and the requestor has not 
indicated in advance a willingness to pay fees as high as are 
anticipated, the requestor shall be promptly notified of the amount of 
the anticipated fee or such portion thereof as can readily be estimated. 
In instances where the estimated fees will greatly exceed $25.00, an 
advance deposit may be required. Dispatch of such a notice or request 
shall suspend the running of the period for response by OMSN until a 
reply is received from the requestor.
    (3) Remittance shall be in the form either of a personal check or 
bank draft on a bank in the United States, or a postal money order. 
Remittance shall be made payable to Treasurer of the United States and 
mailed to the address noted in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (4) A receipt for fees paid will be provided only upon request. 
Refund of fees for services actually rendered will not be made.
    (5) OMSN may waive all or part of any fee provided for in this 
section when it is deemed to be in either the interest of OMSN or of the 
general public.

employee enters on duty, he shall be given instruction in sufficient 
detail in security procedures and practices to inform him of his 
responsibilities arising from his access to classified data.
    (f) Access by Historical Researchers and Former Presidential 
Appointees. In keeping with provisions 4-301 and 4-302 of E.O. 12065, 
the President's Personal Representative for Micronesian Status 
Negotiations shall designate appropriate officials to determine, prior

    The classification, declassification, safeguarding and handling of 
classified information within the Office of the Vice President will 
comply with the letter and spirit of those directives listed in 
Sec. 2800.2. All personnel of the Office of the Vice President are 
responsible individually for complying with the provisions of these

Vice President.


<R05>
Sec. 2800.4  General information.

    (a) Staff Security Officer/Top Secret Control Officer. A Vice 
Presidential Staff Security Officer and Assistant Staff Security Officer 
will be assigned to perform the duties as outlined in these regulations. 
They will normally be on the staff of the Assistant to the Vice 
President for National Security Affairs. The Staff Security Officer and 
Assistant Staff Security Officer will serve as Top Secret Control 
Officer and Assistant Top Secret Control Officer and custodians of 
classified material for the Office of the Vice President respectively, 
and will be responsible for the overall supervision of the Top Secret 
Control program. They will maintain positive control over the movement 
of all Top Secret material under their jurisdiction.
    (b) Custodian, Office of the Assistant to the Vice President for 
Congressional Relations. The Assistant to the Vice President for 
Congressional Relations, Office of the President of the Senate, will be 
designated as Custodian of classified material for that office. He will 
be responsible for compliance with the instructions contained herein. In 
this capacity, he will be charged with safeguarding classified material 
necessary to the operation of the office.
    (c) National Security Classifications. Classifications of National 
Security Information are defined in Executive Order 12065, sections 1-
102 through 1-104.
    (d) Prohibited Markings. (1) The caveats ``FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY'' 
and ``ADMINISTRATIVELY RESTRICTED'' are used within the Office of the 
Vice President to designate certain unclassified information which 
requires control. These caveats will under no circumstances be applied 
to information which qualifies as classified information. Further, 
neither they nor other terms will be used in conjunction with the 
prescribed security classifications of CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET and TOP 
SECRET.
    (2) Unclassified information bearing either of the foregoing 
administrative designations cannot be protected from release under the 
national security exemption of the Freedom of Information Act (although 
other exemptions may be available).
    (e) Security Clearances. No person shall be given access to 
classified information or material unless a favorable background 
investigation has been

[[Page 529]]

completed determining that the individual is trustworthy and that access 
is necessary for the performance of official duties.
    (1) Security Clearance Procedures. (i) The Counsel to the Vice 
President will:
    (A) Be responsible for the processing of full field investigations 
for personnel assigned to the Vice President's staff. Department of 
Defense detailees are processed by the Defense Investigative Service.
    (B) Inform the Staff Security Office of individuals whose full field 
investigations have been satisfactorily completed and approved and of 
any subsequent changes.
    (C) Notify the Staff Security Office as soon as he/she is aware that 
a staff member is planning to terminate his/her employment.
    (ii) The Staff Security Office will provide newly cleared persons 
with a security orientation briefing covering policy and procedures for 
handling classified information and material. After the briefing 
individuals will sign a Statement of Understanding of Security 
Procedures (Attachment 1). This statement will be kept on file by the 
Staff Security Office.
    (iii) There is no such thing as an ``Interim Security Clearance'' 
for persons employed by or detailed to the Office of the Vice President. 
Under no circumstances will uncleared persons be given access to 
classified material. Access to classified material will be denied until 
the individual has had a satisfactorily completed background 
investigation, has received the security orientation briefing and signed 
the Statement of Understanding of Security Procedures.
    (iv) The Staff Security Office, as part of an individual's departure 
debriefing, will remind them of their continuing responsibilities to 
protect classified information to which they have had access during the 
performance of their official duties. After being debriefed, the 
individual will sign a Security Termination Statement acknowledging his 
responsibilities (Attachment 2).
    (2) Satisfactory completion of a background investigation does not 
in itself grant an individual access to classified information. 
Individual clearances for access to classified information or material 
will be controlled by the Staff Security Office and certified in writing 
on an individual basis.
    (f) Access to Classified Material. Each member of the staff who has 
custody or possession of classified information is responsible for 
providing the required degree of protection from unauthorized disclosure 
at all times.
    (1) Classified information and material will only be disclosed to an 
individual after it has been determined that the individual possesses 
the required clearance and has a valid ``need to know.'' Persons 
releasing the information shall be responsible in every case for 
determining the recipient's eligibility for access.
    (2) Access to Sensitive Compartmented Intelligence Information will 
be controlled by the Assistant to the Vice President for National 
Security Affairs.
    (g) Custody and safekeeping of Classified Material. (1) Classified 
material addressed to the Office of the Vice President will normally be 
delivered to and receipted for by the Staff Security Office where it 
will be entered into the classified material control system.
    (i) Staff members receiving classified material from any source by 
any means will personally deliver such material to the Staff Security 
Office for appropriate entry into the classified control system.
    (ii) Conversely, members of the staff desiring to transmit 
classified material will deliver the material to the Staff Security 
Office for handling in accordance with paragraph (h)(5) of this section.
    (2) Storage of Classified Material. (i) Classified material will be 
stored only in accordance with the provisions of ISOO Directive No. 1, 
paragraph IV-F-1 through 4.
    (ii) Filing of unclassified material in security containers is 
prohibited except where the unclassified material is an integral part of 
a file which contains classified material. If extenuating circumstances 
necessitate the use of a security container for storing only 
unclassified material, the container will be marked with a sign stating 
``This container is not used to store

[[Page 530]]

classified material'' or ``Do not store classified material in this 
container.''
    (3) Record of safe locations. The Staff Security Office will assign 
numbers to all security containers used to store classified material in 
the Office of the Vice President. A record of safe numbers, locations 
and date of last combination change will be maintained in the Staff 
Security Office.
    (4) Changing of lock combinations. Combinations of security 
containers will be changed by the Staff Security Office or the Secret 
Service. This service may be requested by contacting the Staff Security 
Office. Combinations will be changed in accordance with the provisions 
of ISOO Directive No. 1, paragraph IV-F-5.
    (5) Records of combinations. Records of combinations shall be 
maintained by the Staff Security Office. Whenever a combination is 
changed, the new combination and other required information will be 
recorded on GSA Optional Form 63. The sealed envelope will then be 
delivered to the Staff Security Office for retention in the vault safe.
    (6) Custodians. Each container used for storage of classified 
material within the Office of the Vice President will have assigned a 
primary and alternate custodian. Responsibility for security of these 
containers shall rest with those persons, and their names shall be 
affixed on the outside of the top drawer of each container positioned so 
as to be readily discernible. Optional Form 63 shall be used for this 
purpose.
    (h) Handling of Classified Material--(1) Use of cover sheets. A 
separate cover sheet indicating the classification of the material will 
be fastened to the top page of cover of each CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET or TOP 
SECRET document.
    (2) Unattended documents. Classified material will be under the 
direct supervision of a person with an appropriate security clearance 
and a verified need-to-know at all times when in use. Special care will 
be taken to insure that classified material is not left unsecured or 
unattended in an office.
    (3) Working papers. Working papers are documents, including drafts, 
photographs, etc., created to assist in the formulation and preparation 
of finished papers. Working papers containing classified information 
will be marked with the appropriate classification and provided the same 
degree of protection as that given to other documents of an equal 
category of classification.
    (4) Communications security. Classified information shall not be 
discussed over any voice communications device except as authorized over 
approved secure communications circuits. This restriction also applies 
to electrical transmission of classified material via any unsecure 
circuitry involving teletypes, DEX equipment or other systems of a like 
nature. Appropriate secure facilities for the discussion or transmittal 
of classified material may be arranged by contacting the Staff Security 
Office.
    (5) Transmittal of Classified Material--(i) Outside the Office of 
the Vice President and the White House Complex. The Staff Security 
Office is responsible for transmitting or transferring all classified 
material outside the Office of the Vice President and the White House 
Complex in accordance with the provisions of ISOO Directive No. 1, 
paragraphs I, G and H.
    (ii) Within the Office of the Vice President and the White House 
Complex. Transfer or movement of classified material will be 
accomplished only by properly cleared persons handcarrying the material 
to the recipient. The material shall be carried in an envelope marked 
with the appropriate classification. Use of see through messenger 
envelopes is not authorized. Recipients will sign a receipt (GSA 
Optional Form 112) for all material classified SECRET and TOP SECRET. 
Whenever TOP SECRET material is transferred, the Staff Security Office 
will be notified in order to maintain accurate accountability of the 
material. Classified material will never be delivered to an uncleared 
person, left in an unoccupied office, or sent through unclassified mail 
delivery/distribution systems.
    (iii) Staff members requiring the use of classified material at 
conferences or meetings held outside the Washington, DC Metropolitan 
area and who intend to use commercial transportation shall provide the 
material to the Staff Security Office far enough in advance to assure 
that the material will be available

[[Page 531]]

on or before the date needed. This requirement does not apply when 
utilizing government/military transportation. In this case, material may 
be handcarried. The Staff Security Office will brief each staff member 
prior to departure concerning security requirements or arrangements 
needed to safeguard the material while away from his office. For 
meetings or conferences within the Washington, DC Metropolitan area, 
members may handcarry classified material. Use of classified material 
during a conference or meeting requires increased awareness and 
precautionary handling to avoid security violations and/or compromises. 
Staff members using classified material during a meeting or conference 
are responsible for ensuring that the material is properly protected at 
all times, and that personnel present posses appropriate clearances for 
the material being presented.
    (iv) Visits to foreign countries. Special precautions must be taken 
when visiting foreign countries to ensure classified material is 
protected at all times. For all visits to foreign countries a member of 
the staff will be appointed as custodian for all classified material 
reqired for the success of the mission. This individual will be the 
holder of a diplomatic passport which exempts him from customs 
inspections. Individual so designated will coordinate with United States 
embassy personnel in the country to be visited for securing of 
classified material within the embassy compound or other appropriate 
secure area during the course of the visit.
    (6) Preparation and marking of Classified Material. All classified 
material originating within the office of the Vice President will be 
prepared and marked by properly authorized and cleared personnel in 
accordance with ISOO Directive No. 1, paragraphs I, G, and H. A sample 
letter is attached for your guidance (Attachment 3). Derivitive 
information will be prepared and classified in accordance with ISOO 
Directive No. 1, paragraphs II A through C. Questions concerning 
procedures should be directed to the Staff Security Office.
    (7) Reproduction of Classified Material. (i) Reproduction of 
classified material will be accomplished only by properly cleared 
persons.
    (ii) Reproduction of TOP SECRET material will be accomplished only 
by a member of the Staff Security Office or a designated representative 
of that office.
    (iii) Accountability of reproduced classified material will be 
maintained by informing the Staff Security Office of the reproduction of 
SECRET and TOP SECRET material, the number of copies reproduced and 
their disposition.
    (iv) Reproduction machines can retain the imagery of material passed 
through them. Therefore, to avoid inadvertent disclosure of classified 
information through subsequent use of machines, staff members will 
always run machines through four cycles (four blank pages) after the 
last page of the classified material has been reproduced. These pages 
will be destroyed in the same manner as classified material.
    (8) Destruction of Classified Material. (i) SECRET and TOP SECRET 
material will be given to the Staff Security Office for destruction to 
insure destruction is properly recorded and destroyed material is 
removed from the classified control system.
    (ii) CONFIDENTIAL material may be destroyed in the holder's office 
by tearing lengthwise and placing in a ``Burn Bag'' specifically 
designated for classified material.
    (iii) Classified waste material will be separated from other office 
waste material and placed in ``Burn Bags.'' Classified waste material 
includes working papers, notes, drafts of classified correspondence, 
carbon paper, typewriter ribbons and any other material containing 
information requiring destruction. ``Burn Bags'' will be collected daily 
by a member of the White House Executive Protective Service who will 
then dispose of the bags in a secure facility.
    (iv) Typewriter ribbons. Classified material can be reproduced from 
imprints on used typewriter ribbons. Therefore, ribbons which are used 
in the preparation of classified material must be safeguarded 
accordingly, i.e., they will

[[Page 532]]

be stored in a safe at the close of business, destroyed as classified 
waste when no longer serviceable, etc.
    (9) Inventories. The Staff Security Office will conduct inventories 
of all TOP SECRET material charged to the Office of the Vice President 
at least annually to determine the adequacy of control procedures and 
insure accountability.
    (i) Loss or compromise. Any person who has knowledge of loss of 
possible compromise of classified information shall promptly report the 
circumstances to the Staff Security Office for appropriate action in 
accordance with ISOO Directive No. 1, paragraph IV, H.
    (j) Penalties. Any individual breach of security may warrant 
penalties up to and including the separation of the individual from his 
employment or criminal prosecution.
    (k) Special access. Special access authority is required for release 
of Sensitive Compartmented Intelligence Information. The names of 
personnel cleared for access to this category of information are on file 
in the Staff Security Office.


<R05>
Sec. 2800.5  Policies.

    (a) Basic policy. Except as provided in the Atomic Energy Act of 
1943, as amended, Executive Order 12065, as implemented by ISOO 
Directive No. 1, provides the only basis for classifying information. It 
is the policy of this office to make available to the public as much 
information concerning its activities as possible consistent with the 
need to protect the national security. Accordingly, security 
classification shall be applied only to protect the national security.
    (b) Duration of classification. Classification shall not be 
continued longer than necessary for the protection of national security. 
Each decision to classify requires a simultaneous determination of the 
duration such classification must remain in effect. For further 
guidance, refer to sections 1-401 and 1-402, E.O. 12065.
    (c) Declassification. Declassification of information shall be given 
emphasis comparable to that accorded to classification. Decisions 
concerning declassification shall be based on the loss of the 
information's sensitivity with the passage of time or upon the 
occurrence of a declassification event. For further guidance, refer to 
sections 3-102, 3-103 and 3-104 of E.O. 12065.
    (d) Systematic review for declassification. Systematic review for 
declassification will be in accordance with sections 3-204, 3-401 and 3-
503 of E.O. 12065.
    (e) Mandatory review requests. Requests from a member of the public, 
a government employee, or an agency, to declassify and release 
information will be acted upon within 60 days provided the request 
reasonably identifies the information. After review, the information or 
any reasonably segregable portion thereof that no longer requires 
protection, shall be declassified and released, except as provided in 
section 3-503, E.O. 12065, unless withholding is otherwise warranted 
under applicable law.
    (f) Classification guides. The Chief Counsel, National Security 
Council, has determined that, in view of the limited amount of material 
originally classified by this office, the preparation and publication of 
classification guides is not required.
    (g) Access to Classified Information by historical researchers and 
former Presidential appointees. Access may be granted under the 
provisions of section 4-3 of E.O. 12065; however, access is permissive 
and not mandatory.


<R05>
Sec. 2800.6  Delegation of classification and declassification authority.

Sec.
2900.1  General.
2900.2  Requests for records.
2900.3  Schedule of fees and methods of payment.

    Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552.

    Source: 57 FR 49394, Nov. 2, 1992, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 2900.1  General.

    This part implements the Freedom of Information Act, section 552 of 
title 5, United States Code, and prescribes rules governing the 
availability to the public of documents and records of the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 2900.2  Requests for records.

    (a) It is the policy of the Commission to make records and documents 
in its possession available to the public to the greatest extent 
possible. All records of the Commission are available for public 
inspection and copying in accordance with this section except those 
records or portions of records which the Executive Secretary or her 
designee specifically determines to be exempt from disclosure under 
section 552(b) of the Freedom of Information Act.
    (b) A request for records shall be made in writing and directed to 
the Executive Secretary, Presidential Commission on the Assignment of 
Women in the Armed Forces, 1001 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., suite 275N, 
Washington, DC 20004. Such request, as well as the envelope containing 
the request, shall be clearly marked ``Freedom of Information Act 
Request'' and shall reasonably describe the record requested. Requests 
lacking a reasonable description will be filled only after a more 
comprehensive description is provided. The staff of the Commission will 
make reasonable efforts to assist a requester in formulating this 
request. Nothing in this section shall preclude staff of the Commission 
from complying with oral, unmarked, or generally stated requests for 
information and documents.
    (c)(1) The Executive Secretary or her designee shall, within ten 
days after its receipt (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal federal 
holidays), either comply with or deny a request for records, provided 
that when additional time is required because of:
    (i) A need to search for, collect and examine a voluminous amount of 
separate and distinct records demanded in a single request; or
    (ii) A need for consultation with another agency having a 
substantial interest in the determination of the request.
    (2) The time limit for disposing of the request may be extended for 
up to ten additional working days by written notice to the requester 
setting forth the reasons for and the anticipated length of the delay.
    (d) The requester will be notified promptly of the determination 
made pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. If the determination is 
to release the requested record, such record shall promptly be made 
available. If the determination is not to release the record, the person 
making the request shall, at the same time he is notified of such 
determination, be notified of:
    (1) The reason for the determination;
    (2) The name and title or position of each person responsible for 
the denial of his request; and
    (3) The right to appeal the determination to the Chairman of the 
Commission within 30 days of receipt of a notice denying the request. An 
appeal shall be made in writing to the General Counsel, Presidential 
Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, 1001 
Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., suite 275N, Washington, DC 20004. Both the 
envelope and the letter of appeal must be clearly marked ``Freedom of 
Information Act Appeal.'' Unless the Chairman of the Commission 
otherwise directs, the General Counsel shall act on behalf of the 
Chairman of the Commission on all appeals. In no case, however, shall 
the individual who made the initial denial of the request render a 
decision on an appeal. A decision shall be rendered on an appeal within 
20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal federal holidays) after 
the receipt of such appeal. The requester shall be notified promptly of 
the decision and, if the appeal is

[[Page 541]]

denied, the reasons therefor and the requester's right to seek judicial 
review of such determination pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom 
of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4).


<R05>
Sec. 2900.3  Schedule of fees and methods of payment.

    (a) Definitions. The following definitions apply in this section.
    (1) Direct costs means those expenditures which the Commission 
actually incurs in searching for, duplicating, and (in the case of 
commercial use requests) reviewing documents to respond to a FOIA 
request.
    (2) Search means all time spent looking for material that is 
responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line 
identification of material within documents. Line-by-line search will 
not be done when duplicating an entire document is a less expensive and 
quicker method of complying with a request. ``Search'' is distinguished 
from ``review'' (see paragraph (a)(4) of this section).
    (3) Duplication means the process of making a copy of a document 
available to a requester. Copies can take the form of paper copy or 
audio-visual materials among others; however, copies will be provided in 
a form that is reasonably usable by requesters.
    (4) Review means the process of examining documents located in 
response to an information request to determine whether any portion of 
any document is permitted to be withheld under FOIA. It also includes 
processing any documents for disclosure, e.g., doing all that is 
necessary to excise them and otherwise prepare them for release. Review 
does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues 
regarding the application of exemptions.
    (5) Commercial use request refers to a request from or made on 
behalf of one who seeks information to further the commercial, trade, or 
profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the 
request is made. This would include a request made for information to 
further such interests through litigation. In determining whether a 
requester properly belongs in this category, the Commission may request 
information concerning the use to which a requester will put the 
requested documents.
    (6) Educational institution means a preschool, a public or private 
elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate or 
graduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and 
an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or 
programs of scholarly research.
    (7) Non-commercial scientific institution means an institution that 
is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis (as that term is defined in 
paragraph (a)(5) of this section) and which is operated solely for the 
purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not 
intended to promote any particular product or industry.
    (8) Representative of the news media means any person actively 
gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish 
or broadcast news to the public. The term ``news'' means information 
that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the 
public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio 
stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of 
periodicals (but only in those instances where they qualify as 
disseminators of ``news'') who make their products available for 
purchase or subscription by the general public. ``Freelance'' 
journalists may be regarded as working for a news organization if they 
can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that 
organization, even though not actually employed by it. A publication 
contract would be the clearest proof, but the Commission may also look 
to the past publication record of a requester in making this 
determination.
    (b) Cost to be included in fees. The agency costs included in fees 
will vary according to the following categories of requests:
    (1) Commercial use requests. Fees will include the Commission's full 
direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating 
the requested records.

[[Page 542]]

    (2) Educational and non-commercial scientific institution requests. 
The Commission will provide documents to requesters in this category for 
the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first two 
hours of search time and the first 100 pages (see paragraph (e) of this 
section). To be eligible for inclusion in this category, requesters must 
show that the request is being made under the auspices of a qualifying 
institution and that the records are sought in furtherance of scholarly 
(if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if 
the request is from a non-commercial scientific institution) research.
    (3) Requests from representatives of the news media. The Commission 
will provide documents to requesters in this category for the cost of 
reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first two hours of search 
time and the first 100 pages (see paragraph (e) of this section). To be 
eligible for inclusion in this category a requester must meet the 
criteria in paragraph (a)(8) of this section.
    (4) All other requests. The Commission will charge requesters who do 
not fit into any of the categories in paragraphs (b) (1) through (3) of 
this section fees which cover the full direct costs of searching for and 
reproducing records that are responsive to the request, except for the 
first two hours of search time and the first 100 pages (see paragraph 
(e) of this section). However, requests from persons for records about 
themselves will be treated under the fee provision of the Privacy Act of 
1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a.
    (c) Fee calculation. The Commission will calculate fees as follows:
    (1) Search. $16.50 per hour.
    (2) Review (commercial-use requests only). $16.50 per hour. Only the 
review necessary at the initial administrative level to determine the 
applicability of any exemption, and not review at the administrative 
appeal level, will be included in the fee. The Commission may charge for 
each review conducted to determine the applicability of different 
exemptions.
    (3) Duplication. At 20 cents per page for paper copy. For copies of 
records prepared by computer, requester will be charged reasonable 
direct costs of making a copy, including operator time. A request for 
records prepared by computer must be accompanied by either 3.5'' 
diskette with 1.44 MB capacity or a 5.25'' diskette with 1.2 MB 
capacity. Computer printouts will be charged at 20 cents per page.
    (4) Additional services. Postage and other additional services 
requested above and beyond normal FOIA processing, such as express mail 
or courier delivery, will be charged at actual cost.
    (d) Assessment of interest. The Commission may begin assessing 
interest charges on the 31st day following the day the fee bill is sent. 
Interest will be at the rate prescribed in section 31 U.S.C. 3717.
    (e) Free search and duplication. Except for commercial use requests, 
the Commission (in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(iv)) will 
provide the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of 
search time to requesters without charge. In addition, the Commission 
will not impose a charge if the cost of collecting a fee will be equal 
to or greater than the fee itself. These provisions work together so 
that the Commission will not begin to assess fees until after providing 
the free search and reproduction.
    (f) Waiver or reduction of fees. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 
552(a)(4)(A)(iii), the Commission will furnish documents without charge, 
or at a reduced charge, where disclosure of the information is in the 
public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to 
public understanding of the operations or activities of the government 
and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
    (g) Remittances. (1) Remittances shall be in the form of either a 
bank draft drawn on a bank in the United States, a money order, or cash.
    (2) Remittances shall be made payable to the order of the U.S. 
Treasury and mailed or delivered to the Executive Secretary, 
Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, 
1001 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., suite 275N, Washington, DC 20004. The 
Commission will assume no responsibility for cash which is lost in the 
mail.
    (3) A receipt for fees paid will be given only upon request.

[[Page 543]]

    (4) Where it is anticipated that the fees chargeable under this 
section amount to more than $250.00, and the requester has not indicated 
in advance a willingness to pay fees as high as are anticipated, the 
requester will be notified of the amount of the anticipated fee. If the 
requester does not agree to pay the estimated fees, the Commission may 
suspend the search and processing of records or, when appropriate (see 
paragraph (h) of this section), require an advance deposit. Requesters 
may confer with Commission personnel in an attempt to formulate the 
request so as to meet their needs at lower cost.
    (h) Advance payment fees. The Commission will not require a 
requester to make an advance payment, i.e., payment before work is 
commenced or continued on a request, except in the following situations:
    (1) When the allowable charges that a requester will be required to 
pay are projected to exceed $250.00, the Commission may require the 
requester to make an advance payment of the entire fee, or a portion of 
the fee, before continuing to process the request.
    (2) If a requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in a 
timely fashion (i.e., within 30 days of the billing date), the 
Commission will require the requester to pay the full amount owed plus 
any applicable interest, and to make an advance payment of the full 
amount of the estimated fee before it begins to process a new request or 
a pending request from the requester.
    (i) Other provisions--(1) Charges for unsuccessful search. The 
Commission may assess charges for time spent searching for requested 
records, even if the search fails to locate responsive records or the 
records are determined, after review, to be exempt from disclosure.
    (2) Aggregating requests to avoid fees. When the Commission 
reasonably determines that a requester is attempting to break a single 
request down into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the 
assessment fees, the Commission aggregate any such requests and charge 
the applicable fee. However, the Commission will not aggregate multiple 
requests on unrelated subjects from one requester.
