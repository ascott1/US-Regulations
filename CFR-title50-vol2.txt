                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 1996), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.

[[Page vii]]

    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Sec. 216.24  Taking and related acts incidental to commercial fishing operations.

    Note to Sec. 216.24: The provisions of 50 CFR part 229, rather than 
Sec. 216.24, will govern the incidental taking of marine mammals in the 
course of commercial fishing operations by persons using vessels of the 
United States, other than vessels used in the eastern tropical Pacific 
yellowfin tuna purse seine fishery, and vessels which have valid fishing 
permits issued in accordance with section 204(b) of the Magnuson Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1824(b)). Other commercial 
fisheries remain subject to regulations under Sec. 216.24.

    (a)(1) No marine mammals may be taken in the course of a commercial 
fishing operation unless: The taking constitutes an incidental catch as 
defined in Sec. 216.3, a general permit and certificate(s) of inclusion 
have been obtained in accordance with these regulations and such taking 
is not in violation of such permit, certificate(s), and regulations.
    (2)(i) It is unlawful for any person using a Class I (400 short tons 
(362.8 metric tons) carrying capacity or less) or Class II (greater than 
400 short tons (362.8 metric tons) carrying capacity, built before 1961) 
U.S. purse seine fishing vessel on a fishing involving the utilization 
of purse seines to capture yellowfin tuna, that is not operating under a 
Category 2 general permit and certificate(s) of inclusion, to carry more 
than two speedboats if any part of its fishing trip is in the Pacific 
Ocean area described in the General Permit for gear Category 2 
operations.
    (ii) It is unlawful for any person using a Class III (greater than 
400 short tons (362.8 metric tons) carrying capacity, built after 1960) 
U.S. purse seine fishing vessel that does not have and operate under a 
valid operator and vessel certificate of inclusion, to catch, possess, 
or land tuna from a fishing trip that includes the Pacific Ocean area 
described in the General Permit for gear Category 2 operations.
    (iii) It is unlawful for any person subject to the jurisdiction of 
the United States to receive, purchase, or possess tuna caught, 
possessed, or landed in violation of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this 
section.
    (iv) It is unlawful for a person subject to the jurisdiction of the 
United States intentionally to deploy a purse seine net on, or to 
encircle, dolphins from a vessel operating in the ETP when the DML 
assigned to that vessel has been reached, or when there is not a DML 
assigned to that vessel.
    (3) Upon written request in advance of entering the General Permit 
area, the limitation in (a)(2) may be waived by the Director, Southwest 
Region for the purpose of allowing transit through the General Permit 
area. The waiver will provide in writing the terms and conditions under 
which the vessel must operate, including a requirement to report by 
radio to the Director, Southwest Region the vessel's date of exit from 
or subsequent entry to the permit area, in order to transit the area 
with more than two speedboats.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Certificates of inclusion--(1) Vessel certificates of inclusion. 
The owner or managing owner of a vessel that participates in commercial 
fishing operations under the ATA permit must hold a valid vessel 
certificate of inclusion. Such certificates are not transferable and 
must be renewed annually. If a vessel certificate holder surrenders his/
her certificate to the Director, Southwest Region, the certificate shall 
not be returned nor shall a new certificate be issued before the end of 
the calendar year. This provision does not apply when a change of vessel 
ownership occurs.
    (2) Operator's certificate of inclusion. The person in charge of and 
actually controlling fishing operations (hereinafter referred to as the 
operator) on a vessel engaged in commercial fishing operations under the 
ATA permit, must hold a valid operator's certificate of inclusion. Such 
certificates are not transferable, and must be renewed annually. In 
order to receive a certification of inclusion, the operator must

[[Page 19]]

have satisfactorily completed all required training.
    (3) A vessel certificate issued pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section must be on board the vessel while it is engaged in fishing 
operations and the operator's certificate issued pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section must be in the possession of the operator to whom 
it was issued. Certificates must be shown upon request to an enforcement 
agent or other National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) designated 
agent. Vessels and operators at sea on a fishing trip on the expiration 
date of their certificate of inclusion, to whom or to which a 
certificate of inclusion for the next year has been issued, may take 
marine mammals under the terms of the new certificate. A vessel owner or 
operator is obligated to obtain or place the new certificate on board, 
as appropriate, when the vessel next returns to port.
    (4) Applications. Owners or managing owners of purse seine vessels 
should make application for vessel certificates of inclusion to the 
Director, Southwest Region. Applications for vessel certificates of 
inclusion must contain:
    (i) The name of the vessel that is to appear on the certificate(s)

managing owner, address, and if applicable, the organization acting on 
behalf of the vessel.
    (5) Fees. (i) Applications for certificates of inclusion under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section must include a fee of $200.00 for each 
vessel named in the application, unless the applicant's income is below 
Federal poverty guidelines and the applicant shows in the application 
that his/her income is below such guidelines, in which case a fee of 
$20.00 must be included.
    (ii) The Assistant Administrator may change the amount of the fee 
required at any time a different fee is determined to be reasonable, and 
notification of such change shall be published in the Federal Register.
    (6) The Director, Southwest Region shall determine the adequacy and 
completeness of applications, and upon said determination that such 
applications are adequate and complete, shall approve such applications 
and issue the certificate(s).
    (7) Failure to comply with provisions of the ATA permit, 
certificates of inclusion, or these regulations may lead to suspension, 
revocation, modification, or denial of a certificate of inclusion. It 
may also subject the certificate holder, vessel, vessel owner, operator, 
or master to the penalties provided under the MMPA. Procedures governing 
permit sanctions and denials are found at subpart D of 15 CFR part 904.
    (8) By using an operator or vessel certificate of inclusion under 
the ATA permit, the certificate holder authorizes the release to NMFS of 
all data collected by observers aboard purse seine vessels during 
fishing trips under the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission observer 
program or any other international observer program in which the United 
States may participate. The certificate holder must furnish the 
international observer program all release forms required to provide the 
observer data to NMFS. Data obtained under such releases will be used 
for the same purposes as data collected directly by observers placed by 
the NMFS and will be subject to the same standards of confidentiality.
    (d) Terms and conditions of certificates under general permits shall 
include, but are not limited to the following:
    (1) [Reserved]
    (2) Encircling gear, purse seining involving the intentional taking 
of marine mammals--(i) Quotas:
    (A) A certificated vessel may take marine mammals only if the taking 
is an incidental occurrence in the course of normal commercial tuna 
purse seine fishing operations, and the fishing operations are under the 
immediate direction of a person who is the holder of

[[Page 20]]

a valid operator's certificate of inclusion, subject to the following 
conditions:
    (1)-(2) [Reserved]
    (3) No purse seine net may be deployed on or used to encircle any 
school of dolphins in which any eastern spinner dolphin (Stenella 
longirostris), coastal spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata), or, in the 
area from 40 deg. N. lat. to 5 deg. N. lat. and from 120 deg. W. long. 
to the coastline of Central and South America, any offshore spotted 
dolphin (Stenella attenuata), are observed in the school prior to the 
release of the net skiff.
    (B) The incidental mortality of marine mammals permitted under the 
general permit for each category will be monitored according to the 
methodology published in the Federal Register. The Assistant 
Administrator shall determine on the basis of the evidence available to 
him the date upon which the allowable quotas will be reached or 
exceeded. Notice of the Assistant Administrator's determination shall be 
published in the Federal Register not less than seven days prior to the 
effective date.
    (C) Except for the coastal spotted dolphin stock and the eastern 
spinner dolphin stock, if at the time the net skiff attached to the net 
is released from the vessel at the start of a set, and species or stocks 
that are prohibited from being taken are not reasonably observable, the 
fact that individuals of that species or stock are subsequently taken 
will not be cause for issuance of a notice of violation provided that 
all procedures required by the applicable regulations have been 
followed.
    (D) The general permit is valid until surrendered by the permit 
holder or suspended or terminated by the Assistant Administrator 
provided the permittee and certificate holders under this part continue 
to use the best marine mammal safety techniques and equipment that are 
economically and technologically practicable. The Assistant 
Administrator may, upon receipt of new information which in his opinion 
is sufficient to require modification of the general permit or 
regulations, propose to modify such after consultation with the Marine 
Mammal Commission. These modifications must be consistent with and 
necessary to carry out the purposes of the MMPA. Any modifications 
proposed by the Assistant Administrator involving changes in the quotas 
will include the statements required by section 103(d) of the MMPA. 
Modifications will be proposed in the Federal Register and a public 
comment period will be allowed. At the request of any interested person 
within 15 days after publication of the proposed modification in the 
Federal Register, the Assistant Administrator may hold a public hearing 
to receive and evaluate evidence in those circumstances where he has 
determined it to be consistent with and necessary to carry out the 
purposes of the MMPA. Such request may be for a formal hearing on the 
record before an Administrative Law Judge. Within 10 days after receipt 
of the request for a public hearing, the Assistant Administrator will 
provide the requesting party or parties with his decision. If a request 
is denied, the Assistant Administrator will state the reasons for the 
denial. Within 10 days after receipt of a decision denying a request for 
a formal hearing, the requesting person may file a written notice of 
appeal with the Administrator. Based upon the evidence presented in the 
notice, the Administrator will render a decision within 20 days from 
receipt of the notice.
    (ii) General conditions: (A) Marine mammals incidentally taken must 
be immediately returned to the environment where captured without 
further injury. The operators of purse seine vessels must take every 
precaution to refrain from causing or permitting incidental mortality or 
serious injury of marine mammals. Live marine mammals must not be 
brailed or hoisted onto the deck during ortza retrieval.
    (B) Operators may take such steps as are necessary to protect their 
gear or person from damage or threat of personal injury. However, all 
marine mammals taken in the course of commercial fishing operations 
shall be subject to the definition of ``incidental catch'' in Sec. 216.3 
of this part and may not be retained except where a specific permit has 
been obtained authorizing the retention.

[[Page 21]]

    (C) The vessel certificate holder shall notify the Director, 
Southwest Region of any change of vessel operator within at least 48 
hours prior to departing on the next scheduled trip.
    (iii) Reporting requirements: In accordance with Sec. 216.24(f) of 
these regulations, the following specific reporting procedures shall be 
required:
    (A) The vessel certificate holder of each certificated vessel, who 
has been notified via certified letter from NMFS that his/her vessel is 
required to carry an observer, shall notify the Director, Southwest 
Region at least 5 days in advance of the vessel's departure on a fishing 
voyage to allow for observer placement. After a fishing voyage is 
initiated, the vessel is obligated to carry an observer until the vessel 
returns to port and one of the following conditions is met:
    (1) Unloads more than 400 tons of any species of tuna; or
    (2) Unloads any amount of any species of tuna equivalent to one half 
of the vessel's carrying capacity; or
    (3) Unloads its tuna catch after 40 days or more at sea from the 
date of departure.

Further, the Director, Southwest Region, may consider special 
circumstances for exemptions to this definition, provided written 
requests clearly describing the circumstances are received prior to the 
termination or the initiation of a fishing voyage. A response to the 
written request will be made by the Director, Southwest Region within 
five (5) days after receipt of the request. A vessel whose vessel 
certificate holder has failed to comply with the provisions of this 
section may not engage in fishing operations for which a general permit 
is required.
    (B) [Reserved]
    (C) The Director, Southwest Region, will provide to the public, 
periodic quota status reports summarizing the estimated incidental 
porpoise mortality by U.S. vessels of individual species and stock.
    (iv) A vessel having a vessel certificate issued under paragraph 
(c)(1) may not engage in fishing operations for which a general permit 
is required unless it is equipped with a porpoise safety panel in its 
purse seine, and has and uses the other required gear, equipment, and 
procedures.
    (A) Class I and II Vessels: For Class I purse seiners (400 short 
tons carrying capacity or less) and for Class II purse seiners (greater 
than 400 short tons carrying capacity, built before 1961), the porpoise 
safety panel must be a minimum of 100 fathoms in length (as measured 
before installation), except that the minimum length of the panel in 
nets deeper than 10 strips must be determined at a ratio of 10 fathoms 
in length for each strip that the net is deep. It must be installed so 
as to protect the perimeter of the backdown area. The perimeter of the 
backdown area is the length of the corkline which begins at the outboard 
end of the last bow bunch pulled and continues to at least two-thirds 
the distance from the backdown channel apex to the stern tiedown point. 
The porpoise safety panel must consist of small mesh webbing not to 
exceed 1\1/4\" stretch mesh, extending from the corkline downward to a 
minimum depth equivalent to one strip of 100 meshes of 4\1/4\" stretch 
mesh webbing. In addition, at least a 20-fathom length of corkline must 
be free from bunchlines at the apex of the backdown channel.
    (B) Class III Vessels: For Class III purse seiners (greater than 400 
short tons carrying capacity, built after 1960), the porpoise safety 
panel must be a minimum of 180 fathoms in length (as measured before 
installation), except that the minimum length of the panel in nets 
deeper than 18 strips must be determined in a ratio of 10 fathoms in 
length for each strip of net depth. It must be installed so as to 
protect the perimeter of the backdown area. The perimeter of the 
backdown area is the length of corkline which begins at the outboard end 
of the last bowbunch pulled and continues to at least two-thirds the 
distance from the backdown channel apex to the stern tiedown point. The 
porpoise safety panel must consist of small mesh webbing not to exceed 
1\1/4\" stretch mesh extending downward from the corkline and, if 
present, the base of the porpoise apron to a minimum depth equivalent to 
two strips of 100 meshes of 4\1/4\" stretch mesh webbing. In addition, 
at least a 20-fathom length of corkline must be

[[Page 22]]

free from bunchlines at the apex of the backdown channel.
    (C) Porpoise safety panel markers: Each end of the porpoise safety 
panel and porpoise apron shall be identified with an easily 
distinguishable marker.
    (D) Porpoise safety panel hand holds: Throughout the length of the 
corkline under which the porpoise safety panel and porpoise apron are 
located, hand hold openings are to be secured so that the insertion of a 
1\3/8\'' diameter cylindrical-shaped object meets resistance.
    (E) Porpoise safety panel corkline hangings: Throughout the length 
of the corkline under which the porpoise safety panel and porpoise apron 
are located, corkline hangings shall be inspected by the vessel operator 
following each trip. Hangings found to have loosened to the extent that 
a cylindrical object with a 1\3/8\'' diameter will not meet resistance 
when inserted between the cork and corkline hangings, must be tightened 
so that a cylindrical object with a 1\3/8\'' diameter cannot be 
inserted.
    (F) Speedboats: Certificated vessels engaged in fishing operations 
involving setting on marine mammals shall carry a minimum of two 
speedboats in operating condition. All speedboats carried aboard purse 
seine vessels and in operating condition shall be rigged with towing 
bridles and towlines. Speedboat hoisting bridles shall not be 
substituted for towing bridles.
    (G) Raft: A raft suitable to be used as a porpoise observation-and-
rescue platform shall be carried on all certificated vessels.
    (H) Facemask and snorkel, or viewbox: At least two facemasks and 
snorkels, or viewboxes, must be carried on all certificated vessels.
    (I) Lights: All certificated vessels shall be equipped by July 1, 
1986, with lights capable of producing a minimum of 140,000 lumens of 
output for use in darkness to ensure sufficient light to observe that 
procedures for porpoise release are carried out and to monitor 
incidental porpoise mortality.
    (v) Vessel inspection: (A) Annual: At least once during each 
calendar year, purse seine nets and other gear and equipment required by 
these regulations shall be made available for inspection by an 
authorized National Marine Fisheries Service Inspector as specified by 
the Director, Southwest Region.
    (B) Reinspection: Purse seine nets and other gear and equipment 
required by these regulations shall be made available for reinspection 
by an authorized National Marine Fisheries Service Inspector as 
specified by the Director, Southwest Region. The vessel certificate 
holder shall notify the Director, Southwest Region of any net 
modification at least 5 days prior to departure of the vessel in order 
to determine whether a reinspection or trial set is required.
    (C) Upon failure to pass an inspection or reinspection, a vessel 
having a vessel certificate of inclusion issued under paragraph (c)(1) 
may not engage in fishing operations for which a general permit is 
required until the deficiencies in gear or equipment are corrected as 
required by an authorized National Marine Fisheries Service inspector.
    (vi) Operator training requirements. All operators shall maintain 
proficiency sufficient to perform the procedures required herein, and 
must attend and satisfactorily complete a formal training session 
conducted under the auspices of the National Marine Fisheries Service in 
order to obtain their certificate of inclusion. At the training session 
an attendee shall be instructed concerning the provisions of the Marine 
Mammal Protection Act of 1972, the regulations promulgated pursuant to 
the MMPA, and the fishing gear and techniques which are required or will 
contribute to reducing serious injury and mortality of porpoise 
incidental to purse seining for tuna. Operators who have received a 
written certificate of satisfactory completion of training and who 
possess a current or previous calendar year certificate of inclusion 
will not be required to attend additional formal training sessions 
unless there are substantial changes in the MMPA, the regulations, or 
the required fishing gear and techniques. Additional training may be 
required for any operator who is found by the Director, Southwest 
Region, to lack proficiency in the procedures required.

[[Page 23]]

    (vii) Marine mammal release requirements: All operators shall use 
the following procedures during all sets involving the incidental taking 
of marine mammals in association with the capture and landing of tuna.
    (A) Backdown procedure: Backdown shall be performed following a 
purse seine set in which marine mammals are captured in the course of 
catching and landing tuna, and shall be continued until it is no longer 
possible to remove live marine mammals from the net by this procedure. 
Thereafter, other release procedures required shall be continued until 
all live animals have been released from the net.
    (B) Prohibited use of sharp or pointed instrument: The use of a 
sharp or pointed instrument to remove any marine mammal from the net is 
prohibited.
    (C) Sundown sets prohibited. On every set encircling porpoise, the 
backdown procedure must be completed and rolling of the net to sack-up 
must be begun before one-half hour after sundown, except as provided 
below. For the purpose of this section, sundown is defined as the time 
at which the upper edge of the sun disappears below the horizon or, if 
view of the sun is obscured, the local time of sunset calculated from 
tables developed by the U.S. Naval Observatory. A sundown set is a set 
in which the backdown procedure has not been completed and rolling the 
net to sack-up has not begun within one-half hour after sundown. Should 
a set extend beyond one-half hour after sundown, the operator must use 
the required marine mammal release procedures including the use of the 
high intensity lighting system.
    (1) A certificated operator may obtain an initial waiver from this 
prohibition, for trips with an observer, by establishing to the 
satisfaction of the Director, Southwest Region, NMFS, based upon NMFS 
and Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) observer records, 
that the operator's average kill of marine mammals per set in sundown 
sets involving marine mammals was 3.01 marine mammals or fewer.
    (i) The application must include the following:
    (A) Name of the operator as it appears on the certificate of 
inclusion;
    (B) The dates of all observed trips any part of which occurred since 
July 1, 1986 and observed trips before that date, if necessary to 
include a minimum of three observed sundown sets;
    (C) Names of the vessels operated during those trips;
    (D) The number of marine mammals killed in sundown sets and the 
number of sundown sets involving marine mammals;
    (E) Detailed description of the circumstances that support any 
request that the mortality associated with a particular sundown set be 
excluded from consideration; and
    (F) The operator's signature or the signature of an individual 
authorized by the operator to make the application in the operator's 
absence.
    (ii) All sundown sets since July 1, 1986 will be considered for this 
determination, except that the Director, Southwest Region will exclude 
one sundown set from each twelve month period from the calculations of 
average kill if the operator establishes to the satisfaction of the 
Director, Southwest Region that the kill in that sundown set was due to 
an unforeseeable equipment malfunction that could not have been avoided 
by reasonable diligence in operating or maintaining the vessel.
    (iii) An operator must have a minimum of five observed sundown sets 
for the Director, Southwest Region to consider in determining whether or 
not the operator qualifies for an exemption. If an operator does not 
have five observed sundown sets since July 1, 1986, the Director, 
Southwest Region will consider records from observed trips before that 
date, starting with the most recent observed trip during which a sundown 
set was made and reviewing as many trips as necessary to obtain at least 
five sundown sets for consideration.
    (2) An operator fishing under an exemption from the sundown set 
prohibition must follow the marine mammal release requirements, 
including the use of high intensity lights for sets that continue one-
half hour past sundown.
    (3) An operator exemption is valid for one calendar year only on 
trips carrying a NMFS or IATTC observer and expires on December 31, 
unless renewed by the Director, Southwest Region.

[[Page 24]]

    (4) An exemption will be reviewed annually between November 1 and 
December 15 and the exemption will not be renewed if the operator's 
average mortality in sundown sets during trips completed in the previous 
twelve month period ending November 1 exceeds the United States fleet's 
average mortality rate in daylight sets for all of the observed trips 
completed in the same period.
    (5) An operator who is notified that his or her exemption will not 
be renewed, or who anticipates not getting renewed, may petition the 
Director, Southwest Region in writing to reinstate the exemption based 
on excluding from the calculations one set where an unforeseeable 
equipment malfunction caused mortality in a sundown set that could not 
have been avoided by reasonable diligence in operating or maintaining 
the vessel. The Director, Southwest Region will reinstate the exemption 
if the evidence supports excluding the set and if the resulting 
recalculation of the operator's performance meets the standard required 
by these regulations.
    (D) Porpoise Safety Panel: During backdown, the porpoise safety 
panel must be positioned so that it protects the perimeter of the 
backdown area. The perimeter of the backdown area is the length of 
corkline which begins at the outboard end of the last bow bunch pulled 
and continues to at least two-thirds the distance from the backdown 
channel apex to the stern tiedown point. Any super apron must be 
positioned at the apex of the backdown channel.
    (E) Use of explosive devices: The use of explosive devices is 
prohibited in all tuna purse seine operations that involve marine 
mammals.
    (viii) Experimental fishing operations: The Assistant Administrator 
may authorize experimental fishing operations and may waive, as 
appropriate, any requirements within Sec. 216.24(d)(2), except quotas on 
the incidental kill of marine mammals and the prohibition on setting 
nets on pure schools of certain porpoise species.
    (A) A vessel certificate holder may apply for an experimental 
fishing operation waiver by submitting the following information to the 
Assistant Administrator no less than 90 days before the intended date 
the proposed operation is intended to begin:
    (1) Name(s) of the vessel(s) and the vessel certificate holder(s) to 
participate;
    (2) A statement of the specific vessel gear and equipment or 
procedural requirement to be exempted and why such an exemption is 
necessary to conduct the experiment;
    (3) A description of how the proposed modification to the gear or 
procedures is expected to reduce incidental mortalities or serious 
injury of marine mammals;
    (4) A description of the applicability of this modification to other 
purse seine vessels;
    (5) Planned design, time, duration, and general area of the 
experimental operation;
    (6) Name(s) of the certificated operator(s) of the vessel(s) during 
the experiment;
    (7) A statement of the qualifications of the individual or company 
doing the analysis of the research.
    (B) The Assistant Administrator will acknowledge receipt of the 
application and, upon determining that it is complete, publish notice in 
the Federal Register summarizing the application, making the full 
application available for inspection and inviting comments for a minimum 
period of thirty days from the date of publication.
    (C) The Assistant Administrator, after considering the information 
identified in paragraph (d)(2)(viii)(A) of this section and the comments 
received, will deny the application giving the reasons for denial or 
issue a permit to conduct the experiment including restrictions and 
conditions as deemed appropriate.
    (D) The permit for an experimental fishing operation will be valid 
only for the vessels and operators named in the permit, for the time 
period and areas specified, for trips carrying an observer assigned by 
the NMFS, and when all the terms and conditions of the permit are met.
    (E) The Assistant Administrator may suspend or revoke an 
experimental fishing permit by written notice to the permit holder if 
the terms and conditions of the permit or the provisions of

[[Page 25]]

the regulations are not followed, after providing an opportunity for the 
permit holder to discuss the proposed suspension or revocation.
    (ix) Operator Certificate of Inclusion Holder Performance 
Requirements. (A) The certificate of inclusion of any operator who makes 
one or more purse seine sets on marine mammals resulting in an average 
kill-per-set for a fishing trip which exceeds 26.30 marine mammals is 
suspended. Such suspension shall be effective upon notification from the 
Director, Southwest Region and shall be for a period of one year. If the 
operator exceeds the 26.30 marine mammals killed per set average for a 
subsequent trip within three years of reinstatement, the certificate is 
suspended. Such suspension shall be effective upon notification by the 
Director, Southwest Region and shall be for a period of one year. If the 
operator's average mortality rate exceeds 26.30 marine mammals kill-per-
set on a subsequent trip within five years of the second reinstatement, 
the certificate is revoked. The revocation shall be effective upon 
notification by the Director, Southwest Region and shall be permanent. 
An operator who is subject to a suspension or revocation under this 
paragraph may petition the Director, Southwest Region to review the 
operator's marine mammal mortality history. The Director, Southwest 
Region may reinstate the operator's certificate if the operator 
demonstrates that the operator has not exceeded a kill-per-set of 3.89 
marine mammals during any of the eight consecutive observed trips 
immediately preceding the trip which caused the suspension. However, 
that trip will be considered as a single trip exceeding a kill-per-set 
of 3.89 marine mammals and subject to the conditions described in 
paragraph (d)(2)(ix)(F) of this section. The Director, Southwest Region 
may exclude from the mortality calculation for a trip, those purse seine 
sets in which marine mammal mortality resulted from an unavoidable and 
unforeseeable equipment breakdown. The mortality rate calculated after 
exclusion of a set or sets under this paragraph will determine the 
action taken under this performance evaluation system.
    (B) Fishing trips with five or fewer sets on marine mammals and an 
average kill-per-set less than or equal to 26.30 marine mammals are not 
subject to further action under the operator performance system. Such 
trips neither count as trips meeting the performance standard nor count 
as trips failing to meet the performance standard for the purpose of 
determining actions based on performance in consecutive fishing trips.
    (C) Fishing trips with more than five sets on marine mammals 
resulting in an average kill-per-set of not greater than 26.30 marine 
mammals are subject to review under the operator performance system as 
follows:
    (1) The operator's kill of marine mammals in purse seine sets on 
marine mammals will be determined from observer records.
    (2) The kill-per-set will be determined by dividing the total kill 
of marine mammals by the number of sets involving marine mammals during 
the fishing trip.
    (3) If the calculated kill-per-set for the trip is equal to or less 
than 3.89 marine mammals, the operator has met the performance standard 
and is not subject to further action under the performance system based 
on the current trip.
    (4) If the calculated kill-per-set for the trip exceeds 3.89 marine 
mammals, the operator failed to meet the mortality performance standard 
and is subject to further action under the performance system.
    (D) The Director, Southwest Region may exclude from the mortality 
calculation for a trip, those purse seine sets in which marine mammal 
mortality resulted from an unavoidable and unforeseeable equipment 
breakdown. Should exclusion of a set or sets cause the operator's 
performance to fall within the standard performance, that trip will not 
be counted as a trip for the purposes of the performance evaluation 
system.
    (E) An operator shall not serve as a certificated operator until the 
Director, Southwest Region has determined under this subpart and 
notified the operator that the operator's marine mammal mortality rate 
performance met or failed to meet the applicable

[[Page 26]]

performance standard on the previous observed trip. The Director, 
Southwest Region will make the determination within five days (excluding 
Saturdays, Sundays and Federal holidays) after receiving the observer 
data from the trip.
    (F) An operator whose average marine mammal mortality rate exceeds 
3.89 kill-per-set for a trip must have observer data and other pertinent 
records reviewed by the Director, Southwest Region and the Porpoise 
Rescue Foundation for the purpose of determining the causes of higher 
than acceptable mortality, must participate in supplemental marine 
mammal safety training as ordered by the Director, Southwest Region and 
must comply with actions for reducing marine mammal mortality which may 
be ordered by the Director, Southwest Region. The operator must carry an 
observer on the next trip for which he serves as the certificated 
operator. If the Director, Southwest Region determines that the required 
training or other ordered action has not been completed satisfactorily 
or is refused, the Director, Southwest Region will suspend the 
operator's certificate of inclusion for one year.
    (G) An operator whose average marine mammal mortality rate exceeds 
3.89 marine mammals killed per set on two consecutive trips or on three 
trips ending within a period of twenty-four months or on three trips 
within eight consecutive trips must have observer data and other 
pertinent records reviewed by the Director, Southwest Region and the 
Porpoise Rescue Foundation for the purpose of determining the causes of 
higher than acceptable mortality, must participate in supplemental 
marine mammal safety training as ordered by the Director, Southwest 
Region and must comply with actions for reducing marine mammal mortality 
which may be ordered by the Director, Southwest Region. The operator 
must carry an expert fisherman (i.e., an experienced vessel operator 
with a history of low dolphin mortality), if required to do so by the 
Director, Southwest Region, to assist in perfecting marine mammal safety 
techniques, and must also carry an observer on the next trip for which 
he serves as the certificated operator. The selection of the expert 
fisherman will be provided by the General Permit holder or the Porpoise 
Rescue Foundation and subject to the approval of the Director, Southwest 
Region. If the Director, Southwest Region determines that the required 
training or other ordered action has not been completed satisfactorily 
or is refused, the Director, Southwest Region will suspend the 
operator's certificate of inclusion for one year.
    (H) The operator certificate of inclusion or an operator whose 
average marine mammal mortality rate exceeds 3.89 kill-per-set on three 
consecutive trips, or on any four trips (of which no more than two are 
consecutives) completed within a period of twenty-four months or on four 
trips (of which no more than two are consecutive) within eight 
consecutively observed trips, is suspended upon notification to the 
operator from the Director, Southwest Region.
    (I) Following a suspension and a reinstatement of a certification of 
inclusion, the operator certificate of inclusion is suspended for any 
operator whose average marine mammal mortality rate exceeds 3.89 marine 
mammals killed per set on any subsequent trip as required under the 
criteria for a suspension established in paragraph (d)(2)(ix)(H) of this 
section. Under this paragraph, trips completed by the operator prior to 
suspension will be carried over and counted along with trips completed 
subsequent to the suspension. Such suspension shall be effective upon 
notification from the Director, Southwest Region and shall be for a 
period of one year. For purposes of this paragraph only, each suspension 
under paragraph (d)(2)(ix)(A) of this section will be considered 
equivalent to and counted as three consecutive trips exceeding the trip 
kill rate of 3.89 marine mammals killed per set.
    (J) An operator may appeal suspension of revocation of a certificate 
of inclusion under paragraphs (d)(2)(ix)(A), (d)(2)(ix)(H), or 
(d)(2)(ix)(I) of this section to the Assistant Administrator. Appeals 
must be filed in writing within 30 days of suspension or revocation and 
must contain a statement setting forth the basis for the appeal. Appeals 
must be filed with the Director, Southwest

[[Page 27]]

Region. The appeal may be presented at the option of the operator at a 
hearing before a person appointed by the Assistant Administrator to hear 
the appeal. The Assistant Administrator will determine, based upon the 
record, including any record developed at a hearing, if the suspension 
or revocation is supported under the criteria set forth in these 
regulations. The decision of the Assistant Administrator will be the 
final decision of the Department of Commerce.
    (K) An operator must carry an observer on the operator's first trip 
after a suspension under this performance system has expired. An 
operator must also participate in supplemental marine mammal safety 
training and comply with actions for reducing marine mammal mortality as 
ordered by the Director, Southwest Region before making another trip as 
a certified operator.
    (L) A person obtaining an operator certificate of inclusion for the 
first time must carry an observer on the operator's first trip.
    (x) Vessel Certificate of Inclusion Holder Performance 
Requirements--(A) vessel certificate of inclusion holder desiring a DML 
for the following year must provide to the Director, Southwest Region, 
NMFS, 501 W. Ocean Blvd., Suite 4200, Long Beach, CA 90802-4213, by 
September 1, the name of the purse seine vessel(s) of carrying capacity 
greater than 400 short tons (362.8 mt) that the owner thinks will 
intentionally deploy purse seine fishing nets in the ETP to encircle 
dolphins in an effort to capture tuna during that year. NMFS will 
forward the list of purse seine vessels to the Director of the IATTC on 
or before October 1, or as required by the IATTC, for assignment of a 
DML for the following year.
    (B) Each vessel certificate of inclusion holder that desires a DML 
for the period July 1 to December 31, for a vessel that has not 
previously had a DML assigned for the year, must provide to the 
Director, Southwest Region, NMFS, 501 W. Ocean Blvd., Suite 4200, Long 
Beach, CA 90802-4213, by March 15, the name of the purse seine vessel(s) 
of carrying capacity greater than 400 short tons (362.8 mt) that the 
owner thinks will intentionally deploy purse seine fishing nets in the 
ETP to encircle dolphins in an effort to capture tuna during the period. 
NMFS will forward the list of purse seine vessels to the Director of the 
IATTC on or before April 1, or as required by the IATTC, for assignment 
of a DML for the 6-month period July 1 to December 31. Under the 
Agreement adopted at the Annual Meeting of the IATTC June 16-18, 1992, 
the DML shall be assigned from the unutilized pool of DMLs described 
under paragraph (d)(2)(x)(D) of this section, divided among the 
applicants for the 6-month period, and shall not exceed 50 percent of 
the DML assigned to a vessel in the fishery with a DML for the entire 
year.
    (C)(1) NMFS will notify vessel owners of the DML assigned for each 
vessel for the following year as determined by the IATTC.
    (2) NMFS may adjust the DMLs, either upward or downward with 15 
percent of the original DML, except that the adjusted DMLs for the U.S. 
fleet will not exceed the original total of the DMLs for the U.S. fleet 
as assigned by the IATTC. All adjustments shall be made prior to 
December 1, and NMFS shall notify the IATTC prior to December 15. DMLs 
as assigned on December 1 will be applicable to the following year.
    (3) NMFS may make an adjustment of a vessel's DMLs if it will 
further scientific or technological advancement in the protection of 
marine mammals in the fishery, or if the past performance of the vessel 
indicates that the protection or use of the yellowfin tuna stocks or 
marine mammals is best served by the adjustment, within the mandates of 
the MMPA. Experimental fishing operation waivers or scientific research 
permits shall be considered a basis for adjustments.
    (D)(1) Any vessel assigned a DML, that does not participate, by June 
1, in this fishery by operating under valid certificates of inclusion, 
or that leaves the fishery, shall lose its right to utilize its DML for 
the remainder of the year.
    (2) NMFS will determine, based on the available information, whether 
a vessel has left the fishery. A vessel lost at sea, undergoing 
extensive repairs, operating in an ocean area other than

[[Page 28]]

the ETP, or for which other information indicates will no longer be 
conducting purse seine operations in the ETP for the remainder of the 
period, shall be determined to have left the fishery. NMFS will make all 
reasonable efforts to determine the intentions of the vessel owner, and 
the owner of any vessel that has been preliminarily determined to have 
left the fishery will be provided notice of such preliminary 
determination and the opportunity to provide information on whether the 
vessel has left the fishery before NMFS makes a final determination and 
notifies the IATTC of this determination. The vessel owner will receive 
written notification of NMFS' final determination.
    (3) Any unused DML for a vessel that has been determined to have 
left the fishery will be returned to the IATTC, to be added to the pool 
of unutilized DMLs.
    (E) Any vessel that exceeds its assigned DML, after any applicable 
adjustment under paragraph (d)(2)(x)(C)(2) of this section, shall have 
its DML for the subsequent year reduced by the amount of overage.
    (F)(1) The vessel operator and owner are responsible for ensuring 
that the DML for that vessel is not exceeded.
    (2) Observers, either from the IATTC observer program or the NMFS 
observer program, will make their records available to the vessel 
operators at any time, including after each set, so that the operator 
can monitor the balance of the DML remaining for use during the trip.
    (3) Vessel captains must cease deploying purse seine sets to 
encircle dolphins intentionally when the vessel's DML, as adjusted under 
paragraph (d)(2)(x)(C)(2) of this section, is reached.
    (G)(1) Sanctions recommended by the Review Panel for any violation 
of these rules shall be considered by NMFS in its enforcement of these 
regulations.
    (2) Intentionally deploying a purse seine net on or to encircle 
dolphins after the vessel's DML is reached will disqualify the vessel 
from consideration for a DML for the following year. If already 
assigned, the DMLs for the following year will be withdrawn, and the 
IATTC notified by NMFS that the DML assigned to that vessel will be 
unutilized. The vessel owner will be provided an opportunity to provide 
information and comments on this issue before a final determination is 
made by NMFS.
    (3) Encircling gear, purse seining not involving the intentional 
taking of marine mammals. (i) A certificate holder may take marine 
mammals so long as such taking is an incidental occurrence in the course 
of normal commercial fishing operations. Marine mammals taken incidental 
to commercial fishing operations shall be immediately returned to the 
environment where captured without further injury.
    (ii) A certificate holder may take such steps as are necessary to 
protect his catch, gear, or person from depredation, damage or personal 
injury without inflicting death or injury to any marine mammal.
    (iii) Only after all means permitted by paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this 
section have been taken to deter a marine mammal from depredating the 
catch, damaging the gear, or causing personal injury, may the 
certificate holder injure or kill the animal causing the depredation or 
immediate damage, or about to cause immediate personal injury; however, 
in no event shall a certificate holder kill or injure an Atlantic 
bottlenosed dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, under the provisions of this 
paragraph. A certificate holder shall not injure or kill any animal 
permitted to be killed or injured under this paragraph unless the 
infliction of such damage is substantial and immediate and is actually 
being caused at the time such steps are taken. In all cases, the burden 
is on the certificate holder to report fully and demonstrate that the 
animal was causing substantial and immediate damage or about to cause 
personal injury and that all possible steps to protect against such 
damage or injury as permitted by paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section 
were taken and that such attempts failed.
    (iv) Marine mammals taken in the course of commercial fishing 
operations shall be subject to the provisions of Sec. 216.3 with respect 
to ``Incidental catch,'' and may be retained except where a specific 
permit has been obtained authorizing the retention.

[[Page 29]]

    (v) All certificate holders shall maintain logs of incidental take 
of marine mammals in such form as prescribed by the Assistant 
Administrator. All deaths or injuries to marine mammals occurring in the 
course of commercial fishing operations under the conditions of a 
general permit shall be immediately recorded in the log and reported in 
writing to the Director, Southwest Region, where a certificate 
application was made, or to an enforcement agent or other designated 
agent of the National Marine Fisheries Service, at the earliest 
opportunity but no later than five days after such occurrence, except 
that if a vessel at sea returns to port later than five days after such 
occurrence, then it shall be reported within forty-eight hours after 
arrival in port. Reports must include:
    (A) The location, time, and date of the death or injury;
    (B) The identity and number of marine mammals killed or injured; and
    (C) A description of the circumstances which led up to and caused 
the death or injury.
    (4) Stationary gear. (i) A certificate holder may take marine 
mammals so long as such taking is an incidental occurrence in the course 
of normal commercial fishing operations. Marine mammals taken incidental 
to commercial fishing operations shall be immediately returned to the 
environment where captured without further injury.
    (ii) A certificate holder may take such steps as are necessary to 
protect his catch, gear, or person from depredation, damage or personal 
injury without inflicting death or injury to any marine mammal.
    (iii) Only after all means permitted by paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this 
section have been taken to deter a marine mammal from depredating the 
catch, damaging the gear, or causing personal injury, may the 
certificate holder injure or kill the animal causing the depredation or 
immediate damage, or about to cause immediate personal injury; however, 
in no event shall a certificate holder kill or injure an Atlantic 
bottlenosed dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, under the provisions of this 
paragraph. A certificate holder shall not injure or kill any animal 
permitted to be killed or injured under this paragraph unless the 
infliction of such damage is substantial and immediate and is actually 
being caused at the time such steps are taken. In all cases, the burden 
is on the certificate holder to report fully and demonstrate that the 
animal was causing substantial and immediate damage or about to cause 
personal injury and that all possible steps to protect against such 
damage or injury as permitted by paragraph (ii) were taken and that such 
attempts failed.
    (iv) Marine mammals taken in the course of commercial fishing 
operations shall be subject to the provisions of Sec. 216.3 with respect 
to ``Incidental catch,'' and may not be retained except where a specific 
permit has been obtained authorizing the retention.
    (v) All certificate holders shall maintain logs of incidental take 
of marine mammals in such form as prescribed by the Assistant 
Administrator. All deaths or injuries to marine mammals occurring in the 
course of commercial fishing operations under the conditions of a 
general permit shall be immediately recorded in the log and reported in 
writing to the Director, Southwest Region, where a certificate 
application was made, or to an enforcement agent or other designated 
agent of the National Marine Fisheries Service, at the earliest 
opportunity but no later than five days after such occurrence, except 
that if a vessel at sea returns to port later than five days after such 
occurrence, then it shall be reported within forty-eight hours after 
arrival in port. Reports must include:
    (A) The location time, and date of the death or injury;
    (B) The identity and number of marine mammals killed or injured; and
    (C) A description of the circumstances which led up to and caused 
the death or injury.
    (5) Other gear. (i) A certificate holder may take marine mammals so 
long as such taking is an incidental occurrence in the course of normal 
commercial fishing operations. Marine mammals taken incidental to 
commercial fishing operations shall be immediately returned to the 
environment where captured without further injury.
    (ii) A certificate holder may take such steps as are necessary to 
protect

[[Page 30]]

his catch, gear, or person from depredation, damage or personal injury 
without inflicting death or injury to any marine mammal.
    (iii) Only after all means permitted by paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this 
section have been taken to deter a marine mammal from depredating the 
catch, damaging the gear, or causing personal injury, may the 
certificate holder injure or kill the animal causing the depredation or 
immediate damage, or about to cause immediate personal injury; however, 
in no event shall a certificate holder kill or injure an Atlantic 
bottlenosed dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, under the provisions of this 
paragraph. A certificate holder shall not injure or kill any animal 
permitted to be killed or injured under this paragraph unless the 
infliction of such damage is substantial and immediate and is actually 
being caused at the time such steps are taken. In all cases, the burden 
is on the certificate holder to report fully and demonstrate that the 
animal was causing substantial and immediate damage or about to cause 
personal injury and that all possible steps to protect against such 
damage or injury as permitted by paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section 
were taken and that such attempts failed.
    (iv) Marine mammals taken in the course of commercial fishing 
operations shall be subject to the provisions of Sec. 216.3 with respect 
to ``Incidental catch,'' and may not be retained except where a specific 
permit has been obtained authorizing the retention.
    (v) All certificate holders shall maintain logs of incidental take 
of marine mammals in such form as prescribed by the Assistant 
Administrator. All deaths or injuries to marine mammals occurring in the 
course of commercial fishing operations under the conditions of a 
general permit shall be immediately recorded in the log and reported in 
writing to the Director, Southwest Region, where a certificate 
application was made, or to an enforcement agent, or other designated 
agent of the National Marine Fisheries Service, at the earliest 
opportunity but no later than five days after such occurrence, except 
that if a vessel at sea returns to port later than five days after such 
occurrence, then it shall be reported within forty-eight hours after 
arrival in port. Reports must include:
    (A) The location, time, and date of the death or injury;
    (B) The identity and number of marine mammals killed or injured; and
    (C) A description of the circumstances which led up to and caused 
the death or injury.
    (vi) [Reserved]
    (vii) The number of Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli) killed or 
injured by Japanese vessels operating in the U.S. EEZ is limited to an 
aggregate of 789 in the Bering Sea and 5250 in the North Pacific Ocean 
over the period 1987 to 1989, of which no more than 448 may be taken 
from the Bering Sea and no more than 2494 may be taken from the North 
Pacific Ocean in any single calendar year. The incidental take levels 
authorized by this subpart are reduced proportionately in the event that 
the Soviet Union reduces salmon quotas for 1988 or 1989 by more than 10 
percent from the 1987 quota. Any permit issued under this part must 
indicate the measures by which the permit holder must comply with the 
conditions attached to the permit, and the reporting requirements of 
paragraph (d)(5)(v) of this section. Any permit issued under this part 
may allow retention of marine mammals for scientific purposes and will 
not require a separate permit under paragraph (d)(5)(iv) of this 
section.
    (6) Commercial passenger fishing vessels (CPFV). (i) A certificate 
holder aboard the vessel may take marine mammals so long as the taking 
is limited to harassment and is an incidental occurrence in the course 
of the active sportfishing subject to the following restrictions 
(paragraphs (d)(6) (ii) through (vi) of this section).
    (ii) Takings are prohibited within 500 yards of a pinniped rookery 
or haul-out site.
    (iii) A certificate holder aboard the CPFV must use only those non-
lethal, non-injurious methods not including capture as approved in 
advance by the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries through publication 
in the Federal Register and stipulated in the General Permit for taking 
marine mammals.

[[Page 31]]

    (iv) Takings are allowed only while engaged in active sportfishing 
to prevent imminent marine mammal approaches to the vessel or to protect 
a passenger's catch or gear from depredation or damage, without 
inflicting death or injury to any marine mammal.
    (v) All operators must ensure the safe use of the approved methods 
for preventing marine mammal sportfishing interaction and must 
satisfactorily complete such training as may be required by the 
Assistant Administrator for Fisheries.
    (vi) All certificate holders must maintain records of incidental 
take of marine mammals in such form as prescribed by the Assistant 
Administrator for Fisheries. All incidents involving harassment of 
marine mammals must be immediately recorded and reported in writing to 
the Director, Southwest Region to whom the certificate application was 
made, or to an enforcement agent or other designated agent of the 
National Marine Fisheries Service, at the earliest opportunity, but no 
later than five days after such occurrence. At a minimum, reports must 
include:
    (A) The time, date, and location of the taking;
    (B) The type of harassment device used, and the number used at each 
occurrence;
    (C) The number and species of affected marine mammals; and
    (D) A description of any behavioral changes noted that may be due to 
using the harassment device.
    (e) Importation, purchase, shipment, sale and transport. (1)(i) It 
is illegal to import into the United States any fish, whether fresh, 
frozen, or otherwise prepared, if the fish have been caught with 
commercial fishing technology that results in the incidental kill or 
incidental serious injury of marine mammals in excess of that allowed 
under this part for U.S. fishermen or in excess of what is specified in 
subsection (e)(5) in the case of fishing for yellowfin tuna.
    (ii) For purposes of this paragraph (e), and in applying the 
definition of an ``intermediary nation'', an import occurs when the fish 
or fish product is released from a nation's Customs' custody and enters 
into the territory of the nation. For other purposes, ``import'' is 
defined in Sec. 216.3.
    (2) The following fish and categories of fish, which the Assistant 
Administrator has determined may be involved with commercial fishing 
operations which cause the death or injury of marine mammals, are 
subject to the requirements of this section:

the accompanying shipment, must include the following information:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Copies of the form are available from the Director, Southwest 
Region (see Sec. 216.3).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (A) Country under whose laws the harvesting vessel operated;
    (B) Exporter (name and address);
    (C) Consignee (name and address);
    (D) Type and quantity of the fish or fish products to be imported, 
listed by U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule Number;
    (E) Ocean area where the fish was harvested (ETP, Western Pacific 
Ocean, South Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, Indian Ocean, 
or other);
    (F) Type of fishing gear used to harvest the fish (purse seine, 
longline, bait boat, large-scale driftnet, other type of gillnet, trawl, 
pole and line, other);
    (G) Dates on which the fishing trip began and ended;
    (H) If shipment is tuna or products from tuna that were harvested in 
the ETP with a purse seine net, the name of the harvesting vessel; and
    (I) For shipments harvested by vessels of a nation known to use 
large-scale driftnets, as determined by the Secretary pursuant to 
paragraph (e)(4) of this section, a statement must be included on the 
Fisheries Certificate of Origin, or by separate attachment, that is 
dated and signed by a responsible government official of the harvesting 
nation, certifying that the fish or fish product was harvested by a 
method other than large-scale driftnet, if the shipment includes:
    (1) Tuna or tuna products described in paragraph (e)(2) (i) or (ii) 
of this section that were harvested on the high seas after July 1, 1991; 
or
    (2) Fish or fish products other than tuna described in paragraph 
(e)(2)(iii) of this section that were harvested in the South Pacific 
Ocean after July 1, 1991, or that were harvested anywhere on the high 
seas after July 1, 1992.
    (4) Large-scale driftnet nations. Based upon the best information 
available, the Assistant Administrator will determine which nations have 
registered vessels that engage in fishing with large-scale driftnets. 
Such determinations shall be published in the Federal Register. A 
responsible government official of any such nation may certify to the 
Assistant Administrator that none of the nation's vessels use large-
scale driftnets. Upon receipt of the certification, the Assistant 
Administrator may find, and publish such finding in the Federal 
Register, that none of

[[Page 34]]

the nation's vessels engage in fishing with large-scale driftnets.
    (5) Yellowfin tuna. 
    (i) Any tuna or tuna products in the classifications listed in 
paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, from harvesting nations whose 
vessels of greater than 400 short tons (362.8 mt) carrying capacity 
operate in the ETP tuna purse seine fishery as determined by the 
Assistant Administrator, may not be imported into the United States 
unless the Assistant Administrator makes an affirmative finding under 
either paragraph (e)(5)(v), (e)(5)(viii) or (e)(5)(x) of this section 
and publishes the finding in the Federal Register that:
    (A) The government of the harvesting nation has adopted a regulatory 
program governing the incidental taking of marine mammals in the course 
of such harvesting that is comparable to the regulatory program of the 
United States; and
    (B) The average rate of incidental mortality by the vessels of the 
harvesting nation is comparable to the average rate of incidental 
mortality of marine mammals by U.S. vessels in the course of such 
harvesting as specified in paragraphs (e)(5)(v)(E) and (e)(5)(v)(F) of 
this section.
    (ii) A harvesting nation which desires an initial finding under 
these regulations that will allow it to import into the United States 
those products listed in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section must 
provide the Assistant Administrator with the following information:
    (A) A detailed description of the nation's regulatory and 
enforcement program governing incidental taking of marine mammals in the 
purse seine fishery for yellowfin tuna, including:
    (1) A description, with copies of relevant laws, implementing 
regulations and guidelines, of the gear and procedures required in the 
fishery to protect marine mammals, including but not limited to the 
following:
    (i) A description of the methods used to identify problems and to 
take corrective actions to improve the performance of individual 
fishermen in reducing incidental mortality and serious injury. By 1990 
the methods must identify individual operators with marine mammal 
mortality rates which are consistently and substantially higher than the 
majority of the nation's fleet, and provide for corrective training and, 
ultimately, suspension and removal from the fishery if the operator's 
performance does not improve to at least the performance of the majority 
of the fleet in a reasonable time period;
    (ii) By 1990, a description of a regulatory system in operation 
which ensures that all marine mammal sets are completed through backdown 
to rolling the net to sack-up no later than one-half hour after sundown, 
except that individual operators may be exempted, if they have 
maintained consistently a rate of kill during their observed sundown 
sets which is not higher than that of the nation's fleet average during 
daylight sets made during the time period used for their comparability 
finding; and
    (iii) By 1990, a description of its restrictions on the use of 
explosive devices in the purse seine fishery which are comparable to 
those of the United States.
    (2) A detailed description of the method (e.g., Inter-American 
Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) or other international program observer 
records) and level of observer coverage by which the incidental 
mortality and serious injury of marine mammals will be monitored.
    (B) A list of its vessels and any certified charter vessels of 
greater than 400 short tons carrying capacity which purse seined for 
yellowfin tuna at any time during the preceding year in the ETP, 
indicating the status of each such vessel during that period (i.e., 
actively fishing in ETP, fishing in other waters; in port for repairs; 
inactive) and the status of each vessel expected to operate in the ETP 
in the year in which the submission is made.
    (C) A compilation of the best available data for each calendar year 
on the performance of any of its purse seine vessels (including 
certified charter vessels) fishing at any time for tuna associated with 
marine mammals within the ETP including the following:
    (1) Total number of tons of yellowfin tuna observed caught in each 
fishing area by purse seine sets on:
    (i) Common dolphin and
    (ii) All other marine mammal species;

[[Page 35]]

    (2) Total number of marine mammals observed killed and the total 
number of marine mammals observed seriously injured in each fishing area 
by species/stock by purse seine sets on:
    (i) Common dolphin and
    (ii) All other marine mammal species;
    (3) Total number of observed trips and total number of observed 
purse seine sets on marine mammals in each fishing area by the nation's 
purse seine fleet during the year;
    (4) Total number of vessel trips and total number of purse seine 
sets on marine mammals in each fishing area by the nation's purse seine 
fleet during the year; and
    (5) The total number of observed purse seine sets in each fishing 
area in which more than 15 marine mammals were killed.
    (D) Data required by paragraph (e)(5)(ii)(C)(2) presented 
individually for the following marine mammal species/stocks: offshore 
spotted dolphin, coastal spotted dolphin, eastern spinner dolphin, 
whitebelly spinner dolphin, common dolphin, striped dolphin, and ``other 
marine mammals''.
    (E) A description of the source of the data provided in accordance 
with paragraph (e)(5)(ii)(C) of this section. The observer program from 
which these data are provided must be operated by the IATTC or another 
international program in which the United States participates and must 
sample at least the same percentage of the fishing trips as the United 
States achieves over the same time period, unless the Assistant 
Administrator determines that an alternative observer program, including 
a lesser level of observer coverage, will provide a sufficiently 
reliable average rate of incidental taking of marine mammals for the 
nation.
    (iii) A nation applying for its initial finding of comparability 
should apply at least 120 days before the desired effective date. The 
Assistant Administrator's determination on a nation's application for 
its initial finding will be announced and published in the Federal 
Register within 120 days of receipt of the information required in 
paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section.
    (iv) A harvesting nation that has in effect a positive finding under 
this section may request renewal of its finding for the following 
calendar year by providing the Assistant Administrator, by December 1 of 
the current calendar year, an update of the information listed in 
Sec. 216.24(e)(5)(ii) summarizing all fishing trips completed during the 
12-month period from October 1 of the previous calendar year through 
September 30 of the current year.
    (v) The Assistant Administrator's determination of a nation's timely 
submitted request for renewal of an affirmative finding will be 
announced by December 31. A finding will be valid for the calendar year 
following the fishing season for which observer data was submitted for 
obtaining a finding. The Assistant Administrator will make an 
affirmative finding or renew an affirmative finding if:
    (A) The harvesting nation has provided all information required by 
paragraphs (e)(5)(ii) and (e)(5)(iv) of this section;
    (B) The nation's regulatory program is comparable to the regulatory 
program of the United States as described in paragraphs (a), (c), 
(d)(2), and (f) of this section and the nation has incorporated into its 
regulatory program such additional prohibitions as the United States may 
apply to its own vessels within 180 days after the prohibition applies 
to U.S. vessels;
    (C) The data on marine mammal mortality and serious injury submitted 
by the harvesting nation are determined to be accurate;
    (D) The observer coverage of fishing trips was equal to that 
achieved by the United States during the same time period or, if less, 
was determined by the Assistant Administrator to provide a sufficiently 
accurate sample of the nation's fleet mortality rate;
    (E) For findings using data collected after 1988, the average kill-
per-set rate for the longest period of time for which data are 
available, up to 5 consecutive years, or for the most recent year, 
whichever is lower, is no more than 25 percent greater than the U.S. 
average for the same time period, after the U.S. mortality rate is 
weighted to account for dissimilar amounts of fishing effort between the 
two nations in the three

[[Page 36]]

ETP fishing areas and for common dolphin and other marine mammal 
species, except as provided in paragraph (e)(5)(v)(F) of this section 
for findings made in 1990;
    (F) For determining comparability where there are fewer than five 
sets (including no effort) on dolphin by the U.S. fleet in a fishing 
area on a species grouping that has fishing effort by the foreign nation 
requesting a comparability test, the mortality rates used for 
comparability will be the overall (i.e., unweighted) kill-per-set rate 
of the U.S. fleet and of the foreign nation's fleet.
    (G) For the 1989 fishing year and subsequent years, the nation's 
observed kill of eastern spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris) and 
coastal spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata) is no greater than 15 
percent and 2 percent, respectively, of the nation's total annual 
observed dolphin mortality; and
    (H) The nation has complied with all reasonable requests by the 
Assistant Administrator for cooperation in carrying out dolphin 
population assessments in the ETP.
    (vi) Period of validity. A finding is valid only for the period for 
which it was issued and may be terminated before the end of the year if 
the Assistant Administrator finds that the nation no longer has a 
comparable regulatory program or kill rate.
    (vii) Reconsideration of finding. The Assistant Administrator may 
reconsider a finding upon a request from and the submission of 
additional information by the harvesting nation, if the information 
indicates that the nation has met the requirements under paragraph 
(e)(5)(v) of this section. For a harvesting nation whose marine mammal 
mortality rate was found to exceed the acceptable levels prescribed in 
paragraphs (e)(5)(v)(E), (e)(5)(v)(F), or (e)(5)(v)(G) of this section, 
the additional information must include data collected by an acceptable 
observer program, which must demonstrate that the nation's fleet marine 
mammal mortality rate improved to the acceptable level during the period 
submitted for comparison, which must include, at a minimum, the most 
recent:
    (A) Twelve months of observer data if the species composition rate 
prescribed by paragraph (e)(5)(v)(G) of this section was not acceptable; 
or
    (B) Six months of observer data if the average kill-per-set rate 
prescribed by paragraph (e)(5)(v)(E) of this section was not acceptable.
    (viii) Application for finding for non-marine-mammal intentional 
sets. The Assistant Administrator's determination on a nation's 
application for a finding will be announced and published in the Federal 
Register. A harvesting nation which has implemented a regulatory program 
that prohibits the intentional setting of any purse seine net to 
encircle marine mammals and desires an initial finding under these 
regulations that will allow it to import into the United States those 
products listed in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section must provide the 
Assistant Administrator with the following:
    (A) Documentary evidence establishing that its regulatory program 
includes:
    (1) A law prohibiting the intentional setting of purse seine nets on 
marine mammals (a copy of the law must be submitted);
    (2) A requirement that a certificate from an observer be obtained 
within 30 days of the completion of each and every trip of the nation's 
purse seine vessels greater than 400 short tons (362.8 mt) carrying 
capacity, stating that the observer was aboard the vessel during the 
entire trip and that there were no intentional purse seine sets on 
marine mammals; and
    (B) A complete list of the nation's vessels and any certified 
charter vessels of greater than 400 short tons (362.8 mt) carrying 
capacity which purse seine for yellowfin tuna in the ETP, indicating the 
status of each vessel (i.e., actively fishing in the ETP, in port for 
repairs, etc.), and a list of changes to this fleet within 30 days when 
changes occur.
    (ix) Application for renewal of finding for non-marine-mammal 
intentional sets. A harvesting nation, which has in effect an 
affirmative finding under this section, may request a renewal of its 
finding for the subsequent calendar year by providing the Assistant 
Administrator an annual report by November 1, covering the previous 
October 1 to

[[Page 37]]

September 30 period, which includes the following:
    (A) Vessel summary data, to include:
    (1) The total number of observed trips;
    (2) The percentage of all purse seine fishing trips that carried 
observers under a program approved by the Assistant Administrator;
    (3) The total number, if any, of observed purse seine sets on marine 
mammals;
    (4) A summary of the number and species, if any, of all marine 
mammals killed or seriously injured in intentional purse seine sets on 
marine mammals;
    (5) A complete list of the nation's vessels and any certified 
charter vessels of greater than 400 short tons (362.8 mt) carrying 
capacity which purse seine for yellowfin tuna in the ETP, indicating the 
status of each vessels as of October 1;
    (B) A summary, which copies of relevant laws, of any changes in the 
nation's laws or regulatory program regarding marine mammals for the 
purse seine fishery in the ETP; and
    (C) A summary of any enforcement actions taken to ensure compliance 
with the nation's marine mammal protection laws.
    (x) Review of finding for non-marine-mammal intentional sets. The 
Assistant Administrator will renew an affirmative finding obtained under 
paragraph (e)(5)(ix) of this section if:
    (A) The harvesting nation has provided all of the information 
required by paragraph (e)(5)(ix) of this section and the conditions 
under which the original finding was made under paragraph (e)(5)(viii) 
of this section continue to exist; and
    (B) Either 100-percent observer coverage is provided for all purse 
seine vessels as required by paragraph (e)(5)(viii)(A)(2) of this 
section; or the harvesting nation is in a probationary status in 
accordance with paragraph (e)(5)(xi)(B)(1) of this section; and
    (C) The harvesting nation meets the criteria of paragraphs 
(e)(5)(v)(E), and (e)(5)(v)(G) of this section; and
    (D) Certificates have been provided to the Assistant Administrator 
within 30 days of the completion of each and every trip of the nation's 
purse seine vessels greater than 400 short tons (362.8 mt) carrying 
capacity from an observer approved by the Assistant Administrator or 
under the direction of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, and 
verified by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, stating that 
the observer was aboard the vessel during the entire trip and that there 
were no intentional purse seine sets on marine mammals or the nation 
received a positive reconsideration for an affirmative finding under 
paragraph (e)(5)(xii)(A) of this section.
    (xi) Probation and revocation. (A)(1) If it is determined that, 
during any trip, a purse seine was intentionally set on marine mammals, 
the nation will enter into a probationary status for 180 days, effective 
upon the date the vessel returns to port to unload.
    (2) If, during the probationary period of 180 days, there are any 
additional intentional purse seine sets made on marine mammals, the 
Assistant Administrator will immediately revoke the affirmative finding.
    (B)(1) If it is determined that, during any trip, an observer is not 
aboard a nation's purse seine vessel greater than 400 short tons (362.8 
mt) carrying capacity fishing in the ETP, that nation will enter into a 
probationary status for 1 year, effective upon the date the vessel 
returns to port to unload.
    (2) If, during the 1-year probationary period, a nation's purse 
seine vessel returns to port to unload, and it is determined that an 
observer was not aboard the vessel during a trip in the ETP, the 
Assistant Administrator will immediately revoke an affirmative finding 
made under paragraphs (e)(5)(viii) or (e)(5)(x) of this section.
    (xii) Reconsideration. (A) The Assistant Administrator will 
reconsider a revocation of an affirmative finding upon request from a 
harvesting nation which had its affirmative finding revoked under 
paragraph (e)(5)(xi)(A) of this section if:
    (1) The number of marine mammals taken in purse seine nets that were 
intentionally set on marine mammals does not exceed the comparability 
standards established in paragraphs (e)(5)(v)(E) and (e)(5)(v)(G) of 
this section; and

[[Page 38]]

    (2) That nation provides documentary evidence that no additional 
purse seines were intentionally set on marine mammals during the 90-day 
period immediately preceding the request for reconsideration.
    (B) A harvesting nation which has its affirmative finding revoked 
under paragraph (e)(5)(xi)(B) of this section or its reconsideration 
under paragraph (e)(5)(xii)(A) of this section denied, may request 
reconsideration for an affirmative finding under paragraph (e)(5)(vii) 
of this section.
    (xiii) Verification. The Assistant Administrator may require 
verification of statements made in connection with requests to allow 
importations.
    (xiv) Intermediary nation. Any yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna 
products in the classifications listed in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this 
section, from any intermediary nation, as that term is defined in 
section 3 of the MMPA, may not be imported into the United States unless 
the Assistant Administrator determines and publishes in the Federal 
Register that the intermediary nation has provided reasonable proof and 
has certified to the United States that it has not imported, in the 
preceding 6 months, yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products that are 
subject to a ban on direct importation into the United States under 
section 101(a)(2)(B) of the MMPA. A prohibition on imports under this 
paragraph may be lifted by the Assistant Administrator upon a 
determination announced in the Federal Register, based upon new 
information supplied by the government of the intermediary nation, that 
the nation has not imported, in the preceding 6 months, yellowfin tuna 
or yellowfin tuna products subject to a ban on direct imports under 
section 101(a)(2)(B) of the MMPA. Shipments of yellowfin tuna or 
yellowfin tuna products through a nation on a through bill of lading or 
in another manner that does not enter the shipments into that nation as 
an importation do not make that nation an intermediary nation. The 
Assistant Administrator shall act on any request to review decisions 
under this paragraph (e)(5)(xiv) that are accompanied by specific and 
detailed supporting information or documentation, within 30 days of 
receipt of such request. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(5)(xiv), 
certification and reasonable proof means the submission by a responsible 
government official from the nation of a document reflecting the 
nation's customs records for the preceding 6 months, together with a 
certificate attesting that the document is accurate.
    (xv) Pelly certification. After 6 months on an embargo being in 
place against a nation under this section, that fact shall be certified 
to the President for purposes of certification under section 8(a) of the 
Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 (22 U.S.C. 1978(a)) for as long as 
the embargo is in effect.
    (xvi) Coordination. The Assistant Administrator will promptly advise 
the Department of State of embargo decisions, actions and finding 
determinations.
    (6) Fish refused entry. If fish is denied entry under the provisions 
of Sec. 216.24(e)(3), the District Director of Customs shall refuse to 
release the fish for entry into the United States and shall issue a 
notice of such refusal to the importer or consignee.
    (7) [Reserved]
    (8) Disposition of fish refused entry into the United States; 
redelivered fish. Fish which is denied entry under Sec. 216.24(e)(3) or 
which is delivered in accordance with Sec. 216.24(e)(7) and which is not 
exported under Customs supervision within 90 days from the date of 
notice of refusal of admission or date of redelivery shall be disposed 
of under Customs laws and regulations. Provided however, That any 
disposition shall not result in an introduction into the United States 
of fish caught in violation of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972.
    (9) Dolphin safe requirements. (i) It is unlawful for any person to 
sell, purchase, offer for sale, transport, or ship in the United States, 
any tuna or tuna product that is not dolphin safe.
    (ii) For purposes of this section, tuna or a tuna product is dolphin 
safe if:
    (A) It does not contain tuna that was harvested on the high seas by 
a vessel engaged in large-scale driftnet fishing;
    (B) In the case of tuna or tuna product that contains tuna harvested 
in the ETP by a purse seine vessel, either the purse seine vessel is of 
less than 400

[[Page 39]]

short tons (362.8 metric tons (mt)) carrying capacity or, if the purse 
seine vessel is of 400 short tons (362.8 mt) carrying capacity or 
greater, the tuna or tuna product is accompanied by:
    (1) A completed Fisheries Certificate of Origin;
    (2) A written statement by the captain of each vessel that harvested 
the tuna, certifying that the vessel did not intentionally deploy a 
purse seine net on, or to encircle, dolphins at any time during the 
trip; a written statement, signed by either the Secretary or a 
representative of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, 
certifying that an observer employed by or working under contract with 
the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission or the Secretary, was on 
board the vessel during the entire trip and that the vessel did not 
intentionally deploy a purse seine net on, or to encircle, dolphin at 
any time during the trip; and
    (3) An endorsement on the Fisheries Certificate of Origin by each 
exporter, importer, and processor certifying that, to the best of his or 
her knowledge and belief, the Fisheries Certificate of Origin and 
attached documents, and the statements required by this paragraph 
(e)(9)(ii) accurately describe the tuna products;
    (C) In the case of tuna or a tuna product containing tuna harvested 
outside the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean by a purse seine vessel, it 
is accompanied by a written statement, executed by the captain of the 
vessel, certifying that no purse seine net was intentionally deployed 
on, or to encircle, dolphins during the particular voyage on which the 
tuna was harvested; and
    (D) In the case of tuna or a tuna product containing tuna harvested 
outside the ETP by a purse seine vessel in a fishery in which the 
Secretary has determined that a regular and significant association 
occurs between marine mammals and tuna, and in which tuna is harvested 
through the use of purse seine nets deployed on, or to encircle, marine 
mammals, it is accompanied by a written statement, executed by the 
captain of the vessel and by an observer, certifying that no purse seine 
net was intentionally deployed on, or to encircle, marine mammals during 
the particular voyage on which the tuna was harvested.
    (iii) Submission of documentation.--(A) Imported tuna or tuna 
product. The documents required by paragraph (e)(9)(ii) of this section 
must accompany the imported tuna or tuna product until no further 
endorsements are required on the documentation and the documents have 
been submitted to officials of the U.S. Customs Service at the time of 
importation.
    (B) U.S. domestic shipments. The documents required by paragraph 
(e)(9)(ii) of this section must accompany tuna or tuna product, other 
than imported, until no further endorsements are required on the 
documentation and the documents have been submitted to the Director, 
Southwest Region, National Marine Fisheries Service, 501 W. Ocean 
Boulevard, Suite 4200, Long Beach, CA 90802.
    (f) Observers. (1) The vessel certificate holder of any certificated 
vessel shall, upon the proper notification by the National Marine 
Fisheries Service, allow an observer duly authorized by the Secretary to 
accompany the vessel on any or all regular fishing trips for the purpose 
of conducting research and observing operations, including collecting 
information which may be used in civil or criminal penalty proceedings, 
forfeiture actions, or permit or certificate sanctions.
    (2) Research and observation duties shall be carried out in such a 
manner as to minimize interference with commercial fishing operations. 
The navigator shall provide true vessel locations by latitude and 
longitude, accurate to the nearest minute, upon request by the observer. 
No owner, master, operator, or crew member of a certificated vessel 
shall impair or in any way interfere with the research or observations 
being carried out.
    (3) Marine mammals killed during fishing operations which are 
accessible to crewmen and requested from the certificate holder or 
master by the observer shall be brought aboard the vessel and retained 
for biological processing, until released by the observer for return to 
the ocean. Whole marine mammals designated as biological specimens by 
the observer shall be retained in cold storage aboard the vessel

[[Page 40]]

until retrieved by authorized personnel of the National Marine Fisheries 
Service when the vessel returns to port for unloading.
    (4) The Secretary shall provide for the payment of all reasonable 
costs directly related to the quartering and maintaining of such 
observers on board such vessels. A vessel certificate holder who has 
been notified that the vessel is required to carry an observer, via 
certified letter from the National Marine Fisheries Service, shall 
notify the office from which the letter was received at least five days 
in advance of the fishing voyage to facilitate observer placement. A 
vessel certificate holder who has failed to comply with the provisions 
of this section may not engage in fishing operations for which a general 
permit is required.
    (5) It is unlawful for any person to forcibly assault, impede, 
intimidate, interfere with, or to influence or attempt to influence an 
observer, or to harass (including sexual harassment) an observer by 
conduct which has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with 
the observer's work performance, or which creates an intimidating, 
hostile, or offensive environment. In determining whether conduct 
constitutes harassment, the totality of the circumstances, including the 
nature of the conduct and the context in which it occurred, will be 
considered. The determination of the legality of a particular action 
will be made from the facts on a case-by-case basis.
    (6)(i) All observers must be provided sleeping, toilet and eating 
accommodations at least equal to that provided to a full crew member. A 
mattress or futon on the floor or a cot is not acceptable in place of a 
regular bunk. Meal and other galley privileges must be the same for the 
observer as for other crew members.
    (ii) Female observers on a vessel with an all-male crew must be 
accommodated either in a single-person cabin or, if reasonable privacy 
can be ensured by installing a curtain or other temporary divider, in a 
two-person cabin shared with a licensed officer of the vessel. If the 
cabin assigned to a female observer does not have its own toilet and 
shower facilities that can be provided for the exclusive use of the 
observer, then a schedule for time-sharing common facilities must be 
established before the placement meeting and approved by NMFS and must 
be followed during the entire trip.
    (iii) In the event there are one or more female crew members, the 
female observer may be provided a bunk in a cabin shared solely with 
female crew members, and provided toilet and shower facilities shared 
solely with these female crew members.
    (7)(i) A vessel certificate of inclusion holder (or vessel owner in 
the case of a new application) may seek an exemption from carrying a 
female observer on a vessel by applying to the Director, Southwest 
Region when applying for the vessel certificate of inclusion until July 
10, 1989 and establishing the following:
    (A) The vessel will have an all-male crew;
    (B) The vessel has fewer than two private (one-person) and semi-
private (two-person) cabins in total (excluding the captain's cabin);
    (C) A temporary divider like a curtain cannot be installed in the 
private or semi-private cabin (excluding the captain's cabin) to provide 
reasonable privacy; and
    (D) There are no other areas (excluding the captain's cabin) that 
can be converted to a sleeping room without either significant expense 
or significant sacrifice to the crew's quarters.
    (ii) The exclusion criteria in paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section 
can be met without having to provide the captain's cabin for the 
observer. The application for an exemption must also include an accurate 
diagram of the vessel's living areas, and other areas possibly suitable 
for sleeping. Additional documentation to support the application may 
also be required, as may an inspection of the vessel. The exemption, 
once granted, is valid for the same calendar year as the vessel 
certificate of inclusion, and the exemption must be renewed annually to 
remain valid. The vessel certificate of inclusion holder is responsible 
for reporting to the Director, Southwest Region any changes aboard the 
vessel within 15 days of the change which might affect the continued 
eligibility for an exemption. The Director, Southwest Region will revoke 
an exemption

[[Page 41]]

if the criteria for an exemption are no longer met.
    (g) Penalties and rewards: Any person or vessel subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States shall be subject to the penalties 
provided for under the MMPA for the conduct of fishing operations in 
violation of these regulations. The Secretary shall recommend to the 
Secretary of the Treasury that an amount equal to one-half of the fine 
incurred but not to exceed $2,500 be paid to any person who furnishes 
information which leads to a conviction for a violation of these 
regulations. Any officer, employee, or designated agent of the United 
States or of any State or local government who furnishes information or 
renders service in the performance of his official duties shall not be 
eligible for payment under this section.

Sec. 216.27   Release, non-releasability, and disposition under special exception permits for rehabilitated marine mammals.

    (a) Release requirements. (1) Any marine mammal held for 
rehabilitation

[[Page 42]]

must be released within six months of capture or import unless the 
attending veterinarian determines that:
    (i) The marine mammal might adversely affect marine mammals in the 
wild;
    (ii) Release of the marine mammal to the wild will not likely be 
successful given the physical condition and behavior of the marine 
mammal; or
    (iii) More time is needed to determine whether the release of the 
marine mammal to the wild will likely be successful. Releasability must 
be reevaluated at intervals of no less than six months until 24 months 
from capture or import, at which time there will be a rebuttable 
presumption that release into the wild is not feasible.
    (2) The custodian of the rehabilitated marine mammal shall provide 
written notification prior to any release into the wild.
    (i) Notification shall be provided to:
    (A) The NMFS Regional Director at least 15 days in advance of 
releasing any beached or stranded marine mammal, unless advance notice 
is waived in writing by the Regional Director; or
    (B) The Office Director at least 30 days in advance of releasing any 
imported marine mammal.
    (ii) Notification shall include the following:
    (A) A description of the marine mammal, including its physical 
condition and estimated age;
    (B) The date and location of release; and
    (C) The method and duration of transport prior to release.
    (3) The Regional Director, or the Office Director as appropriate, 
may:
    (i) Require additional information prior to any release;
    (ii) Change the date or location of release, or the method or 
duration of transport prior to release;
    (iii) Impose additional conditions to improve the likelihood of 
success or to monitor the success of the release; or
    (iv) Require other disposition of the marine mammal.
    (4) All marine mammals must be released near wild populations of the 
same species, and stock if known, unless a waiver is granted by the 
Regional Director or the Office Director.
    (5) All marine mammals released must be tagged or marked in a manner 
acceptable to the Regional Director or the Office Director. The tag 
number or description of the marking must be reported to the Regional 
Director or Office Director following release.
    (b) Non-releasability and postponed determinations. (1) The 
attending veterinarian shall provide the Regional Director or Office 
Director with a written report setting forth the basis of any 
determination under paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.
    (2) Upon receipt of a report under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, 
the Regional Director or Office Director, in their sole discretion, may:
    (i) Order the release of the marine mammal;
    (ii) Order continued rehabilitation for an additional 6 months; or
    (iii) Order other disposition as authorized.
    (3) No later than 30 days after a marine mammal is determined 
unreleasable in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of 
this section, the person with authorized custody must:
    (i) Request authorization to retain or transfer custody of the 
marine mammal in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, or;
    (ii) Humanely euthanize the marine mammal or arrange any other 
disposition of the marine mammal authorized by the Regional Director or 
Office Director.
    (4) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this section, the 
Office Director may require use of a rehabilitated marine mammal for any 
activity authorized under subpart D in lieu of animals taken from the 
wild.
    (5) Any rehabilitated beached or stranded marine mammal placed on 
public display following a non-releasability determination under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section and pending disposition under paragraph 
(c) of this section, or any marine mammal imported for medical treatment 
otherwise unavailable and placed on public display pending disposition 
after such medical treatment is concluded, must be held in captive 
maintenance consistent with all requirements for public display.

[[Page 43]]

    (c) Disposition for a special exception purpose. (1) Upon receipt of 
an authorization request made under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, 
or release notification under (a)(2), the Office Director may authorize 
the retention or transfer of custody of the marine mammal for a special 
exception purpose authorized under subpart D.
    (2) The Office Director will first consider requests from a person 
authorized to hold the marine mammal for rehabilitation. The Office 
Director may authorize such person to retain or transfer custody of the 
marine mammal for scientific research, enhancement, or public display 
purposes.
    (3) The Office Director may authorize retention or transfer of 
custody of the marine mammal only if:
    (i) Documentation has been submitted to the Office Director that the 
person retaining the subject animal or the person receiving custody of 
the subject animal by transfer, hereinafter referred to as the 
recipient, complies with public display requirements of 16 U.S.C. 
1374(c)(2)(A) or, for purposes of scientific research and enhancement, 
holds an applicable permit, or an application for such a special 
exception permit under Sec. 216.33 or a request for a major amendment 
under Sec. 216.39 has been submitted to the Office Director and has been 
found complete;
    (ii) The recipient agrees to hold the marine mammal in conformance 
with all applicable requirements and standards; and
    (iii) The recipient acknowledges that the marine mammal is subject 
to seizure by the Office Director:
    (A) If, at any time pending issuance of the major amendment or 
permit, the Office Director determines that seizure is necessary in the 
interest of the health or welfare of the marine mammal;
    (B) If the major amendment or permit is denied; or
    (C) If the recipient is issued a notice of violation and assessment, 
or is subject to permit sanctions, in accordance with 15 CFR part 904.
    (4) There shall be no remuneration associated with any transfer, 
provided that, the transferee may reimburse the transferor for any and 
all costs associated with the rehabilitation and transport of the marine 
mammal.
    (5) Marine mammals undergoing rehabilitation or pending disposition 
under this section shall not be subject to public display, unless such 
activities are specifically authorized by the Regional Director or the 
Office Director, and conducted consistent with the requirements 
applicable to public display. Such marine mammals shall not be trained 
for performance or be included in any aspect of a program involving 
interaction with the public; and
    (6) Marine mammals undergoing rehabilitation shall not be subject to 
intrusive research, unless such activities are specifically authorized 
by the Office Director in consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission 
and its Committee of Scientific Advisors on Marine Mammals, and are 
conducted pursuant to a scientific research permit.
    (d) Reporting. In addition to the report required under 
Sec. 216.22(b), the person authorized to hold marine mammals for 
rehabilitation must submit reports to the Regional Director or Office 
Director regarding release or other disposition. These reports must be 
provided in the form and frequency specified by the Regional Director or 
Office Director.

governed by the following requirements:
    (a) Applicant. (1) For each application submitted under this 
section, the applicant shall be the principal investigator responsible 
for the overall research or enhancement activity. If the research or 
enhancement activity will involve a periodic change in the principal 
investigator or is otherwise controlled by and dependent upon another 
entity, the applicant may be the institution, governmental entity, or 
corporation responsible for supervision of the principal investigator.

[[Page 50]]

    (2) For any scientific research involving captive maintenance, the 
application must include supporting documentation from the person 
responsible for the facility or other temporary enclosure.
    (b) Issuance Criteria. For the Office Director to issue any 
scientific research or enhancement permit, the applicant must 
demonstrate that:
    (1) The proposed activity furthers a bona fide scientific or 
enhancement purpose;
    (2) If the lethal taking of marine mammals is proposed:
    (i) Non-lethal methods for conducting the research are not feasible; 
and
    (ii) For depleted, endangered, or threatened species, the results 
will directly benefit that species or stock, or will fulfill a 
critically important research need.
    (3) Any permanent removal of a marine mammal from the wild is 
consistent with any applicable quota established by the Office Director.
    (4) The proposed research will not likely have significant adverse 
effects on any other component of the marine ecosystem of which the 
affected species or stock is a part.
    (5) For species or stocks designated or proposed to be designated as 
depleted, or listed or proposed to be listed as endangered or 
threatened:
    (i) The proposed research cannot be accomplished using a species or 
stock that is not designated or proposed to be designated as depleted, 
or listed or proposed to be listed as threatened or endangered;
    (ii) The proposed research, by itself or in combination with other 
activities will not likely have a long-term direct or indirect adverse 
impact on the species or stock;
    (iii) The proposed research will either:
    (A) Contribute to fulfilling a research need or objective identified 
in a species recovery or conservation plan, or if there is no 
conservation or recovery plan in place, a research need or objective 
identified by the Office Director in stock assessments established under 
section 117 of the MMPA;
    (B) Contribute significantly to understanding the basic biology or 
ecology of the species or stock, or to identifying, evaluating, or 
resolving conservation problems for the species or stock; or
    (C) Contribute significantly to fulfilling a critically important 
research need.
    (6) For proposed enhancement activities:
    (i) Only living marine mammals and marine mammal parts necessary for 
enhancement of the survival, recovery, or propagation of the affected 
species or stock may be taken, imported, exported, or otherwise affected 
under the authority of an enhancement permit. Marine mammal parts would 
include in this regard clinical specimens or other biological samples 
required for the conduct of breeding programs or the diagnosis or 
treatment of disease.
    (ii) The activity will likely contribute significantly to 
maintaining or increasing distribution or abundance, enhancing the 
health or welfare of the species or stock, or ensuring the survival or 
recovery of the affected species or stock in the wild.
    (iii) The activity is consistent with:
    (A) An approved conservation plan developed under section 115(b) of 
the MMPA or recovery plan developed under section 4(f) of the ESA for 
the species or stock; or
    (B) If there is no conservation or recovery plan, with the Office 
Director's evaluation of the actions required to enhance the survival or 
recovery of the species or stock in light of the factors that would be 
addressed in a conservation or recovery plan.
    (iv) An enhancement permit may authorize the captive maintenance of 
a marine mammal from a threatened, endangered, or depleted species or 
stock only if the Office Director determines that:
    (A) The proposed captive maintenance will likely contribute directly 
to the survival or recovery of the species or stock by maintaining a 
viable gene pool, increasing productivity, providing necessary 
biological information, or establishing animal reserves required to 
support directly these objectives; and
    (B) The expected benefit to the species or stock outweighs the 
expected

[[Page 51]]

benefits of alternatives that do not require removal of marine mammals 
from the wild.
    (v) The Office Director may authorize the public display of marine 
mammals held under the authority of an enhancement permit only if:

in number and limited to:
    (A) Individuals who perform a function directly supportive of and 
necessary to the permitted research activity; and
    (B) Support personnel included for the purpose of training or as 
backup personnel for persons described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(A).
    (v) Any marine mammal part imported under the authority of a 
scientific research permit must not have been obtained as the result of 
a lethal taking that would be inconsistent with the Acts, unless 
authorized by the Office Director.
    (vi) Marine mammals held under a permit for scientific research 
shall not be placed on public display, included in an interactive 
program or activity, or trained for performance unless such activities:
    (A) Are necessary to address scientific research objectives and have 
been specifically authorized by the Office Director under the scientific 
research permit; and
    (B) Are conducted incidental to and do not in any way interfere with 
the permitted scientific research; and
    (C) Are conducted in a manner consistent with provisions applicable 
to public display, unless exceptions are specifically authorized by the

Sec. 216.72  Restrictions on taking.

    (a) The harvests of seals on St. Paul and St. George Islands shall 
be treated independently for the purposes of this section. Any 
suspension, termination, or extension of the harvest is applicable only 
to the island for which it is issued.
    (b) By April 1 of every third year, beginning April 1994, the 
Assistant Administrator will publish in the Federal Register a summary 
of the preceding 3 years of harvesting and a discussion of the number of 
seals expected to be taken annually over the next 3 years to satisfy the 
subsistence requirements of each island. This discussion will include an 
assessment of factors and conditions on St. Paul and St. George Islands 
that influence the need by Pribilof Aleuts to take seals for subsistence 
uses and an assessment of any changes to those conditions indicating 
that the number of seals that may be taken for subsistence each year 
should be made higher or lower. Following a 30-day public comment 
period, a final notification of the expected annual harvest levels for 
the next 3 years will be published.
    (c)(1) No fur seal may be taken on the Pribilof Islands before June 
23 of each year.
    (2) No fur seal may be taken except by experienced sealers using the 
traditional harvesting methods, including stunning followed immediately 
by exsanguination. The harvesting method shall include organized drives 
of subadult males to killing fields unless it is determined by the NMFS 
representatives, in consultation with the Pribilovians conducting the 
harvest, that alternative methods will not result in increased 
disturbance to the rookery or the increased accidental take of female 
seals.
    (3) Any taking of adult fur seals or pups, or the intentional taking 
of subadult female fur seals is prohibited.
    (4) Only subadult male fur seals 124.5 centimeters or less in length 
may be taken.
    (5) Seals with tags and/or entangling debris may only be taken if so 
directed by NMFS scientists.
    (d) The scheduling of the harvest is at the discretion of the 
Pribilovians, but must be such as to minimize stress

[[Page 56]]

to the harvested seals. The Pribilovians must give adequate advance 
notice of their harvest schedules to the NMFS representatives to allow 
for necessary monitoring activities. Scheduling must be consistent with 
the following restrictions:
    (1) St. Paul Island--Seals may only be harvested from the following 
haulout areas: Zapadni, English Bay, Northeast Point, Polovina, Lukanin, 
Kitovi, and Reef. No haulout area may be harvested more than once per 
week.
    (2) St. George Island--Seals may only be harvested from the 
following haulout areas: Northeast and Zapadni. Neither haulout area may 
be harvested more than twice per week.
    (e)(1) The Assistant Administrator is required to suspend the take 
provided for in Sec. 215.31 when:
    (i) He determines, after reasonable notice by NMFS representatives 
to the Pribilovians on the island, that the subsistence needs of the 
Pribilovians on the island have been satisfied;
or
    (ii) He determines that the harvest is otherwise being conducted in 
a wasteful manner; or
    (iii) The lower end of the range of the estimated subsistence level 
provided in the notice issued under paragraph (b) of this section is 
reached.
    (2) A suspension based on a determination under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) 
of this section may be lifted by the Assistant Administrator if he finds 
that the conditions which led to the determination that the harvest was 
being conducted in a wasteful manner have been remedied.
    (3) A suspension issued in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of 
this section may not exceed 48 hours in duration and shall be followed 
immediately by a review of the harvest data to determine if a finding 
under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section is warranted. If a the harvest 
is not suspended under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, the 
Assistant Administrator must provide a revised estimate of the number of 
seals required to satisfy the Pribilovians' subsistence needs.
    (f) The Assistant Administrator shall terminate the take provided 
for in Sec. 215.31 on August 8 of each year or when it is determined 
under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section that the subsistence needs of 
the Pribilovians on the island have been satisfied, whichever occurs 
first.

    Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1385.

    Source: 61 FR 27794, June 3, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


[[Page 58]]




<R05>
Sec. 216.90  Purpose.

    This subpart governs the requirements for labeling of tuna or tuna 
products sold in or exported from the United States that suggest the 
tuna was harvested in a manner not injurious to dolphins.


<R05>
Sec. 216.91  Labeling requirements.

    It is a violation of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act 
(15 U.S.C. 45) for any person subject to U.S. jurisdiction, including 
any producer, exporter, importer, distributor, or seller of any tuna 
product exported from the United States or offered for sale in the 
United States to include on the label of that product the term ``dolphin 
safe'' or any other term, phrase, or symbol that claims or suggests that 
the tuna contained in the product was harvested using a fishing method 
that is not harmful to dolphins, if the product:
    (a) Contains tuna harvested with a large-scale driftnet; or
    (b) Contains tuna harvested in the ETP by a purse seine vessel 400 
short tons (362.8 metric tons) carrying capacity or greater and is 
labeled in a manner that violates the standards set forth in Sec. 216.92 
or Sec. 216.93.


<R05>
Sec. 216.92  Purse seine vessels greater than 400 short tons (362.8 metric tons).

    For purposes of Sec. 216.91(b), any tuna product containing tuna 
that were harvested in the ETP by a purse seine vessel 400 short tons 
(362.8 metric tons) carrying capacity or greater, must be accompanied 
by:
    (a) A completed Fisheries Certificate of Origin;
    (b) A written statement by the captain of each vessel that harvested 
the tuna, certifying that the vessel did not intentionally deploy a 
purse seine net on or to encircle dolphins at any time during the trip;
    (c) A written statement certifying that an observer, employed by or 
working under contract with the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission 
or the Secretary, was on board the vessel during the entire trip and 
that the vessel did not intentionally deploy a purse seine net on or to 
encircle dolphin at any time during the trip. The statement must be 
signed by either:
    (1) The Secretary; or
    (2) A representative of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission; 
and
    (d) An endorsement on the Fisheries Certificate of Origin by each 
exporter, importer, and processor certifying that, to the best of his or 
her knowledge and belief, the Fisheries Certificate of Origin and 
attached documentation, accurately describe the tuna products.


<R05>
Sec. 216.93  Submission of documentation.

    The documents required by Sec. 216.92 must accompany the tuna 
product whenever it is offered for sale or export, except that these 
documents need not accompany the product when offered for sale if:
    (a) The documents do not require further endorsement by any importer 
or processor, and are submitted to officials of the U.S. Customs Service 
at the time of import; or
    (b) The documents are endorsed as required by Sec. 216.92(d) and 
delivered to the Director, Southwest Region, or to the U.S. Customs 
Service at the time of exportation.


<R05>
Sec. 216.94  Requests to review documents.

    At any time, the Assistant Administrator may request, in writing, 
any exporter, importer, processor, distributor, or seller of any tuna or 
tuna product labeled in a manner subject to the requirements of 
Sec. 216.91, to produce, within a specified time period, all documentary 
evidence concerning the origin of any product that is offered for sale 
as ``dolphin safe,'' including the original invoice.


<R05>
Sec. 216.95  False statements or endorsements.

    Any person who knowingly and willfully makes a false statement or 
false endorsement required by Sec. 216.92 is liable for a civil penalty 
not to exceed $100,000, that may be assessed in an action brought in any 
appropriate District Court of the United States on behalf of the 
Secretary.

 Subpart I--General Regulations Governing Small Takes of Marine Mammals 
                   Incidental to Specified Activities

    Source: 61 FR 15887, Apr. 10, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 216.101  Purpose.

    The regulations in this subpart implement section 101(a)(5) (A) 
through (D) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended, 16 
U.S.C. 1371(a)(5), which provides a mechanism for allowing, upon 
request, the incidental, but not intentional, taking of small numbers of 
marine mammals by U.S. citizens who engage in a specified activity 
(other than commercial fishing) within a specified geographic region.


<R05>
Sec. 216.102  Scope.

    The taking of small numbers of marine mammals under section 
101(a)(5) (A) through (D) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act may be 
allowed only if the National Marine Fisheries Service:
    (a) Finds, based on the best scientific evidence available, that the 
total taking by the specified activity during the specified time period 
will have a negligible impact on species or stock of marine mammal(s) 
and will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of 
those species or stocks of marine mammals intended for subsistence uses;
    (b) Prescribes either regulations under Sec. 216.106, or 
requirements and conditions contained within an incidental harassment 
authorization issued under Sec. 216.107, setting forth permissible 
methods of taking and other means of effecting the least practicable 
adverse impact on the species or stock of marine mammal and its habitat 
and on the availability of the species or stock of marine mammal for 
subsistence uses, paying particular attention to rookeries, mating 
grounds, and areas of similar significance; and
    (c) Prescribes either regulations or requirements and conditions 
contained within an incidental harassment authorization, as appropriate, 
pertaining to the monitoring and reporting of such taking. The specific 
regulations governing certain specified activities are contained in 
subsequent subparts of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 216.103  Definitions.

    In addition to definitions contained in the MMPA, and in Sec. 216.3, 
and unless the context otherwise requires, in subsequent subparts to 
this part:
    Arctic waters means the marine and estuarine waters north of 60 deg. 
N. lat.
    Citizens of the United States and U.S. citizens mean individual U.S. 
citizens or any corporation or similar entity if it is organized under 
the laws of the United States or any governmental unit defined in 16 
U.S.C. 1362(13). U.S. Federal, state and local government agencies shall 
also constitute citizens of the United States for purposes of this part.
    Incidental harassment, incidental taking and incidental, but not 
intentional, taking all mean an accidental taking. This does not mean 
that the taking is unexpected, but rather it includes those takings that 
are infrequent, unavoidable or accidental. (A complete definition of 
``take'' is contained in Sec. 216.3).
    Negligible impact is an impact resulting from the specified activity 
that cannot be reasonably expected to, and is not reasonably likely to, 
adversely affect the species or stock through effects on annual rates of 
recruitment or survival.
    Small numbers means a portion of a marine mammal species or stock 
whose taking would have a negligible impact on that species or stock.
    Specified activity means any activity, other than commercial 
fishing, that takes place in a specified geographical region and 
potentially involves the taking of small numbers of marine mammals.
    Specified geographical region means an area within which a specified 
activity is conducted and that has certain biogeographic 
characteristics.
    Unmitigable adverse impact means an impact resulting from the 
specified activity:
    (1) That is likely to reduce the availability of the species to a 
level insufficient for a harvest to meet subsistence needs by:
    (i) Causing the marine mammals to abandon or avoid hunting areas;

[[Page 60]]

    (ii) Directly displacing subsistence users; or
    (iii) Placing physical barriers between the marine mammals and the 
subsistence hunters; and
    (2) That cannot be sufficiently mitigated by other measures to 
increase the availability of marine mammals to allow subsistence needs 
to be met.


<R05>
Sec. 216.104  Submission of requests.

    (a) In order for the National Marine Fisheries Service to consider 
authorizing the taking by U.S. citizens of small numbers of marine 
mammals incidental to a specified activity (other than commercial 
fishing), or to make a finding that an incidental take is unlikely to 
occur, a written request must be submitted to the Assistant 
Administrator. All requests must include the following information for 
their activity:
    (1) A detailed description of the specific activity or class of 
activities that can be expected to result in incidental taking of marine 
mammals;
    (2) The date(s) and duration of such activity and the specific 
geographical region where it will occur;
    (3) The species and numbers of marine mammals likely to be found 
within the activity area;
    (4) A description of the status, distribution, and seasonal 
distribution (when applicable) of the affected species or stocks of 
marine mammals likely to be affected by such activities;
    (5) The type of incidental taking authorization that is being 
requested (i.e., takes by harassment only; takes by harassment, injury 
and/or death) and the method of incidental taking;
    (6) By age, sex, and reproductive condition (if possible), the 
number of marine mammals (by species) that may be taken by each type of 
taking identified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, and the number of 
times such takings by each type of taking are likely to occur;
    (7) The anticipated impact of the activity upon the species or stock 
of marine mammal;
    (8) The anticipated impact of the activity on the availability of 
the species or stocks of marine mammals for subsistence uses;
    (9) The anticipated impact of the activity upon the habitat of the 
marine mammal populations, and the likelihood of restoration of the 
affected habitat;
    (10) The anticipated impact of the loss or modification of the 
habitat on the marine mammal populations involved;
    (11) The availability and feasibility (economic and technological) 
of equipment, methods, and manner of conducting such activity or other 
means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact upon the 
affected species or stocks, their habitat, and on their availability for 
subsistence uses, paying particular attention to rookeries, mating 
grounds, and areas of similar significance;
    (12) Where the proposed activity would take place in or near a 
traditional Arctic subsistence hunting area and/or may affect the 
availability of a species or stock of marine mammal for Arctic 
subsistence uses, the applicant must submit either a plan of cooperation 
or information that identifies what measures have been taken and/or will 
be taken to minimize any adverse effects on the availability of marine 
mammals for subsistence uses. A plan must include the following:
    (i) A statement that the applicant has notified and provided the 
affected subsistence community with a draft plan of cooperation;
    (ii) A schedule for meeting with the affected subsistence 
communities to discuss proposed activities and to resolve potential 
conflicts regarding any aspects of either the operation or the plan of 
cooperation;
    (iii) A description of what measures the applicant has taken and/or 
will take to ensure that proposed activities will not interfere with 
subsistence whaling or sealing; and
    (iv) What plans the applicant has to continue to meet with the 
affected communities, both prior to and while conducting the activity, 
to resolve conflicts and to notify the communities of any changes in the 
operation;
    (13) The suggested means of accomplishing the necessary monitoring 
and reporting that will result in increased knowledge of the species, 
the level of taking or impacts on populations of marine mammals that are 
expected to be present while conducting activities

[[Page 61]]

and suggested means of minimizing burdens by coordinating such reporting 
requirements with other schemes already applicable to persons conducting 
such activity. Monitoring plans should include a description of the 
survey techniques that would be used to determine the movement and 
activity of marine mammals near the activity site(s) including migration 
and other habitat uses, such as feeding. Guidelines for developing a 
site-specific monitoring plan may be obtained by writing to the 
Director, Office of Protected Resources; and
    (14) Suggested means of learning of, encouraging, and coordinating 
research opportunities, plans, and activities relating to reducing such 
incidental taking and evaluating its effects.
    (b)(1) The Assistant Administrator shall determine the adequacy and 
completeness of a request and, if determined to be adequate and 
complete, will begin the public review process by publishing in the 
Federal Register either:
    (i) A proposed incidental harassment authorization; or
    (ii) A notice of receipt of a request for the implementation or 
reimplementation of regulations governing the incidental taking.
    (2) Through notice in the Federal Register, newspapers of general 
circulation, and appropriate electronic media in the coastal areas that 
may be affected by such activity, NMFS will invite information, 
suggestions, and comments for a period not to exceed 30 days from the 
date of publication in the Federal Register. All information and 
suggestions will be considered by the National Marine Fisheries Service 
in developing, if appropriate, the most effective regulations governing 
the issuance of letters of authorization or conditions governing the 
issuance of an incidental harassment authorization.
    (3) Applications that are determined to be incomplete or 
inappropriate for the type of taking requested, will be returned to the 
applicant with an explanation of why the application is being returned.
    (c) The Assistant Administrator shall evaluate each request to 
determine, based upon the best available scientific evidence, whether 
the taking by the specified activity within the specified geographic 
region will have a negligible impact on the species or stock and, where 
appropriate, will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the 
availability of such species or stock for subsistence uses. If the 
Assistant Administrator finds that the mitigating measures would render 
the impact of the specified activity negligible when it would not 
otherwise satisfy that requirement, the Assistant Administrator may make 
a finding of negligible impact subject to such mitigating measures being 
successfully implemented. Any preliminary findings of ``negligible 
impact'' and ``no unmitigable adverse impact'' shall be proposed for 
public comment along with either the proposed incidental harassment 
authorization or the proposed regulations for the specific activity.
    (d) If, subsequent to the public review period, the Assistant 
Administrator finds that the taking by the specified activity would have 
more than a negligible impact on the species or stock of marine mammal 
or would have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of such 
species or stock for subsistence uses, the Assistant Administrator shall 
publish in the Federal Register the negative finding along with the 
basis for denying the request.


<R05>
Sec. 216.105  Specific regulations.

    (a) For all petitions for regulations under this paragraph, 
applicants must provide the information requested in Sec. 216.104(a) on 
their activity as a whole, which includes, but is not necessarily 
limited to, an assessment of total impacts by all persons conducting the 
activity.
    (b) For allowed activities that may result in incidental takings of 
small numbers of marine mammals by harassment, serious injury, death or 
a combination thereof, specific regulations shall be established for 
each allowed activity that set forth:
    (1) Permissible methods of taking;
    (2) Means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact on the 
species and its habitat and on the availability of the species for 
subsistence uses; and

[[Page 62]]

    (3) Requirements for monitoring and reporting, including 
requirements for the independent peer-review of proposed monitoring 
plans where the proposed activity may affect the availability of a 
species or stock for taking for subsistence uses.
    (c) Regulations will be established based on the best available 
information. As new information is developed, through monitoring, 
reporting, or research, the regulations may be modified, in whole or in 
part, after notice and opportunity for public review.


<R05>
Sec. 216.106  Letter of Authorization.

    (a) A Letter of Authorization, which may be issued only to U.S. 
citizens, is required to conduct activities pursuant to any regulations 
established under Sec. 216.105. Requests for Letters of Authorization 
shall be submitted to the Director, Office of Protected Resources. The 
information to be submitted in a request for an authorization will be 
specified in the appropriate subpart to this part or may be obtained by 
writing to the above named person.
    (b) Issuance of a Letter of Authorization will be based on a 
determination that the level of taking will be consistent with the 
findings made for the total taking allowable under the specific 
regulations.
    (c) Letters of Authorization will specify the period of validity and 
any additional terms and conditions appropriate for the specific 
request.
    (d) Notice of issuance of all Letters of Authorization will be 
published in the Federal Register within 30 days of issuance.
    (e) Letters of Authorization shall be withdrawn or suspended, either 
on an individual or class basis, as appropriate, if, after notice and 
opportunity for public comment, the Assistant Administrator determines 
that:
    (1) The regulations prescribed are not being substantially complied 
with; or
    (2) The taking allowed is having, or may have, more than a 
negligible impact on the species or stock or, where relevant, an 
unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of the species or stock 
for subsistence uses.
    (f) The requirement for notice and opportunity for public review in 
Sec. 216.106(e) shall not apply if the Assistant Administrator 
determines that an emergency exists that poses a significant risk to the 
wellbeing of the species or stocks of marine mammals concerned.
    (g) A violation of any of the terms and conditions of a Letter of 
Authorization or of the specific regulations shall subject the Holder 
and/or any individual who is operating under the authority of the 
Holder's Letter of Authorization to penalties provided in the MMPA.


<R05>
Sec. 216.107  Incidental harassment authorization for Arctic waters.

    (a) Except for activities that have the potential to result in 
serious injury or mortality, which must be authorized under 
Sec. 216.105, incidental harassment authorizations may be issued, 
following a 30-day public review period, to allowed activities that may 
result in only the incidental harassment of a small number of marine 
mammals. Each such incidental harassment authorization shall set forth:
    (1) Permissible methods of taking by harassment;
    (2) Means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact on the 
species, its habitat, and on the availability of the species for 
subsistence uses; and
    (3) Requirements for monitoring and reporting, including 
requirements for the independent peer-review of proposed monitoring 
plans where the proposed activity may affect the availability of a 
species or stock for taking for subsistence uses.
    (b) Issuance of an incidental harassment authorization will be based 
on a determination that the number of marine mammals taken by harassment 
will be small, will have a negligible impact on the species or stock of 
marine mammal(s), and will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the 
availability of species or stocks for taking for subsistence uses.
    (c) An incidental harassment authorization will be either issued or 
denied within 45 days after the close of the public review period.
    (d) Notice of issuance or denial of an incidental harassment 
authorization will be published in the Federal Register within 30 days 
of issuance of a determination.

[[Page 63]]

    (e) Incidental harassment authorizations will be valid for a period 
of time not to exceed 1 year but may be renewed for additional periods 
of time not to exceed 1 year for each reauthorization.
    (f) An incidental harassment authorization shall be modified, 
withdrawn, or suspended if, after notice and opportunity for public 
comment, the Assistant Administrator determines that:
    (1) The conditions and requirements prescribed in the authorization 
are not being substantially complied with; or
    (2) The authorized taking, either individually or in combination 
with other authorizations, is having, or may have, more than a 
negligible impact on the species or stock or, where relevant, an 
unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of the species or stock 
for subsistence uses.
    (g) The requirement for notice and opportunity for public review in 
paragraph (f) of this section shall not apply if the Assistant 
Administrator determines that an emergency exists that poses a 
significant risk to the well-being of the species or stocks of marine 
mammals concerned.
    (h) A violation of any of the terms and conditions of an incidental 
harassment authorization shall subject the holder and/or any individual 
who is operating under the authority of the holder's incidental 
harassment authorization to penalties provided in the MMPA.


<R05>
Sec. 216.108  Requirements for monitoring and reporting under incidental harassment authorizations for Arctic waters.

    (a) Holders of an incidental harassment authorization in Arctic 
waters and their employees, agents, and designees must cooperate with 
the National Marine Fisheries Service and other designated Federal, 
state, or local agencies to monitor the impacts of their activity on 
marine mammals. Unless stated otherwise within an incidental harassment 
authorization, the holder of an incidental harassment authorization 
effective in Arctic waters must notify the Alaska Regional Director, 
National Marine Fisheries Service, of any activities that may involve a 
take by incidental harassment in Arctic waters at least 14 calendar days 
prior to commencement of the activity.
    (b) Holders of incidental harassment authorizations effective in 
Arctic waters may be required by their authorization to designate at 
least one qualified biological observer or another appropriately 
experienced individual to observe and record the effects of activities 
on marine mammals. The number of observers required for monitoring the 
impact of the activity on marine mammals will be specified in the 
incidental harassment authorization. If observers are required as a 
condition of the authorization, the observer(s) must be approved in 
advance by the National Marine Fisheries Service.
    (c) The monitoring program must, if appropriate, document the 
effects (including acoustical) on marine mammals and document or 
estimate the actual level of take. The requirements for monitoring 
plans, as specified in the incidental harassment authorization, may vary 
depending on the activity, the location, and the time.
    (d) Where the proposed activity may affect the availability of a 
species or stock of marine mammal for taking for subsistence purposes, 
proposed monitoring plans or other research proposals must be 
independently peer-reviewed prior to issuance of an incidental 
harassment authorization under this subpart. In order to complete the 
peer-review process within the time frames mandated by the MMPA for an 
incidental harassment authorization, a proposed monitoring plan 
submitted under this paragraph must be submitted to the Assistant 
Administrator no later than the date of submission of the application 
for an incidental harassment authorization. Upon receipt of a complete 
monitoring plan, and at its discretion, the National Marine Fisheries 
Service will either submit the plan to members of a peer review panel 
for review or within 60 days of receipt of the proposed monitoring plan, 
schedule a workshop to review the plan. The applicant must submit a 
final monitoring plan to the Assistant Administrator prior to the 
issuance of an incidental harassment authorization.
    (e) At its discretion, the National Marine Fisheries Service may 
place an

[[Page 64]]

observer aboard vessels, platforms, aircraft, etc., to monitor the 
impact of activities on marine mammals.
    (f)(1) As specified in the incidental harassment authorization, the 
holder of an incidental harassment authorization for Arctic waters must 
submit reports to the Assistant Administrator within 90 days of 
completion of any individual components of the activity (if any), within 
90 days of completion of the activity, but no later than 120 days prior 
to expiration of the incidental harassment authorization, whichever is 
earlier. This report must include the following information:
    (i) Dates and type(s) of activity;
    (ii) Dates and location(s) of any activities related to monitoring 
the effects on marine mammals; and
    (iii) Results of the monitoring activities, including an estimate of 
the actual level and type of take, species name and numbers of each 
species observed, direction of movement of species, and any observed 
changes or modifications in behavior.
    (2) Monitoring reports will be reviewed by the Assistant 
Administrator and, if determined to be incomplete or inaccurate, will be 
returned to the holder of the authorization with an explanation of why 
the report is being returned. If the authorization holder disagrees with 
the findings of the Assistant Administrator, the holder may request an 
independent peer review of the report. Failure to submit a complete and 
accurate report may result in a delay in processing future authorization 
requests.
    (g) Results of any behavioral, feeding, or population studies, that 
are conducted supplemental to the monitoring program, should be made 
available to the National Marine Fisheries Service before applying for

When using explosives, the following mitigation measures must be 
utilized:
    (1)(i) If bottlenose or spotted dolphins are observed within 3,000 
ft (910 m) of the platform prior to detonating charges, detonation must 
be delayed until either the marine mammal(s) are more than 3,000 ft (910 
m) from the platform or actions (e.g., operating a vessel in the 
vicinity of the dolphins to stimulate bow riding, then steering the 
vessel away from the structure to be removed) are successful in removing 
them at least 3,000 ft (910 m) from the detonation site;
    (ii) Whenever the conditions described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of 
this section occur, the aerial survey required under Sec. 216.145(b)(1) 
must be repeated prior to detonation of charges if the timing 
requirements of Sec. 216.145(b)(1) cannot be met.
    (2) Detonation of explosives must occur no earlier than 1 hour after 
sunrise and no later than 1 hour before sunset;
    (3) If weather and/or sea conditions preclude adequate aerial, 
shipboard or subsurface surveillance, detonations must be delayed until 
conditions improve sufficiently for surveillance to be undertaken; and
    (4) Detonations must be staggered by a minimum of 0.9 seconds for 
each group of charges.

Sec. 216.145  Requirements for monitoring and reporting.

    (a) Observer(s) approved by the National Marine Fisheries Service in 
advance of the detonation must be used to monitor the area around the 
site prior to, during, and after detonation of charges.
    (b)(1) Both before and after each detonation episode, an aerial 
survey by NMFS-approved observers must be conducted for a period not 
less than 30 minutes within 1 hour of the detonation episode. To ensure 
that no marine mammals are within the designated 3,000 ft (1,000 yd, 941 
m) safety zone nor are likely to enter the designated safety zone prior 
to or at the time of detonation, the pre-detonation survey must 
encompass all waters within one nautical mile of the structure.
    (2) A second post-detonation aerial or vessel survey of the 
detonation site must be conducted no earlier than 48 hours and no later 
than 1 week after the oil and gas structure is removed, unless a 
systematic underwater survey, either by divers or remotely-operated 
vehicles, dedicated to marine mammals and sea turtles, of the site has 
been successfully conducted within 24 hours of the detonation event. The 
aerial or vessel survey must be systematic and concentrate down-current 
from the structure.
    (3) The NMFS observer may waive post-detonation monitoring described 
in paragraph (b)(2) of this section provided no marine mammals were 
sighted

[[Page 67]]

by the observer during either the required 48 hour pre-detonation 
monitoring period or during the pre-detonation aerial survey.
    (c) During all diving operations (working dives as required in the 
course of the removals), divers must be instructed to scan the 
subsurface areas surrounding the platform (detonation) sites for 
bottlenose or spotted dolphins and if marine mammals are sighted to 
inform either the U.S. government observer or the agent of the holder of 
the Letter of Authorization immediately upon surfacing.
    (d)(1) A report summarizing the results of structure removal 
activities, mitigation measures, monitoring efforts, and other 
information as required by a Letter of Authorization, must be submitted 
to the Director, NMFS, Southeast Region, 9721 Executive Center Drive N, 
St. Petersburg, FL 33702 within 30 calendar days of completion of the 
removal of the rig.
    (2) NMFS will accept the U.S. Government observer report as the 
activity report if all requirements for reporting contained in the 
Letter of Authorization are provided to that observer before the 
observer's report is complete.


<R05>
Sec. 216.146  Letters of Authorization.

    (a) To incidentally take bottlenose and spotted dolphins pursuant to 
these regulations, each company operating or which operated an oil or 
gas structure in the geographical area described in Sec. 216.141, and 
which is responsible for abandonment or removal of the platform, must 
apply for and obtain a Letter of Authorization in accordance with 
Sec. 216.106.
    (b) A copy of the Letter of Authorization must be in the possession 
of the persons conducting activities that may involve incidental takings 
of bottlenose and spotted dolphins.

activity identified in Sec. 216.141 will be renewed annually upon:
    (1) Timely receipt of the reports required under Sec. 216.145(d), 
which have been reviewed by the Assistant Administrator and determined 
to be acceptable;
    (2) A determination that the maximum incidental take authorizations 
in Sec. 216.141(b) will not be exceeded; and
    (3) A determination that the mitigation measures required under 
Sec. 216.143(b) and the Letter of Authorization have been undertaken.
    (b) If a species' annual authorization is exceeded, the Assistant 
Administrator will review the documentation submitted with the annual 
reports required under Sec. 216.145(d), to determine that the taking is 
not having more than a negligible impact on the species or stock 
involved.
    (c) Notice of issuance of a renewal of the Letter of Authorization 
will be published in the Federal Register.

except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no substantive 
modification, including withdrawal or suspension, to the Letter of 
Authorization issued pursuant to Sec. 216.106 and subject to the 
provisions of this subpart shall be made until after notice and an 
opportunity for public comment. For purposes of this paragraph, renewal 
of a Letter of Authorization under Sec. 216.147, without modification, 
is not considered a substantive modification.
    (b) If the Assistant Administrator determines that an emergency 
exists that poses a significant risk to the well-being of the species or 
stocks of marine mammals specified in Sec. 216.141(b), the Letter of 
Authorization issued pursuant to Sec. 216.106, or renewed pursuant to 
this section may be substantively modified without prior notice and an 
opportunity for public comment. A notice will be published in the 
Federal Register subsequent to the action.

    (3) A determination that the mitigation measures required under 
Sec. 216.153(b) and the Letter of Authorization have been undertaken.
    (b) If a species' annual authorization is exceeded, the National

modification, including withdrawal or suspension, to the Letter of 
Authorization issued pursuant to Sec. 216.106 and subject to the

    (b) If the National Marine Fisheries Service determines that an 
emergency exists that poses a significant risk to the well-being of the 
species or stocks of marine mammals specified in Sec. 216.151, or that 
significantly and detrimentally alters the scheduling of explosives 
detonation within the area specified in Sec. 216.151, the Letter of 
Authorization issued pursuant to Sec. 216.106, or renewed pursuant to 
this section may be substantively modified without prior notice and an

                         Subpart A--Introduction


<R05>
Sec. 220.1   General.

    Each person intending to engage in an activity for which a permit is 
required by parts 217 through 222 of this chapter or the Endangered 
Species Act of 1973 shall, before commencing such activity, obtain a 
valid permit authorizing such activity. Each person who desires to 
obtain the permit privileges authorized by parts 217 through 222 of this 
chapter must make application for such permit in accordance with the 
requirements of this part 220 of this chapter and the other regulations 
in parts 217 through 222 of this chapter which set forth the additional 
requirements for the specific permits desired. If the activity for which 
permission is sought is covered by the requirements of more than one 
part of parts 217 through 222 of this chapter, the requirements of each 
part must be met. If the information required for each specific 
permitted activity is included, one application may be accepted for all 
permits required, and a single permit may be issued.


<R05>
Sec. 220.2   Purpose of regulations.

    The regulations contained in this part will provide uniform rules 
and procedures for application, issuance, renewal, conditions, and 
general administration of permits issuable pursuant to parts 217 through 
222 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 220.3   Scope of regulations.

    The provisions in this part are in addition to, and are not in lieu 
of, other permit regulations of parts 217 through 222 of this chapter 
and apply to all permits issued thereunder, including ``Endangered Fish 
or Wildlife'' (part 222).


<R05>
Sec. 220.4   Emergency variation from requirements.

    The Director may approve variations from the requirements of this 
part when he finds that an emergency exists and that the proposed 
variations will not hinder effective administration of parts 217 through 
222 of this chapter, and will not be unlawful.


<R04>
                   Subpart B--Application for Permits


<R05>
Sec. 220.11   Procedure for obtaining a permit.

    The following general procedures apply to applications for permits:

[[Page 76]]

    (a) Forms. Applications must be submitted by letter containing all 
necessary information, attachments, certification, and signature. In no 
case will oral or telephone applications be accepted.
    (b) Forwarding instructions. Applications must be submitted to the 
Director, National Marine Fisheries Service. The address is listed in 
Sec. 217.21.
    (c) Time requirement. Applications must be received by the 
appropriate official of the National Marine Fisheries Service at least 
90 calendar days prior to the date on which the applicant desires to 
have the permit made effective. The National Marine Fisheries Service 
will, in all cases, attempt to process applications deemed sufficient in 
the shortest possible time. The National Marine Fisheries Service does 
not, however, guarantee 90 days issuance after publication in the 
Federal Register of receipt of a permit application and some permits 
cannot be issued within that time period.
Sec. 220.12  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 220.13   Abandoned application.

    Upon receipt of an insufficiently or improperly executed 
application, the applicant shall be notified of the deficiency in the 
application. If the applicant fails to supply the deficient information 
or otherwise fails to correct the deficiency within 60 days following 
the date of notification, the application shall be considered abandoned.


<R04>
                    Subpart C--Permit Administration


<R05>
Sec. 220.21   Issuance of permits.

    (a) No permit may be issued prior to the receipt of a written 
application therefor, unless a written variation from the requirements, 
as authorized by Sec. 220.4 is inserted into the official file of the 
National Marine Fisheries Service. Any representation of an employee or 
agent of the United States Government shall not be construed as a permit 
unless it meets the requirements of a permit as defined in 50 CFR 
217.12.
    (b) The Director shall issue the appropriate permit unless--
    (1) Denial of a permit has been made pursuant to subpart D of 15 CFR 
part 904;
    (2) The applicant has failed to disclose material information 
required, or has made false statements as to any material fact, in 
connection with his application;
    (3) The applicant has failed to demonstrate a valid justification 
for the permit or a showing of responsibility;
    (4) The authorization requested potentially threatens a wildlife 
population, or
    (5) The Director finds through further inquiry or investigation, or 
otherwise, that the applicant is not qualified.
    (c) Each permit shall bear a serial number. Such number may be 
reassigned to the permittee to whom issued so long as he maintains 
continuity of renewal.
    (d) The applicant shall be notified in writing of the denial of any 
permit request, and the reasons therefor. If authorized in the notice of 
denial, the applicant may submit further information, or reasons why the 
permit should not be denied. Such further submissions shall not be 
considered a new application. The final action by the Director shall be 
considered the final administrative decision of the Department.

permit, including conservation activities. In determining the duration 
of a permit, the Assistant Administrator will consider the duration of 
the proposed activities, as well as the possible positive and negative 
effects associated with issuing a permit of the proposed duration on 
listed species, including the extent to which the conservation plan is 
likely to enhance the habitat of the endangered species or increase the 
long-term survivability of the species.
    (f) Certificates of inclusion. (1) Any individual who wishes to 
conduct an activity covered by a general incidental take permit must 
apply to the Assistant Administrator for a certificate of inclusion. 
Each application must be signed and dated and include the following:
    (i) The general incidental take permit under which the applicant 
wants coverage.
    (ii) The name, address and telephone number of the applicant. If the

which the Director deems sufficient, he shall, as soon as practicable, 
publish a notice thereof in the Federal Register. Information received 
by the Director as a part of the application shall be available to the 
public as a matter of public record at every stage of the proceeding. An 
interested party may within 30 days after the date of publication of 
such notice, submit to the Director his written data, views, or 
arguments with respect to the taking, importation, or other action 
proposed in the application and may request a hearing in connection with 
the action to be taken thereon.
    (b) If a request for a hearing is made within the 30-day period 
referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, or if the Director 
determines that a hearing would otherwise be advisable, the Director 
may, within 60 days after the date of publication of the notice referred 
to in paragraph (a) of this section, afford to such requesting party or 
parties an opportunity for a hearing. Such hearing shall also be open to 
participation by any interested members of the public. Notice of the 
date, time, and place of such hearing shall be published in the Federal 
Register not less than 15 days in advance of such hearing. Any 
interested person may appear in person or through representatives at the

arguments, or exhibits. A summary record of the hearing shall be kept.
    (c) Except as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 904, as soon as 
practicable but not later than 30 days after the close of the hearing 
(or if no hearing is held, as soon as practicable after the end of the 
30 days succeeding publication of the notice referred to in paragraph 
(a) of this section) the Director shall issue or deny issuance of the 
permit. Notice of the decision of the Director shall be published in the 
Federal Register within 10 days after the date of the issuance or denial 
and indicate where copies of the permit, if issued, may be obtained.
    (d) If a permit is issued, the Director shall publish notice thereof 
in the Federal Register, including his finding that (1) such permit was 
applied for in good faith, (2) if granted and exercised will not operate 
to the disadvantage of such endangered species, and (3) will be 
consistent with the purposes and policy set forth in section 2 of the 
Endangered Species Act of 1973. The requirements of this paragraph 
pertain solely to the permits issued under Sec. 222.23.

adjacent riparian zone of specified lakes and river reaches in 
hydrologic units presently or historically accessible to listed Snake 
River salmon (except reaches above impassable natural falls, and 
Dworshak and Hells Canyon Dams). Adjacent riparian zones are defined as 
those areas within a horizontal distance of 300 feet (91.4 m) from the 
normal line of high water of a stream channel (600 feet or 182.8 m, when 
both sides of the stream channel are included) or from the shoreline of 
a standing body of water. Figure 5 identifies the general geographic 
extent of larger rivers, lakes, and streams within hydrologic units 
designated as critical habitat for Snake River sockeye, spring/summer 
chinook, and fall chinook salmon. Note that Figure 5 does not constitute 
the definition of critical habitat, but instead is provided as a general 
reference to guide Federal agencies and interested parties in locating 
the general boundaries of critical habitat for listed Snake River 
salmon. The complete text delineating critical habitat for each species 
follows. Hydrologic units (Table 3) are those defined by the Department 
of the Interior (DOI), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) publication,

                           Table 2 to Part 226

    Major Steller sea lion haulout sites in Alaska are identified in the 
following table. Where two sets of coordinates are given, the baseline 
extends in a clockwise direction from the first set of geographic 
coordinates along the shoreline at mean lower-low water to the second 
set of coordinates. Where only one set of coordinates is listed, that 
location is the basepoint.

    (4) Quota. If the Assistant Administrator determines and publishes 
notice that 675 Steller sea lions have been killed incidentally in the 
course of commercial fishing operations in Alaskan waters and adjacent 
areas of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) west of 141 deg. W 
longitude during any calendar year, then it will be unlawful to kill any 
additional Steller sea lions in this area. In order to monitor this 
quota, the Director, Alaska Region, National Marine Fisheries Service, 
may require the placement of an observer on any fishing vessel. If data 
indicate that the quota is being approached, the Assistant Administrator 
will issue emergency rules to establish closed areas, allocate the 
remaining quota among fisheries, or take other action(s) to ensure that 
commercial fishing operations do not exceed the quota.
    (b) Exceptions--(1) Permits. The Assistant Administrator may issue 
permits authorizing activities that would otherwise be prohibited under 
paragraph (a) of this section in accordance with and subject to the 
provisions of 50 CFR part 222, subpart C--Endangered Fish or Wildlife 
Permits.
    (2) Official activities. Paragraph (a) of this section does not 
prohibit or restrict a Federal, state or local government official, or 
his or her designee, who is acting in the course of official duties 
from:
    (i) Taking a Steller sea lion in a humane manner, if the taking is 
for the protection or welfare of the animal, the protection of the 
public health and welfare, or the nonlethal removal of nuisance animals; 
or
    (ii) Entering the buffer areas to perform activities that are 
necessary for national defense, or the performance of other legitimate 
governmental activities.
    (3) Subsistence takings by Alaska natives. Paragraph (a) of this 
section does not apply to the taking of Steller sea lions for 
subsistence purposes under section 10(e) of the Act.
    (4) Emergency situations. Paragraph (a)(2) of this section does not 
apply to an emergency situation in which compliance with that provision 
presents a threat to the health, safety, or life of a person or presents 
a significant threat to the vessel or property.
    (5) Exemptions. Paragraph (a)(2) of this section does not apply to 
any activity authorized by a prior written exemption from the Director, 
Alaska Region, National Marine Fisheries Service. Concurrently with the 
issuance of any exemption, the Assistant Administrator will publish 
notice of the exemption in the Federal Register. An exemption may be 
granted only if the activity will not have a significant adverse affect 
on Steller sea lions, the activity has been conducted historically or 
traditionally in the buffer zones, and there is no readily available and 
acceptable alternative to or site for the activity.
    (6) Navigational transit. Paragraph (a)(2) of this section does not 
prohibit a vessel in transit from passing through a strait, narrows, or 
passageway listed in this paragraph if the vessel proceeds in continuous 
transit and maintains a minimum of 1 nautical mile from the rookery 
site. The listing of a strait, narrows, or passageway does not indicate 
that the area is safe for navigation. The listed straits, narrows, or 
passageways include the following:

Sec. 227.72  Exceptions to prohibitions.

    (a) Scientific, propagation, or survival permits. (1) The Assistant 
Administrator may issue permits authorizing activities which would 
otherwise be prohibited under Sec. 227.71 for scientific purposes or to 
enhance the propagation or survival of such species. Applications for 
these permits are subject to the provisions of part 220 of this chapter 
II.
    (2) Ongoing scientific, propagation, or survival projects, which 
would otherwise be prohibited by Sec. 227.71 may continue without a 
permit until an application for a permit has been denied or 90 days from 
the effective date of the listing of the effected species, whichever 
comes first. If a permit has not been denied, ongoing projects may 
continue beyond this 90-day period provided that the individual 
responsible for such project(s) has applied for a permit and receives a 
letter from the Assistant Administrator stating that the application is 
complete and sufficient for processing within the 90-day period. 
Projects not receiving a permit or letter indicating sufficiency by the 
90th day must cease. Within 30 days of receipt of an application, the 
Assistant Administrator will determine the completeness and sufficiency 
of the application for processing. If an application is deemed complete 
and sufficient for processing, a permit will be issued or denied within 
the next 90 days beginning with the date of the letter informing the 
applicant that the application is sufficient. Approved projects shall 
continue in accordance with the conditions of the permit.
    (b) Permits for zoological exhibition or educational purposes. The 
Assistant Administrator may issue permits authorizing activities which 
would be otherwise prohibited under Sec. 227.71 for zoological 
exhibition or educational purposes. Applications for these permits are 
subject to the provisions of part 220 of this chapter II.
    (c) Exceptions for injured, dead, or stranded specimens. If any 
member of any threatened species listed in Sec. 227.4 is found injured, 
dead, or stranded, any agent or employee of the National Marine 
Fisheries Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Coast Guard, 
or any other Federal land or water management agency, or any agent or 
employee of a State agency responsible for fish and wildlife who is 
designated by his or her agency for such purposes, may, when acting in 
the course of his or her official duties, take such specimens without a 
permit if such taking is necessary to aid a sick, injured, or stranded 
specimen or dispose of a dead specimen or salvage a dead specimen which 
may be useful for scientific study. Wherever possible, live specimens 
shall be returned to their aquatic environment as soon as possible. 
Every action shall be reported in writing to the Assistant Administrator 
within 30 days, and reports of further occurrence shall be made as 
deemed appropriate by the Assistant Administrator until the specimen is 
either returned to its environment or disposed of. Reports shall be 
mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the 
Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, National Marine Fisheries 
Service, Washington, DC 20235, and shall contain the following 
information:
    (1) Name and position of the official or employee involved;
    (2) Description of the specimen(s) involved;
    (3) Date and location of disposal;
    (4) Circumstances requiring the action;
    (5) Method of disposal;
    (6) Disposition of the specimen(s), including, where the specimen(s) 
has been retained in captivity, a description of the place and means of 
confinement, and the measures taken for its maintenance and care; and

[[Page 160]]

    (7) Such other information as the Assistant Administrator may 
require.
    (d) Exception for research or conservation. Any employee or agent of 
the National Marine Fisheries Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, or 
a State fish and wildlife agency operating a conservation program 
pursuant to the terms of a Cooperative Agreement with the National 
Marine Fisheries Service or the Fish and Wildlife Service in accordance 
with section 6(c) of the Act, designated by his or her agency for such 
purposes, may, when acting in the course of his or her official duties, 
take any threatened species to carry out scientific research or 
conservation programs. All such takings shall be reported within 30 days 
of the taking to the Assistant Administrator who may request additional 
reports of the taking and research at his discretion.
    (e) Exception for incidental taking-- (1) General. The prohibitions 
against taking in Sec. 227.71(a) do not apply to the incidental take of 
any member of any species of sea turtle listed in Sec. 227.4 (i.e., a 
take not directed toward such member) during fishing or scientific 
research activities, to the extent that those involved are in compliance 
with the requirements of paragraphs (e)(1), (2), (3), and (6) of this 
section, or in compliance with the terms and conditions of an incidental 
take permit issued pursuant to paragraph (e)(7) of this section.
    (i) Any specimen so taken must be handled with due care to prevent 
injury to live specimens, observed for activity, and returned to the 
water according to the following procedures:
    (A) Sea turtles that are dead or actively moving must be released 
over the stern of the boat. In addition, they must be released only when 
trawls are not in use, when the engine gears are in neutral position, 
and in areas where they are unlikely to be recaptured or injured by 
vessels.
    (B) Resuscitation must be attempted on sea turtles that are comatose 
or inactive but not dead by:
    (1) Placing the turtle on its back (carapace) and pumping its 
breastplate (plastron) with hand or foot; or
    (2) Placing the turtle on its breastplate (plastron) and elevating 
its hindquarter several inches for a period of 1 up to 24 hours. The 
amount of the elevation depends on the size of the turtle; greater 
elevations are needed for larger turtles. Sea turtles being resuscitated 
must be shaded and kept wet or moist. Those that revive and become 
active must be released over the stern of the boat only when trawls are 
not in use, when the engine gears are in neutral position, and in areas 
where they are unlikely to be recaptured or injured by vessels. 
Similarly, sea turtles that fail to move within several hours (up to 24, 
if possible) must be returned to the water in the same manner.
    (ii) Any specimen so taken must not be consumed, sold, landed, 
offloaded, transshipped, or kept below deck.
    (2) Gear requirements--(i) TED requirement. Except as provided in 
paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, any shrimp trawler that is in the 
Atlantic Area or Gulf Area must have an approved TED (as defined in 
Sec. 217.12 of this subchapter) installed in each net that is rigged for 
fishing. A net is rigged for fishing if it is in the water, or if it is 
shackled, tied, or otherwise connected to any trawl door or board, or to 
any tow rope, cable, pole or extension, either on board or attached in 
any manner to the shrimp trawler.
    (ii) Exemptions from the TED requirement. (A) A shrimp trawler is 
exempt from the TED requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section 
if it complies with the alternative tow-time restrictions in paragraph 
(e)(3)(i) of this section and if it:
    (1) Has on board no power or mechanical-advantage trawl retrieval 
system (i.e., any device used to haul any part of the net aboard);
    (2) Is a bait shrimper that retains all live shrimp on board in a 
container with a circulating seawater system, if it does not possess 
more than 32 pounds (14.5 kg) of dead shrimp on board, and if it has on 
board a valid original state bait-shrimp license (if in a state that 
requires such a license);
    (3) Has only a pusher-head trawl, skimmer trawl, or wing net rigged 
for fishing;
    (4) Is in an area during a period for which tow-time restrictions 
apply under paragraphs (e)(3)(ii) or (iii) of

[[Page 161]]

this section, if it complies with all applicable provisions imposed 
under those paragraphs;
    (5) Prior to December 1, 1994, is in inshore waters, if it has no 
more than one net rigged for fishing (other than a test (or try) net), 
if that net has both a headrope length of less than 35 feet (10.7 m) and 
a footrope length of less than 44 feet (13.4 m).
    (B) The following fishing gear or activities are exempted from the 
TED requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section:
    (1) A single test net (try net) with a headrope length of 20 feet 
(6.1 m) or less, if it is either pulled immediately in front of another 
net or is not connected to another net in any way, if no more than one 
test net is used at a time, and if it is not towed as a primary net;
    (2) A beam or roller trawl fished without doors, boards, or similar 
devices, that has a mouth formed by a rigid frame and rigid vertical 
bars, if none of the spaces between the bars, or between the bars and 
the frame, exceed 4 inches (10.2 cm); and
    (3) A shrimp trawler fishing for, or possessing, royal red shrimp, 
if at least 90 percent (by weight) of all shrimp either found on board, 
or offloaded from that shrimp trawler, is royal red shrimp.
    (iii) Gear requirement--summer flounder trawlers--(A) TED 
requirement. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(B) of this 
section, any summer flounder trawler in the summer flounder fishery-sea 
turtle protection area must have an approved TED (as defined in 
Sec. 217.12 of this chapter) installed in each net that is rigged for 
fishing. A net is rigged for fishing if it is in the water, or if it is 
shackled, tied, or otherwise connected to any trawl door or board, or to 
any tow rope, cable, pole or extension, either on board or attached in 
any manner to the summer flounder trawler.
    (B) Exemptions from the TED requirement. Any summer flounder trawler 
north of 35 deg.46.1' N. lat. (Oregon Inlet, NC) from January 15 through 
March 15 annually is exempt from the TED requirement of paragraph 
(e)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, unless the Assistant Administrator 
determines that TED use is necessary to protect sea turtles or ensure 
compliance, pursuant to the procedures of paragraph (e)(6) of this 
section.
    (C) Monitoring. Summer flounder trawlers must carry onboard a NMFS-
approved observer if requested upon written notification from the 
Director, Southeast Region, NMFS, or the Director, Northeast Region, 
NMFS, sent to the address specified for the vessel in either the NMFS or 
state fishing permit application, or to the address specified for 
registration or documentation purposes, or upon written notification 
otherwise served on the owner or operator of the vessel. Owners and 
operators must comply with the terms and conditions specified in such 
written notification. All NMFS-approved observers will report any 
violations of this section, or other applicable regulations and laws; 
such information may be used for enforcement purposes.
    (D) Additional sea turtle conservation measures. The Assistant 
Administrator may impose other such restrictions upon summer flounder 
trawlers as he or she deems necessary or appropriate to protect sea 
turtles and ensure compliance, pursuant to the procedures of paragraph 
(e)(6) of this section. Such measures may include, but are not limited 
to, a requirement to use TEDs in areas other than summer flounder 
fishery-sea turtle protection area, a requirement to use limited tow-
times, and closure of the fishery.
    (iv) Gear requirement--leatherback conservation zone--(A) 
Leatherback surveys. From January 1 through June 30 of each year, weekly 
aerial surveys will be conducted (contingent upon weather conditions) by 
NMFS or state agents in the leatherback conservation zone (defined in 
Sec. 217.12 of this chapter). If sighting rates of greater than 10 
leatherback turtles per 50 nautical miles (92.6 km) of trackline are 
observed, the aerial surveys of that area will be replicated within 24 
hours, or as soon as practicable thereafter.
    (B) TED requirements and registration. If surveys pursuant to 
(e)(2)(iv)(A) of this section indicate a sighting rate within the 
leatherback conservation zone of greater than 10 leatherback sea turtles 
per 50 nautical miles (92.6 km) of trackline, NMFS will close, for a 2-

[[Page 162]]

week period, an area of the leatherback conservation zone encompassing 
all, or a portion of, inshore waters and offshore waters 10 nautical 
miles (18.5 km) seaward of the COLREGS demarcation line, bounded by 
1 deg. lat. coinciding with the trackline, within the leatherback 
conservation zone. Within such closed area, fishing by any shrimp 
trawler required to have a NMFS-approved TED installed in each net 
rigged for fishing is prohibited, unless the TED installed is one 
described at paragraph (e)(4)(i)(G)(2)(ii) or paragraph (e)(4)(iii)(E) 
of this section, and the owner or operator of the shrimp trawler has 
notified the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director) of his 
or her intention to fish in that area, in accordance with the procedure 
provided in paragraphs (e)(6)(iv) (A) through (F) of this section. If 
requested in writing from the Regional Director, owners and operators of 
shrimp trawlers in the leatherback conservation zone must carry NMFS-
approved observers aboard such vessel(s). A shrimp trawler in the 
leatherback conservation zone must comply with the terms and conditions 
specified in such written request, as well as provide information on 
trawling hours, gear modifications, and turtle captures.
    (C) Notification. NMFS will immediately announce specific area 
closures on the NOAA weather radio channel, in newspapers, and other 
media. Specific area closures will be effective upon filing for public 
inspection at the Office of the Federal Register. Owners and operators 
of shrimp trawl vessels in the leatherback conservation zone are 
responsible for monitoring the NOAA weather radio channel for closure 
announcements. Shrimp trawlers may also call the Southeast Regional 
Office at (813) 570-5312 to receive updated area closure information.
    (3) Tow-time restrictions--(i) Duration of tows. If tow-time 
restrictions are utilized pursuant to paragraphs (e)(2)(ii), (e)(3)(ii), 
or (e)(3)(iii) of this section, a shrimp trawler must limit tow times to 
no more than 55 minutes from April 1 through October 31; and to no more 
than 75 minutes from November 1 through March 31. A shrimp trawler in 
the North Carolina restricted area must limit tow times to no more than 
30 minutes from May 16 through August 15. The tow time is measured from 
the time that the trawl door enters the water until it is removed from 
the water. For a trawl that is not attached to a door, the tow time is 
measured from the time the codend enters the water until it is removed 
from the water.
    (ii) Alternative--special environmental conditions. (A) The 
Assistant Administrator may allow compliance with tow-time restrictions, 
as an alternative to the TED requirement of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this 
section, if he/she determines that the presence of algae, seaweed, 
debris or other special environmental conditions in a particular area 
makes trawling with TED-equipped nets impracticable.
    (B) North Carolina restricted area. From June 27, 1994 through 
November 30, 1994, a shrimp trawler in the North Carolina restricted 
area, as an alternative to complying with the TED requirement of 
paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, may comply with the tow-time 
restrictions set forth in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. The owner 
or operator of a shrimp trawler who wishes to operate his or her shrimp 
trawler in the North Carolina restricted area must register pursuant to 
paragraph (e)(3)(v) of this section, with registration received by the 
Director, Southeast Region, NMFS, at least 24 hours before the first use 
of such tow times. Registration may be made by telephoning (813) 893-
3141 or writing to 9721 Executive Center Drive, St. Petersburg, FL 
33702. The owner or operator of a shrimp trawler in the North Carolina 
restricted area must carry onboard a NMFS-approved observer upon written 
notification by the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS. Notification shall 
be made to the address specified for the vessel in either the NMFS or 
state fishing permit application, the registration or documentation 
papers, or otherwise served upon the owner or operator of the vessel. 
The owner or operator must comply with the terms and conditions 
specified in such written notification. All observers will report any 
violations of this section, or other applicable regulations and laws; 
such information may be used for enforcement purposes.

[[Page 163]]

    (iii) Substitute--ineffectiveness of TEDs. The Assistant 
Administrator may require compliance with tow-time restrictions, as a 
substitute for the TED requirement of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this 
section, if he/she determines that TEDs are ineffective in protecting 
sea turtles.
    (iv) Notice; applicability; conditions. The Assistant Administrator 
will publish notification concerning any tow-time restriction imposed 
under paragraphs (e)(3) (ii) or (iii) of this section in the Federal 
Register and will announce it in summary form on channel 16 of the 
marine VHF radio. A notification of tow-time restrictions will include 
findings in support of these restrictions as an alternative to, or as 
substitute for, the TED requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this 
section. The notification will specify the effective dates, the 
geographic area where tow-time restrictions apply, and any applicable 
conditions or restrictions that the Assistant Administrator determines 
are necessary or appropriate to protect sea turtles and ensure 
compliance, including, but not limited to, a requirement to carry 
observers, or for all shrimp trawlers in the area to synchronize their 
tow times so that all trawl gear remains out of the water during certain 
times. A notification withdrawing tow-time restrictions will include 
findings in support of that action.
    (v) Registration. If the Assistant Administrator imposes 
restrictions under paragraph (e)(3) (ii) or (iii) of this section, he/
she may require the owner and operator of a shrimp trawler to register 
before entering an area where, and during the time when, the 
restrictions apply. If registration is required, the trawler's owner and 
operator must submit the following information to the NMFS Regional 
Office:
    (A) The name and official number (or registration number) of the 
shrimp trawler;
    (B) The names, mailing and street addresses, and telephone numbers 
of the trawler owner and operator;
    (C) The permit number or other identification of relevant state or 
Federal fishing permit(s);
    (D) Where and when the trawler intends to fish;
    (E) Where and when the trawler will depart on any fishing trip, with 
sufficient specificity to allow for an observer to embark on the trip; 
and
    (F) Any changes in the information submitted under paragraphs 
(e)(3)(v) (A) through (E) of this section. Failure to do so immediately 
will void the registration, which will render unlawful any subsequent 
entry of the shrimp trawler into the area where and during the time when 
the restrictions apply.
    (vi) Procedures. The Assistant Administrator will consult with the 
appropriate fishery officials (state or Federal) where the affected 
shrimp fishery is located in issuing a notification concerning tow-time 
restrictions. An emergency notification can be effective for a period of 
up to 30 days and may be renewed for additional periods of up to 30 days 
each if the Assistant Administrator finds that the conditions that 
necessitated the imposition of tow-time restrictions continue to exist. 
The Assistant Administrator may invite comments on such an action, and 
may withdraw or modify the action by following procedures similar to 
those for implementation. The Assistant Administrator will implement any 
permanent tow-time restriction through rulemaking.
    (4) Approved TEDs. Any netting, webbing, or mesh that may be 
measured to determine compliance with this paragraph (e)(4) is subject 
to measurement, regardless of whether it is wet or dry. Any such 
measurement will be of the stretched mesh size.
    (i) Hard TEDs. Hard TEDs are TEDs with rigid deflector grids and are 
categorized as ``hooped hard TEDs,'' such as the NMFS and Cameron TEDs 
(Figures 1 & 2), or ``single-grid hard TEDs,'' such as the Matagorda and 
Georgia TEDs (Figures 3 & 4). Hard TEDs complying with the following 
generic design criteria are approved TEDs:
    (A) Construction materials. A hard TED must be constructed of one or 
a combination of the following materials, with minimum dimensions as 
follows:
    (1) Solid steel rod with a minimum outside diameter of \1/4\ inch 
(0.64 cm);
    (2) Fiberglass or aluminum rod with a minimum outside diameter of 
\1/2\ inch (1.27 cm); or

[[Page 164]]

    (3) Steel or aluminum tubing with a minimum outside diameter of 1/2 
inch (1.27 cm) and a minimum wall thickness of 1/8 inch (0.32 cm) (also 
known as schedule 40 tubing).
    (B) Method of attachment. A hard TED must be sewn into the trawl 
around the entire circumference of the TED with heavy twine.
    (C) Angle of deflector bars. The angle of the deflector bars must be 
between 30 deg. and 55 deg. from the normal, horizontal flow through the 
interior of the trawl.
    (D) Space between bars. The space between deflector bars, and 
between the deflector bars and the frame, must not exceed 4 inches (10.2 
cm).
    (E) Direction of bars. The deflector bars must run from top to 
bottom of the TED, as the TED is positioned in the net, except that up 
to four of the bottom bars and two of the top bars, including the frame, 
may run from side to side of the TED.
    (F) Position of escape opening. The entire width of the escape 
opening from the trawl must be centered on and immediately forward of 
the frame at either the top or bottom of the net when the net is in its 
deployed position. The escape opening must be at the top of the net when 
the slope of the deflector bars from forward to aft is upward, and must 
be at the bottom when such slope is downward. For a single-grid TED, the 
escape opening must be cut horizontally along the same plane as the TED, 
and may not be cut in a fore-and-aft direction.
    (G) Size of escape opening. (1) On a hooped hard TED, the escape 
opening must not be smaller than 25 inches by 25 inches (63.5 cm by 63.5 
cm) in the Gulf Area, or 30 inches by 30 inches (76.2 cm by 76.2 cm) in 
the Atlantic Area. A door frame may not be used over the escape opening; 
however, a webbing flap may be used as provided in paragraph 
(e)(4)(iv)(C) of this section.
    (2)(i) On a single-grid hard TED, the cut in the trawl webbing for 
the escape opening cannot be narrower than the outside width of the grid 
minus 4 inches (10.2 cm) on both sides of the grid, when measured as a 
straight line width. (Figure 13 of this part illustrates the dimensions 
of this cut.) The resulting escape opening in the net webbing must 
measure at least 32 inches (81.3 cm) in horizontal taut length and, 
simultaneously, 10 inches (25.4 cm) in vertical taut height in the Gulf 
Area; or 35 inches (88.9 cm) in horizontal taut length and, 
simultaneously, 12 inches (30.5 cm) in vertical taut height in the 
Atlantic Area. The vertical measurement must be taken at the midpoint of 
the horizontal measurement.
    (ii) Escape opening for leatherback turtles. A single-grid hard TED 
escape opening shall be enlarged to allow leatherback turtles to escape 
by cutting an exit hole in the extension forward of the TED frame 26 
inches (66 cm) deep, on each side, by 83 inches (211 cm) across (Figures 
12a and 12b of this part). Excess webbing is removed by cutting across 
\1/2\ mesh forward of the TED frame. The exit hole cover is made by 
cutting a 133-inch (338-cm) by 58-inch (148 cm) piece of webbing no 
smaller than 1\1/2\ inch (4 cm) stretch mesh and no larger than 1\5/8\ 
inch (4.2 cm) stretch mesh. The 133-inch (338 cm) edge of the cover is 
attached to the forward edge of the opening (83-inch (211-cm) edge) with 
a sewing sequence of 3:2. The cover should overlap 5 inches (13 cm) of 
the exit hole on each side. The side of the cover is attached, 
maintaining the 5-inch (13-cm) overlap, to the side of the opening by 
sewing 28 inches (71 cm) of the cover to 26 inches (66 cm) of the 
opening forward of the TED frame and by sewing 15 inches (38 cm) of the 
cover to 15 inches (38 cm) of the extension behind the TED frame. The 
cover may extend no more than 24 inches (61 cm) behind the posterior 
edge of the TED frame. The circumference of the exit opening must be 142 
inches (361 cm) when stretched. If an accelerator funnel is used with a 
single-grid hard TED, modified as above, it must also have a minimum 
circumference of 142 inches (361 cm).
    (H) Size of hoop or grid-- (1) Hooped hard TED. (i) An oval front 
hoop on a hard TED must have an inside horizontal measurement of at 
least 32 inches (81.3 cm) and an inside vertical measurement of at least 
20 inches (50.8 cm) in the Gulf Area, or an inside horizontal 
measurement of at least 35 inches (88.9 cm) and an inside vertical

[[Page 165]]

measurement of at least 30 inches (76.2 cm) in the Atlantic Area.
    (ii) A circular front hoop on a hard TED must have an inside 
diameter of at least 32 inches (81.3 cm) in the Gulf Area or 35 inches 
(88.9 cm) in the Atlantic Area.
    (2) Single-grid hard TED. A single-grid hard TED must have an inside 
horizontal and vertical measurement of at least 28 inches (71.1 cm) in 
the Gulf Area or 30 inches (76.2 cm) in the Atlantic Area. The required 
inside measurements must be at the mid-point of the deflector grid.
    (I) Flotation. Floats must be attached to the top one-half of all 
hard TEDs with bottom escape openings. The floats may be attached either 
outside or inside the net, but not to a flap. Floats attached inside the 
net must be behind the rear surface. Floats must be attached with heavy 
twine or rope. Floats must be constructed of aluminum, hard plastic, 
expanded polyvinyl chloride, or expanded ethylene vinyl acetate unless 
otherwise specified. The requirements of this paragraph may be satisfied 
by compliance with either the dimension requirements of paragraph 
(e)(4)(i)(I)(1) of this section, or the buoyancy requirements of 
paragraph (e)(4)(i)(I)(2) of this section, or the buoyancy-dimension 
requirements of paragraph (e)(4)(i)(I)(3) of this section. If roller 
gear is used pursuant to paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(E), the roller gear must 
be included in the circumference measurement of the TED or the total 
weight of the TED.
    (1) Float dimension requirements. (i) For hard TEDs with a 
circumference of 120 inches (304.8 cm) or more, a minimum of either one 
round, aluminum or hard plastic float, no smaller than 9.8 inches (25.0 
cm) in diameter, or two expanded polyvinyl chloride or expanded ethylene 
vinyl acetate floats, each no smaller than 6.75 inches (17.2 cm) in 
diameter by 8.75 inches (22.2 cm) in length, must be attached.
    (ii) For hard TEDs with a circumference of less than 120 inches 
(304.8 cm), a minimum of either one round, aluminum or hard plastic 
float, no smaller than 9.8 inches (25.0 cm) in diameter, or one expanded 
polyvinyl chloride or expanded ethylene vinyl acetate float, no smaller 
than 6.75 inches (17.2 cm) in diameter by 8.75 inches (22.2 cm) in 
length, must be attached.
    (2) Float buoyancy requirements. Floats of any size and in any 
combination must be attached such that the combined buoyancy of the 
floats, as marked on the floats, equals or exceeds the weight of the 
hard TED, as marked on the TED. The buoyancy of the floats and the 
weight of the TED must be clearly marked on the floats and the TED as 
follows:
    (i) Float buoyancy markings. Marking must be made in clearly legible 
raised or recessed lettering by the original manufacturer. The marking 
must identify the buoyancy of the float in water, expressed in grams or 
kilograms, and must include the metric unit of measure. The marking may 
additionally include the buoyancy in English units. The marking must 
identify the nominal buoyancy for the manufactured float.
    (ii) TED weight markings. The marking must be made by a registered 
TED manufacturer and must be permanent and clearly legible and must be 
accompanied by the identifying symbol of the registered manufacturer. 
The marking must identify the in-air, dry weight of the TED, expressed 
in grams or kilograms, and must include the metric unit of measure. The 
marking may additionally include the weight in English units. The marked 
weight must represent the actual weight of the individual TED as 
manufactured. Previously manufactured TEDs may be marked upon return to 
a registered TED manufacturer. Where a TED is comprised of multiple 
detachable components, the weight of each component must be separately 
marked. A TED manufacturer may become registered to mark TEDs by 
requesting registration in writing from the NMFS Southeast Regional 
Director. To request registration, the manufacturer should write to the 
Director, Southeast Region, NMFS, 9721 Executive Center Dr. North, St. 
Petersburg, FL 33702, and include the manufacturer's name, address, and 
telephone number; the sizes, styles, and anticipated number of TEDs to 
be produced annually; the method of marking; and a description of the 
manufacturer's distinctive, identifying

[[Page 166]]

symbol. Upon receipt of a complete request, the Director, Southeast 
Region, NMFS, will notify the manufacturer in writing of their 
registration.
    (3) Buoyancy-dimension requirements. Floats of any size and in any 
combination, provided that they are marked pursuant to paragraph 
(e)(4)(i)(I)(2)(i) of this section, must be attached such that the 
combined buoyancy of the floats equals or exceeds the following values:
    (i) For floats constructed of aluminum or hard plastic, regardless 
of the size of the TED grid, the combined buoyancy must equal or exceed 
14 lb (6.4 kg);
    (ii) For floats constructed of expanded polyvinyl chloride or 
expanded ethylene vinyl acetate, where the circumference of the TED is 
120 inches (304.8 cm) or more, the combined buoyancy must equal or 
exceed 20 lb (9.1 kg); or
    (iii) For floats constructed of expanded polyvinyl chloride or 
expanded ethylene vinyl acetate, where the circumference of the TED is 
less than 120 inches (304.8 cm), the combined buoyancy must equal or 
exceed 10 lb (4.5 kg).
    (ii) Special Hard TEDs. Special hard TEDs are hard TEDs which do not 
meet all of the design and construction criteria of the generic 
standards. The following special hard TEDs are approved TEDs:
    (A) Flounder TED (Figure 10 of this part). The Flounder TED must be 
constructed of at least 1 1/4 inch (3.2 cm) outside diameter aluminum or 
steel pipe with a wall thickness of at least 1/8 inch (0.3 cm). It must 
have a rectangular frame with outside dimensions which can be no less 
than 51 inches (129.5 cm) in length and 32 inches (81.3 cm) in width. It 
must have at least five vertical deflector bars, with bar spacings of no 
more than 4 inches (10.2 cm). The vertical bars must be connected to the 
top of the frame and to a single horizontal bar near the bottom. The 
horizontal bar must be connected at both ends to the sides of the frame 
and parallel to the bottom bar of the frame. There must be a space no 
larger than 10 inches (25.4 cm) between the horizontal bar and the 
bottom bar of the frame. An additional vertical bar runs from the middle 
of the bottom bar to the middle of the horizontal bar dividing the 
opening at the bottom into two rectangles with an opening height of no 
more than 10 inches (25.4 cm) and an opening width of no more than 14 1/
2 inches (36.8 cm). If, because of the width of the TED, the opening 
width of the bottom rectangles exceeds the maximum allowed, additional 
vertical bars must be added. This TED must comply with paragraphs 
(e)(4)(i)(B), (e)(4)(i)(C), (e)(4)(i)(F), and (e)(4)(i)(G) of this 
section with respect to the method of attachment, the angle of the 
deflector bars, the position of the escape opening, and the size of the 
escape opening, except that the deflector bars must be positioned in the 
net to deflect turtles to the escape opening in the top of the trawl. 
This TED may not be configured with a bottom escape opening. 
Installation of an accelerator funnel is not permitted with this TED. 
Use of this TED is restricted to the Atlantic summer flounder bottom 
trawl fishery.
    (B) Jones TED (Figure 11 of this part). The Jones TED must be 
constructed of at least 1 1/4 inch (3.2 cm) outside diameter aluminum or 
steel pipe, and the pipe must have a wall thickness of at least 1/8 inch 
(0.3 cm). It must be generally oval in shape with a flattened bottom. 
The deflector bars must be attached to the frame at a 45 deg. angle from 
the horizontal positioning downward and each bar must be attached at 
only one end to the frame. The deflector bars must be attached and lie 
in the same plane as the frame. The space between the ends of the bottom 
deflector bars and the bottom frame bar must be no more than 3 inches 
(7.6 cm). The spacing between the bottom three deflector bars on each 
side must be no greater than 2 1/2 inches (6.4 cm). The spacing between 
all other deflector bars must not exceed 3 1/2 inches (8.9 cm) and 
spacing between ends of opposing deflector bars also must not exceed 3 
1/2 inches (8.9 cm). This TED must comply with paragraphs (e)(4)(i)(B), 
(e)(4)(i)(C), (e)(4)(i)(F), (e)(4)(i)(G), (e)(4)(i)(H)(2), and 
(e)(4)(i)(I) of this section with respect to the method of attachment, 
the angle of the deflector bars, the position of the escape opening, the 
size of the escape opening, the size of the grid, and flotation.

    (iii) Soft TEDS. Soft TEDs are TEDs with deflector panels made from 
polypropylene or polyethylene netting. The following soft TEDs are 
approved TEDs:
    (A) Morrison TED (Figures 5 & 6)-- (1) Description. The Morrison TED 
uses synthetic mesh webbing for its deflector panel(s). The webbing must 
consist of number 42 (3-mm thick) or larger polypropylene or 
polyethylene webbing that is heat-set knotted or braided. The stretched 
mesh size may not exceed 8 inches (20.3 cm). The webbing may be 
installed either as one main excluder panel or as a main and two side 
(jib) excluder panels (Figure 6), so long as it forms a complete barrier 
to large objects inside the trawl net forward of the codend. The base 
(leading edge) of the excluder panel(s) must be sewn to the bottom body 
of the trawl net at least 16 feet 8 inches (5.1 m) forward of the point 
at which the codend is attached to the trawl net. The apex of the 
excluder panel(s) must be sewn to the center of the top body of the 
trawl net not more than 20 inches (50.8 cm) forward of the point at 
which the codend is attached to the trawl net. The meshes of the leading 
edge of the excluder panel shall be sewn evenly onto the bottom belly of 
the trawl following the same row of meshes from seam to seam, including 
the wings (i.e., the sides of the trawl that separate the top from the 
bottom). The leading edge of the panel cannot be installed on a bias. If 
a net extension is inserted forward of the codend, the base and apex 
attachments of the excluder panel(s) must be measured from the forward 
attachment points of such extension. The horizontal taut length of the 
stretched main excluder panel may not be less than 15 feet (4.6 m). Each 
point on the circumference of the webbing must be sewn to the trawl net. 
The meshes of the webbing must be under tension when the codend is 
pulled aft, thus forming diamond patterns pointing toward the top of the 
trawl net. As an escape opening, a slit at least 4 feet 8 inches (1.4 m) 
in taut length must be cut in a fore-and-aft direction at the top of the 
trawl net immediately forward of the apex of the panel webbing. The slit 
may not be covered or closed in any manner.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (B) Parrish TED (Figure 7). The Parrish TED consists of an extension 
and deflector panel made of synthetic mesh and a steel frame. The 
extension must be a piece of 1\3/4\-inch (4.4-cm) stretched mesh, no. 15 
thread, treated nylon, measuring 150 meshes by 100 meshes and installed 
in the trawl. When installed, the extension must be cylindrically shaped 
with a circumference of 150 meshes and a depth of 100 meshes. The 
deflector panel must slope down the inside of the extension and must be 
a rectangular piece of 8-inch (20.3-cm), stretched mesh, 3-mm diameter, 
braided polyethylene. The deflector panel must measure eight meshes 
across its leading and trailing edges and be 15\1/2\ meshes deep. The 
eight meshes at the leading edge of the deflector panel must be sewn 
into the small (1\3/4\-inch) (4.4-cm) mesh of the extension three meshes 
down from the top edge of the extension. The eight meshes at the 
trailing edge must be attached to the top edge of the frame. Each side 
edge of the deflector panel must be attached at 5\5/8\-inch (14.3-cm) 
intervals to a \3/8\-inch (1.0-cm) diameter, three-strand polydacron 
rope, which must be attached to the small mesh of the extension at 5\5/
8\-inch (14.3-cm) intervals. The deflector panel must form a complete 
barrier to large objects inside the extension forward of the frame. The 
frame must be a rectangular, \3/8\-inch (1.0-cm) diameter, welded 
galvanized steel rod unit with a 40-inch by 4-inch (101.6-cm by 10.2-cm) 
opening and small pad eyes at the top corners. The trailing-edge meshes 
of the deflector panel must be attached to the top of the frame, and 50 
lateral meshes of the extension netting (1\3/4\-inch (4.4.-cm) mesh) 
must be centered and sewn to the bottom and sides of the frame. The 
escape opening must consist of a lateral slit, measuring 40 meshes, cut 
from the leading edge at the bottom of the frame. A bungee cord having a 
50-inch (127.0-cm) non-stretched length and a \1/4\-inch (0.64-cm) 
diameter must be laced through the meshes at the cut. Opposing ends of 
the bungee cord must be secured to the opposing pad eyes at the top of 
the frame. One end of a flap measuring 50 meshes across by 30

[[Page 168]]

meshes deep must be attached to the meshes at the cut.
    (C) Andrews TED (Figures 8a and 8b of this part). The Andrews TED is 
a funnel constructed of 5-inch (12.7-cm) stretched mesh polyethylene or 
polypropylene webbing that is sewn inside a shrimp trawl. The bottom 
panel of the trawl may be used as the bottom panel of the funnel, so 
long as the bottom edges of the sides of the funnel are sewn at every 
mesh to the bottom panel of the trawl. The leading edge of the funnel 
must be sewn with heavy twine at all points to the outer trawl beginning 
on the row of meshes located 20 meshes behind the center of the footrope 
and continuing around the circumference of the trawl, following the same 
row of meshes. The webbing may not be laced with rope. The funnel must 
taper to an escape opening in the bottom of the trawl. The trailing edge 
on the funnel must be sewn at all points around the circumference of the 
escape opening. The escape opening must be at least 96 inches (243.8 cm) 
in circumference. A webbing flap may be used to cover the escape opening 
if no device holds the webbing flap closed or otherwise restricts the 
opening, and if such flap is constructed of webbing that has a stretched 
mesh size no larger than 2 inches (5.1 cm), lies on the outside of the 
trawl, is attached along its entire forward edge forward of the escape 
opening, is 50 meshes wide and 15 meshes deep, does not overlap the exit 
opening more than 5 meshes on each side (it may be attached along the 
15-mesh edge), and maintains an opening of at least 48 inches (121.9 cm) 
in a taut position.
    (D) Taylor TED (Figures 9a and 9b of this part). The Taylor TED is 
constructed of 6-inch (15.2-cm) polyethylene or polypropylene webbing 
that is heat-set knotted or braided. The Taylor TED deflector panel must 
be not less than 228 inches (580 cm) on the leading edge and not less 
than 120 inches (305 cm) long. The leading edge, sides, and apex of the 
deflector panel must be sewn to the trawl body so as to form a complete 
barrier to large objects inside the trawl net forward of the codend or 
extension. The apex may be removed not more than 24 inches (61 cm) 
forward of the rear point. If the apex is removed, a rectangular section 
24 inches (61 cm) long must be sewn evenly to the rear of the deflector 
panel to maintain the 120-inch (305-cm) length. The leading edge of the 
Taylor TED deflector panel must be sewn to the bottom body of the trawl 
net. The rear point of the deflector panel, or rear edge, if the apex is 
removed, must be sewn evenly, centered across the top body. An escape 
opening must be located on the top of the trawl body centered over the 
deflector panel. The opening must measure not less than 72 inches (183.6 
cm), must be in a single row of meshes, and must be located no farther 
forward than the point where its entire length is above the deflector 
panel--the forward edge of the opening must extend from the attachment 
of the deflector panel on one side of the body, across the top of the 
body, to the attachment of the deflector panel on the other side. All 
trawl webbing above the deflector panel between the 72-inch (183.6-cm) 
cut and the posterior edge of the deflector panel must be removed. A 
rectangular flap of nylon webbing not larger than 2-inch (5.1-cm) 
stretched mesh may be sewn to the forward edge of the escape opening. 
The width of the flap may not exceed the length of the forward edge of 
the triangular opening. The flap may extend not more than 12 inches 
(30.5 cm) beyond the rear point of the escape opening. The sides of the 
flap may be attached to the body, but may not be attached farther aft 
than the rear point of the escape opening. One row of chain not larger 
than 3/16 inch (4.76 mm) may be sewn evenly to the back edge of the 
flap. The stretched length of the chain may not exceed 84 inches (214.2 
cm).
    (E) Allowable modifications to soft TEDs. The following 
modifications may be made to the Morrison and Taylor TEDs to increase 
the size of the escape opening to permit the exclusion of leatherback 
turtles. An enlarged escape opening must be created on the top of the 
trawl body centered over the deflector panel. The opening must measure 
not less than 96 inches (244 cm), must be in a single row of meshes, and 
must be located no farther forward than the point where its entire 
length is above the deflector panel--the forward edge of the opening 
must extend

[[Page 169]]

from the attachment of the deflector panel on one side of the body, 
across the top of the body, to the attachment of the deflector panel on 
the other side. All trawl webbing above the deflector panel between the 
96-inch (244-cm) cut and the posterior edge of the deflector panel must 
be removed. A rectangular flap of nylon webbing not larger than 2-inch 
(5.1-cm) stretched mesh may be sewn to the forward edge of the escape 
opening. The width of the flap may not exceed the length of the forward 
edge of the triangular opening. The flap may extend not more than 12 
inches (30.4 cm) beyond the rear point of the escape opening. The sides 
of the flap may be attached to the body, but may not be attached farther 
aft than the rear point of the escape opening. One row of chain not 
larger than 3/16 inch (4.76 mm) may be sewn evenly to the back edge of 
the flap. The stretched length of the chain may not exceed 96 inches 
(244 cm). For the Morrison TED, the apex of the excluder panel may be 
removed no more than 48 inches (122 cm) forward of the rear edge. A 
rectangular section 48 inches (122 cm) long must then be sewn evenly to 
the rear of the excluder panel to maintain the length prescribed in the 
description of the Morrison TED. For the Morrison TED, the addition of a 
webbing flap and the modification of the excluder panel may only be done 
conjointly with the enlargement of the escape opening as described in 
this paragraph (e)(4)(iii)(E).
    (iv) Allowable modifications to TEDs. No modifications may be made 
to an approved soft TED, except for the modifications described in 
paragraph (e)(4)(iii)(E). Unless otherwise prohibited in paragraph 
(e)(4)(ii) of this section, only the following modifications may be made 
to an approved hard TED and an approved special hard TED:
    (A) Floats. In addition to floats required pursuant to paragraph 
(e)(4)(i)(I) of this section, floats may be attached to the top one-half 
of the TED, either outside or inside the net, but not to a flap. Floats 
attached inside the net must be behind the rear surface at the top of 
the TED.
    (B) Accelerator funnel. An accelerator funnel may be installed in 
the trawl, if it is made of net webbing material with a stretched mesh 
size not greater than 1 5/8 inches (4.1 cm), if it has an inside 
horizontal opening of at least 39 inches (99.1 cm) when measured in a 
taut position, if it is inserted in the net immediately forward of the 
TED, and if its rear edge does not extend past the bars of the TED. The 
trailing edge of the accelerator funnel may be attached to the TED on 
the side opposite the escape opening if not more than 1/3 of the 
circumference of the funnel is attached, and if the inside horizontal 
opening of at least 39 inches (99.1 cm) is maintained. In a downward 
shooting TED, only the top 1/3 of the circumference of the funnel may be 
attached to the TED. In an upward shooting TED, only the bottom 1/3 of 
the circumference of the funnel may be attached to the TED.
    (C) Webbing flap. A webbing flap may be used to cover the escape 
opening if no device holds it closed or otherwise restricts the opening, 
and if it is constructed of webbing with a stretched mesh size no larger 
than 1 5/8 inches (4.1 cm), lies on the outside of the trawl, is 
attached along its entire forward edge forward of the escape opening, is 
not attached on the sides beyond the row of meshes that lies 6 inches 
(15.2 cm) behind the posterior edge of the grid, and does not extend 
more than 24 inches (61.0 cm) beyond the posterior edge of the grid.
    (D) Chafing webbing. A single piece of nylon webbing, with a twine 
size no smaller than size 36 (2.46 mm in diameter), may be attached 
outside of the escape opening webbing flap to prevent chafing on bottom 
opening TEDs. This webbing may be attached along its leading edge only. 
This webbing may not extend beyond the trailing edge or sides of the 
existing escape opening webbing flap, and it must not interfere or 
otherwise restrict the turtle escape opening.
    (E) Roller gear. Roller gear may be attached to the bottom of a TED 
to prevent chafing on the bottom of the TED and the trawl net. When a 
webbing flap is used in conjunction with roller gear, the webbing flap 
must be of a length such that no part of the webbing flap can touch or 
come in contact with any part of the roller gear assembly or the means 
of attachment of the roller gear assembly to the TED, when the trawl

[[Page 170]]

net is in its normal, horizontal position. Roller gear must be 
constructed according to one of the following design criteria:
    (1) A single roller consisting of hard plastic shall be mounted on 
an axle rod, so that the roller can roll freely about the axle. The 
maximum diameter of the roller shall be 6 inches (15.24 cm), and the 
maximum width of the axle rod shall be 12 inches (30.4 cm). The axle rod 
must be attached to the TED by two support rods. The maximum clearance 
between the roller and the TED shall not exceed 1 inch (2.5 cm) at the 
center of the roller. The support rods and axle rod must be made from 
solid steel or solid aluminum rod no larger than 1/2 inch (1.28 cm) in 
diameter. The attachment of the support rods to the TED shall be such 
that there are no protrusions (lips, sharp edges, burrs, etc.) on the 
front face of the grid. The axle rod and support rods must lie entirely 
behind the plane of the face of the TED grid.
    (2) A single roller consisting of hard plastic tubing shall be 
tightly tied to the back face of the TED grid with rope or heavy twine 
passed through the center of the roller tubing. The roller shall lie 
flush against the TED. The maximum outside diameter of the roller shall 
be 3 1/2 inches (8.0 cm), the minimum outside diameter of the roller 
shall be 2 inches (5.1 cm), and the maximum length of the roller shall 
be 12 inches (30.4 cm). The roller must lie entirely behind the plane of 
the face of the grid.
    (5) Revision of generic design criteria, allowable modification of 
hard TEDs, additional soft TEDs and special hard TEDs. (i) The Assistant 
Administrator may revise the generic design criteria for hard TEDs set 
forth in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, may approve special hard 
TEDs in addition to those listed in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this 
section, may approve soft TEDs in addition to those listed in paragraph 
(e)(4)(iii) of this section, or may approve allowable modifications to 
hard TEDs in addition to those authorized in paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of 
this section, by a regulatory amendment, if, according to a NMFS-
approved scientific protocol, the TEDs demonstrate a sea turtle 
exclusion rate of 97 percent or greater (or an equivalent exclusion 
rate). Two such protocols have been published by NMFS (52 FR 24262, June 
29, 1987; and 55 FR 41092, October 9, 1990). Testing under the protocol 
must be conducted under the supervision of the Assistant Administrator, 
and shall be subject to all such conditions and restrictions as the 
Assistant Administrator deems appropriate. Any person wishing to 
participate in such testing should contact the Director, Southeast 
Fisheries Science Center, NMFS, 75 Virginia Beach Drive, Miami, FL 
33149.
    (ii) Upon application, the Assistant Administrator may issue 
permits, subject to such conditions and restrictions as the Assistant 
Administrator deems appropriate, authorizing public or private 
experimentation aimed at improving shrimp retention efficiency of 
existing approved TEDs and at developing additional TEDs, or conducting 
fishery research, that would otherwise be subject to paragraph (e)(2) of 
this section. Applications should be addressed to the Director, 
Southeast Region, NMFS, 9450 Koger Blvd., St. Petersburg, FL 33702.
    (6) Limitations on incidental takings during fishing activities.--
(i) Limitations. The exemption for incidental takings of sea turtles in 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section does not authorize incidental takings 
during fishing activities if the takings:
    (A) Would violate the restrictions, terms, or conditions of an 
incidental take statement or biological opinion;
    (B) Would violate the restrictions, terms, or conditions of an 
incidental take permit; or
    (C) May be likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a species 
listed under the Act.
    (ii) Determination; restrictions on fishing activities. The 
Assistant Administrator may issue a determination that incidental 
takings during fishing activities are unauthorized. Pursuant thereto, 
the Assistant Administrator may restrict fishing activities in order to 
conserve a species listed under the Act, including, but not limited to, 
restrictions on the fishing activities of vessels subject to paragraph 
(e)(2)(i) of this section. The Assistant Administrator will take such 
action if he/she

[[Page 171]]

determines that restrictions are necessary to avoid unauthorized takings 
that may be likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed 
species. The Assistant Administrator may withdraw or modify a 
determination concerning unauthorized takings or any restriction on 
fishing activities if the Assistant Administrator determines that such 
action is warranted.
    (iii) Notice; applicability; conditions. The Assistant Administrator 
will publish a notification of a determination concerning unauthorized 
takings or a notification concerning the restriction of fishing 
activities in the Federal Register. The Assistant Administrator will 
provide as much advance notice as possible, consistent with the 
requirements of the Act, and will announce the notification in summary 
form on channel 16 of the marine VHF radio. Notification of a 
determination concerning unauthorized takings will include findings in 
support of that determination; specify the fishery, including the target 
species and gear used by the fishery, the area, and the times, for which 
incidental takings are not authorized; and include such other conditions 
and restrictions as the Assistant Administrator determines are necessary 
or appropriate to protect sea turtles and ensure compliance. 
Notification of restriction of fishing activities will include findings 
in support of the restriction, will specify the time and area where the 
restriction is applicable, and will specify any applicable conditions or 
restrictions that the Assistant Administrator determines are necessary 
or appropriate to protect sea turtles and ensure compliance. Such 
conditions and restrictions may include, but are not limited to, 
limitations on the types of fishing gear that may be used, tow-time 
restrictions, alteration or extension of the periods of time during 
which particular tow-time requirements apply, requirements to use TEDs, 
and requirements to provide observers. Notification of withdrawal or 
modification will include findings in support of that action.
    (iv) Registration. If the Assistant Administrator imposes 
restrictions under paragraph (e)(6)(ii) of this section, he/she may 
require the owner and operator of a vessel to register before entering 
an area where, and during the time when, the restrictions apply. If 
registration is required, the vessel's owner and operator must submit 
the following information to the NMFS Regional Office:
    (A) The name and official number (or registration number) of the 
vessel;
    (B) The names, mailing and street addresses, and telephone numbers 
of the vessel owner and operator;
    (C) The permit number or other identification of relevant state or 
Federal fishing permit(s);
    (D) Where and when the vessel intends to fish; and
    (E) Where and when the vessel will depart on any fishing trip, with 
sufficient specificity to allow for an observer to embark on the trip.
    (F) Any changes in the information submitted under paragraphs 
(e)(6)(iv) (A) through (E) of this section. Failure to do so immediately 
will void the registration, which will render unlawful any subsequent 
entry of the fishing vessel into the area where and during the time when 
the restrictions apply.
    (v) Procedures. The Assistant Administrator will consult with the 
appropriate fisheries officials (state or Federal) where the fishing 
activities are located in issuing notification of a determination 
concerning unauthorized takings or notification concerning the 
restriction of fishing activities. An emergency notification will be 
effective for a period of up to 30 days and may be renewed for 
additional periods of up to 30 days each. The Assistant Administrator 
may invite comments on such action, and may withdraw or modify the 
action by following procedures similar to those for implementation. The 
Assistant Administrator will implement any permanent determination or 
restriction through rulemaking.
    (7) Incidental-take permits. The Assistant Administrator may issue 
permits authorizing activities that would otherwise be prohibited in 
Sec. 227.71(a) of this chapter in accordance with section 10(a)(1)(B) of 
the Act (16 U.S.C. 1539(a)(1)(B)), and in accordance with, and subject 
to, the provisions of parts 220 and 222 of this chapter. Such permits 
may be issued for the incidental

[[Page 172]]

taking of both endangered and threatened species of sea turtles. This 
section supersedes restrictions on the scope of parts 220 and 222, 
including, but not limited to, the restrictions specified in 
Secs. 220.3, 222.1, 222.2(a) and 222.22(a).
    (f) Subsistence. The prohibition in Sec. 227.71(b) shall not apply 
with respect to the taking of any member of the species of green sea 
turtle (Chelonia mydas) in waters seaward of mean low tide for personal 
consumption by residents of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands 
if such taking is customary, traditional and necessary for the 
sustenance of such resident and his immediate family. Sea turtles so 
taken cannot be transferred to non-residents or sold.

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 229.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The regulations in this part implement sections 101(a)(5)(E) and 
118 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended (16 U.S.C. 
1371(a)(5)(E) and 1387) that provide for exceptions for the taking of 
marine mammals incidental to certain commercial fishing operations from 
the Act's general moratorium on the taking of marine mammals.
    (b) Section 118 of the Act, rather than sections 103 and 104, 
governs the incidental taking of marine mammals in the course of 
commercial fishing operations by persons using vessels of the United 
States, other than vessels fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern 
tropical Pacific Ocean purse seine fishery, and vessels that have valid 
fishing permits issued in accordance with section 204(b) of the Magnuson 
Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1824(b)).
    (c) The regulations of Subpart B also govern the incidental taking 
by commercial fishers of marine mammals from species or stocks 
designated under the Act as depleted on the basis of their listing as 
threatened species or endangered species under the Endangered Species 
Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).
    (d) The regulations of this part do not apply to the incidental 
taking of California sea otters or to Northwest treaty Indian tribal 
members exercising treaty fishing rights.
    (e) Authorizations under subpart A of this part are exemptions only 
from the taking prohibitions under the Act and not those under the 
Endangered Species Act of 1973. To be exempt from the taking 
prohibitions under the Endangered Species Act, specific authorization 
under subpart B of this part is required.
    (f) Authorizations under this part do not apply to the intentional 
lethal taking of marine mammals in the course of commercial fishing 
operations.
    (g) The purposes of the regulations in this part are to: (1) Reduce 
the incidental mortality or serious injury of marine mammals occurring 
in the course of commercial fishing operations below the potential 
biological removal level for a particular stock, and
    (2) Reduce the incidental mortality or serious injury of marine 
mammals occurring in the course of commercial fishing operations to 
insignificant levels approaching a zero mortality and serious injury 
rate by the statutory deadline of April 30, 2001.


<R05>
Sec. 229.2  Definitions.

    In addition to the definitions contained in the Act and Sec. 216.3 
of this chapter, and unless the context otherwise requires, in this part 
229:
    Act or MMPA means the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as 
amended (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.).

[[Page 189]]

    Authorization Certificate means a document issued by the Assistant 
Administrator, or designee, under the authority of section 118 of the 
Act that authorizes the incidental, but not intentional, taking of 
marine mammals in Category I or II fisheries.
    Category I fishery means a commercial fishery determined by the 
Assistant Administrator to have frequent incidental mortality and 
serious injury of marine mammals. A commercial fishery that frequently 
causes mortality or serious injury of marine mammals is one that is by 
itself responsible for the annual removal of 50 percent or more of any 
stock's potential biological removal level.
    Category II fishery means a commercial fishery determined by the 
Assistant Administrator to have occasional incidental mortality and 
serious injury of marine mammals. A commercial fishery that occasionally 
causes mortality or serious injury of marine mammals is one that, 
collectively with other fisheries, is responsible for the annual removal 
of more than 10 percent of any marine mammal stock's potential 
biological removal level and that is by itself responsible for the 
annual removal of between 1 and 50 percent, exclusive, of any stock's 
potential biological removal level. In the absence of reliable 
information indicating the frequency of incidental mortality and serious 
injury of marine mammals by a commercial fishery, the Assistant 
Administrator will determine whether the taking is ``occasional'' by 
evaluating other factors such as fishing techniques, gear used, methods 
used to deter marine mammals, target species, seasons and areas fished, 
qualitative data from logbooks or fisher reports, stranding data, and 
the species and distribution of marine mammals in the area, or at the 
discretion of the Assistant Administrator. Eligible commercial fisheries 
not specifically identified in the list of fisheries are deemed to be 
Category II fisheries until the next list of fisheries is published.
    Category III fishery means a commercial fishery determined by the 
Assistant Administrator to have a remote likelihood of, or no known 
incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals. A commercial 
fishery that has a remote likelihood of causing incidental mortality and 
serious injury of marine mammals is one that collectively with other 
fisheries is responsible for the annual removal of:
    (1) Ten percent or less of any marine mammal stock's potential 
biological removal level, or
    (2) More than 10 percent of any marine mammal stock's potential 
biological removal level, yet that fishery by itself is responsible for 
the annual removal of 1 percent or less of that stock's potential 
biological removal level. In the absence of reliable information 
indicating the frequency of incidental mortality and serious injury of 
marine mammals by a commercial fishery, the Assistant Administrator will 
determine whether the taking is ``remote'' by evaluating other factors 
such as fishing techniques, gear used, methods used to deter marine 
mammals, target species, seasons and areas fished, qualitative data from 
logbooks or fisher reports, stranding data, and the species and 
distribution of marine mammals in the area or at the discretion of the 
Administrator.
    Commercial fishing operation means the catching, taking, or 
harvesting of fish from the marine environment (or other areas where 
marine mammals occur) that results in the sale or barter of all or part 
of the fish harvested. The term includes licensed commercial passenger 
fishing vessel (as defined in Sec. 216.3 of this chapter) activities and 
aquaculture activities.
    Depleted species means any species or population that has been 
designated as depleted under the Act and is listed in Sec. 216.15 of 
this chapter or part 18, subpart E of this title, or any endangered or 
threatened species of marine mammal.
    Fisher means the vessel owner or operator or owner or operator of 
gear in a nonvessel fishery.
    Fishery has the same meaning as in section 3 of the Magnuson Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1802).
    Fishing trip means any time spent away from port actively engaged in 
commercial fishing operations. The end of a fishing trip will be the 
time of a

[[Page 190]]

fishing vessel's return to port or the return of a fisher from tending 
gear in a nonvessel fishery.
    Fishing vessel or vessel means any vessel, boat, ship, or other 
craft that is used for, equipped to be used for, or of a type normally 
used for, fishing.
    Incidental, but not intentional, take means the non-intentional or 
accidental taking of a marine mammal that results from, but is not the 
purpose of, carrying out an otherwise lawful action.
    Incidental mortality means the non-intentional or accidental death 
of a marine mammal that results from, but is not the purpose of, 
carrying out an otherwise lawful action.
    Injury means a wound or other physical harm. Signs of injury to a 
marine mammal include, but are not limited to, visible blood flow, loss 
of or damage to an appendage or jaw, inability to use one or more 
appendages, asymmetry in the shape of the body or body position, 
noticeable swelling or hemorrhage, laceration, puncture or rupture of 
eyeball, listless appearance or inability to defend itself, inability to 
swim or dive upon release from fishing gear, or signs of equilibrium 
imbalance. Any animal that ingests fishing gear, or any animal that is 
released with fishing gear entangling, trailing or perforating any part 
of the body will be considered injured regardless of the absence of any 
wound or other evidence of an injury.
    Interaction means coming in contact with fishing gear or catch. An 
interaction may be characterized by a marine mammal entangled, hooked, 
or otherwise trapped in fishing gear, regardless of whether injury or 
mortality occurs, or situations where marine mammals are preying on 
catch. Catch means fish or shellfish that has been hooked, entangled, 
snagged, trapped or otherwise captured by commercial fishing gear.
    List of Fisheries means the most recent final list of commercial 
fisheries published in the Federal Register by the Assistant 
Administrator, categorized according to the likelihood of incidental 
mortality and serious injury of marine mammals during commercial fishing 
operations.
    Minimum population estimate means an estimate of the number of 
animals in a stock that:
    (1) Is based on the best available scientific information on 
abundance, incorporating the precision and variability associated with 
such information; and
    (2) Provides reasonable assurance that the stock size is equal to or 
greater than the estimate.
    Negligible impact has the same meaning as in Sec. 228.3 of this 
chapter.
    Net productivity rate means the annual per capita rate of increase 
in a stock resulting from additions due to reproduction, less losses due 
to mortality.
    Nonvessel fishery means a commercial fishing operation that uses 
fixed or other gear without a vessel, such as gear used in set gillnet, 
trap, beach seine, weir, ranch, and pen fisheries.
    NMFS means the National Marine Fisheries Service.
    Observer means an individual authorized by NMFS, or a designated 
contractor, to record information on marine mammal interactions, fishing 
operations, marine mammal life history information, and other scientific 
data, and collect biological specimens during commercial fishing 
activities.
    Potential biological removal level means the maximum number of 
animals, not including natural mortalities, that may be removed from a 
marine mammal stock while allowing that stock to reach or maintain its 
optimum sustainable population. The potential biological removal level 
is the product of the following factors:
    (1) The minimum population estimate of the stock;
    (2) One-half the maximum theoretical or estimated net productivity 
rate of the stock at a small population size; and
    (3) A recovery factor of between 0.1 and 1.0.
    Regional Fishery Management Council means a regional fishery 
management council established under section 302 of the Magnuson Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act.
    Serious injury means any injury that will likely result in 
mortality.
    Strategic stock means a marine mammal stock:

[[Page 191]]

    (1) For which the level of direct human-caused mortality exceeds the 
potential biological removal level;
    (2) Which, based on the best available scientific information, is 
declining and is likely to be listed as a threatened species under the 
Endangered Species Act of 1973 within the foreseeable future;
    (3) Which is listed as a threatened species or endangered species 
under the Endangered Species Act of 1973; or
    (4) Which is designated as depleted under the Marine Mammal 
Protection Act of 1972, as amended.
    Take Reduction Plan means a plan developed to reduce the incidental 
mortality and serious injury of marine mammals during commercial fishing 
operations in accordance with section 118 of the Marine Mammal 
Protection Act of 1972, as amended.
    Take Reduction Team means a team established to recommend methods of 
reducing the incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals 
due to commercial fishing operations, in accordance with section 118 of 
the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended.
    Vessel owner or operator means the owner or operator of:
    (1) A fishing vessel that engages in a commercial fishing operation; 
or
    (2) Fixed or other commercial fishing gear that is used in a 
nonvessel fishery.
    Vessel of the United States has the same meaning as in section 3 of 
the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1802).


<R05>
Sec. 229.3  Prohibitions.

    (a) It is prohibited to take any marine mammal incidental to 
commercial fishing operations except as otherwise provided in part 216 
of this chapter or in this part 229.
    (b) It is prohibited to assault, harm, harass (including sexually 
harass), oppose, impede, intimidate, impair, or in any way influence or 
interfere with an observer, or attempt the same. This prohibition 
includes, but is not limited to, any action that interferes with an 
observer's responsibilities, or that creates an intimidating, hostile, 
or offensive environment.
    (c) It is prohibited to provide false information when registering 
for an Authorization Certificate, applying for renewal of the 
Authorization Certificate, reporting the taking of any marine mammal, or 
providing information to any observer.
    (d) It is prohibited to tamper with or destroy observer equipment in 
any way.
    (e) It is prohibited to intentionally lethally take any marine 
mammal in the course of commercial fishing operations unless imminently 
necessary in self-defense or to save the life of a person in immediate 
danger, and such taking is reported in accordance with the requirements 
of Sec. 229.6.
    (f) It is prohibited to violate any regulation in this part or any 
provision of section 118 of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 229.4  Requirements for Category I and II fisheries.

    (a) General. For a vessel owner or crew members to lawfully 
incidentally take marine mammals in the course of commercial fishing 
operations in a Category I or II fishery, the owner or authorized 
representative of a fishing vessel or nonvessel fishing gear must 
annually register for and receive an Authorization Certificate. The 
granting and administration of authorizations under this part shall be 
integrated and coordinated with existing fishery license, registration, 
or permit systems and related programs, wherever possible. These 
programs may include, but are not limited to, state or 
interjurisdictional fisheries programs. If the administration of 
authorizations is integrated into an existing program, NMFS will publish 
a notice in the Federal Register of where to register, and efforts will 
be made to contact affected fishers via other appropriate means of 
notification.
    (b) Registration. Owners of vessels or, for nonvessel fisheries, 
gear, must register for and receive an Authorization Certificate. To 
register, owners must submit the following information, using a format 
specified by NMFS:
    (1) Name, address, and phone number of owner;
    (2) Name, address, and phone number of operator, if different from 
owner, unless the name of the operator is not known or has not been 
established at the time the registration is submitted;

[[Page 192]]

    (3) Vessel name, length and home port; U.S. Coast Guard 
documentation number, or state registration number, and state commercial 
vessel license number;
    (4) A list of all Category I and II fisheries in which the fisher 
may actively engage during the calendar year;
    (5) The approximate time, duration, and location of each such 
fishery operation, and the general type and nature of use of the fishing 
gear and techniques used; and
    (6) A certification, signed and dated by the vessel owner or 
authorized representative, as follows: ``I hereby certify that I am the 
owner of the vessel, that I have reviewed all information contained on 
this document, and that it is true and complete to the best of my 
knowledge.''
    (c) Fee. A check or money order made payable to NMFS in the amount 
specified in the notice of the final List of Fisheries must accompany 
each registration submitted to NMFS. The amount of this fee will be 
based on recovering the administrative costs incurred in granting an 
authorization. The Assistant Administrator may waive the fee requirement 
for good cause upon the recommendation of the Regional Director.
    (d) Address. Unless the granting and administration of 
authorizations under part 229 is integrated and coordinated with 
existing fishery licenses, registrations, or related programs pursuant 
to paragraph (a) of this section, requests for registration forms and 
completed registration forms should be sent to the NMFS Regional Offices 
are given:
    (1) Alaska Region, NMFS, P.O. Box 21668, 709 West 9th Street, 
Juneau, AK 99802; telephone: 907-586-7235;
    (2) Northwest Region, NMFS, 7600 Sand Point Way NE., Seattle, WA 
98115-0070; telephone: 206-526-4353;

    (5) Southeast Region, NMFS, 9721 Executive Center Drive North, St. 
Petersburg, FL 33702; telephone: 813-570-5301.
    (e) Issuance. After receipt of a completed initial registration form 
and the required fee, NMFS will issue an Authorization Certificate and 
annual decal to the vessel owner. The Authorization Certificate will be 
renewed annually, and an annual decal issued, after receipt of an 
updated registration form, required fee, and statement (yes/no) 
regarding whether any marine mammals were incidentally killed or injured 
during the previous calendar year. The Authorization Certificate will be 
renewed only if the fisher has complied with the provisions of 
Secs. 229.4, 229.6, and 229.7.
    (f) Authorization Certificate and decal requirements. (1) The annual 
decal must be attached to the vessel on the port side of the cabin or, 
in the absence of a cabin, on the forward port side of the hull, and 
must be free of obstruction and in good condition. The decal must be 
attached to the Authorization Certificate for nonvessel fisheries.
    (2) The Authorization Certificate, or a copy, must be on board the 
vessel while it is operating in a Category I or II fishery, or, in the 
case of nonvessel fisheries, the Authorization Certificate with decal 
attached, or copy must be in the possession of the person in charge of 
the fishing operation. The Authorization Certificate, or copy, must be 
made available upon request to any state or Federal enforcement agent 
authorized to enforce the Act, any designated agent of NMFS, or any 
contractor providing observer services to NMFS.
    (3) Authorization Certificates and annual decals are not 
transferable. In the event of the sale or change in ownership of the 
vessel, the Authorization Certificate is void and the new owner must 
register for an Authorization Certificate and decal.
    (4) An Authorization Certificate holder must notify the issuing 
office in writing:
    (i) If the vessel or nonvessel fishing gear will engage in any 
Category I or II fishery not listed on the initial registration form at 
least 30 days prior to engaging in that fishery; and,
    (ii) If there are any changes in the mailing address or vessel 
ownership within 30 days of such change.

[[Page 193]]

    (g) Reporting. Any Authorization Certificate holders must comply 
with the reporting requirements specified under Sec. 229.6.
    (h) Disposition of marine mammals. Any marine mammal incidentally 
taken must be immediately returned to the sea with a minimum of further 
injury, unless directed otherwise by NMFS personnel, a designated 
contractor or an official onboard observer, or authorized otherwise by a 
scientific research permit that is in the possession of the operator.
    (i) Monitoring. Authorization Certificate holders must comply with 
the observer or other monitoring requirements specified under 
Sec. 229.7.
    (j) Deterrence. When necessary to deter a marine mammal from 
damaging fishing gear, catch, or other private property, or from 
endangering personal safety, vessel owners and crew members engaged in a 
Category I or II fishery must comply with all deterrence provisions set 
forth in the Act and all guidelines and prohibitions published 
thereunder.
    (k) Self defense. When imminently necessary in self-defense or to 
save the life of a person in immediate danger, a marine mammal may be 
lethally taken if such taking is reported to NMFS in accordance with the 
requirements of Sec. 229.6.
    (l) Take reduction plans and emergency regulations. Authorization 
Certificate holders must comply with any applicable take reduction plans 
and emergency regulations.
    (m) Expiration. Authorization Certificates and annual decals expire 
at the end of each calendar year.


<R05>
Sec. 229.5  Requirements for Category III fisheries.

    (a) General. Vessel owners and crew members of such vessels engaged 
only in Category III fisheries may incidentally take marine mammals 
without registering for or receiving an Authorization Certificate.
    (b) Reporting. Vessel owners engaged in a Category III fishery must 
comply with the reporting requirements specified in Sec. 229.6.
    (c) Disposition of marine mammals. Any marine mammal incidentally 
taken must be immediately returned to the sea with a minimum of further 
injury unless directed otherwise by NMFS personnel, a designated 
contractor, or an official onboard observer, or authorized otherwise by 
a scientific research permit in the possession of the operator.
    (d) Monitoring. Vessel owners engaged in a Category III fishery must 
comply with the observer requirements specified under Sec. 229.7(f).
    (e) Deterrence. When necessary to deter a marine mammal from 
damaging fishing gear, catch, or other private property, or from 
endangering personal safety, vessel owners and crew members engaged in a 
Category I or II fishery must comply with all deterrence provisions set 
forth in the Act and all guidelines and prohibitions published 
thereunder.
    (f) Self-defense. When imminently necessary in self-defense or to 
save the life of a person in immediate danger, a marine mammal may be 
lethally taken if such taking is reported to NMFS in accordance with the 
requirements of Sec. 229.6.
    (g) Emergency regulations. Vessel owners engaged in a Category III 
fishery must comply with any applicable emergency regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 229.6  Reporting requirements.

    (a) Vessel owners or operators engaged in any Category I, II, or III 
fishery must report all incidental mortality and injury of marine 
mammals in the course of commercial fishing operations to the Assistant 
Administrator, or appropriate Regional Office, by mail or other means, 
such as fax or overnight mail specified by the Assistant Administrator. 
Reports must be sent within 48 hours after the end of each fishing trip 
during which the incidental mortality or injury occurred, or, for 
nonvessel fisheries, within 48 hours of an occurrence of an incidental 
mortality or injury. Reports must be submitted on a standard postage-
paid form as provided by the Assistant Administrator. The vessel owner 
or operator must provide the following information on this form:
    (1) The vessel name, and Federal, state, or tribal registration 
numbers of the registered vessel;

[[Page 194]]

    (2) The name and address of the vessel owner or operator;
    (3) The name and description of the fishery, including gear type and 
target species; and
    (4) The species and number of each marine mammal incidentally killed 
or injured, and the date, time, and approximate geographic location of 
such occurrence. A description of the animal(s) killed or injured must 
be provided if the species is unknown.
    (b) Participants in nonvessel fisheries must provide all of the 
information in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section with the 
exception of the vessel name and registration number.


<R05>
Sec. 229.7  Monitoring of incidental mortalities and serious injuries.

    (a) Purpose. The Assistant Administrator will establish a program to 
monitor incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals during 
the course of commercial fishing operations in order to:
    (1) Obtain statistically reliable estimates of incidental mortality 
and serious injury;
    (2) Determine the reliability of reports of incidental mortality and 
injury under Sec. 229.6; and
    (3) Identify changes in fishing methods or technology that may 
increase or decrease incidental mortality and serious injury.
    (b) Observer program. Pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the 
Assistant Administrator may place observers aboard Category I and II 
vessels as necessary. Observers may, among other tasks:
    (1) Record incidental mortality and injury, and bycatch of other 
nontarget species;
    (2) Record numbers of marine mammals sighted; and
    (3) Perform other scientific investigations, which may include, but 
are not limited to, sampling and photographing incidental mortalities 
and serious injuries.
    (c) Observer requirements for Authorization Certificate holders. (1) 
If requested by NMFS or a designated contractor providing observer 
services to NMFS, an Authorization Certificate holder engaged in a 
Category I or II fishery must take aboard an observer to accompany the 
vessel on fishing trips.
    (2) After being notified by NMFS, or by a designated contractor 
providing observer services to NMFS, that the vessel is required to 
carry an observer, the Authorization Certificate holder must comply with 
the notification by providing information requested within the specified 
time on scheduled or anticipated fishing trips.
    (3) NMFS, or a designated contractor providing observer services to 
NMFS, may waive the observer requirement based on a finding that the 
facilities for housing the observer or for carrying out observer 
functions are so inadequate or unsafe that the health or safety of the 
observer or the safe operation of the vessel would be jeopardized.
    (4) The Authorization Certificate holder and crew must cooperate 
with the observer in the performance of the observer's duties including:
    (i) Providing adequate accommodations;
    (ii) Allowing for the embarking and debarking of the observer as 
specified by NMFS personnel or designated contractors. The operator of a 
vessel must ensure that transfers of observers at sea are accomplished 
in a safe manner, via small boat or raft, during daylight hours if 
feasible, as weather and sea conditions allow, and with the agreement of 
the observer involved;
    (iii) Allowing the observer access to all areas of the vessel 
necessary to conduct observer duties;
    (iv) Allowing the observer access to communications equipment and 
navigation equipment, when available on the vessel, as necessary to 
perform observer duties;
    (v) Providing true vessel locations by latitude and longitude, 
accurate to the minute, or by loran coordinates, upon request by the 
observer;
    (vi) Sampling marine mammal or other protected species specimens, 
upon request by NMFS personnel;
    (vii) Sampling, retaining and storing mammal or other protected 
species specimens, upon request by NMFS personnel, designated 
contractors, or the observer aboard, if adequate facilities are 
available and if feasible;

[[Page 195]]

    (viii) Notifying the observer in a timely fashion of when all 
commercial fishing operations are to begin and end;
    (ix) Not impairing or in any way interfering with the research or 
observations being carried out; and
    (x) Complying with other guidelines or regulations that NMFS may 
develop to ensure the effective deployment and use of observers.
    (5) Marine mammals incidentally killed during fishing operations and 
which are readily accessible to crew members, must be brought onboard 
the vessel as biological specimens and retained for the purposes of 
scientific research if feasible and requested by NMFS personnel, 
designated contractors, or the aboard observer. Marine mammals so 
collected and retained as biological specimens must, upon request by 
NMFS personnel, designated contractors, or the observer aboard, be 
retained in cold storage on board the vessel, if feasible, until removed 
at the request of NMFS personnel, designated contractors, or the 
observer aboard, retrieved by authorized personnel of NMFS, or released 
by the observer for return to the ocean. Such biological specimens may 
be transported on board the vessel during the fishing trip and back to 
port under this authorization.
    (6) Any marine mammal incidentally taken may be retained only if 
authorized by NMFS personnel, designated contractors or an official 
observer aboard, or by a scientific research permit that is in the 
possession of the operator.
    (d) Observer requirements for Category III fisheries. (1) The 
Assistant Administrator may place observers on Category III vessels if 
the Assistant Administrator:
    (i) Believes that the incidental mortality and serious injury of 
marine mammals from such fishery may be contributing to the immediate 
and significant adverse impact on a species or stock listed as a 
threatened species or endangered species under the Endangered Species 
Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.); and
    (ii) Has complied with Sec. 229.9(a)(3)(i) and (ii); or
    (iii) Has the consent of the vessel owner.
    (2) If an observer is placed on a Category III vessel, the vessel 
owner and/or operator must comply with the requirements of 
Sec. 229.7(c).
    (e) Alternative observer program. The Assistant Administrator may 
establish an alternative observer program to provide statistically 
reliable information on the species and number of marine mammals 
incidentally taken in the course of commercial fishing operations. The 
alternative observer program may include direct observation of fishing 
activities from vessels, airplanes, or points on shore.


<R05>
Sec. 229.8  Publication of List of Fisheries.

    (a) The Assistant Administrator will publish in the Federal Register 
a proposed revised List of Fisheries on or about July 1 of each year for 
the purpose of receiving public comment. Each year, on or about October 
1, the Assistant Administrator will publish a final revised List of 
Fisheries, which will become effective January 1 of the next calendar 
year.
    (b) The proposed and final revised List of Fisheries will:
    (1) Categorize each commercial fishery based on the definitions of 
Category I, II, and III fisheries set forth in Sec. 229.2; and
    (2) List the marine mammals that interact with commercial fishing 
operations and the estimated number of vessels or persons involved in 
each commercial fishery.
    (c) The Assistant Administrator may publish a revised List of 
Fisheries at other times, after notification and opportunity for public 
comment. The revised final List of Fisheries will become effective no 
sooner than 30 days after publication in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 229.9  Emergency regulations.

    (a) If the Assistant Administrator finds that the incidental 
mortality or serious injury of marine mammals from commercial fisheries 
is having, or is likely to have, an immediate and significant adverse 
impact on a stock or species, the Assistant Administrator will:
    (1) In the case of a stock or species for which a take reduction 
plan is in effect--

[[Page 196]]

    (i) Prescribe emergency regulations that, consistent with such plan 
to the maximum extent practicable, reduce incidental mortality and 
serious injury in that fishery; and
    (ii) Approve and implement on an expedited basis, any amendments to 
such plan that are recommended by the Take Reduction Team to address 
such adverse impact;
    (2) In the case of a stock or species for which a take reduction 
plan is being developed--
    (i) Prescribe emergency regulations to reduce such incidental 
mortality and serious injury in that fishery; and
    (ii) Approve and implement, on an expedited basis, such plan, which 
will provide methods to address such adverse impact if still necessary;
    (3) In the case of a stock or species for which a take reduction 
plan does not exist and is not being developed, or in the case of a 
Category III fishery that the Assistant Administrator believes may be 
contributing to such adverse impact,
    (i) Prescribe emergency regulations to reduce such incidental 
mortality and serious injury in that fishery, to the extent necessary to 
mitigate such adverse impact;
    (ii) Immediately review the stock assessment for such stock or 
species and the classification of such commercial fishery under this 
section to determine if a take reduction team should be established; and
    (iii) Where necessary to address such adverse impact on a species or 
stock listed as a threatened species or endangered species under the 
Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), place observers on 
vessels in a Category III fishery if the Assistant Administrator has 
reason to believe such vessels may be causing the incidental mortality 
and serious injury to marine mammals from such stock.
    (b) Prior to taking any action under Sec. 229.9(a)(1) through (3), 
the Assistant Administrator will consult with the Marine Mammal 
Commission, all appropriate Regional Fishery Management Councils, state 
fishery managers, and the appropriate take reduction team, if 
established.
    (c) Any emergency regulations issued under this section:
    (1) Shall be published in the Federal Register and will remain in 
effect for no more than 180 days or until the end of the applicable 
commercial fishing season, whichever is earlier, except as provided in 
paragraph (d) of this section; and
    (2) May be terminated by notification in the Federal Register at an 
earlier date if the Assistant Administrator determines that the reasons 
for the emergency regulations no longer exist.
    (d) If the Assistant Administrator finds that incidental mortality 
and serious injury of marine mammals in a commercial fishery is 
continuing to have an immediate and significant adverse impact on a 
stock or species, the Assistant Administrator may extend the emergency 
regulations for an additional period of not more than 90 days or until 
reasons for the emergency regulations no longer exist, whichever is 
earlier.


<R05>
Sec. 229.10  Penalties.

<R04>
      Subpart B--Takes of Endangered and Threatened Marine Mammals


<R05>
Sec. 229.20  Issuance of permits.

    (a) Determinations. During a period of up to 3 consecutive years, 
NMFS will allow the incidental, but not the intentional, taking by 
persons using vessels of the United States or foreign vessels that have 
valid fishing permits issued by the Assistant Administrator in 
accordance with section 204(b) of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and 
Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1824(b)), while engaging in commercial fishing 
operations, of marine mammals from a species or stock designated as 
depleted because of its listing as an endangered species or threatened 
species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 if the Assistant 
Administrator determines that:
    (1) The incidental mortality and serious injury from commercial 
fisheries will have a negligible impact on such species or stock;
    (2) A recovery plan has been developed or is being developed for 
such species or stock pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973; 
and
    (3) Where required under regulations in subpart A of this part:
    (i) A monitoring program has been established under Sec. 229.7; (ii) 
Vessels engaged in such fisheries are registered in accordance with 
Sec. 229.4; and
    (iii) A take reduction plan has been developed or is being developed 
for such species or stock in accordance with regulations at subpart C of 
this part.
    (b) Procedures for making determinations. In making any of the 
determinations listed in paragraph (a) of this section, the Assistant 
Administrator will publish an announcement in the Federal Register of 
fisheries having takes of marine mammals listed under the Endangered 
Species Act, including a summary of available information regarding the 
fisheries interactions with listed species. Any interested party may, 
within 45 days of such publication, submit to the Assistant 
Administrator written data or views with respect to the listed 
fisheries. As soon as practicable after the end of the 45 days following 
publication, NMFS will publish in the Federal Register a list of the 
fisheries for which the determinations listed in paragraph (a) of this 
section have been made. This publication will set forth a summary of the 
information used to make the determinations.
    (c) Issuance of authorization. The Assistant Administrator will 
issue appropriate permits for vessels in fisheries that are required to 
register under Sec. 229.4 and for which determinations under the 
procedures of paragraph (b) of this section can be made.
    (d) Category III fisheries. Vessel owners engaged only in Category 
III fisheries for which determinations are made under the procedures of 
paragraph (b) of this section will not be subject to the penalties of 
this Act for the incidental taking of marine mammals to which this 
subpart applies, as long as the vessel owner or operator of such vessel 
reports any incidental mortality or injury of such marine mammals in 
accordance with the requirements of Sec. 229.6.
    (e) Emergency authority. During the course of the commercial fishing 
season, if the Assistant Administrator determines that the level of 
incidental mortality or serious injury from commercial fisheries for 
which such a determination was made under this section has resulted or 
is likely to result in an impact that is more than negligible on the 
endangered or threatened species or stock, the Assistant Administrator 
will use the emergency authority of Sec. 229.9 to protect such species 
or stock, and may modify any permit granted under this paragraph as 
necessary.
    (f) Suspension, revocation, modification and amendment. The 
Assistant Administrator may, pursuant to the provisions of 15 CFR part 
904, suspend or revoke a permit granted under this section if the 
Assistant Administrator determines that the conditions or limitations 
set forth in such permit are not being complied with. The Assistant 
Administrator may amend or modify, after notification and opportunity 
for public comment, the list of fisheries published in accordance with 
Sec. 229.21(b) whenever the Assistant Administrator determines there has 
been a significant change in the information or conditions used to 
determine such a list.

                           Subpart A--General


<R05>
Sec. 253.1  Purpose.

    (a) The regulations in this part pertain to fisheries assistance 
programs. Subpart B of these rules governs the Fisheries Obligation 
Guarantee Program, which guarantees the repayment of certain long-term 
fisheries and aquacultural debts. This allows those debts to be placed 
in the same private investment market that buys U.S. Treasury 
securities, where interest rates are lower and maturities are longer. 
The Program does all credit work and holds and services all credit 
collateral. The Program's guarantee fee makes it self-supporting.
    (b) Subpart C implements Title III of Public Law 99-659 (16 U.S.C. 
4100 et seq.), which has two objectives:
    (1) To promote and encourage State activities in support of the 
management of interjurisdictional fishery resources identified in 
interstate or Federal fishery management plans; and
    (2) To promote and encourage management of interjurisdictional 
fishery resources throughout their range.
    (3) The scope of this part includes guidance on making financial 
assistance awards to States or Interstate Commissions to undertake 
projects in support of management of interjurisdictional fishery 
resources in both the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and State waters, 
and to encourage States to enter into enforcement agreements with either 
the Department of Commerce or the Department of the Interior.

<R05>
Sec. 253.11  Guarantee policy.

    (a) A guarantee financing or refinancing up to 80 percent of a 
project's actual cost shall be available to any qualified citizen 
otherwise eligible under the Act and these rules, except:
    (1) Vessel construction. The Program will not finance this project 
cost. The Program will only refinance this project cost for an existing 
vessel whose previous construction cost has already been financed (or 
otherwise paid). Refinancing this project cost for a vessel that already 
exists is not inconsistent with wise use, but financing it may be.
    (2) Vessel refurbishing that materially increases an existing 
vessel's harvesting capacity. The Program will not finance this project 
cost. The Program will only refinance this project cost for a vessel 
whose previous refurbishing cost has already been financed (or otherwise 
paid). Refinancing this project cost is not inconsistent with wise use, 
but financing it may be.
    (3) Purchasing a used vessel or used fishery facility. The Program 
will neither finance nor refinance this project cost (except for a used 
vessel or fishery facility that the Program purchased and is reselling), 
unless the used vessel or fishery facility will be refurbished in the 
United States and will be a contributory project or it will be used in 
an underutilized fishery.
    (b) Every project, other than those specified in paragraphs (a) (1) 
and (2) of this section, is consistent with wise use and every project, 
other than those specifically precluded in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of 
this section, may be financed, as well as refinanced.


<R05>
Sec. 253.12  Guaranteed note, U.S. note, and security documents.

    (a) Guaranteed note--(1) Principal. This may not exceed 80 percent 
of actual cost, but may, in the Division's credit judgment, be less.
    (2) Maturity. This may not exceed 25 years, but shall not exceed the 
project property's useful life and may, in the Division's credit 
judgment, be less.
    (3) Interest rate. This may not exceed the amount the Division deems 
reasonable.
    (4) Prepayment penalty. The Division will allow a reasonable 
prepayment penalty, but the guarantor will not guarantee a notemaker's 
payment of it.
    (5) Form. This will be the simple promissory note (with the 
guarantee attached) the Division prescribes, promising only to pay 
principal, interest, and prepayment penalty.
    (6) Sole security. The guaranteed note and the guarantee will be the 
noteholder's sole security.
    (b) U.S. note and security documents--(1) Form. The U.S. note and 
security documents will be in the form the Division prescribes.
    (2) U.S. note. This exists to evidence the notemaker's actual and 
contingent liability to the guarantor (contingent if the guarantor does 
not pay the guaranteed note (including any portion of it), on the 
notemaker's behalf or if the guarantor does not advance any other 
amounts or incur any other expenses on the notemaker's behalf to protect

[[Page 206]]

the U.S. or accommodate the notemaker; actual if, and to the same 
monetary extent that, the guarantor does). Payment of the guaranteed 
note by anyone but the guarantor will amortize the original principal 
balance (and interest accruing on it) of the U.S. note to the same 
extent that it amortizes the guaranteed note. The U.S note will, among 
other things, contain provisions for adding to its principal balance all 
amounts the Program advances, or expenses it incurs, to protect the U.S. 
or accommodate the notemaker.
    (3) Security documents. The Division will, at a minimum, require a 
pledge of all project property (or adequate substitute collateral). The 
Division will require such other security as it deems the circumstances 
of each notemaker and project require to protect the U.S. All security 
documents will secure the U.S. note. The security documents will, among 
other things, contain provisions for adding to the U.S. note all Program 
advances, expenditures, and expenses required to protect the U.S. or 
accommodate the notemaker.
    (4) Recourse. Significant Program reliance, as a secondary means of 
repayment, on the net worths of parties other than the notemaker will 
ordinarily require secured recourse against those net worths. Recourse 
may be by a repayment guarantee or irrevocable letter of credit. 
Ordinarily, the Division will require recourse against: All major 
shareholders of a closely-held corporate notemaker, the parent 
corporation of a subsidiary corporate notemaker without substantial 
pledged assets other than the project property, and all major limited 
partners. The Division may also require recourse against others it deems 
necessary to protect the U.S. The principal parties in interest, who 
ultimately stand most to benefit from the project, should ordinarily be 
held financially accountable for the project's performance. Where 
otherwise appropriate recourse is unavailable, the conservatively 
projected net liquidating value of the notemaker's assets pledged to the 
Program must, in the Division's credit judgment, substantially exceed 
all projected Program exposure.
    (c) Dual-use CCF. For a vessel, the Division may require annually 
depositing some portion of the project property's net income into a 
dual-use CCF. A dual-use CCF provides the normal CCF tax-deferral 
benefits, but also both gives the Program control of CCF withdrawals and 
recourse against CCF deposits and ensures an emergency refurbishing 
reserve (tax-deferred) for project property.


<R05>
Sec. 253.13  Ability and experience requirements.

    A notemaker and the majority of its principals must generally have 
the ability, experience, resources, character, reputation, and other 
qualifications the Division deems necessary for successfully operating 
the project property and protecting the U.S. The Program will ordinarily 
not provide guarantees: For venture capital purposes; to a notemaker 
whose principals are all from outside the industry; or for a notemaker 
the majority of whose principals cannot document successful industry 
ability and experience of a duration, degree, and nature consistent with 
protecting the U.S.


<R05>
Sec. 253.14  Economic and financial requirements.

    (a) Income and expense projections. The Division's conservative 
income and expense projections for the project property's operation must 
prospectively indicate net earnings that can service all debt, properly 
maintain the project property, and protect the U.S. against the 
industry's cyclical economics and other risks of loss.
    (b) Working capital. The Division's conservative assessment of an 
applicant's financial condition must indicate initial working capital 
prospectively sufficient to provide for the project property to achieve 
net earnings projections, fund all foreseeable contingencies, and 
protect the U.S. At the Division's discretion, some portion of projected 
working capital needs may be met by something other than current assets 
minus current liabilities (i.e., by a line or letter of credit, 
noncurrent assets readily capable of generating working capital, a 
guarantor with sufficient financial resources, etc.).

[[Page 207]]

    (c) Audited financial statements. These will ordinarily be required 
for any notemaker with large or financially extensive operations whose 
financial condition the Division believes it cannot otherwise assess 
with reasonable certainty.
    (d) Consultant services. Infrequently, expert consulting services 
may be necessary to help the Division assess a project's economic, 
technical, or financial feasibility. The Division will select and employ 
the necessary consultant, but require the applicant to reimburse the 
Division. A subsequently approved application will not be closed until 
the applicant reimburses the Division. This cost may, at the Division's 
discretion, be included in a guaranteed note's amount. For a declined 
application, the Division may reimburse itself from the remaining 25 
percent of the application fee.


<R05>
Sec. 253.15  Miscellaneous.

    (a) Applicant. Only the legal title holder of project property (or 
the lessee of an appropriate long-term financing lease) may apply for a 
guarantee. Applicants must submit an ``Application for Fisheries 
Obligation Program Guarantee'' to the appropriate NMFS Regional 
Financial Services Branch to be considered for a guaranteed loan.
    (b) Investigation and approval. The Division shall do a due 
diligence investigation of every application it accepts and determine 
if, in the Division's sole judgment, the application is eligible and 
qualified. Applications the Division deems ineligible or unqualified 
will be declined. The Division will approve eligible and qualified 
applications based on the applicability of the information obtained 
during the application and investigation process to the programmatic 
goals and financial requirements of the program and under terms and 
conditions that, in the Division's sole discretion, protect the U.S. The 
Division will state these terms and conditions in its approval in 
principal letter.
    (c) Insurance. All property and other risks shall be continuously 
insured during the term of the U.S. note. Insurers must be acceptable to 
the Division. Insurance must be in such forms and amounts and against 
such risks as the Division deems necessary to protect the U.S. Insurance 
must be endorsed to include the requirements the U.S., as respects its 
interest only, deems necessary to protect the U.S. (e.g., the Program 
will ordinarily be an additional insured as well as the sole loss payee 
for the amount of its interest; cancellation will require 20 days' 
advance written notice; vessel seaworthiness will be admitted, and the 
Program will be adequately protected against other insureds' breaches of 
policy warranties, negligence, omission, etc.)
    (d) Property inspections. The Division will require adequate 
condition and valuation inspection of all property as the basis for 
assessing the property's worth and suitability for guarantee. The 
Division may also require these at specified periods during guarantee 
life. These must be conducted by competent and impartial inspectors 
acceptable to the Division. Inspection cost will be at an applicant's 
expense. Those occurring before application approval may be included in 
actual cost.
    (e) Guarantee terms and conditions. The Division's approval in 
principle letter shall specify the terms and conditions of the 
guarantor's willingness to guarantee. These shall be incorporated in 
closing documents that the Division prepares. Terms and conditions are 
at the Division's sole discretion. An applicant's nonacceptance will 
result in disqualification for guarantee.
    (f) Noteholder. The Division will, as a gratuitous service, request 
parties interested in investing in guaranteed notes to submit offers to 
fund each prospective guaranteed note. The Division and the applicant 
will, by mutual consent, choose the responsive bidder, which ordinarily 
will be the prospective noteholder whose bid represents the lowest net 
effective annual cost of capital. Until the Division has closed the 
guarantee, arrangements between an applicant and a prospective 
noteholder are a matter of private contract between them, and the 
Program is not responsible to either for nonperformance by the other.
    (g) Closing--(1) Approval in principle letters. Every closing will 
be in strict accordance with a final approval in principle letter.

[[Page 208]]

    (2) Contracts. The guaranteed note, U.S. note, and security 
documents will ordinarily be on standard Program forms that may not be 
altered without Divisional approval. The Division will ordinarily 
prepare all contracts, except certain pledges involving real property, 
which will be prepared by each notemaker's attorney at the direction and 
approval of the Division's attorney.
    (3) Closing schedules. The Division will ordinarily close guarantee 
transactions with minimal services from applicants' attorneys, except 
where real property pledges or other matters appropriate for private 
counsel are involved. Real property services required from an 
applicant's attorney may include: Title search, mortgage and other 
document preparation, execution and recording, escrow and disbursement, 
and a legal opinion and other assurances. An applicant's attorney's 
expense, and that of any other private contractor required, is for 
applicant's account. Attorneys and other contractors must be 
satisfactory to the Division. The Division will attempt to meet 
reasonable closing schedules, but will not be liable for adverse 
interest-rate fluctuations, loss of commitments, or other consequences 
of being unable to meet an applicant's and a prospective noteholder's 
closing schedule. These parties should work closely with the Division to 
ensure a closing schedule the Division can meet.


<R05>
Sec. 253.16  Fees.

    (a) Application fee. The Division will not accept an application 
without the application fee. Fifty percent of the application fee is 
fully earned at application acceptance, and is not refundable. The rest 
is fully earned when the Division issues an approval in principal 
letter, and it is refundable only if the Division declines an 
application or an applicant requests refund before the Division issues 
an approval in principal letter.
    (b) Guarantee fee. Each guarantee fee will be due in advance and 
will be based on the guaranteed note's repayment provisions for the 
prospective year. The first annual guarantee fee is due at guarantee 
closing. Each subsequent one is due and payable on the guarantee 
closing's anniversary date. Each is fully earned when due, and shall not 
subsequently be refunded for any reason.
    (c) Refinancing or assumption fee. This fee applies only to 
refinancing or assuming existing guaranteed notes. It is due upon 
application for refinancing or assuming a guaranteed note. It is fully 
earned when due and shall be nonrefundable. The Division may waive a 
refinancing or assumption fee's payment when the refinancing or 
assumption's primary purpose is to protect the U.S.
    (d) Where payable. Fees are payable by check made payable to ``NMFS/
FSFF.'' Other than those collected at application or closing, fees are 
payable by mailing checks to: U.S. Department of Commerce, National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries 
Service, P.O. Box 73004, Chicago, Ill. 60673. To ensure proper 
crediting, each check must include the official case number the Division 
assigns to each guarantee.


<R05>
Sec. 253.17  Demand and payment.

    Every demand must be delivered in writing to the Division. Each must 
include the noteholder's certified record of the date and amount of each 
payment made on the guaranteed note and the manner of its application. 
Should the Division not acknowledge receipt of a timely demand, the 
noteholder must possess evidence of the demand's timely delivery.


<R05>
Sec. 253.18  Program operating guidelines.

    The Division may issue Program operating guidelines, as the need 
arises, governing national Program policy and administrative issues not 
addressed by these rules.


<R05>
Sec. 253.19  Default and liquidation.

    Upon default of the security documents, the Division shall take such 
remedial action (including, where appropriate, liquidation) as it deems 
best able to protect the U.S.' interest.

state is to be determined by the Secretary as the ratio which the 
equally weighted average of the volume and value of fishery resources 
harvested by domestic commercial fishermen and landed within such state 
during the 3 most recent calendar years for which data satisfactory to 
the Secretary are available bears to the total equally weighted average 
of the volume and value of all fishery resources harvested by domestic 
commercial fishermen and landed within all of the states during those 
calendar years.

funds' availability.
    (b) No state, under the apportionment formula in paragraph (a) of 
this section, that has a ratio of one-third of 1 percent or higher may 
receive an apportionment for any fiscal year that is less than 1 percent 
of the total amount of funds available for that fiscal year.
    (c) If a State's ratio under the apportionment formula in paragraph

<R05>
Sec. 253.22  State projects.

    (a) General--(1) Designation of state agency. The Governor of each 
state shall notify the Secretary of which agency of the state government 
is authorized under its laws to regulate commercial fisheries and is, 
therefore, designated receive financial assistance awards. An official 
of such agency shall certify which official(s) is authorized

[[Page 211]]

in accordance with state law to commit the state to participation under 
the Act, to sign project documents, and to receive payments.
    (2) States that choose to submit proposals in any fiscal year must 
so notify the NMFS Regional Director before the end of the third quarter 
of that fiscal year.
    (3) Any state may, through its state agency, submit to the NMFS 
Regional Director a completed NOAA Grants and Cooperative Agreement 
Application Package with its proposal for a project, which may be 
multiyear. Proposals must describe the full scope of work, 
specifications, and cost estimates for such project.
    (4) States may submit a proposal for a project through, and request 
payment to be made to, an Interstate Fisheries Commission. Any payment 
so made shall be charged against the apportionment of the appropriate 
state(s). Submitting a project through one of the Commissions does not 
remove the matching funds requirement for any state, as provided in 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) Evaluation of projects. The Secretary, before approving any 
proposal for a project, will evaluate the proposal as to its 
applicability, in accordance with 16 U.S.C. 4104(a)(2).
    (c) State matching requirements. The Federal share of the costs of 
any project conducted under this subpart, including a project submitted 
through an Interstate Commission, cannot exceed 75 percent of the total 
estimated cost of the project, unless:
    (1) The state has adopted an interstate fishery management plan for 
the fishery resource to which the project applies; or
    (2) The state has adopted fishery regulations that the Secretary has 
determined are consistent with any Federal fishery management plan for 
the species to which the project applies, in which case the Federal 
share cannot exceed 90 percent of the total estimated cost of the 
project.
    (d) Financial assistance award. If the Secretary approves or 
disapproves a proposal for a project, he or she will promptly give 
written notification, including, if disapproved, a detailed explanation 
of the reason(s) for the disapproval.
    (e) Restrictions. (1) The total cost of all items included for 
engineering, planning, inspection, and unforeseen contingencies in 
connection with any works to be constructed as part of such a proposed 
project shall not exceed 10 percent of the total cost of such works, and 
shall be paid by the state as a part of its contribution to the total 
cost of the project.
    (2) The expenditure of funds under this subpart may be applied only 
to projects for which a proposal has been evaluated under paragraph (b) 
of this section and approved by the Secretary, except that up to $25,000 
each fiscal year may be awarded to a state out of the state's regular 
apportionment to carry out an ``enforcement agreement.'' An enforcement 
agreement does not require state matching funds.
    (f) Prosecution of work. All work must be performed in accordance 
with applicable state laws or regulations, except when such laws or 
regulations are in conflict with Federal laws or regulations such that 
the Federal law or regulation prevails.


<R05>
Sec. 253.23  Other funds.

    (a) Funds for disaster assistance. (1) The Secretary shall retain 
sole authority in distributing any disaster assistance funds made 
available under section 308(b) of the Act. The Secretary may distribute 
these funds after he or she has made a thorough evaluation of the 
scientific information submitted, and has determined that a commercial 
fishery failure of a fishery resource arising from natural or 
undetermined causes has occurred. Funds may only be used to restore the 
resource affected by the disaster, and only by existing methods and 
technology. Any fishery resource used in computing the states' amount 
under the apportionment formula in Sec. 253.21(a) will qualify for 
funding under this section. The Federal share of the cost of any 
activity conducted under the disaster provision of the Act shall be 
limited to 75 percent of the total cost.

[[Page 212]]

    (2) In addition, pursuant to section 308(d) of the Act, the 
Secretary is authorized to award grants to persons engaged in commercial 
fisheries, for uninsured losses determined by the Secretary to have been 
suffered as a direct result of a fishery resource disaster. Funds may be 
distributed by the Secretary only after notice and opportunity for 
public comment of the appropriate limitations, terms, and conditions for 
awarding assistance under this section. Assistance provided under this 
section is limited to 75 percent of an uninsured loss to the extent that 
such losses have not been compensated by other Federal or State 
programs.
    (b) Funds for interstate commissions. Funds authorized to support 
the efforts of the three chartered Interstate Marine Fisheries 
Commissions to develop and maintain interstate fishery management plans 
for interjurisdictional fisheries will be divided equally among the 
Commissions.

<R05>
Sec. 259.1   Execution of agreements and deposits made in a Capital Construction Fund.

    In the case of a taxable year of a taxpayer beginning after December 
31, 1969, and before January 1, 1972, the rules governing the execution 
of agreements and deposits under such agreements shall be as follows:
    (a) A capital construction fund agreement executed and entered into 
by the taxpayer on or prior to the due date, with extensions, for the 
filing of his Federal income tax return for such taxable year or years 
will be deemed to be effective on the date of the execution of such 
agreement or as of the close of business of the last regular business 
day of each such taxable year or years to which such deposit relates, 
whichever day is earlier.
    (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, 
where:
    (1) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, and prior 
to January 1, 1971, an application for a capital construction fund 
agreement is filed by a taxpayer prior to January 1, 1972, and a capital 
construction fund agreement is executed and entered into by the taxpayer 
prior to March 1, 1972, and
    (2) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1970, and prior 
to January 1, 1972, an application for a capital construction fund 
agreement is filed by a taxpayer prior to January 1, 1973, and a capital 
construction fund agreement is executed and entered into by the taxpayer 
prior to March 1, 1973 (or, if earlier, 60 days after the publication of 
final joint regulations under section 607 of the Merchant Marine Act, 
1936, as amended); then such a capital construction fund agreement will 
be deemed to be effective as of the close of business of the last 
regular business day of each such taxable year or years to which such 
deposit related.

[[Page 213]]

    (c) (1) Deposits made in a capital construction fund pursuant to 
such an agreement within 60 days after the date of execution of the 
agreement, or on or prior to the due date, with extensions, for the 
filing of his Federal income tax return for such taxable year or years, 
whichever date shall be later, shall be deemed to have been made on the 
date of the actual deposit or as of the close of business of the last 
regular business day of each such taxable year or years to which such 
deposit relates, whichever day is earlier.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, for taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 1970, and ending prior to January 1, 
1972, deposits made later than the last date permitted under paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section but on or before January 9, 1973, in a capital 
construction fund pursuant to an agreement with the Secretary of 
Commerce, acting by and through the Administrator of the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, shall be deemed to have been 
made on the date of the actual deposit or as of the close of business of 
the last regular business day of such taxable year, whichever is 
earlier.
    (d) Nothing in this section shall alter the rules and regulations 
governing the timing of deposits with respect to existing capital and 
special reserve funds or with respect to the treatment of deposits for 
any taxable year or years other than a taxable year or years beginning 
after December 31, 1969, and before January 1, 1972.<SUP>1

Sec. 259.30   Application for Interim Capital Construction Fund Agreement (``Interim CCF Agreement'').

    (a) General qualifications. To be eligible to enter into an Interim 
CCF Agreement an applicant must:
    (1) Be a citizen of the United States (citizenship requirements are 
those for documenting vessels in the coastwise trade within the meaning 
of section 2 of the Shipping Act, 1916, as amended);
    (2) Own or lease one or more eligible vessels (as defined in section 
607(k)(1) of the Act) operating in the foreign or domestic commerce of 
the United States.
    (3) Have an acceptable program for the acquisition, construction, or 
reconstruction of one or more qualified vessels (as defined in section 
607(k)(2) of the Act). Qualified vessels must be for commercial 
operation in the fisheries of the United States. If the qualified vessel 
is 5 net tons or over, it must be documented in the fisheries of the 
United States. Dual documentation in both the fisheries and the 
coastwise trade of the United States is permissible. Any vessel which 
will carry fishing parties for hire must be inspected and certified 
(under 46 CFR part 176) by the U.S. Coast Guard as qualified to carry 
more than six passengers or demonstrate to the Secretary's satisfaction 
that the carrying of fishing parties for hire will constitute its 
primary activity. The program must be a firm representation of the 
applicant's actual intentions. Vague or contingent objectives will not 
be acceptable.
    (b) Content of application. Applicants seeking an Interim CCF 
Agreement may make application by letter providing the following 
information:
    (1) Proof of U.S. citizenship;
    (2) The first taxable year for which the Interim CCF Agreement is to 
apply (see Sec. 259.33 for the latest time at which applications for an 
Interim CCF Agreement relating to a previous taxable year may be 
received);
    (3) The following information regarding each ``eligible vessel'' 
which is to be incorporated in Schedule A of the Interim CCF Agreement 
for purposes of making deposits into a CCF pursuant to section 607 of 
the Act:
    (i) Name of vessel,

[[Page 214]]

    (ii) Official number, or, in the case of vessels under 5 net tons, 
the State registration number where required,
    (iii) Type of vessel (i.e., catching vessel, processing vessel, 
transporting vessel, charter vessel, barge, passenger carrying fishing 
vessel, etc.),
    (iv) General characteristic (i.e., net tonnage, fish-carrying 
capacity, age, length, type of fishing gear, number of passengers 
carried or in the case of vessels operating in the foreign or domestic 
commerce the various uses of the vessel, etc.),
    (v) Whether owned or leased and, if leased, the name of the owner, 
and a copy of the lease,
    (vi) Date and place of construction,
    (vii) If reconstructed, date of redelivery and place of 
reconstruction,
    (viii) Trade (or trades) in which vessel is documented and date last 
documented,
    (ix) If a fishing vessel, the fishery of operation (which in this 
section means each species or group of species--each species must be 
specifically identified by acceptable common names--of fish, shellfish, 
or other living marine resources which each vessel catches, processes, 
or transports or will catch, process, or transport for commercial 
purposes such as marketing or processing the catch),
    (x) If a fishing vessel, the area of operation (which for fishing 
vessels means the general geographic areas in which each vessel will 
catch, process, or transport, or charter for each species or group of 
species of fish, shellfish, or other living marine resources).
    (4) The specific objectives to be achieved by the accumulation of 
assets in a Capital Construction Fund (to be incorporated in Schedule B 
of the Interim CCF Agreement) including:
    (i) Number of vessels,
    (ii) Type of vessel (i.e., catching, processing, transporting, or 
passenger carrying fishing vessel),
    (iii) General characteristics (i.e., net tonnage, fish-carrying 
capacity, age, length, type of fishing gear, number of passengers 
carried),
    (iv) Cost of projects,
    (v) Amount of indebtedness to be paid for vessels to be constructed, 
acquired, or reconstructed (all notes, mortgages, or other evidences of 
the indebtedness must be submitted as soon as available, together with 
sufficient additional evidence to establish that full proceeds of the 
indebtedness to be paid from a CCF under an Interim CCF Agreement, were 
used solely for the purpose of the construction, acquisition, or 
reconstruction of Schedule B vessels),
    (vi) Date of construction, acquisition, or reconstruction,
    (vii) Fishery of operation (which in this section means each species 
or group of species--each species must be specifically identified by 
acceptable common name--of fish, shellfish, or other living marine 
resources),
    (viii) Area of operation (which in this section means the general 
geographic areas in which each vessel will will operate for each species 
or group of species of fish, shellfish, or other living marine 
resources).
    (c) Filing. The application must be signed and submitted in 
duplicate to the Regional Office of the National Marine Fisheries 
Service's Financial Assistance Division corresponding to the region in 
which the party conducts its business. As a general rule, the Interim 
CCF Agreement must be executed and entered into by the taxpayer on or 
prior to the due date, with extensions, for the filing of the Federal 
tax return in order to be effective for the tax year to which that 
return relates. It is manifestly in the Applicant's best interest to 
file at least 45 days in advance of such date.

<R05>
Sec. 259.31   Acquisition, construction, or reconstruction.

    (a) Acquisition. No vessel having previously been operated in a 
fishery of the United States prior to its acquisition by the party 
seeking CCF withdrawal therefor shall be a qualified vessel for the 
purpose of acquisition, except in the cases specified in paragraphs 
(a)(1) and (2) of this section:
    (1) A vessel not more than 5 years old, at the time of its 
acquisition by the party seeking CCF withdrawal therefor may be a 
qualified vessel for the purpose of acquisition, but only if each 
acquisition in this category becomes a Schedule A vessel and there

[[Page 215]]

exists for each acquisition in this category (on a one-for-one basis) an 
additional Schedule B construction or reconstruction. The sole 
consideration for permitting an acquisition in this category is that it 
will enable the party (but the Secretary will not attempt to 
predetermine such an ability) to accelerate accomplishment of the 
additional Schedule B construction or reconstruction. Should this 
consideration materially fail, the Secretary shall, at his discretion, 
disqualify previously qualified withdrawals in this category, seek 
liquidated damages as provided for in paragraph (a)(4) of this section 
and/or terminate the Interim CCF Agreement.
    (2) A vessel more than 5 years old, but not more than 25 years old 
(special showing required if more than 25 years old, see paragraph (b) 
of this section), at the time of acquisition by the party seeking CCF 
withdrawal therefor may be a qualified vessel for the purpose of 
acquisition, but only if that same vessel becomes a Schedule A vessel 
and (in addition to being a Schedule B vessel for the purpose of its 
acquisition) becomes a Schedule B vessel for the purpose of that same 
vessel's reconstruction to be accomplished ordinarily within 7 years 
from the date of acquisition. The sole consideration for permitting an 
acquisition in this category is that it will enable a party (but the 
Secretary will not attempt to predetermine such an ability) to 
accelerate accomplishment of the Schedule B reconstruction of the vessel 
so acquired. Should this consideration materially fail, the same penalty 
prescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies.
    (3) Reserved for minimum deposits under this section.
    (4) Reserved for liquidated damages.
    (b) Reconstruction. No reconstruction project costing less than 
$100,000 shall qualify a vessel for reconstruction, unless the 
reconstruction project costs, or will cost, 20 percent or more of the 
reconstructed vessel's acquisition cost (in its unreconstructed state) 
to the party seeking CCF withdrawal therefor. If the reconstruction 
project meets the $100,000 test, then the 20 percent test does not 
apply. Conversely, if the reconstruction project does not meet the 
$100,000 test, then the 20 percent test applies.
    (1) Reconstruction may include rebuilding, replacing, 
reconditioning, converting and/or improving any portion of a vessel. A 
reconstruction project must, however, substantially prolong the useful 
life of the reconstructed vessel, increase its value, or adapt it to a 
different commercial use in the fishing trade or industry.
    (2) All, or the major portion (ordinarily, not less than 80 
percent), of a reconstruction project's actual cost must (for the 
purpose of meeting the above dollar or percentage tests) be classifiable 
as a capital expenditure for Internal Revenue Service (IRS) purposes. 
That otherwise allowable (i.e., for the purpose of meeting the above 
dollar or percentage tests) portion of a reconstruction project's actual 
cost which is not classifiable as a capital expenditure shall, however, 
be excluded from the amount qualified for withdrawal as a result of the 
reconstruction project.
    (3) No vessel more than 25 years old at the time of withdrawal or 
request for withdrawal shall be a qualified vessel for the purpose of 
reconstruction unless a special showing is made, to the Secretary's 
discretionary satisfaction, that the type and degree of reconstruction 
intended will result in an efficient and productive vessel with an 
economically useful life at least 10 years beyond the date 
reconstruction is completed.
    (c) Time permitted for construction or reconstruction. Construction 
or reconstruction must be completed within 18 months from the date 
construction or reconstruction first commences, unless otherwise 
consented to by the Secretary.
    (d) Energy saving improvements. An improvement made to a vessel to 
conserve energy shall, regardless of cost, be treated as a 
reconstruction for the purpose of qualifying a CCF withdrawal for such 
expenditure and shall be exempted from having to meet conditional 
fishery requirements for reconstruction as set forth in Sec. 259.32 and 
from all qualifying tests for reconstruction set forth in paragraph (b) 
of this section with the following exceptions:

[[Page 216]]

    (1) An energy saving improvement shall be required to meet both 
conditional fishery requirements and the qualifying tests for 
reconstruction if it serves the dual purpose of saving energy and 
meeting the reconstruction requirement of paragraph (a) of this section 
for qualifying a withdrawal for the acquisition of a used vessel.
    (2) That portion of the actual cost of an energy saving improvement 
which is to be paid for from the CCF must be classifiable and treated as 
a capital expenditure for Internal Revenue Service purposes.

(Sec. 607 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 U.S.C. 1177))

[39 FR 33675, Sept. 19, 1974, as amended at 46 FR 54563, Nov. 3, 1981]


<R05>
Sec. 259.32   Conditional fisheries.

    (a) The Secretary may from time-to-time establish certain fisheries 
in which CCF benefits will be restricted. The regulatory mechanism for 
so doing is part 251 of this chapter. Each fishery so restricted is 
termed a ``conditional fishery''. Subpart A of part 251 of this chapter 
establishes the procedure to be used by the Secretary in proposing and 
adopting a fishery as a conditional fishery. Subpart B of part 251 of 
this chapter enumerates each fishery actually adopted as a conditional 
fishery (part 251 of this chapter should be referred to for details). 
The purpose of this Sec. 259.32 is to establish the effect of 
conditional fishery adoption upon Interim CCF Agreements.
    (b) If a written request for an otherwise permissible action under 
an Interim CCF Agreement is submitted prior to the date upon which 
conditional fishery adoption occurs, then the Secretary will act, in an 
otherwise normal manner, upon so much of the action then applied for as 
is then permissible without regard to the subsequent adoption of a 
conditional fishery (even, if that adoption occurs before the Secretary 
gives his consent or issues an Interim CCF Agreement or amendment 
thereto, all as the case may be). Nevertheless, the conditions as set 
forth in paragraph (d) of this section shall apply.
    (c) If a written request for an otherwise permissible action under 
an Interim CCF Agreement, or an application for an Interim CCF 
Agreement, is submitted after the date upon which conditional fishery 
adoption occurs, then the Secretary will act, in an otherwise normal 
manner, upon so much of the action then applied for as is then 
permissible without regard to the previous adoption of a conditional 
fishery provided, however, that this paragraph shall apply only to 
construction or reconstruction for which a binding contract has been 
reduced to writing prior to the date upon which conditional fishery 
adoption occurred. Nevertheless, the conditions as set forth in 
paragraph (d) of this section shall apply.
    (d) Conditional fishery adoption shall have no effect whatsoever 
upon a Schedule B objective whose qualification for withdrawal (which 
may be in an amount equal to the total cost over time of a Schedule B 
objective, i.e., a series of withdrawals) has been, prior to the date of 
conditional fishery adoption, either consented to by the Secretary or 
requested in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. This 
extends to past, present, and future withdrawals in an amount 
representing up to 100 percent of the cost of a Schedule B objective. 
Commencement of any project in these categories shall, however, be 
started not later than 6 months from the date of conditional fishery 
adoption and shall be completed within 24 months from the date of 
conditional fishery adoption, unless for good and sufficient cause shown 
the Secretary, at his discretion, consents to a longer period for either 
project commencement or completion. Consent to the qualification of 
withdrawal for any project in these categories not commenced or 
completed within the periods allowed shall be revoked at the end of the 
periods allowed.
    (e) Conditional fishery adoption shall have no effect whatsoever 
upon Schedule B objectives which will not result in significantly 
increasing harvesting capacity in a fishery adopted as a conditional 
fishery.
    (1) Construction of a new vessel (vessel ``Y'') for operation in an 
adopted conditional fishery shall be deemed to significantly increase 
harvesting capacity in that fishery unless the party

[[Page 217]]

causing the ``Y'' vessel to be constructed causes (within 1 year after 
the delivery of vessel ``Y'') to be permanently removed from all 
fishing, or placed permanently in a fishery not then adopted as a 
conditional fishery, under such conditions as the Secretary may deem 
necessary or desirable, a vessel (vessel ``Z'') which has during the 
previous 18 months operated substantially in the same fishery as the 
``Y'' vessel and which has a fishing capacity substantially equivalent 
to the ``Y'' vessel. Failure to remove a vessel could subject all 
withdrawals to be treated as nonqualified and may be cause for 
termination of the CCF. What constitutes substantially equivalent 
fishing capacity shall be a matter for the Secretary's discretion. 
Ordinarily, in exercising his discretion about what does or does not 
constitute substantially equivalent fishing capacity, the Secretary will 
take into consideration (i) the average size of vessels constructed for 
the adopted conditional fishery in question at the time vessel ``Z'' was 
constructed (or, if constructed for a different fishery, the average 
size of vessels in the adopted conditional fishery at the time vessel 
``Z'' entered it), (ii) the average size of vessels constructed for the 
adopted conditional fishery at the time vessel ``Y'' was or will be 
constructed, and (iii) such other factors as the Secretary may deem 
material and equitable, including the length of time the party had owned 
or leased vessel ``Z'' and the length of time the vessel has operated in 
the conditional fishery. The Secretary will consider these factors, and 
exercise his discretion, in such a way as to encourage use of this 
program by established fishermen who have owned or leased for 
substantial periods vessels which need to be replaced, even though a 
``Z'' vessel may have been constructed at a time which dictated a lesser 
fishing capacity than dictated for a ``Y'' vessel at the time of its 
construction.
    (2) Acquisition and/or reconstruction of a used vessel for operation 
in an adopted conditional fishery shall be deemed to significantly 
increase harvesting capacity in that fishery unless the vessel to be 
acquired and/or reconstructed had during the previous 3 years operated 
substantially in the same fishery as the adopted conditional fishery in 
which it will operate after acquisition and/or reconstruction. If less 
than 3 years, then acquisition and/or reconstruction of a used vessel 
for operation in an adopted conditional fishery shall be deemed to 
significantly increase harvesting capacity in that fishery unless there 
occurs vessel removal or permanent placement elsewhere under the same 
conditions specified for construction in paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section.
    (3) Construction of a new vessel or the acquisition and/or 
reconstruction of a used vessel for operation in an adopted conditional 
fishery shall not be deemed to significantly increase the harvesting 
capacity where the vessel constructed, acquired and/or reconstructed 
replaces another vessel which was lost or destroyed and which had, 
immediately prior to the loss or destruction, operated in the same 
fishery as the adopted conditional fishery, provided, however, that the 
fishing capacity of the replacement vessel has a fishing capacity 
substantially equivalent to the vessel lost or destroyed and that the 
construction, acquisition and/or reconstruction is completed within 2 
years after the close of the taxable year in which the loss or 
destruction occurred. The Secretary may, at his discretion, and for good 
and sufficient cause shown, extend the replacement period, provided that 
the request for extension of time to replace is timely filed with the 
Secretary
    (f) Conditional fishery adoption shall have the following effect on 
all Schedule B objectives (whether for acquisition, construction, or 
reconstruction) which the Secretary deems to significantly increase 
harvesting capacity in that fishery, excluding those circumstances 
specifically exempted by paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section 
(which shall be governed by the provisions of paragraphs (b) through (e) 
of this section).
    (1) The Secretary may nevertheless consent to the qualification of 
withdrawal, but only up to an amount not exceeding the total of eligible 
ceilings actually deposited during tax years other than the taxable year 
in which conditional fishery adoption occurs

[[Page 218]]

plus a pro-rata portion of eligible ceilings generated in the tax year 
in which conditional fishery adoption occurs. Pro-ration shall be 
according to the number of months or any part thereof in a party's tax 
year which elapse before the adoption of the conditional fishery occurs. 
For example, if a party's tax year runs from January 1, 1974, to 
December 31, 1974, and conditional fishery adoption occurs on August 15, 
1974, (i.e., during the 8th month of the party's tax year), then the 
pro-rata portion for that year is eight-twelfths of the total eligible 
ceilings generated during that year.
    (2) Qualified withdrawals in excess of the amount specified in 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall not, during the continuance of 
the adopted conditional fishery, be consented to. Parties at this point 
shall have the following option:
    (i) Make, with the Secretary's consent, a nonqualified withdrawal of 
the excess and discontinue the future deposit of eligible ceilings 
(which may effect termination of the Interim CCF Agreement).
    (ii) Reserve the excess, as well as the future deposit of eligible 
ceilings, for a Schedule B objective not then involving an adopted 
conditional fishery. If amendment of an Interim CCF Agreement is 
necessary in order to include a Schedule B objective not then involving 
an adopted conditional fishery, the party may, with the Secretary's 
consent, make the necessary amendment.
    (iii) Reserve the excess, as well as the future deposit of eligible 
ceilings, for a Schedule B objective involving a then adopted 
conditional fishery in anticipation that the then adopted conditional 
fishery will eventually be disadopted, in which case all deposits of 
eligible ceilings will once again be eligible for the Secretary's 
consent as qualified withdrawals. If the adoption of a conditional 
fishery continues for a substantial length of time and there is no 
forseeable prospect of disadoption, then the Secretary, in his 
discretion, may require paragraph (f)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section to 
be effected.
    (g) The Secretary shall neither enter into a new Interim CCF 
Agreement, nor permit amendment of an existing one, which involves a 
Schedule B objective in a then adopted conditional fishery unless 
paragraph (b), (c) or (d) of this Sec. 259.32 applies or unless the 
Schedule B objective is expressly conditioned upon acquisition 
construction, or reconstruction of the type permitted under paragraph 
(e) of this Sec. 259.32. Such an express condition would not survive 
beyond the time at which conditional fishery status is removed.


<R05>
Sec. 259.33   Constructive deposits and withdrawals; ratification of withdrawals (as qualified) made without first having obtained Secretary's consent; first 
          tax year for which Interim CCF Agreement is effective.

    (a) Periods controlling permissibility. For the purpose of this 
Sec. 259.33, the period between the beginning and the end of a party's 
tax year is designated ``Period (aa)''; the period between the end of a 
party's tax year and the party's tax due date for that tax year is 
designated ``Period (bb)''; the period between the party's tax due date 
and the date on which ends the party's last extension (if any) of that 
tax due date is designated ``Period (cc)''.
    (b) Constructive deposits and withdrawals (before Interim CCF 
Agreement effectiveness date). Constructive deposits and withdrawals 
shall be permissible only during the Period (aa) during which a written 
application for an interim CCF Agreement is submitted to the Secretary 
and so much of the next succeeding Period (aa), if any, which occurs 
before the Secretary executes the Interim CCF Agreement previously 
applied for. All otherwise qualified expenditures of eligible ceilings 
during Period (aa) may be consented to by the Secretary as constructive 
deposits and withdrawals: Provided, The applicant's application for an 
Interim CCF Agreement and for consent to constructive deposit and 
withdrawal qualification (together with sufficient supporting data to 
enable the Secretary's execution or issuance of consent) is submitted to 
the Secretary either before the end of Period (bb) or, if extension was 
requested and received, before the end of Period (cc). If, however, the 
Secretary receives the completed application in proper form so close to 
the latest permissible period that the Interim CCF Agreement cannot be 
executed and/or the consent given before the end of Period (bb) or 
Period (cc), whichever

[[Page 219]]

applies, then the burden is entirely upon the applicant to negotiate 
with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for such relief as may be 
available (e.g., filing an amended tax return, if appropriate). The 
Secretary willl nevertheless execute the Interim CCF Agreement and issue 
his consent however long past the applicant's Period (bb) or Period 
(cc), whichever applies, the Secretary's administrative workload 
requires. Should IRS relief be, for any reason, unavailable, the 
Secretary shall regard the same as merely due to the applicant's having 
failed to apply in a more timely fashion.
    (c) Constructive deposits (after Interim CCF Agreement effectiveness 
date). The Secretary shall not permit constructive deposits or 
withdrawals after the effective date of an Interim CCF Agreement. 
Eligible ceilings must, after the effective date of an interim CCF 
Agreement, be physically deposited in money or kind in scheduled 
depositories before the last date eligible ceilings for any Period (aa) 
of any party become ineligible for deposit (the last date being Period 
(bb) or Period (cc), whichever applies).
    (d) Ratification of withdrawals (as qualified) made without first 
having obtained Secretary's consent. The Secretary may ratify as 
qualified any withdrawal made without first having obtained the 
Secretary's consent therefor, provided the withdrawal was such as would 
have resulted in the Secretary's consent had it been requested before 
withdrawal, and provided further that the party's request for consent 
(together with sufficient supporting data to enable issuance of the 
Secretary's consent) is submitted to the Secretary either before the end 
of Period (bb) or, if extension was requested and received, before the 
end of Period (cc).
    (1) If, however, the Secretary receives the request in proper form 
so close to the latest permissible period that the consent cannot be 
given before expiration of Period (bb) or Period (cc), whichever 
applies, then the burden is entirely upon the party to negotiate with 
IRS for such relief as may be available (e.g., filing an amended tax 
return, if appropriate). The Secretary will nevertheless issue his 
consent however long past the party's Period 
(bb) or Period (cc), whichever applies, the Secretary's administrative 
workload requires. Should IRS relief be, for any reason, unavailable, 
the Secretary shall regard the same as merely due to the party's having 
failed to apply in a more timely fashion.
    (2) All parties shall be counseled that it is manifestly in their 
best interest to request the Secretary's consent 45 days in advance of 
the expected date of withdrawal. Withdrawals made without the 
Secretary's consent, in reliance on obtaining the Secretary's consent, 
are made purely at a party's own risk. Should any withdrawal made 
without the Secretary's consent prove, for any reason, to be one to 
which the Secretary will not or cannot consent by ratification, then the 
result will be either, or both, at the Secretary's discretion, an 
unqualified withdrawal or an involuntary termination of the Interim CCF 
Agreement.
    (3) Should the withdrawal made without having first obtained the 
Secretary's consent be made in pursuance of a project not then an 
eligible Schedule B objective, then the Secretary may entertain an 
application to amend the Interim CCF Agreement's Schedule B objectives 
as the prerequisite to consenting by ratification to the withdrawal, all 
under the same time constraints and conditions as otherwise specified 
herein.
    (4) Any withdrawals made, after the effective date of an Interim CCF 
Agreement, without the Secretary's consent are automatically non-
qualified withdrawals unless the Secretary subsequently consents to them 
by ratification as otherwise specified herein.
    (5) Redeposit of that portion of the ceiling withdrawn without the 
Secretary's consent, and for which such consent is not subsequently 
given (either by ratification or otherwise), shall not be permitted. If 
such a non-qualified withdrawal adversely affects the Interim CCF 
Agreement's general status in any wise deemed by the Secretary, at his 
discretion, to be significant and material, the Secretary may 
involuntarily terminate the Interim CCF Agreement.
    (e) First tax year for which Interim CCF Agreement is effective. An 
Agreement, to be effective for any party's Period (aa), 

[[Page 220]]

must be executed and entered into by the party, and submitted to the 
Secretary, before the end of Period (bb) or Period (cc), whichever 
applies, for such Period (aa). If executed and entered into by the 
party, and/or received by the Secretary, after the end of Period (bb) or 
Period (cc), whichever applies, then the Agreement will be first 
effective for the next succeeding Period (aa).
    (1) If, however, the Secretary receives an Agreement executed and 
entered into by the party in proper form so close to the latest 
permissible period that the Secretary cannot execute the Agreement 
before expiration of Period (bb) or Period (cc), whichever applies, then 
the burden is entirely upon the party to negotiate with IRS for such 
relief as may be available (e.g., filing an amended tax return, if 
appropriate). The Secretary will nevertheless execute the Agreement 
however long past the party's Period (bb) or Period (cc), whichever 
applies, the Secretary's administrative workload requires. Should IRS 
relief be, for any reason, unavailable, the Secretary shall regard the 
same as merely due to the party's having failed to apply in a more 
timely manner.
    (2) All parties shall be counseled that it is manifestly in their 
best interest to enter into and execute an Agreement, and submit the 
same to the Secretary, at least 45 days in advance of the Period (bb) or 
Period (cc), whichever applies, for the Period (aa) for which the 
Agreement is first intended to be effective.


<R05>
Sec. 259.34   Minimum and maximum deposits; maximum time to deposit.

    (a) Minimum annual deposit. The minimum annual (based on each 
party's taxable year) deposit required by the Secretary in order to 
maintain an Interim CCF Agreement shall be an amount equal to 2 percent 
of the total anticipated cost of all Schedule B objectives unless such 2 
percent exceeds during any tax year 50 percent of a party's Schedule A 
taxable income, in which case the minimum deposit for that year shall be 
50 percent of the party's Schedule A taxable income.
    (1) Minimum annual deposit compliance shall be audited at the end of 
each party's taxable year unless any one or more of the Schedule B 
objectives is scheduled for commencement more than 3 taxable years in 
advance of the taxable year in which the agreement is effected, in which 
case minimum annual deposit compliance shall be audited at the end of 
each 3 year taxable period. In any taxable year, a Party may apply any 
eligible amount in excess of the 2 percent minimum annual deposit toward 
meeting the party's minimum annual deposit requirement in past or future 
years: Provided, however, At the end of each 3 year period, the 
aggregate amount in the fund must be in compliance with 2 percent 
minimum annual deposit rule (unless the 50 percent of taxable income 
situation applies).
    (2) The Secretary may, at his discretion and for good and sufficient 
cause shown, consent to minimum annual deposits in any given tax year or 
combination of tax years in an amount lower than prescribed herein: 
Provided, The party demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction the 
availability of sufficient funds from any combination of sources to 
accomplish Schedule B objectives at the time they are scheduled for 
accomplishment.
    (b) Maximum deposits. Other than the maximum annual ceilings 
established by the Act, the Secretary shall not establish a maximum 
annual ceiling: Provided, however, That deposits can no longer be made 
once a party has deposited 100 percent of the anticipated cost of all 
Schedule B objectives, unless the Interim CCF Agreement is then amended 
to establish additional Schedule B objectives.
    (c) Maximum time to deposit. Ten years shall ordinarily be the 
maximum time the Secretary shall permit in which to accumulate deposits 
prior to commencement of any given Schedule B objective. A time longer 
than 10 years, either by original scheduling or by subsequent extension 
through amendment, may, however, be permitted at the Secretary's 
discretion and for good and sufficient cause shown.


<R05>
Sec. 259.35  Annual deposit and withdrawal reports required.

    (a) The Secretary will require from each Interim CCF Agreement 
holder

[[Page 221]]

(Party) the following annual deposit and withdrawal reports. Failure to 
submit such reports may be cause for involuntary termination of CCF 
Agreements.
    (1) A preliminary deposit and withdrawal report at the end of each 
calendar year, which must be submitted not later than 45 days after the 
close of the calendar year. The report must give the amounts withdrawn 
from and deposited into the party's CCF during the subject year, and be 
in letter form showing the agreement holder's name, FVCCF identification 
number, and taxpayer identification number. Each report must bear 
certification that the deposit and withdrawal information given includes 
all deposit and withdrawal activity for the year and the account 
reported. Negative reports must be submitted in those cases where there 
is no deposit and/or withdrawal activity. If the party's tax year is the 
same as the calendar year, and if the final deposit and withdrawal 
report required under paragraph (a)(2) of this section is submitted 
before the due date for this preliminary report, then this report is not 
required.
    (2) A final deposit and withdrawal report at the end of the tax 
year, which shall be submitted not later than 30 days after expiration 
of the due date, with extensions (if any), for filing the party's 
Federal income tax return. The report must be made on a form prescribed 
by the Secretary using a separate form for each FVCCF depository. Each 
report must bear certification that the deposit and withdrawal 
information given includes all deposit and withdrawal activity for the 
year and account reported. Negative reports must be submitted in those 
cases where there is no deposit and/or withdrawal activity.
    (b) Failure to submit the required annual deposit and withdrawal 
reports shall be cause after due notice for either, or both, 
disqualification of withdrawals or involuntary termination of the 
Interim CCF Agreement, at the Secretary's discretion.
    (c) Additionally, the Secretary shall require from each Interim CCF 
Agreement holder, not later than 30 days after expiration of the party's 
tax due date, with extensions (if any), a copy of the party's Federal 
Income Tax Return filed with IRS for the preceding tax year. Failure to 
submit shall after due notice be cause for the same adverse action 
specified in the paragraph above.

[39 FR 33675, Sept. 19, 1974, as amended at 48 FR 57302, Dec. 29, 1983; 
53 FR 35203, Sept. 12, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 259.36   CCF accounts.

    (a) General: Each CCF account in each scheduled depository shall 
have an account number, which must be reflected on the reports required 
by Sec. 259.35. All CCF accounts shall be reserved only for CCF 
transactions. There shall be no intermingling of CCF and non-CCF 
transactions and there shall be no pooling of 2 or more CCF accounts 
without prior consent of the Secretary. Safe deposit boxes, safes, or 
the like shall not be eligible CCF depositories without the Secretary's 
consent and then only under such conditions as the Secretary, in his 
discretion, prescribes.
    (b) Assignment: The use of Fund assets for transactions in the 
nature of a countervailing balance, compensating balance, pledge, 
assignment, or similar security arrangement shall constitute a material 
breach of the Agreement unless prior written consent of the Secretary is 
obtained.
    (c) Depositories: (1) Section 607(c) of the Act provides that 
amounts in a CCF must be kept in the depository or depositories 
specified in the Agreements and be subject to such trustee or other 
fiduciary requirements as the Secretary may specify.
    (2) Unless otherwise specified in the Agreement, the party may 
select the type or types of accounts in which the assets of the Fund may 
be deposited.
    (3) Non-cash deposits or investments of the Fund should be placed in 
control of a trustee under the following conditions:
    (i) The trustee should be specified in the Agreement;
    (ii) The trust instrument should provide that all investment 
restrictions stated in section 607(c) of the Act will be observed;

[[Page 222]]

    (iii) The trust instrument should provide that the trustee will give 
consideration to the party's withdrawal requirements under the Agreement 
when investing the Fund;
    (iv) The trustee must agree to be bound by all rules and regulations 
which have been or will be promulgated governing the investment or 
management of the Fund.


<R05>
Sec. 259.37   Conditional consents to withdrawal qualification.

    The Secretary may conditionally consent to the qualification of 
withdrawal, such consent being conditional upon the timely submission to 
the Secretary of such further proofs, assurances, and advices as the 
Secretary, in his discretion, may require. Failure of a party to comply 
with the conditions of such a consent within a reasonable time and after 
due notice shall, at the Secretary's discretion, be cause for either, or 
both, nonqualification of withdrawal or involuntary Interim CCF 
Agreement termination.


<R05>
Sec. 259.38   Miscellaneous.

    (a) Wherever the Secretary prescribes time constraints herein for 
the submission of any CCF transactions, the postmark date shall control 
if mailed or, if personally delivered, the actual date of submission. 
All required materials may be submitted to any Financial Assistance 
Division office of the National Marine Fisheries Service.
    (b) All CCF information received by the Secretary shall be held 
strictly confidential, except that it may be published or disclosed in 
statistical form provided such publication does not disclose, directly 
or indirectly, the identity of any fundholder.
    (c) While recognizing that precise regulations are necessary in 
order to treat similarly situated parties similarly, the Secretary also 
realizes that precision in regulations can often cause inequitable 
effects to result from unavoidable, unintended, or minor discrepancies 
between the regulations and the circumstances they attempt to govern. 
The Secretary will, consequently, at his discretion, as a matter of 
privilege and not as a matter of right, attempt to afford relief to 
parties where literal application of the purely procedural, as opposed 
to substantive, aspects of these regulations would otherwise work an 
inequitable hardship. This privilege will be sparingly granted and no 
party should before the fact attempt to act in reliance on its being 
granted after the fact.
    (d) These Secs. 259.30 through 259.38 are applicable absolutely to 
all Interim CCF Agreements first entered into (or the amendment of all 
then existing Interim CCF Agreements, which amendment is first entered 
into) on or after the date these Secs. 259.30 through 259.38 are 
adopted. These Secs. 259.30 through 259.38 are applicable to all Interim 
CCF Agreements entered into before the date these Secs. 259.30 through 
259.38 are adopted, with the following exceptions only:
    (1) The vessel age limitations imposed by Sec. 259.31 shall not 
apply to already scheduled Schedule B objectives.
    (2) The minimum deposits imposed by Sec. 259.34 shall not apply to 
any party's tax year before that party's tax year next following the one 
in which these Secs. 259.30 through 259.38 are adopted.
    (e) These Secs. 259.30 through 259.38 are specifically incorporated 
in all past, present, and future Interim CCF Agreements by reference 
thereto made in Whereas Clause number 2 of all such Interim CCF 
Agreements.

evaluating the product, or sample, in accordance with the requirements 
of such standards, specifications, or instructions: Provided, That when 
inspection for quality is based on any U.S. grade standard which 
contains a scoring system the grade to be assigned to a lot is the grade 
indicated by the average of the total scores of the sample units: 
Provided further, That:
    (1) Such sample complies with the applicable standards of quality 
promulgated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act;
    (2) Such sample complies with the product description;
    (3) Such sample meets the indicated grade with respect to factors of

indicated grade because of any quality factor to which a limiting rule 
applies;
    (ii) None of the sample units falls more than 4 score points below 
the minimum total score for the indicated grade; and
    (iii) The number of sample units classed as deviants does not exceed 
the applicable acceptance number indicated in the sampling plans 
contained in Sec. 260.61. A ``deviant,'' as used in this paragraph, 
means a sample unit that falls into the next grade below the indicated 
grade but does not score more than 4 points below the minimum total 
score for the indicated grade.
    (5) If any of the provisions contained in paragraphs (b)(3) and (4)

certificate shall supersede the inspection certificate which was issued 
in error and the superseded certificate shall become null and void after 
the issuance of the corrected certificate.


<R05>
Sec. 260.28   Issuance of an inspection report in lieu of an inspection certificate.

                                Sampling


<R05>
Sec. 260.57   How samples are drawn by inspectors or licensed samplers.

    An inspector or a licensed sampler shall select samples, upon 
request, from designated lots of processed products which are so placed 
as to permit thorough and proper sampling in accordance with the 
regulations in this part. Such person shall, unless otherwise directed 
by the Secretary, select sample units of such products at random, and 
from various locations in each lot in such manner and number, not 
inconsistent with the regulations in this part, as to secure a 
representative sample of the lot. Samples drawn for inspection shall be 
furnished by the applicant at no cost to the Department.


<R05>
Sec. 260.58   Accessibility for sampling.

    Each applicant shall cause the processed products for which 
inspection is requested to be made accessible for proper sampling. 
Failure to make any lot accessible for proper sampling shall be 
sufficient cause for postponing inspection service until such time as 
such lot is made accessible for proper sampling.


<R05>
Sec. 260.59   How officially drawn samples are to be identified.

    Officially drawn samples shall be marked by the inspector or 
licensed sampler so such samples can be properly identified for 
inspection.


<R05>
Sec. 260.60   How samples are to be shipped.

    Unless otherwise directed by the Secretary, samples which are to be 
shipped to any office of inspection shall be forwarded to the office of 
inspection serving the area in which the processed prodcuts from which 
the samples were drawn is located. Such samples shall be shipped in a 
manner to avoid, if possible, any material change in the quality or 
condition of the sample of the processed product. All transportation 
charges in connection with such shipments of samples shall be at the 
expense of the applicant and wherever practicable, such charges shall be 
prepaid by him.


<R05>
Sec. 260.61   Sampling plans and procedures for determining lot compliance.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided for in this section in connection 
with in-plant inspection and unless otherwise approved by the Secretary, 
samples shall be selected from each lot in the exact number of sample 
units indicated for the lot size in the applicable single sampling plan 
or, at the discretion of the inspection service, any comparable multiple 
sampling plan: Provided, That at the discretion of the inspection 
service the number of sample units selected may be increased to the 
exact number of sample units indicated for any one of the larger sample 
sizes provided for in the appropriate plans.
    (b) Under the single sampling plans with respect to any specified 
requirement:

[[Page 233]]

    (1) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the 
specific requirements) in the sample does not exceed the acceptance 
number prescribed for the sample size the lot meets the requirement;
    (2) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the 
specific requirement) in the sample exceeds the acceptance number 
prescribed for the sample size the lot fails the requirement.
    (c) Under the multiple sampling plans inspection commences with the 
smallest sample size indicated under the appropriate plan and with 
respect to any specified requirement:
    (1) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the 
specific requirement) in the sample being considered does not exceed the 
acceptance number prescribed for that sample size the lot meets the 
requirement;
    (2) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the 
specific requirement) in the sample being considered equals or exceeds 
the rejection number prescribed for that sample size the lot fails the 
requirement; or
    (3) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the 
specific requirement) in the sample being considered falls between the 
acceptance and rejection numbers of the plan, additional sample units 
are added to the sample so that the sample thus cumulated equals the 
next larger cumulative sample size in the plan. It may then be 
determined that the lot meets or fails the specific requirement by 
considering the cumulative sample and applying the procedures outlined 
in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section or by considering 
successively larger samples cumulated in the same manner until the lot 
meets or fails the specific requirement.
    (d) If in the conduct of any type of in-plant inspection the sample 
is examined before the lot size is known and the number of sample units 
exceeds the prescribed sample size for such lot but does not equal any 
of the prescribed larger sample sizes the lot may be deemed to meet or 
fail a specific requirement in accordance with the following procedure:
    (1) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the 
specific requirement) in the nonprescribed sample does not exceed the 
acceptance number of the next smaller sample size the lot meets the 
requirements;
    (2) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the 
specific requirement) in the nonprescribed sample equals the acceptance 
number prescribed for the next larger sample size additional sample 
units shall be selected to increase the sample to the next larger 
prescribed sample size;
    (3) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the 
specific requirement) in the nonprescribed sample exceeds the acceptance 
number prescribed for the next larger sample size the lot fails the 
requirement.
    (e) In the event that the lot compliance determination provisions of 
a standard or specification are based on the number of specified 
deviations instead of deviants the procedures set forth in this section 
may be applied by substituting the word ``deviation'' for the word 
``deviant'' wherever it appears.
    (f) Sampling plans referred to in this section are those contained 
in Tables I, II, III, IV, V, and VI which follow or any other plans 
which are applicable. For processed products not included in these 
tables, the minimum sample size shall be the exact number of sample 
units prescribed in the table, container group, and lot size that, as 
determined by the inspector, most closely resembles the product, type, 
container size and amount of product to be samples.

regulations of this subchapter, the Director may, without a hearing, 
temporarily suspend, either before or after the institution of a 
debarment hearing, the inspection service provided under the regulations 
of this subchapter or under any inspection contract for one or more 
plants under the control of such person. Notice of suspension shall be 
served by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, and 
the notice shall specifically state those acts or activities of such 
person which are the bases for the suspension. The suspension shall 
become effective five (5) days after receipt of the notice.
    (2) Once a person has received a notice of a temporary suspension, a 
debarment hearing will be set for 30 days after the effective date of 
the suspension. Within 60 days after the completion of the debarment 
hearing, the Hearing Examiner shall determine, based upon evidence of 
record, whether the temporary suspension shall be continued or 
terminated. A temporary suspension shall be terminated by the Hearing 
Examiner if he determines that the acts or activities, which were the 
bases for the suspension, did not occur or will not cause serious and 
irreparable injury to the inspection program and services provided under 
the regulations of this subchapter. This determination of the Hearing 
Examiner on the continuation or termination of the temporary suspension 
shall be final and there shall be no appeal of this determination. The 
initial decision by the Hearing Examiner on the debarment shall be made 
in accordance with paragraph (b)(1), Decisions, of this section.
    (3) After a debarment hearing has been instituted against any person 
by a suspension, such suspension will remain in effect until a final 
decision is rendered on the debarment in accordance with the regulations 
of this section or the temporary suspension is terminated by the Hearing 
Examiner.
    (4) When a debarment hearing has been instituted against any person 
not under suspension, the Director may, in accordance with the 
regulations of this paragraph (b) temporarily suspend such person, and 
the suspension will remain in effect until a final decision on the 
debarment is rendered in accordance with the regulations of this section 
or the temporary suspension is terminated by the Hearing Examiner.

    The establishment management shall be responsible for taking all 
precautions to assure the following:
    (a) Disease control. No person affected by disease in a communicable 
form, or while a carrier of such disease, or while affected with boils, 
sores, infected wounds, or other abnormal sources of microbiological 
contamination, shall work in a food plant in any capacity in which there 
is a reasonable possibility of food ingredients becoming contaminated by 
such person, or of disease being transmitted by such person to other 
individuals.
    (b) Cleanliness. All persons, while working in direct contact with 
food preparation, food ingredients, or surfaces coming into contact 
therewith shall:
    (1) Wear clean outer garments, maintain a high degree of personal 
cleanliness, and conform to hygenic practices while on duty, to the 
extent necessary to prevent contamination of food products.
    (2) Wash and sanitize their hands thoroughly to prevent 
contamination by undesirable microorganisms before starting work, after 
each absence from the work station, and at any other time when the hands 
may have become soiled or contaminated.
    (3) Remove all insecure jewelry and, when food is being manipulated 
by hand, remove from hands any jewelry that cannot be adequately 
sanitized.
    (4) If gloves are used in food handling, maintain them in an intact, 
clean, and sanitary condition. Such gloves shall be of an impermeable 
material except where their usage would be inappropriate or incompatible 
with the work involved.
    (5) Wear hair nets, caps, masks, or other effective hair restraints. 
Other persons that may incidentally enter the processing areas shall 
comply with this requirement.
    (6) Not store clothing or other personal belongings, eat food, drink 
beverages, chew gum, or use tobacco in any form in areas where food or 
food ingredients are exposed or in areas used for washing equipment or 
utensils.
    (7) Take any other necessary precautions to prevent contamination of 
foods with microorganisms or foreign substances including, but not 
limited to perspiration, hair, cosmetics, tobacco, chemicals, and 
medicants.
    (c) Education and training. Personnel responsible for identifying 
sanitation failures or food contamination should have a background of 
education or experience, or a combination thereof, to provide a level of 
competency necessary for production of clean wholesome food. Food 
handlers and supervisors should receive appropriate training in proper 
food-handling techniques and food-protection principles and should be 
cognizant of the danger of poor personal hygiene and unsanitary 
practices, and other vectors of contamination.

    Source: 61 FR 9369, Mar. 8, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 261.101  Standard description.

    A U.S. Standard for Grades authorized under this part is a standard 
for a fish or fishery product that has been developed and adopted by the 
voluntary seafood inspection program pursuant to the Agricultural 
Marketing Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C. 1621 et seq.) and other authorities 
delegated to the U.S. Department of Commerce.


<R05>
Sec. 261.102  Publication and removal of U.S. Grade Standards.

    (a) The voluntary U.S. Standards for Grades adopted pursuant to this 
part shall be issued as Program policies and contained within the NMFS 
Fishery Products Inspection Manual. Compliance with voluntary standards 
issued as Program policies within the manual shall satisfy the 
requirements of this

[[Page 255]]

part. Compliance with a voluntary standard issued as a Program policy 
does not relieve any party from the responsibility to comply with the 
provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; or other Federal 
laws and regulations.
    (b) Notification of an application for a new grade standard shall be 
published in the Federal Register. If adopted, the grade standard shall 
be issued as a Program policy and contained in the NMFS Fishery Products 
Inspection Manual.
    (c) Recision and revision of a U.S. Standard for Grades will be made 
a Program policy amendment and contained in the NMFS Fishery Products 
Inspection Manual.
    (d) The NMFS Fishery Products Inspection Manual is available to 
interested parties.

<R05>
Sec. 261.103  Basis for determination of a U.S. Standard for Grades.

    (a) To address the inherently distinct and dissimilar attributes 
found in the fishery product groups, each standard for grades should 
have a different scope and product description, product forms, sample 
sizes, definition of defects, etc. The Secretary will make the final 
determination regarding the content of a U.S. Standard for Grades.
    (b) A proposal for a new or revised U.S. grade standard may include 
the following:
    (1) Scope and product description, which describes the products that 
are eligible for grading using the standard (e.g., fish portion, fish 
fillet).
    (2) Product forms, which describe the types, styles and market forms 
covered by the standard (e.g., skin-off, tail-on, headless).
    (3) Grade and inspection marks, which describe the grades and 
inspection mark criteria for each grade category (e.g., Grade A 
<ls-thn-eq> 15 points).
    (4) Grade determination, which describes the means by which the 
grade is determined (i.e., the factors rated by score points and those 
that are not). Standards may contain defect grouping limiting rules that 
contain additional provisions that must be met.
    (5) Sampling, which describes the method of sampling and sample unit 
sizes (e.g., 10 portions, 8 ounces, etc.).
    (6) Procedures that describe the process used to determine the 
product grade (e.g., label declarations, sensory evaluation).
    (7) Definitions of defects, which outline the defects associated 
with the products covered by the standard, defines them, and describes 
the method of counting or measuring the defects. This section may 
provide associated defect points or reference a defect table (e.g., 
bruises, blood spots, bones, black spots, coating defects, 1-inch 
squares, percent by weight, ratios).
    (8) Defect point assessment, which describes how to assess points 
and provides any special guidance that may be necessary to the 
particular standard (e.g., defect points for certain categories are 
added together and divided by the weight of the sample unit; the number 
of instances are counted to determine if it is slight, moderate, or 
excessive defect).
    (9) Tolerances for lot certification, which provide the sections 
from Title 50 CFR that regulate lot certification.
    (10) Hygiene, which specifies the sections of applicable Federal 
regulations regulating the safe, wholesome production of food for human 
consumption.
    (11) Methods of analysis, which describe the methods of analysis 
that will be used in the evaluation of the products covered by the 
standard for grades (e.g., net weight, deglazing, debreading).
    (12) Defect table, which is the table of defects and associated 
points to be assessed for each defect.

<R05>
Sec. 285.4  Facilitation of enforcement.

    (a) The Secretary, the Secretary of the Department in which the U.S. 
Coast Guard is operating, and the U.S. Customs Service will enforce 
jointly this part and the provisions of the Act.
    (b) Enforcement agents of NMFS will enforce provisions of this part 
and the Act on behalf of the Secretary and may take any actions 
authorized with respect to enforcement. By agreement, the Secretary may 
utilize the personnel, services, and facilities of any other Federal 
Agency to enforce these rules and the Act. By agreement, the Secretary 
also may designate personnel of a State to enforce these rules and the 
Act.
    (c) The operator of, or any other person aboard, any fishing vessel 
subject to this part must immediately comply with instructions and 
signals issued by an authorized officer to stop the vessel and with 
instructions to facilitate safe boarding and inspection of the vessel, 
its gear, equipment, fishing record (where applicable), and catch for 
purposes of enforcing the Act and this part.
    (d) Communications. (1) Upon being approached by a U.S. Coast Guard 
vessel or aircraft, or other vessel or aircraft with an authorized 
officer aboard, the operator of a fishing vessel must be alert for 
communications conveying enforcement instructions.
    (2) VHF-FM radiotelephone is the preferred method of communicating 
between vessels. If the size of the vessel and the wind, sea, and 
visibility conditions allow, a loudhailer may be used instead of the 
radio. Hand signals, placards, high frequency radiotelephone, or voice 
may be employed by an authorized officer, and message blocks may be 
dropped from an aircraft.
    (3) If other communications are not practicable, visual signals may 
be transmitted by flashing light directed at the vessel signaled. Coast 
Guard units will normally use the flashing light signal ``L'' as the 
signal to stop. In the International Code of Signals, ``L'' (. -- . .) 
\1\ means ``you should stop your vessel instantly.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Period (.) means a short flash of light; dash (--) means a long 
flash of light.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (4) Failure of a vessel's operator promptly to stop the vessel when 
directed to do so by an authorized officer using loudhailer, 
radiotelephone, flashing light signal, or other means constitutes Prima 
facie evidence of the offense of refusal to allow an authorized officer 
to board.
    (5) The operator of a vessel who does not understand a signal from 
an enforcement unit and who is unable to obtain clarification by 
loudhailer or radiotelephone must consider the signal to be a command to 
stop the vessel instantly.
    (e) Boarding. The operator of a vessel directed to stop must
    (1) Guard Channel 16, VHF-FM if so equipped;
    (2) Stop immediately and lay to or maneuver in such a way as to 
allow the authorized officer and his party to come aboard;
    (3) Except for those vessels with a freeboard of four feet or less, 
provide a safe ladder, if needed, for the authorized officer and his 
party to come aboard;

[[Page 262]]

    (4) When necessary to facilitate the boarding or when requested by 
an authorized officer, provide a manrope or safety line, and 
illumination for the ladder; and
    (5) Take such other actions as necessary to facilitate boarding and 
to ensure the safety of the authorized officer and the boarding party.
    (f) Signals. The following signals, extracted from the International 
Code of Signals, may be sent by flashing light by an enforcement unit 
when conditions do not allow communications by loudhailer or 
radiotelephone. Knowledge of these signals by vessel operators is not 
required. However, knowledge of these signals and appropriate action by 
a vessel operator may preclude the necessity of sending the signal ``L'' 
and the necessity for the vessel to stop instantly.
    (1) ``AA'' repeated (.- .-) is the call to an unknown station. The 
operator of the signaled vessel should respond by identifying the vessel 
by radiotelephone or by illuminating the vessel's identification.
    (2) ``RY-CY'' (.-. -.-- -.-. -.--) means ``you should proceed at 
slow speed, a boat is coming to you.'' This signal is normally employed 
when conditions allow an enforcement boarding without the necessity of 
the vessel being boarded coming to a complete stop, or, in some cases, 
without retrieval of fishing gear which may be in the water.
    (3) ``SQ3'' (... --.- ...--) means ``you should stop or heave to; I 
am going to board you.''

Sec. 285.5  Civil procedures.

    (a) The method for assessment of civil penalties for violation of 
these rules or the Act must be in accordance with the procedures set 
forth in 15 CFR part 904.
    (b) In view of the perishable nature of tuna when not processed 
otherwise than by chilling or freezing, authorized officers may cause to 
be sold, for not less than its reasonable market value, unchilled or 
unfrozen tunas that may be seized and forfeited under the Act and this 
part.
    (c) The purchaser must remit the proceeds of any sale made under 
paragraph (b) of this section to the Director. The Director will deposit 
and retain the proceeds in the Suspense Account of NMFS (Account No. DO 
6875--Phase 19) after deducting the reasonable cost of the sale, if any, 
pending judgement of the court or other disposition of the case.

first violation and a civil penalty of not more than $50,000 for any 
subsequent violation;
    (b) Violates any provision of Sec. 285.3 (c) or (d) of this part 
will be assessed a civil penalty of not more than $1,000 for a first 
violation and a civil penalty of not more than $5,000 for any subsequent 
violation; or
    (c) Violates any provision of Sec. 285.3(e) will be assessed a civil 
penalty of not more than $100,000.

Sec. 285.7  Experimental fishing exemption.

    (a) Upon a written request received at least 30 days before the 
desired effective date, the Director, in order to provide for the 
conduct of experimental fishing to gather data needed to make management 
decisions for the Atlantic tuna resources or fisheries, may exempt any 
person or vessel from specific requirements of this part.
    (b) A request for an exemption must be in writing and received by 
the Director at least thirty (30) days before the desired effective 
date. The request must specify any vessel(s) involved, describe the gear 
to be used, the manner in which the gear will be fished, the duration of 
the activity, the area where the activity will be conducted, the species 
of tuna that will be caught, the anticipated bycatch, the port(s) 
involved and the disposition of the catch, both domestic and foreign. 
The request must include any fee specified by the Director pursuant to 
Sec. 285.7(e).

[[Page 263]]

    (c) The Director may not grant such exemption unless it is 
determined that the purpose, design, and administration of the 
experimental fishing is consistent with the objectives of the management 
program, ICCAT recommendations, the provisions of the Atlantic Tunas 
Convention Act, and other applicable law, and that granting the 
exemption will not:
    (1) Have a detrimental effect on the Atlantic tunas resources and 
fisheries; or
    (2) Create significant enforcement problems.
    (d) Each vessel participating in any experimental fishing activity 
is subject to all provisions of this part except those specified in the 
exemption granted that activity by the Director. The conditions, 
duration of the experimental fishing, and the provisions of this part to 
which the exemption applies, will be specified in a letter issued by the 
Director to each vessel or person participating in the exempted 
activity. This letter must be carried aboard the vessel conducting the 
exempted activity. Any exemption authorization that has been altered, 
erased, or mutilated is invalid. A letter of exemption issued under this 
part is not transferable or assignable. Any violation of any condition 
in a letter of exemption shall render it null and void upon receipt of 
written notification from the Director.
    (e) The Director may charge a fee to recover the administrative 
expenses of issuing a letter of exemption. The amount of the fee will be 
calculated, at least annually, in accordance with the procedures of the 
NOAA Finance Handbook for determining administrative costs of each 
special product or service. The fee may not exceed such costs. Persons 
seeking an exemption may contact the Director at (301) 713-2334 to find 
out the applicable fee. Failure to pay the fee will preclude issuance of 
the exemption. Payment by a commercial instrument later determined to be 
insufficiently funded shall invalidate any letter of exemption.

Sec. 285.8  At-sea observer coverage.

    (a) Notwithstanding the selection for placement or the placement of 
on-board fishery observers under the authority of any other Federal 
statute or fisheries regulation, NMFS may require observers for any 
vessel engaged in directed fishing for, or incidentally taking, Atlantic 
tunas at any time.
    (b) Owners of vessels selected for observer coverage are required to 
notify the appropriate Fisheries Science Center Director before 
commencing any fishing trip that may result in the harvest of any 
Atlantic tuna. Notification procedures will be specified in selection 
letters to vessel owners.
    (c) An owner or operator of a vessel on which a NMFS-approved 
observer is embarked must:
    (1) Provide accommodations and food that are equivalent to those 
provided to the crew;
    (2) Allow the observer access to and use of the vessel's 
communications equipment and personnel upon request for the transmission 
and receipt of messages related to the observer's duties;
    (3) Allow the observer access to and use of the vessel's navigation 
equipment and personnel upon request to determine the vessel's position;
    (4) Allow the observer free and unobstructed access to the vessel's 
bridge, working decks, holding bins, weight scales, holds, and any other 
space used to hold, process, weigh, or store fish; and
    (5) Allow the observer to inspect and copy the vessel's log, 
communications logs, and any records associated with the catch and 
distribution of fish for that trip.

    Source: 50 FR 43400, Oct. 25, 1985, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 285.20   Fishing seasons.

    (a) Commencement. Fishing in the regulatory area for Atlantic 
bluefin tuna will begin
    (1) On January 1 of each year:
    (i) For anglers fishing for Atlantic bluefin tuna under the quota 
specified in Sec. 285.22(d);

[[Page 264]]

    (ii) For vessels permitted in the Incidental Catch category fishing 
under the quota specified in Sec. 285.22(e); and
    (iii) For anglers participating in the tag and release program under 
Sec. 285.27.
    (2) On June 1 of each year:
    (i) For vessels permitted in the General category fishing under the 
quota specified in Sec. 285.22(a), and
    (ii) For vessels permitted in the Harpoon Boat category fishing 
under the quota specified in Sec. 285.22(b).
    (3) On August 15 of each year:
    (i) For vessels permitted in the Purse Seine category fishing under 
the quota specified in Sec. 285.22(c).
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (4) Consistent with the Convention, the Act and this part, the 
Assistant Administrator may change the commencement date under this 
section for any vessel permit category or person (angler) if the 
Assistant Administrator determines that the changed date will enable 
scientific research on the status of the stock to be conducted more 
effectively and will not prevent the quotas for the affected fishery 
from being caught, based upon historical catch data or other relevant 
information. The Assistant Administrator will publish a notice in the 
Federal Register of any change in the commencement date(s) for fishing 
under this section at least 60 days before commencement of the affected 
fishery.
    (b) Closure. 
    (1) The Assistant Administrator will monitor catch and landing 
statistics, including catch and landing statistics from previous years 
and projections based on those statistics, of Atlantic bluefin tuna by 
vessels other than those permitted in the Purse Seine category. On the 
basis of these statistics, the Assistant Administrator will project a 
date when the catch of Atlantic bluefin tuna will equal any quota under 
Sec. 285.22, and will publish a notice in the Federal Register stating 
that fishing for or retaining Atlantic bluefin tuna under the quota must 
cease on that date at a specified hour.
    (2) Angling for Atlantic bluefin tuna under a tag and release 
program under Sec. 285.27 may continue even after fishing for a quota 
has ceased.
    (3) A vessel permitted in the Purse Seine category may fish under 
the bluefin tuna quota specified in Sec. 285.22(c), or in fisheries for 
Atlantic yellowfin or skipjack tuna or other fisheries where bluefin 
tuna might be taken as bycatch, only until the allocation of bluefin 
tuna assigned or transferred under Sec. 285.25(d) to that vessel is 
reached. Upon reaching its individual vessel allocation of Atlantic 
bluefin tuna, directed purse seine fisheries for Atlantic tunas are 
closed to such vessel and the vessel will be deemed to have been given 
notice to that effect.
    (c) State actions. Nothing in this section may be construed to 
invalidate any more restrictive commencement or closure date established 
by any State in waters under its jurisdiction.

Sec. 285.21  Vessel permits.

    (a) Permit requirements. A vessel that fishes for, takes, retains or 
possesses Atlantic bluefin tuna must have on board a valid permit issued 
to the vessel owner under this section.
    (b) Categories of permits. (1) Upon submission of a complete and 
valid application pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, the 
Regional Director will issue to the owner of each qualifying vessel a 
permit for one of the following permit categories: General, Charter/
Headboat, Angling, Harpoon Boat, Purse Seine, or Incidental Catch. A 
permit will not be issued for more than one category.
    (2) Persons may fish for, retain or possess Atlantic bluefin tuna 
only under the quota, catch limits, and size classes applicable to the 
permit category of the carrying vessel, except that anglers on board 
General and Charter/Headboat category vessels may fish for and retain 
school, large school and small medium bluefin tuna, subject to the 
limits applicable to the Angling category only until such time that a 
large medium or giant bluefin tuna is caught, retained or possessed on 
board the vessel.
    (3) School, large school and small medium bluefin tuna landed by 
anglers on board General and Charter/Headboat category vessels are 
counted against the Angling category quota. When the General category 
fishery is open, large

[[Page 265]]

medium and giant bluefin tuna landed by anglers on board General and 
Charter/Headboat category vessels are counted against the General 
category quota. When the General category fishery is closed, or at any 
time in the Gulf of Mexico, large medium and giant bluefin tuna landed 
by anglers on board Angling and Charter/Headboat category vessels 
pursuant to Sec. 285.24(d)(2) may not be sold and are counted against 
the Angling category quota.
    (4) Persons fishing for Atlantic bluefin tuna must not possess on 
board or use any gear inappropriate to the category for which the 
carrying vessel is permitted:
    (i) General--rod and reel (including downriggers), handline, 
harpoon, bandit gear;
    (ii) Charter/Headboat--rod and reel (including downriggers), 
handline;
    (iii) Angling--rod and reel (including downriggers), handline;
    (iv) Harpoon Boat--harpoon;
    (v) Purse Seine--purse seine nets;
    (vi) Incidental Catch--purse seine nets, fixed gear, traps, 
longlines.
    (5) When fishing for, or possessing, Atlantic bluefin tuna, 
operators of vessels permitted for the Charter/Headboat category must 
have on board a current copy of the operator's merchant marine license 
or the operator's uninspected passenger vessel license.
    (6) Vessels permitted for any category other than the Angling 
category are eligible to conduct commercial fishing for Atlantic bluefin 
tuna.
    (c) Application procedure. Permits issued under this section must be 
renewed upon expiration. A vessel owner applying for an Atlantic bluefin 
tuna permit under this section must submit a completed permit 
application signed by the owner or agent on an appropriate form obtained 
from the Regional Director. The application must be submitted to the 
Regional Director at least 30 days before the date on which the 
applicant desires to have the permit made effective. The application 
must include the name, address and telephone number of the vessel 
owner(s) (for each owner that owns more than a 25 percent interest in 
the vessel); the name of the vessel; the port where the vessel is 
docked; the official U.S. Coast Guard documentation or state 
registration number; the gross tonnage, if known; the length of the 
vessel; the engine horsepower; the year the vessel was built; the type 
of vessel construction; the type of vessel propulsion; the vessel's fish 
hold capacity; the type(s) of fishing gear used; the normal crew size; 
number of party or charter passengers licensed to carry (if applicable); 
and the category of the permit. In addition, applicants must submit a 
copy of the official state registration or U.S. Coast Guard 
documentation, party/charter boat license, and, if a boat is owned by a 
corporation or partnership, the corporate or partnership documents (copy 
of Certificate of Incorporation and Articles of Association or 
Incorporation, including the names and addresses of all shareholders 
owning 25 percent or more of the corporation's shares). Except for purse 
seine vessels, an owner may change the category of the vessel's permit 
by notifying the Regional Director in writing before May 15. After May 
15, the vessel's permit category may not be changed for the remainder of 
the calendar year, regardless of any change in the vessel's ownership, 
unless there is sufficient evidence for the Regional Director to 
determine that an error involving contradictory information was made on 
the application.
    (d) Issuance. (1) Except as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 
904, the Regional Director will issue a permit within 30 days of receipt 
of a completed application.
    (2) The Regional Director will notify the applicant of any 
deficiency in the application. If the applicant fails to correct the 
deficiency within 15 days following the date of notification, the 
application will be considered abandoned.
    (e) Duration. A permit issued under this section remains valid until 
it is suspended or revoked, or it expires. A permit issued under this 
section expires when the name of the owner or vessel changes, or upon 
the renewal date specified on the permit by the Regional Director.
    (f) Alteration. A permit issued under this section which is 
substantially altered, erased, or mutilated is invalid.
    (g) Replacement. The Regional Director may issue replacement permits

[[Page 266]]

when requested in writing by the owner or authorized representative, 
stating the need for replacement, the name of the vessel, and the 
fishing permit number assigned. An application for a replacement permit 
will not be considered a new application. An appropriate fee, consistent 
with paragraph (k) of this section, may be charged for issuance of the 
replacement permit.
    (h) Transfer. A permit issued under this section, except in the case 
of a purse seine permit as allowed under paragraph (m) of this section, 
is not transferable or assignable to another vessel or owner; it is 
valid only for the vessel and owner to which it is issued.
    (i) Display. A permit issued under this section must be carried on 
board the vessel at all times. The permit must be displayed for 
inspection upon request of any authorized officer or any employee of 
NMFS designated by the Regional Director for such purpose. Upon sale of 
any large medium or giant Atlantic bluefin tuna, the vessel permit must 
be presented for inspection to the permitted dealer completing the 
landing card.
    (j) Sanctions. The Administrator may suspend, revoke, modify, or 
deny a permit issued or sought under this section. Procedures governing 
permit sanctions and denials are found at subpart D of 15 CFR part 904.
    (k) Fees. The Regional Director may charge a fee to recover the 
administrative expenses of permit issuance. The amount of the fee shall 
be determined, at least annually, in accordance with the procedures of 
the NOAA Finance Handbook for determining administrative costs of each 
special product or service. The fee may not exceed such costs and is 
specified with each application form. The appropriate fee must accompany 
each application. Failure to pay the fee will preclude issuance of the 
permit. Payment by a commercial instrument later determined to be 
insufficiently funded shall invalidate any permit.
    (l) Change in application information. Within 15 days after any 
change in the information contained in an application submitted under 
this section, the vessel owner must report the change in writing to the 
Regional Director. The permit is void if any change in the information 
is not reported within 15 days.
    (m) Closed categories. The Regional Director will issue permits to 
catch and retain Atlantic bluefin tuna under Sec. 285.22(c) only to 
current owners of those purse seine vessels, or their replacements, that 
were granted allocations under this subpart and landed Atlantic bluefin 
tuna in the fishery for Atlantic bluefin tuna during the period 1980 
through 1982. The Regional Director will not issue a permit to take 
Atlantic bluefin tuna under this subpart to the owner of any vessel that 
was replaced or consolidated with another vessel and retired from the 
purse seine fishery during the period 1980 through 1982, unless that 
vessel is replacing another vessel being retired from the fishery.

vessels subject to U.S. jurisdiction in the regulatory area is 
subdivided as follows:
    (a) General. (1) The total annual amount of large medium and giant 
Atlantic bluefin tuna that may be caught, retained, possessed or landed 
in the regulatory area by vessels permitted in the General category 
under Sec. 285.21(b) is 541 mt, of which 133 mt are available in the 
period beginning June 1 and ending July 31; 186 mt are available in the 
period beginning August 1 and ending August 31; 159 mt are available in 
the period beginning September 1 and ending September 30; and 63 mt are 
available beginning October 1.
    (2) On the basis of the statistics referenced at Sec. 285.20(b)(1), 
the Assistant Administrator will project a date when the catch of 
Atlantic bluefin tuna will equal the available quota in any period, and 
will publish a notification in the Federal Register stating that fishing 
for, retaining, possessing, or landing Atlantic bluefin tuna under the 
quota for that period is prohibited from a specified time on that date 
until the opening of the subsequent quota period, whereupon a quota 
equal to the

[[Page 267]]

initial quota for that period as adjusted for estimated overharvest or 
underharvest prior to that period will become available.
    (3) When the October General category catch is projected to have 
reached a total of 10 mt less than the overall October quota, the 
Director will publish a notification in the Federal Register to set 
aside the remaining quota for an area comprising the waters south and 
west of a straight line originating at a point on the southern shore of 
Long Island at 72 deg.27' W. long. (Shinnecock Inlet) and running SSE 
150 deg. true. The daily catch limit for the set-aside area will be one 
large medium or giant Atlantic bluefin tuna per vessel per day. Upon the 
effective date of the set-aside, fishing for, retaining, or landing 
large medium or giant Atlantic bluefin tuna must cease in all waters 
outside of the set-aside area.
    (b) Harpoon Boat. The total annual amount of large medium and giant 
Atlantic bluefin tuna that may be caught, retained, possessed, or landed 
in the regulatory area by vessels permitted in the Harpoon Boat category 
under Sec. 285.21(b) is 53 mt.
    (c) Purse Seine. The total amount of large medium and giant Atlantic 
bluefin tuna that may be caught, retained, possessed, or landed in the 
regulatory area by vessels permitted in the Purse Seine category under 
Sec. 285.21(b) is 251 mt.
    (d) Angling. The total annual amount of Atlantic bluefin tuna that 
may be caught, retained, possessed, or landed in the regulatory area by 
anglers is 243 mt. No more than 5 mt of this quota may be large medium 
or giant bluefin tuna quota. No more than 138 mt of this quota may be 
school Atlantic bluefin tuna. The quota for school Atlantic bluefin tuna 
is further subdivided as follows:
    (1) 65 mt of school Atlantic bluefin tuna may be caught, retained, 
possessed, or landed south of 38 deg.47' N. lat.
    (2) 73 mt of school Atlantic bluefin tuna may be caught, retained, 
possessed, or landed north of 38 deg.47' N. lat.
    (e) Incidental. The total annual amount of large medium and giant 
Atlantic bluefin tuna that may be caught, retained, possessed, or landed 
in the regulatory area by vessels permitted in the Incidental Catch 
category under Sec. 285.21(b) is 110 mt. This quota is further 
subdivided as follows:
    (1) 109 mt for longline vessels. No more than 86 mt may be caught, 
retained, possessed, or landed in the area south of 34 deg.00' N. lat.
    (2) For vessels fishing under Sec. 285.23 (a) and (b), 1 mt may be 
caught, retained, possessed, or landed in the regulatory area.
    (f) Inseason adjustment amount. The total amount of Atlantic bluefin 
tuna that will be held in reserve for inseason adjustments is 108 mt. 
The Assistant Administrator may allocate any portion (from zero to 100 
percent) of this amount to any category or categories of the fishery, 
including research activities authorized under Sec. 285.1(c). The 
Assistant Administrator will publish a notice of allocation of any 
inseason adjustment amount in the Federal Register before such 
allocation is to become effective. Before making any such allocation, 
the Assistant Administrator will consider the following factors:
    (1) The usefulness of information obtained from catches of the 
particular category of the fishery for biological sampling and 
monitoring the status of the stock;
    (2) The catches of the particular gear segment to date and the 
likelihood of closure of that segment of the fishery if no allocation is 
made;
    (3) The projected ability of the particular gear segment to harvest 
the additional amount of Atlantic bluefin tuna before the anticipated 
end of the fishing season; and
    (4) The estimated amounts by which quotas established for other gear 
segments of the fishery might be exceeded.
    (g) The catching or retention of school, large school or small 
medium Atlantic bluefin tuna is prohibited except as allowed by 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (h) If the Assistant Administrator determines, based on landing 
statistics and other available information, that an annual quota in any 
category, or as appropriate, subcategory, has been exceeded or has not 
been reached, the Assistant Administrator will subtract the

[[Page 268]]

overharvest from, or add the underharvest to, that quota category for 
the following year; provided that the total of the adjusted quotas and 
the reserve is consistent with a recommendation of the Commission 
regarding country quotas. The Assistant Administrator will publish any 
amounts to be subtracted or added and the basis for the quota reductions 
or increases in the Federal Register.
    (i) Transfers between categories. The Assistant Administrator is 
authorized to make adjustments to quotas involving transfers between 
vessel categories or, as appropriate, subcategories if, during a single 
year quota period or the second year of a biannual quota period as 
defined by ICCAT, the Assistant Administrator determines, based on 
landing statistics, present year catch rates, effort, and other 
available information, that any category, or as appropriate, 
subcategory, is not likely to take its entire quota as previously 
allocated for that year. Given that determination, the Assistant 
Administrator may transfer inseason any portion of the quota of any 
fishing category to any other fishing category or to the reserve after 
considering the four factors indicated at paragraphs (f) (1) through (4) 
of this section, and the probability that any transfers between 
categories will not result in the total single-year quota or the total 
2-year quota being exceeded. The Assistant Administrator shall file a 
notification of transfer of any inseason adjustment amount with the 
Office of the Federal Register before such transfer is to become 
effective.

Sec. 285.23  Incidental catch.

    (a) Herring, mackerel, and menhaden purse seine gear and fixed gear 
other than longlines or traps. Subject to the quotas in Sec. 285.22, 
large medium and giant Atlantic bluefin tuna may be retained during any 
fishing trip, on board a vessel for which an Incidental Catch permit has 
been issued under Sec. 285.21 that is fishing with herring, mackerel, 
and menhaden purse seine gear or fixed gear other than longlines or 
traps principally for species of fish other than tuna, provided that the 
total amount of Atlantic bluefin tuna taken does not exceed 2 percent, 
by weight, of all other fish on board the vessel at the end of each 
fishing trip.
    (b) Traps. Subject to the quotas in Sec. 285.22, large medium and 
giant Atlantic bluefin tuna may be retained during any fishing trip on 
board a vessel for which an Incidental Catch permit under Sec. 285.21 
has been issued that catches Atlantic bluefin tuna incidentally while 
fishing with traps, provided that the total amount of Atlantic bluefin 
tuna taken does not exceed 2 percent, by weight, of all other fish 
landed by the owner of the vessel within the preceding 30-day period.
    (c) Longlines. Subject to the quotas in Sec. 285.22, any person 
operating a vessel using longline gear possessing an Incidental Catch 
permit issued under Sec. 285.21 may retain or land large medium and 
giant Atlantic bluefin tuna as an incidental catch. The amount of 
Atlantic bluefin tuna retained or landed may not exceed:
    (1) One fish per vessel per fishing trip landed south of 34 deg.00' 
N. latitude, provided that for the months of January through April at 
least 1,500 pounds (680 kg), and for the months of May through December 
at least 3,500 pounds (1,588 kg), either dressed or round weight, of 
species other than Atlantic bluefin tuna are legally caught, retained, 
and offloaded from the same trip and are recorded on the dealer weighout 
as sold; and
    (2) Two percent by weight, either dressed or round weight, of all 
other fish legally landed, offloaded and documented on the dealer 
weighout as sold at the end of each fishing trip, north of 34 deg.00' N. 
latitude.
    (d) Purse Seine. When fishing for Atlantic yellowfin or skipjack 
tuna, vessels for which an Atlantic bluefin tuna Purse Seine category 
permit has been issued are allowed a 1 percent per trip (by weight) 
incidental take of bluefin less than the large medium size class. Any 
landings of these incidental catches may not be sold and will be

[[Page 269]]

counted against the Purse Seine category quota allocation for bluefin 
tuna.

<R05>
Sec. 285.24  Catch limits.

    (a) General category. (1) From the start of each fishing year, 
except on designated restricted fishing days, only one large medium or 
giant Atlantic bluefin tuna may be possessed or landed per day from a 
vessel for which a General category permit has been issued under 
Sec. 285.21. On designated restricted fishing days, persons aboard such 
vessels may not possess, retain or land any large medium or giant 
Atlantic bluefin tuna. For calendar year 1996, designated restricted 
fishing days are: July 14, 15, 16, 21, 22, 23, 28, 29, and 30; August 4, 
5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, and 27; and September 3, 8, 9, 
10, 15.
    (2) The Assistant Administrator may increase or reduce the catch 
limit over a range from zero (restricted fishing days) to a maximum of 
three large medium or giant Atlantic bluefin tuna per day per vessel 
based on a review of dealer reports, daily landing trends, availability 
of the species on the fishing grounds, and any other relevant factors, 
to provide for maximum utilization of the quota. The Assistant 
Administrator will publish a document in the Federal Register of any 
adjustment in the allowable daily catch limit made under this paragraph. 
Other than fishery closures pursuant to attainment of quotas in any 
period, such notice of catch limit adjustment shall be filed at the 
Office of the Federal Register at least 3 calendar days prior to the 
change becoming effective.
    (3) Large medium and giant Atlantic bluefin tuna may be possessed or 
retained on board a vessel for which a General category permit has been 
issued if the amount does not exceed a single day's catch, regardless of 
the length of the trip, as allowed by the daily catch limit in effect on 
that day.
    (4) Anglers on board vessels permitted in the General category may 
possess school, large school, and small medium Atlantic bluefin tuna in 
an amount not to exceed a single day's catch, regardless of the length 
of the trip, as allowed by the daily catch limit for the Angling 
category in effect on that day. However, on allowable fishing days, once 
the applicable catch limit for large medium or giant bluefin tuna is 
possessed or retained, fishing by persons on board the vessel must cease 
and the vessel must proceed to port.
    (b) Harpoon Boat category. Vessels permitted in the Harpoon Boat 
category may catch multiple giant bluefin tuna but only one large medium 
bluefin tuna per day per vessel may be caught.
    (c) Purse Seine category. Large medium bluefin tuna may be caught 
from a vessel for which a Purse Seine category permit has been issued 
provided that the total amount of large medium bluefin landed per trip 
does not exceed 15 percent by weight of the total amount of giant 
Atlantic bluefin tuna landed on that trip, and the total annual amount 
of large medium bluefin landed does not exceed 10 percent by weight of 
the total amount of giant Atlantic bluefin tuna allocated to that vessel 
for that fishing season.
    (d) Angling category. (1) Each angler on board a vessel permitted in 
the Angling category may catch and retain each day no more than two 
Atlantic bluefin tuna which may be from the school or large school size 
class. In addition to the per angler limits, one small medium size class 
bluefin tuna may be retained each day, per angling category vessel. 
Anglers may not retain young school Atlantic bluefin tuna.
    (2) In addition to the daily catch limit for school, large school 
and small medium bluefin tuna, a vessel for which an Angling category 
permit has been issued may catch and retain annually one large medium or 
giant Atlantic bluefin tuna, to be counted against the Angling category 
quota specified in Sec. 285.22. The owner or operator of the vessel must 
report to the nearest NMFS enforcement office within 24 hours of landing 
any large medium or giant bluefin, and must make the tuna available for 
inspection and attachment of a tag. No such large medium or giant 
Atlantic bluefin tuna may be sold or transferred to any person for a 
commercial purpose except for taxidermic

[[Page 270]]

purposes. A list of local NMFS enforcement offices may be obtained from 
the Regional Director.
    (3) The Assistant Administrator may increase or reduce the per 
angler catch limit for any size class bluefin tuna or may change the per 
angler limit to a per boat limit or a per boat limit to a per angler 
limit based on a review of daily landing trends, availability of the 
species on the fishing grounds, and any other relevant factors, to 
provide for maximum utilization of the quota spread over the longest 
possible period of time. The Assistant Administrator will publish a 
document in the Federal Register of any adjustment in the allowable 
daily catch limit made under this paragraph. Other than fishery closures 
pursuant to attainment of quotas in any period, such notice of catch 
limit adjustment shall be filed at the Office of the Federal Register at 
least 3 calendar days prior to the change becoming effective.
    (4) Anglers on board vessels for which an Angling category permit 
has been issued may possess school, large school, and small medium 
Atlantic bluefin tuna in an amount not to exceed a single day's catch, 
regardless of the length of the trip, as allowed by the daily catch 
limit for the Angling category in effect on that day.
    (e) Charter/Headboat category. (1) Anglers on board vessels for 
which a Charter/Headboat category permit has been issued are subject to 
the daily catch limits for school, large school, and small medium 
Atlantic bluefin tuna applicable to the Angling category.
    (2) When the General category fishery is closed, or at any time when 
operating in the Gulf of Mexico, operators of Charter/Headboat vessels 
are subject to the annual vessel limit and reporting requirement for 
non-commercial take of large medium or giant Atlantic bluefin tuna as 
specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (3) When the General category fishery is open, except when operating 
in the Gulf of Mexico, operators of vessels for which a Charter/Headboat 
category permit has been issued are subject to the daily catch limit in 
effect for the General category for large medium or giant Atlantic 
bluefin tuna as specified in paragraph (a) of this section. Once the 
applicable catch limit for large medium or giant bluefin tuna is 
possessed or retained, fishing by persons on board the vessel must cease 
and the vessel must proceed to port. Large medium or giant bluefin tuna 
landed by Charter/Headboat vessels may be sold and are counted against 
the quota for the General category.
    (4) Anglers on board vessels for which a Charter/Headboat category 
permit has been issued may possess school, large school, and small 
medium Atlantic bluefin tuna in an amount not to exceed a single day's 
catch, regardless of the length of the trip, as allowed by the daily 
catch limit for the Angling category in effect on that day. Vessels for 
which a Charter/Headboat category permit has been issued may possess 
large medium and giant Atlantic bluefin tuna in an amount not to exceed 
a single day's catch, regardless of the length of the trip, as allowed 
by the daily catch limit in effect on that day.

Sec. 285.25  Purse seine vessel requirements.

    (a) Mesh size. Any owner or operator of a vessel with a permit 
issued under Sec. 285.21(b) conducting a directed fishery for Atlantic 
bluefin tuna with nets, other than a trap net, must use a purse seine 
net with a mesh size equal to or smaller than 4.5 inches in the main 
body (stretched when wet) and which has at least 24-count thread 
throughout the net.
    (b) Exemption. The Director may exempt any person from the mesh 
restrictions in paragraph (a) of this section if it is determined that 
the net sought to be exempted will not result in significant injury or 
mortality to Atlantic bluefin tuna which are encircled by the net but 
manage to escape.
    (c) Inspection. Any owner of a purse seine vessel with a permit 
issued under Sec. 285.21(b) must request an inspection of the vessel and 
fishing gear by an enforcement agent of NMFS before commencing any 
fishing trip that may result in the harvest of any regulated species and 
before offloading any Atlantic bluefin tuna. The vessel owner

[[Page 271]]

must request such inspection at least 24 hours before commencement of a 
fishing trip and offloading by calling 508-563-5721 or 508-281-9261. 
Purse seine vessel owners must have each large medium and giant bluefin 
tuna in their catch weighed, measured, and the information recorded on 
the landing card required under Sec. 285.28(a) at the time of offloading 
and prior to transporting said tuna from the area of offloading.
    (d) Vessel allocations. (1) Owners or operators of vessels for which 
a Purse seine permit has been issued under Sec. 285.21(b) must apply for 
an allocation of Atlantic bluefin tuna from the quotas specified in 
Sec. 285.22. The owner or operator must apply for this allocation in 
writing to the Regional Director by April 15 and must specify the 
particular size class or classes of Atlantic bluefin tuna for which the 
vessel will fish. The owner or operator must supply documentation of the 
vessel's stockholders, owners, partners, or association structure.
    (2) The Regional Director will review applications for allocations 
of Atlantic bluefin tuna on or about May 1, and will make equal 
allocations of the available size classes of Atlantic bluefin tuna among 
vessel owners so requesting. Such allocations are freely transferable, 
in whole or in part, among purse seine vessel permit holders. Any purse 
seine vessel permit holder intending to land bluefin tuna under an 
allocation transferred from another purse seine vessel permit holder 
must provide written notice of such intent to the Regional Director 3 
days before landing any such bluefin tuna. Such notification must 
include the transfer date, amount (mt) transferred, and the permit 
numbers of vessels involved in the transfer. Trip or seasonal catch 
limits otherwise applicable under Sec. 285.24(c) are not altered by 
transfers of bluefin tuna allocation. Purse seine vessel permit holders 
who, through landing and/or transfer, have no remaining bluefin tuna 
allocation may not use their permitted vessels in any fishery in which 
Atlantic bluefin tuna might be caught.
    (3) Purse seine vessel owners may apply to the Regional Director to 
permanently consolidate vessel permits issued under Sec. 285.21(b). Upon 
approval of consolidation by the Regional Director, the Atlantic tuna 
permit(s) of the transferring vessel(s) will be cancelled, and the 
holder of the consolidated permit is authorized to apply for allocations 
of Atlantic bluefin tuna commensurate with the number of consolidated 
permits. Purse seine vessel owners who cancel their permit by means of 
consolidation must not fish their vessel in any fishery in which 
Atlantic bluefin tuna might be caught.
    (e) Transfer at sea. Purse seine vessel owners or operators may 
transfer large medium and giant Atlantic bluefin tuna at sea from the 
net of the catching vessel to another permitted purse seine vessel 
provided the amount transferred does not cause the receiving vessel to 
exceed its annual vessel allocation as modified by authorized transfers. 
Such at-sea transfers are authorized only between purse seine vessels 
permitted under Sec. 285.21 and not to buy boats permitted under 
Sec. 285.28.

<R05>
Sec. 285.26  Size classes.

    Total curved fork length will be the sole criterion for determining 
the size class of whole (head on) Atlantic bluefin tuna. For this 
purpose, all measurements must be taken in a line tracing the contour of 
the body from the tip of the upper jaw to the fork of the tail, which 
abuts the ventral side of the pectoral fin and the ventral side of the 
caudal keel. For any Atlantic bluefin tuna found with the head removed, 
it is deemed, for purposes of this subpart, that the tuna, when caught, 
fell into a size class in accordance with the following formula: Total 
curved fork length equals pectoral fin curved fork length multiplied by 
a factor of 1.35. The pectoral fin curved fork length will be the sole 
criterion for determining the size class of a beheaded Atlantic bluefin 
tuna. For this purpose, all measurements must be taken in a line tracing 
the contour of the body from the ventral side of the pectoral fin to the 
fork of the tail, which abuts the ventral side of the caudal keel.

Sec. 285.27  Tag and release program.

    (a) Notwithstanding other provisions of this part, an angler may 
fish for Atlantic bluefin tuna under a tag and release program, provided 
the angler tags all Atlantic bluefin tuna so caught with tags issued 
under this section, and releases and returns such fish to the sea 
immediately after tagging and with a minimum of injury. To participate 
in this program, an angler must obtain tags, reporting cards, and 
detailed instructions for their use from the Cooperative Tagging Center, 
Southeast Fisheries Center, NMFS, 75 Virginia Beach Drive, Miami, FL 
33149-1099 or by calling (800)437-3936.
    (b) Tags obtained from sources other than NMFS may be used to fish 
for Atlantic bluefin tuna provided the angler has registered each year 
with the Cooperative Tagging Center and the NMFS program manager has 
approved the use of tags from that source. Anglers using an alternative 
source of tags wishing to tag bluefin tuna can call (800) 437-3936 or 
write NMFS at the address given above.
    (c) Anglers registering for the Atlantic bluefin tagging program are 
required to provide their name, address, phone number, and, if 
applicable, identify the alternate source of tags.
    (d) If NMFS-issued or NMFS-approved tags are not on board a vessel, 
all anglers on board that vessel are deemed to be ineligible to fish 
under this section.

Sec. 285.28  Dealer permits.

    (a) General. A dealer purchasing, receiving, possessing, importing 
or exporting Atlantic bluefin tuna must have a valid permit required 
under this section. If such purchase or receipt is made from a buy-boat, 
the buy-boat must have a valid permit under paragraph (l) of this 
section.
    (b) Application. Applications for a dealer permit must be in writing 
on an appropriate form obtained from the Regional Director. The 
application must be signed by the applicant, and be submitted to the 
Regional Director at least 30 days before the date upon which the 
applicant desires the permit to be effective. The application must 
contain the following information: Company name; principal place of 
business; owner or owners' names; applicant's name (if different from 
owner or owners) and mailing address and telephone number; and any other 
information required by the Regional Director.
    (c) Issuance. (1) Except as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 
904, the Regional Director will issue a permit within 30 days of receipt 
of a completed application.
    (2) The Regional Director will notify the applicant of any 
deficiency in the application. If the applicant fails to correct the 
deficiency within 15 days following the date of notification, the 
application will be considered abandoned.
    (d) Duration. Any permit issued under this section remains valid 
until December 31 of the year for which it is issued, unless suspended 
or revoked.
    (e) Alteration. Any permit which is substantially altered, erased, 
or mutilated is invalid.
    (f) Replacement. The Regional Director may issue replacement 
permits. An application for a replacement permit is not considered a new 
application.
    (g) Transfer. A permit issued under this section is not transferable 
or assignable; it is valid only for the dealer to whom it is issued.
    (h) Inspection. The dealer must keep the permit issued under this 
section at his/her principal place of business. The permit must be 
displayed for inspection upon request of any authorized officer, or any 
employee of NMFS designated by the Regional Director for such purpose.
    (i) Sanctions. The Administrator may suspend, revoke, modify, or 
deny a permit issued or sought under this section. Procedures governing 
permit sanctions and denials are found at subpart D of 15 CFR part 904.
    (j) Fees. The Regional Director may charge a fee to recover the 
administrative expenses of permit issuance. The amount of the fee is 
calculated, at least annually, in accordance with the procedures of the 
NOAA Finance Handbook for determining administrative costs of each 
special product or service.

[[Page 274]]

The fee may not exceed such costs and is specified on each application 
form. The appropriate fee must accompany each application. Failure to 
pay the fee will preclude issuance of the permit. Payment by a 
commercial instrument later determined to be insufficiently funded shall 
invalidate any permit.
    (k) Change in application information. Within 15 days after any 
change in the information contained in an application submitted under 
this section, the dealer issued a permit will report the change in 
writing to the Regional Director.
    (l) Buy-boats. Each buy-boat must have a dealer permit issued under 
this section. The Regional Director will not issue a dealer permit under 
this section for a buy-boat operation to any vessel which has a valid 
fishing permit issued under Sec. 285.21. The Regional Director will not 
issue a dealer permit to a buy-boat unless the owner or operator of the 
buy-boat agrees in writing to allow an individual authorized by the 
Regional Director to accompany the buy-boat on any trip to observe 
operations. The Regional Director will provide reasonable notice to the 
owner or operator of any buy-boat that an individual will be placed 
aboard. Failure to allow an authorized individual to be placed aboard 
following reasonable notice voids the permit. The Regional Director will 
reimburse the owner of any buy-boat for any expenses which the Regional 
Director determines to be reasonable and which are related directly to 
the placement of an individual aboard that buy-boat.

Sec. 285.29  Dealer recordkeeping and reporting.

    Any person issued a dealer permit under Sec. 285.28:
    (a) Must report via electronic facsimile (fax) or an Interactive 
Voice Response System (IVRS) as instructed by the Regional Director 
within 24 hours of the purchase or receipt of each Atlantic bluefin tuna 
from the person or vessel that harvested the fish. Said report via fax 
or the IVRS must include the tag number affixed to the fish by the 
dealer, the date landed, the round and/or dressed weight (indicating 
which weight(s) measured), the total or pectoral fin curved fork length 
(indicating which length(s) measured), and the permit category of the 
landing vessel. In addition, dealers must submit to the Regional 
Director a daily report on a reporting card provided by NMFS. Said card 
must be postmarked and mailed at the dealer's expense within 24 hours of 
the purchase or receipt of each Atlantic bluefin tuna. Each vessel 
permit holder or vessel operator must sign each reporting card 
immediately upon transfer of the fish to verify the name of the vessel 
that landed the fish and the vessel permit number, and each card must 
indicate the tag number affixed to the fish by the dealer or assigned by 
an authorized officer, the date landed, the port where landed, the round 
and/or dressed weight (indicating which weight(s) measured), the total 
and/or pectoral fin curved fork length (indicating which length(s) 
measured), gear used, and area where the fish was caught. The dealer 
purchasing or receiving the Atlantic bluefin tuna must inspect the 
vessel permit and verify that the required vessel name and vessel permit 
information is correctly recorded on the reporting card.
    (b) Must submit to the Regional Director a bi-weekly report on forms 
supplied by NMFS.
    (1) Said report must be postmarked and mailed, at the dealer's 
expense, within 10 days after the end of each 2-week reporting period in 
which Atlantic bluefin tuna were purchased, received, or imported. The 
biweekly reporting periods are defined as the first day through the 14th 
day of each month and the 15th day through the last day of the month. 
Each report must specify accurately and completely for each tuna 
purchased or received: Date of landing or import, vessel Atlantic 
Bluefin Tuna permit number (if applicable), tail tag number, weight in 
pounds or kilograms (specify if round or dressed), nature of the sale 
(dockside or consignment), price per pound or kilogram (round or dressed 
weight), and destination of the fish (domestic or export). In addition, 
dealers may indicate the quality rating of their bluefin tuna: (A, B, or 
C) for four

[[Page 275]]

attributes (freshness, fat, color, and shape).
    (2) At the top of each form, the dealer must indicate the company 
name, license number, and the name of the person filling out the report. 
In addition, the beginning and ending dates of the 2-week reporting week 
period must be specified by the dealer and noted at the top of the form.
    (c) Must allow an authorized officer, or any employee of NMFS 
designated by the Regional Director for this purpose, to inspect and 
copy any records of transfers, purchases, or receipts of Atlantic 
bluefin tuna;
    (d) Must retain at his/her place of business a copy of each landing 
card (including proof of fax or IVRS transmission) and a copy of each 
bi-weekly report for a period of 2 years from the date on which each was 
required to be submitted to the Regional Director.
    (e) Each operator of a buy-boat, in addition to the above, must 
notify the Regional Director of any intended offloading, and must 
request a vessel inspection at least 6 hours before such offloading, by 
calling 508-281-9261 between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday 
through Friday, local time, or at all other times during the day and 
weekends, by calling 508-992-7711. In making the request for inspection, 
the owner or operator of the buy-boat or a designated representative 
must provide his/her name, the buy-boat's name and permit number, the 
number of tuna received, and the location and anticipated time of 
landing in port.

Sec. 285.30  Tags.

    (a) Issuance of tags. The Regional Director will issue numbered tail 
tags to each person receiving a dealer's permit under Sec. 285.28.
    (b) Transfer of tags. Tail tags issued under this section are not 
transferable and are usable only by the permitted dealer to whom they 
are issued.
    (c) Affixing tags. (1) A dealer or agent must affix a tail tag to 
each Atlantic bluefin tuna purchased or received, immediately upon its 
offloading from a vessel. The tail tag must be affixed to the tuna 
between the fifth dorsal finlet and the keel.
    (2) Any person who catches a large medium or giant Atlantic bluefin 
tuna and does not transfer it to a permitted dealer must contact the 
nearest NMFS enforcement office at the time of landing said Atlantic 
bluefin tuna and make the tuna available so that a NMFS enforcement 
agent may inspect the fish and attach a tail tag to it. A list of local 
NMFS enforcement offices can be obtained by contacting regional offices 
in Gloucester, MA (508-281-9261) and St. Petersburg, FL (813-570-5344). 
The Regional Director may designate a person other than a NMFS agent to 
inspect and tag the fish. Such designation will be made in writing.
    (d) Removal of tags. A tag affixed to any Atlantic bluefin tuna 
under paragraph (c)(1) of this section or under Sec. 285.202(a)(6)(v) 
must remain on the tuna until the tuna is cut into portions. If the tuna 
or tuna parts subsequently are packaged for transport for domestic 
commercial use or for export, the tag number must be written legibly and 
indelibly on the outside of any package or container. Tag numbers must 
be recorded on any document accompanying shipment of bluefin tuna for 
commercial use or export.
    (e) Reuse of tags. Tags issued under this section are separately 
numbered and may be used only once, one tail tag per fish, to 
distinguish the purchase of one Atlantic bluefin tuna. Once affixed to a 
tuna or recorded on any package, container or report, a tail tag and 
associated number may not be reused.

recreational vessels must adhere to applicable daily catch limits. 
Atlantic tunas taken on board private recreational vessels may not be 
sold.
    (e) Purse seine. Directed purse seine fishing for Atlantic 
yellowfin, bigeye, albacore, and skipjack tunas and Atlantic bonito is 
restricted to owners of those purse seine vessels that have current 
Atlantic bluefin tuna purse seine permits under Sec. 285.21(b) and that 
have reported, or replaced vessels that have reported, Atlantic 
yellowfin, skipjack, albacore or bigeye tuna landings to NMFS over the 
period 1989 through 1993. The owner or operator of such purse seine 
vessel must apply for authorization to fish for Atlantic yellowfin, 
bigeye, albacore, and skipjack tunas and Atlantic bonito in writing to 
the Regional Director by April 15. The owner must supply documentation 
of the vessel's stockholders, owners, partners, or association structure 
and records of landings to verify that the vessel meets the qualifying 
criteria. The Regional Director will review these applications for 
authorization on or about May 1 and issue authorizations as appropriate.
    (f) Exemptions. In lieu of a permit issued under this section, 
persons on board a vessel for which a valid permit for the Atlantic 
bluefin tuna fishery has been issued under Sec. 285.21 of this part are 
eligible to fish for and take Atlantic yellowfin, bigeye, albacore, and 
skipjack tunas and Atlantic bonito using the authorized gear and subject 
to the commercial fishing restrictions applicable to the category of 
permit issued for the vessel. In lieu of a permit issued under this 
section, owners or operators of vessels for which valid permits for the 
Atlantic shark fishery (50 CFR part 678) or the Atlantic swordfish 
fishery (50 CFR part 630) have been issued are eligible to fish for and 
take Atlantic yellowfin, bigeye, albacore, and skipjack tunas and 
Atlantic bonito using the authorized gear and subject to fishing 
restrictions applicable to the permit issued to the vessel. Owners or 
operators of vessels fishing for Atlantic yellowfin, bigeye, albacore,

to the jurisdiction of the United States, must notify the Regional 
Director not less than 48 hours prior to any transfer of Atlantic tuna 
taken in the regulatory area to another vessel for the purpose of 
transshipment. Such reports must include the date and place of 
unloading, name and destination of the oncarrying vessel, and the 
tonnage by species of tuna transferred.
    (e) The failure to file the reports or to follow the procedures 
required by this section, the tampering with or the removal of an 
official seal, or the alteration of a fishing vessel's log by any person 
or fishing vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States is a 
prohibited act within the meaning of Sec. 285.3.
    (f) Any person authorized to carry out enforcement activities under 
the Act or these regulations has power, without warrant or other 
process, to inspect, at any reasonable time, catch on board the vessel,

                 Subpart D--Restrictions on Tuna Imports


<R05>
Sec. 285.80   Basis and purpose.

    (a) The stocks of Atlantic tunas under investigation and regulation 
by the Commission represent the concern of a number of countries 
interested in the conservation of such stocks. In order to assure that 
the achievement of the conservation objectives of the Commission are 
fulfilled the Act provides for certain restrictions on the importation 
of Atlantic tunas. Pursuant to section 6(c) of the Act, the Secretary, 
with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, is directed to 
promulgate regulations to prohibit:
    (1) The entry into the United States of fish in any form of those 
species which are subject to regulation pursuant to a recommendation of 
the Commission and which were taken from the regulatory area in such 
manner or in such circumstances as would tend to diminish the 
effectiveness of the conservation recommendations of the Commission; and
    (2) The entry into the United States, from any country when vessels 
of such country are being used in the conduct of fishing operations in 
the regulatory area in such manner or in such circumstances as would 
tend to diminish the effectiveness of the conservation recommendations 
of the Commission, of fish in any form of those species which are 
subject to regulation pursuant to a recommendation of the Commission and 
which were taken from the regulatory area;
    (3) The entry into the United States, from any country when vessels 
of such country engage in repeated and flagrant fishery operations in 
the regulatory area which seriously threaten

[[Page 284]]

the achievement of the objectives of the Commission's recommendations, 
of fish in any form of these species which are under investigation by 
the Commission and which were taken from the regulatory area.
    (b) By letter of February 18, 1976, the Secretary of State concurred 
in the promulgation of the regulations in this part. Such regulations 
are designed to implement the provisions of section 6(c) of the Act with 
respect to import controls and to proscribe procedures for the 
establishment of restrictions on imports of tuna and tuna-like fish 
whenever such action shall be deemed warranted.

<R05>
Sec. 285.83   Investigations authorized.

    (a) The Assistant Administrator will make, from time to time, such 
inquiries and investigations as may be necessary to keep himself and 
other interested persons currently informed regarding the nature and 
effectiveness of the measures for the implementation of the Commission's 
recommendations concerning those activities which are being carried out 
by foreign countries whose vessels engage in fishing within the 
regulatory area. In making a finding, as to:
    (1) Whether or not fish in any form of those species which are 
subject to regulation by the Commission are being taken from the 
regulatory area in a manner or under such circumstances as would tend to 
diminish effectiveness of the conservation recommendations of the 
Commission; or
    (2) Whether or not a country is condoning the use of vessels in the 
conduct of fishing operations in the regulatory area in such a manner or 
under such circumstances that would tend to diminish the effectiveness 
of the conservation recommendations of the Commission; or
    (3) Whether or not a country is condoning the use of vessels in 
repeated and flagrant fishing operations which seriously threaten the 
achievement of the objectives of the commissions recommendations, the 
Assistant Administrator will take into account, among such other 
considerations as may appear to be pertinent in a particular case, the 
following factors:
    (i) Whether or not the country provides or causes to be provided to 
the Commission pertinent statistics on a timely basis;
    (ii) Whether or not the country has in force conservation measures 
applicable to its own fishermen adequate for the implementation of the 
Commission's recommendations;
    (iii) Whether or not the country has in force measures for the 
control of landings in its ports of species subject to regulations which 
are taken in the regulatory area by fishermen of other countries 
contrary to the Commission's conservation recommendations;
    (iv) Whether or not the country, having put conservation measures 
into effect, takes reasonable action to enforce such measures;
    (v) The number of vessels of the country which conduct fishing 
operations in the regulatory area;
    (vi) The quantity of species subject to regulation taken from the 
regulatory area by the Country's vessels contrary to the Commission's 
conservation recommendations and its relationship to (A) the total 
quantity permitted to be taken by the vessels of all countries 
participating in the fishery and (B) the quantity of such species sought 
to be restored to the stocks of fish pursuant to the Commission's 
conservation recommendations.
    (b) Any person who has reason to believe that the vessels of any 
country are being used in the conduct of fishing

[[Page 285]]

operations in the regulatory area in such manner or in such 
circumstances as would tend to diminish the effectiveness of the 
conservation recommendations of the Commission or that other acts within 
the purview of the import control provisions of section 6(c) of the Act, 
are occurring or are likely to occur, may communicate his belief to the 
Assistant Administrator. Every such communication must contain or be 
accompanied by a full statement of the reasons for the belief, including 
a detailed description of such specific acts or events as may indicate a 
need for instituting an investigation as authorized in this part.
    (c) Upon receipt by the Assistant Administrator of any communication 
submitted pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section and upon a finding 
that the communication complies with the requirements of that paragraph, 
the Assistant Administrator will promptly conduct an investigation to be 
made as appears to be warranted by the circumstances of the case. In 
conducting such investigations the Assistant Administrator or his 
designated representative will consider any representations offered by 
foreign interests, importers, brokers, domestic producers, or other 
interested persons. Unless good cause to the contrary exists every such 
investigation will be completed within 60 days following receipt of the 
communication.

Sec. 285.84   Publication of findings.

    If it is determined on the basis of Sec. 285.83 that species of fish 
subject to regulation or under investigation by the Commission, as the 
case may be, are ineligible for entry into the United States under 
section 6(c) of the Act, the Assistant Administrator with the approval 
of the Secretary of the Commerce and with the concurrence of the 
Secretary of State, will publish a finding to that effect in the Federal 
Register. Effective upon the date of publication of such finding in the 
Federal Register every shipment of fish in any form of the species found 
to be ineligible will be denied entry unless it is established by 
satisfactory proof pursuant to Sec. 285.85 that a particular shipment of 
such fish is not ineligible for entry: Provided, That entry will not be 
denied and no such proof will be required for any such shipment which, 
on the date of such publication, was in transit to the United States on 
board a vessel operating as a common carrier.

<R05>
Sec. 285.100  Basis and purpose.

    At its sixth regular meeting, the International Commission for the 
Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (Commission) adopted an international 
port inspection scheme to assist in the enforcement of the Commission's 
recommendations. The following regulations have been adopted by the 
United States to implement the port inspection scheme.


<R05>
Sec. 285.101  Authorized officer.

    For the purposes of this subpart, an authorized officer is a person 
appointed by a contracting party (the United States and the countries 
listed in Sec. 285.102(a)) as an authorized inspector for the 
Commission, who possesses an identification card so stating.


<R05>
Sec. 285.102  Vessels subject to inspection.

    (a) All United States tuna vessels or vessels carrying tuna and 
their catch, gear, and records are subject to inspection under this 
subpart by an authorized officer when landing or transshipping tuna or 
when making a port call at a port of the following countries, which are 
defined as the contracting parties. The names of any subsequent 
additional contracting parties may be added to the list by Federal 
Register notice. United States tuna vessels or vessels carrying tuna are 
also subject to the requirements of subparts A through C as appropriate.

    (1) Brazil
    (2) Cuba
    (3) France
    (4) Gabon
    (5) Ivory Coast
    (6) Portugal
    (7) Senegal
    (8) South Africa
    (9) Spain

    (b) All tuna vessels or vessels carrying tuna, and registered by any 
of the above countries, and their catch, gear and records are subject to 
inspection under this subpart when landing or transshipping tuna or when 
making a port call in the United States.
    (c) A vessel entering a port of the above countries because of force 
majeure shall be exempt from inspection by an authorized officer.


<R05>
Sec. 285.103  Reports.

    (a) Inspections must be reported on a standardized Commission form 
and signed by the authorized officer. The master is entitled to add or 
have added to the report, any observation which the master thinks 
suitable. If the master adds information to the report, he also must 
sign the report. The authorized officer will note in the vessel's log 
that the inspection has been made. A copy of the report will be given to 
the vessel master and a copy sent to the authorized officer's national 
authority.
    (b) The master must allow the authorized officer to examine any 
portion of the catch and gear and provide any relevant documents as the 
authorized officer deems necessary to verify compliance with these 
regulations.

            Subpart F--Bluefin Tuna Statistical Documentation

    Source: 60 FR 14388, Mar. 17, 1995, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 285.200  Species subject to documentation requirements.

    Imports into the United States and exports or re-exports from the 
United States of all bluefin tuna or bluefin tuna products regardless of 
ocean area of catch are subject to the documentation requirements of 
this subpart.
    (a) Documentation is required for bluefin tuna identified by the 
following

[[Page 288]]

item numbers from the Harmonized Tariff Schedule:
    (1) Fresh or chilled bluefin tuna, excluding fillets and other fish 
meat, No. 0302.39.00.20.
    (2) Frozen bluefin tuna, excluding fillets, No. 0303.49.00.20.
    (b) In addition, bluefin tuna products in other forms (e.g., chunks, 
fillets, canned) listed under any other item numbers from the Harmonized 
Tariff Schedule are subject to the documentation requirements of this 
subpart, except that fish parts other than meat (i.e., heads, eyes, roe, 
guts, tails) may be allowed entry without said statistical 
documentation.


<R05>
Sec. 285.201  Documentation requirements.

    (a) Bluefin imports. (1) Imports of all bluefin tuna products into 
the United States must be accompanied at the time of entry by an 
original completed approved Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document with the 
information and exporter's certification specified in Sec. 285.202(a)(1) 
through (7). Such information must be validated as specified in 
Sec. 285.202(a)(8) by a responsible government official of the country 
whose flag vessel caught the tuna (regardless of where the fish are 
first landed), unless the Assistant Administrator has waived validation 
requirements for the country pursuant to Sec. 285.203.
    (2) Bluefin tuna imported into the United States from a country 
requiring a tag on all such tuna available for sale must be accompanied 
by the appropriate tag issued by that country, and said tag must remain 
on any tuna until it reaches its final import destination. If the final 
import destination is the United States, the tag must remain on the tuna 
until it is cut into portions. If the tuna portions are subsequently 
packaged for domestic commercial use or export, the tag number and the 
issuing country must be written legibly and indelibly on the outside of 
the package.
    (3) Dealers selling bluefin tuna that was previously imported into 
the United States for domestic commercial use must provide on the 
original Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document that accompanied the import 
shipment the correct information and importer's certification specified 
in Sec. 285.202(a)(9). The original of the completed Bluefin Tuna 
Statistical Document must be postmarked and mailed by said dealer to the 
Regional Director within 24 hours of the time the tuna was imported into 
the United States.
    (b) Bluefin exports. (1) Dealers exporting bluefin tuna that was 
harvested by U.S. vessels and first landed in the United States must 
complete an original numbered Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document issued 
to that dealer by the Regional Director. Such an individually numbered 
document is not transferable or reusable and may be used only once by 
the dealer to which it was issued to report on a specific export 
shipment. Dealers must provide on the Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document 
the correct information and exporter certification specified in 
Sec. 285.202(a)(1) through (7). As required under Sec. 285.203, the 
Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document must be validated as specified in 
Sec. 285.202(a)(8) by an official of the U.S. Government or, if 
authorized by NMFS, an official of an accredited institution. A list of 
such officials may be obtained by contacting the Office of Fisheries 
Conservation and Management, NMFS, Silver Spring, MD (301-713-2347), or 
the nearest NMFS Enforcement Office. A list of local NMFS enforcement 
offices can be obtained by contacting regional offices in Gloucester, MA 
(508-281-9261), St. Petersburg, FL (813-570-5344) and Long Beach, CA 
(310-980-4050). Dealers requesting government validation for exports 
should notify NMFS as soon as possible after arrival of the vessel to 
avoid delays in inspection and validation of the export shipment.
    (2) Dealers re-exporting bluefin tuna that was previously imported 
into the United States must provide on the original Bluefin Tuna 
Statistical Document that accompanied the import shipment the correct 
information and intermediate importer's certification specified in 
Sec. 285.202(a)(9).
    (3) Dealers must submit the original of the completed Bluefin Tuna 
Statistical Document to accompany the shipment of bluefin tuna to its 
export or re-export destination. A copy of the Bluefin Tuna Statistical 
Document completed as specified under paragraph

[[Page 289]]

(b)(1) or (2) of this section must be postmarked and mailed by said 
dealer to the Regional Director within 24 hours of the time the tuna was 
exported or re-exported from the United States.
    (c) Recordkeeping. Dealers must retain at their principal place of 
business a copy of each Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document required to be 
submitted to the Regional Director pursuant to this section for a period 
of 2 years from the date on which it was submitted to the Regional 
Director.


<R05>
Sec. 285.202  Contents of documentation.

    (a) A Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document, to be deemed complete, 
must:
    (1) Have a document number assigned as prescribed by the country 
issuing the document;
    (2) State the name of the country issuing the document, which is the 
country whose flag vessel harvested the bluefin tuna, regardless of 
where the tuna is first landed;
    (3) State the name of the vessel that caught the fish and the 
vessel's registration number, if applicable;
    (4) State the name of the owner of the trap that caught the fish, if 
applicable;
    (5) State the point of export, which is the city, state or province, 
and country from which the bluefin tuna is first exported;
    (6) State the following specified information about the shipment:
    (i) The product type (fresh or frozen) and product form (round, 
gilled and gutted, dressed, fillet or other);
    (ii) The method of fishing used to harvest the fish (purse seine, 
trap, rod and reel, etc.);
    (iii) The ocean area from which the fish was harvested (western 
Atlantic, eastern Atlantic, Mediterranean, or Pacific);
    (iv) The weight of each fish (in kilograms for the same product form 
previously specified);
    (v) The identifying tag number, if landed by vessels from countries 
with tagging programs;
    (7) State the name and license number of, and be signed and dated in 
the exporter's certification block by, the exporter;
    (8) If applicable, state the name and title of, and be signed and 
dated in the validation block by, a responsible government official of 
the country whose flag vessel caught the tuna (regardless of where the 
tuna are first landed) or by an official of an institution accredited by 
said government, with official government or accredited institution seal 
affixed, thus validating the information on the Bluefin Tuna Statistical 
Document; and
    (9) As applicable, state the name(s) and address(es), including the 
name of the city and state or province of import, and the name(s) of the 
intermediate country(ies) or the name of the country of final 
destination, and license number(s) of, and be signed and dated in the 
importer's certification block by, each intermediate and the final 
importer.
    (b) An approved Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document may be obtained 
from the Regional Director to accompany exports of bluefin tuna from the 
United States. Bluefin tuna dealers in countries that do not provide an 
approved Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document to exporters may obtain an 
approved Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document from the Regional Director to 
accompany exports to the United States.
    (c) Dealers from a country exporting bluefin tuna to the United 
States may use the approved Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document obtainable 
from the Regional Director or documents developed by the dealer's 
country, if that country submits a copy, through the ICCAT Executive 
Secretariat, to the Assistant Administrator, and the Assistant 
Administrator concurs with the ICCAT Secretariat's determination that 
the document meets the information requirements of the ICCAT 
recommendation. In such case, the Assistant Administrator shall provide 
a list of countries for which Bluefin Tuna Statistical Documents are 
approved, together with examples of such documents to the appropriate 
official of the U.S. Customs Service. Effective upon the date indicated 
in such notice to the U.S. Customs Service, shipments of bluefin tuna or 
bluefin tuna products offered for importation from said country(ies) may 
be accompanied by either that country's approved Bluefin Tuna

[[Page 290]]

Statistical Document or by the Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document 
provided to the foreign country exporter by the Regional Director.


<R05>
Sec. 285.203  Validation requirements.

    (a) Imports. The approved Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document 
accompanying any import of bluefin tuna, whether or not the issuing 
country is a member of ICCAT, must be validated by a government official 
from the issuing country, unless the Assistant Administrator waives the 
government validation requirement for that country following a 
recommendation to do so by the Executive Secretary of ICCAT. The 
Assistant Administrator shall furnish a list of countries for which 
government validation requirements are waived to the appropriate 
official of the U.S. Customs Service. Said list shall indicate the 
circumstances of exemption for each issuing country and the non-
government institutions, if any, accredited to validate Bluefin 
Statistical Documents for that country.
    (b) Exports. The approved Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document 
accompanying any export of bluefin tuna from the United States must be 
validated by a U.S. government official, except under circumstances of 
waiver, if any, specified on the form and accompanying instructions, or 
in a letter to permitted dealers from the Regional Director. Such 
circumstances of waiver of government validation shall be consistent 
with ICCAT recommendations concerning validation of Bluefin Tuna 
Statistical Documents. If authorized, such waiver of government 
validation may include:
    (1) Exemptions from government validation for fish with individual 
tags affixed pursuant to Sec. 280.52 or Sec. 285.30 of this chapter, or;
    (2) Validation by non-government officials authorized to do so by 
the Regional Director under paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Authorization for non-government validation. Institutions, or 
associations seeking authorization to validate Bluefin Tuna Statistical 
Documents accompanying exports from the United States, must apply in 
writing to the Regional Director. A letter of application must indicate 
the procedures to be used for verification of information to be 
validated, must list the names, addresses, and telephone/fax numbers of 
individuals to perform validation, and must provide an example of the 
stamp or seal to be applied to the Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document. 
Upon finding the institution or association capable of verifying the 
information required on the Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document, the 
Regional Director will issue, within 30 days, a letter specifying the 
duration of effectiveness and conditions of authority to validate 
Bluefin Tuna Statistical Documents accompanying exports from the United 
States. The effectiveness of such authorization will be delayed as 
necessary for the Assistant Administrator to notify the ICCAT 
Secretariat of non-government institutions and associations authorized 
to validate Bluefin Tuna Statistical Documents.


<R05>
Sec. 285.204  Ports of entry.

    The Assistant Administrator shall monitor the importation of bluefin 
tuna into the United States. If the Assistant Administrator determines 
that the diversity of handling practices at certain ports at which 
bluefin tuna is being imported into the United States allow for 
circumvention of the Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document requirement, he/
she may designate, after consultation with the U.S. Customs Service, 
those ports at which Pacific or Atlantic bluefin tuna may be imported 
into the United States. The Assistant Administrator shall announce in 
the Federal Register the names of ports so designated and the effective 
dates of entry restrictions.


<R05>
Sec. 285.205  Prohibitions.

    It is unlawful for any person to do any of the following:
    (a) Import or attempt to import any bluefin tuna into the United 
States without an accompanying original form of an approved Bluefin Tuna 
Statistical Document correctly completed with the appropriate 
certification and government validation.
    (b) Import any bluefin tuna into the United States from a country 
that requires all such tuna to be tagged, without said tag accompanying 
the bluefin tuna.

[[Page 291]]

    (c) Remove a tag from any bluefin tuna imported into the United 
States accompanied by a tag, prior to its being cut into portions for a 
destination in the United States or for export.
    (d) Fail to write legibly and indelibly the tag number and the 
issuing country on the outside of any package containing a part or parts 
of a bluefin tuna that was imported into the United States accompanied 
by said tag.
    (e) Export or re-export from the United States any bluefin tuna 
without an accompanying original approved Bluefin Tuna Statistical 
Document correctly completed with the appropriate certification and, if 
applicable, validated by a designated official of the United States 
government or an official of an institution authorized by the Regional 
Director pursuant to Sec. 285.203(c) to validate such documents.
    (f) Fail to provide in a timely manner any originals or copies of 
Bluefin Tuna Statistical Documents required to be submitted to the 
Regional Director pursuant to Sec. 285.201.
    (g) Write false information on or modify any information previously 
written on any Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document required by this 
subpart or to validate such document if not authorized to do so by the 
Regional Director.
    (h) Fail to maintain copies of completed Bluefin Tuna Statistical 
Documents as required under Sec. 285.201.
    (i) Import any bluefin tuna in a manner inconsistent with any ports 
of entry designated by the Assistant Administrator pursuant to 
Sec. 285.204.
    (j) Reuse, or transfer to another dealer, any numbered Bluefin Tuna 
Statistical Document issued to a dealer under this subpart.

claims and expenses, the Chief, FSD, will notify the Secretary of the 
Interior that additional assessments are needed.
    (2) Billing and collections. The Secretary of the Interior will 
calculate the amounts to be paid by each Holder and shall notify each 
Holder of the dollar amount and the time and place for all payments. 
Each assessment shall be paid to the Secretary of the Interior no later 
than 45 days after the Secretary of the Interior sends notice of the 
assessment.
    (3) Annual assessment limits. No Holder shall be required to pay in 
excess of $5,000 for any lease, permit, easement or right-of-way in any 
calendar year.
    (c) Moneys recovered through subrogation. Any moneys recovered by 
the Secretary through the subrogation of a claimant's rights shall be 
deposited into the Fund.
    (d) Investments of the fund. Excess sums in the Fund will be 
invested in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States. Revenue

<R05>
Sec. 296.4  Claims eligible for compensation.

    (a) Claimants. Damage or loss eligible for Fund compensation must be 
suffered by a commercial fisherman.
    (b) Damage or loss of fishing gear. Damage or loss is eligible for 
Fund

[[Page 294]]

compensation if it was caused by materials, equipment, tools, 
containers, or other items associated with OCS oil and gas exploration, 
development, or production activities. Damage or loss may be eligible 
for compensation even though it did not occur in OCS waters if the item 
causing the damage or loss was associated with oil and gas exploration, 
development, or production activities in OCS waters.
    (c) Exceptions. Damage or loss is not eligible for Fund 
compensation:
    (1) If the damage or loss was caused by the negligence or fault of 
the claimant;
    (2) If the damage or loss occurred prior to September 18, 1978;
    (3) To the extent that damage or loss exceeds the replacement value 
of the fishing gear involved;
    (4) For any portion of the damage or loss which can be compensated 
by insurance;
    (5) If the claim is not filed within 90 calendar days of the date 
the claimant or the claimant's agent first became aware of the damage or 
loss (or such longer period as the Secretary may allow under unusual and 
extenuating circumstances); or
    (6) If the damage or loss was caused by an obstruction unrelated to 
OCS oil and gas exploration, development, or production activities.

<R05>
Sec. 296.5  Instructions for filing claims.

    (a) Fifteen-day report required to gain presumption of causation--
(1) General. Damages or losses are presumed to be qualified for 
compensation if certain requirements are satisfied. One requirement is 
that a report must be made to NMFS within fifteen (15) days after the 
date on which the vessel first returns to a port after discovering the 
damage or loss. Filing of a fifteen-day report must be followed up by 
filing a detailed claim.
    (2) When and how to file a fifteen-day report. To qualify for the 
presumption of causation, a fifteen-day report must be made to NMFS 
within fifteen days after the date on which the vessel first returns to 
a port after discovering the damage or loss. Satisfaction of the 
fifteen-day requirement is determined by the postmark, if the report is 
mailed; by the date of a call, if the report is telephoned or 
radiotelephoned; or, by the date of appearance, if the report is made in 
person. The fifteen-day report must be made to the Chief, Financial 
Services Division, National Marine Fisheries Service, 1315 East-West 
Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910; telephone: (301) 713-2396.
    (3) Contents of fifteen-day report. Each fifteen-day report must 
include the following information:
    (i) The claimant's name and address;
    (ii) The name of the commercial fishing vessel involved;
    (iii) The location of the obstruction which caused the damage or 
loss;
    (iv) A description of the nature of the damage or loss;
    (v) The date such damage or loss was discovered;
    (vi) If the fifteen-day report is made after the vessel returns to 
port, the date on which the vessel first returned to port after 
discovering the damage.
    (b) Form of claim. Claims must be in writing. Claims may be 
submitted on NOAA form 88-164. This form may be obtained from any NMFS 
regional office or from the Chief, FSD. Although claimants are not 
required to use this claim form, it will probably be to their benefit to 
do so.
    (c) Who must file and when and where to file claims. All claimants 
(including those who filed 15-day reports to gain the presumption of 
causation) must submit a claim application to the Chief, Financial 
Services Division, within 90 calendar days of the date the claimant or 
the claimant's agent first became aware of the damage or loss. The 
Chief, FSD, may allow a longer period for filing claims if, in his 
discretion, unusual and extenuating circumstances justify a longer 
period. The term ``filed'' means delivered in person, or mailed (as 
determined by the date of the postmark) to the Chief, Financial Services 
Division, National Marine Fisheries Service, 1825 Connecticut Avenue, 
NW., Washington, DC 20235. The Chief, FSD, suggests that mailed claims 
be sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, so 
the claimant will have a record that

[[Page 295]]

the claim was received by the Chief, FSD.
    (d) Aggregating claims. If more than one commercial fisherman 
suffers loss or damage from the same incident (for example, when several 
members of the crew lost income due to loss of fishing time), all claims 
should be submitted on their behalf by the owner or operator of the 
commercial fishing vessel involved.
    (e) Contents of claim. Each claim must be signed by the claimant and 
must accurately and completely provide the following information:
    (1) The name, mailing address, telephone number, citizenship, and 
occupational status (for example, vessel owner, operator, or crew 
member) of each claimant;
    (2) The name and Coast Guard documentation number or State 
registration number of the commercial fishing vessel involved in the 
damage or loss;
    (3) The home port, type, and size of the vessel involved in the 
casualty;
    (4) A full statement of the circumstances of the damage or loss 
including:
    (i) The date when the casualty was first discovered by the claimant,
    (ii) The water depth (if known) and visibility at the time and 
location where the casualty occurred,
    (iii) The direction, speed, and activities of the claimant's vessel 
immediately before, during, and after the casualty (including a full 
description of both the deployment of any fishing gear which is the 
subject of the claim and all attempts at retrieval of the gear),
    (iv) The names and addresses of all witnesses to the casualty,
    (v) The location where the casualty occurred in Loran C coordinates 
or the next most accurate method of position fixing available to the 
claimant,
    (vi) A description of the item or obstruction (if sighted or 
recovered) which caused the casualty, and whether or not any surface 
markers were attached to or near the obstruction. Submit any available 
photographs of the item or obstruction. State reasons for believing the 
obstruction is associated with OCS oil and gas activities.
    (5) The amount claimed for property damage or loss and a full 
statement of the type and extent of damage or loss including:
    (i) An inventory of all components of fishing gear damaged or lost,
    (ii) The date, place, and cost of acquisition of all fishing gear 
damaged or lost and proof of its purchase (sales receipts, affidavits, 
or other evidence),
    (iii) One estimate from a commercial fishing gear repair or supply 
company of the present replacement or repair (whichever applies) cost of 
the damaged or lost fishing gear. If the gear will be repaired by the 
claimant himself, a detailed estimate by the claimant identifying the 
repair cost.
    (6) The amount claimed for economic loss and the basis for that 
amount with supporting documentation, as follows:
    (i) Trip tickets for the three vessel trips immediately before the 
trip during which the casualty was discovered and for the vessel trip 
immediately following the trip during which the casualty occurred.
    (ii) A statement of the amount of time involved on each of the 
vessel trips above (or if the casualty involves fixed gear, a statement 
of the number of gear units deployed on each of these trips).
    (iii) A statement of the amount of time lost from fishing because of 
the damage or loss and a full explanation of why this time period is 
reasonable.
    (iv) Documentation of the date replacement gear was ordered and 
received or the date gear repair began and ended. This documentation may 
consist of purchase orders, bills of lading, or statements from sellers 
or repairers.
    (7) The amount claimed for other consequential loss or costs 
(including fees for claim preparation, etc.) with suitable documentation 
of the amounts claimed (such as invoices, receipts, etc.).

<R05>
Sec. 296.6  NMFS processing of claims.

    (a) Action by NMFS. Upon receipt of a claim, the Chief, FSD, will:
    (1) Send an abstract of the claim to the Secretary of the Interior;
    (2) Send the reported location of any obstruction which was not 
recovered

[[Page 296]]

and retained to the National Ocean Survey, which will inform the Defense 
Mapping Agency Hydrographic/Topographic Center.
    (b) Actions by the Interior Department. Upon receipt of an abstract 
of a claim, the Interior Department will immediately:
    (1) Plot the casualty site, and advise NMFS whether the site is in 
an area affected by OCS activities;
    (2) make reasonable efforts to notify all persons known to have 
engaged in activities associated with OCS energy activity in the 
vicinity where the damage or loss occurred.
    (c) Responses to notice of claim. (1) Each person notified by the 
Interior Department will, within thirty days after receipt of the 
notice, advise the Chief, FSD, and the Interior Department whether he 
admits or denies responsibility for the damages claimed.
    (2) Each person notified by the Interior Department who fails to 
give timely and proper advice of admission or denial of responsibility 
shall be presumed to deny responsibility for the damages claimed.
    (3) If any person admits responsibility, the Chief, FSD, will 
initiate action to recover from that party any sums paid or to be paid 
for the claimed damages.
    (4) Any person referred to in this section, including lessees or 
permittees or their contractors or subcontractors, may submit evidence 
about any claim to the Chief, FSD.
    (d) Failure to meet filing requirements. The Chief, FSD, may reject 
any claim that does not meet the filing requirements. The Chief, FSD, 
will give a claimant whose claim is rejected written notice of the 
reasons for rejection within 30 days after the date on which the claim 
was filed. If the claimant does not refile an acceptable claim within 30 
days after the date of this written notice, the claimant is not eligible 
for Fund compensation unless there are extenuating circumstances.
    (e) Proceedings--(1) Location. Any required proceeding will be 
conducted within such United States judicial district as may be mutually 
agreeable to the claimant and the Assistant Administrator, NMFS, or his 
designee, or if no agreement can be reached, within the United States 
judicial district in which the claimant's home port is located.
    (2) Powers. For purposes of any proceeding, the Assistant 
Administrator, NMFS, or his designee, shall have the power to administer 
oaths and subpoena witnesses and the production of books, records, and 
other evidence relative to the issues involved.
    (3) Amendments to claims. A claimant may amend the claim at any time 
before the Chief, FSD, issues an initial determination.
    (4) Criminal penalty for fraudulent claims. Any person who files a 
fraudulent claim is subject to prosecution under 18 U.S.C. sections 287 
and 1001, each of which, upon conviction, imposes a penalty of not more 
than a $10,000 fine and 5 years' imprisonment, or both.

[47 FR 49600, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 6322, Feb. 20, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 296.7  Burden of proof and presumption of causation.

    (a) Burden of proof. The claimant has the burden to establish, by a 
preponderance of the evidence, all facts necessary to qualify his claim, 
including:
    (1) The identity or nature of the item which caused the damage or 
loss; and
    (2) That the item is associated with oil and gas exploration, 
development, or production activities on the Outer Continental Shelf.
    (b) Presumption of causation. Notwithstanding the above, damages or 
losses are presumed to be caused by items associated with oil and gas 
exploration, development, or production activities on the OCS if the 
claimant establishes that:
    (1) The claimant's commercial fishing vessel was being used for 
commercial fishing and was located in an area affected by OCS oil and 
gas exploration, development, or production activities;
    (2) A report on the location of the obstruction which caused such 
damage or loss, and the nature of such damage or loss, was made within 
fifteen days after the date on which the vessel first returned to a port 
after discovering such damage;
    (3) There was no record on the most recent nautical charts issued by 
the

[[Page 297]]

National Ocean Survey, NOAA, or in any weekly Notice to Mariners issued 
by the Defense Mapping Agency Hydrographic/Topographic Center, in effect 
at least 15 days before the date the damage or loss occurred, then an 
obstruction existed in the immediate vicinity where the damage or loss 
occurred. In the case of damages caused by a pipeline, the presumption 
will be available regardless of whether the pipeline was recorded on 
charts or in the Notice to Mariners; and
    (4) There was no proper surface marker or lighted buoy attached, or 
closely anchored, to such obstruction.
    (c) Geographic exclusion from presumption of causation. Damage or 
loss occurring within a one-quarter mile radius of obstructions recorded 
on charts or in a Notice to Mariners, or properly marked, is presumed to 
involve the recorded or marked obstruction.


<R05>
Sec. 296.8  Amount of award.

    (a) Actual damages. The award for damaged fishing gear will be the 
lesser of the gear's repair cost or replacement cost. The award for lost 
fishing gear will be the gear's replacement cost.
    (b) Consequential damages. An award may also include compensation 
for any damage or loss (except personal injury) that is incurred as a 
consequence of the fishing gear damage or loss.
    (c) Resulting economic loss. An award may also include 50 percent of 
the resulting economic loss from damage to or loss of fishing vessels 
and gear.
    (d) Attorney, CPA, consultant fees. An award may also include 
compensation for reasonable fees paid by the claimant to an attorney, 
CPA, or other consultant for the preparation or prosecution of a claim.
    (e) Negligence of claimant. (1) An award will be reduced to the 
extent that the loss or damage was caused by the negligence or fault of 
the claimant. (For example, a claimant who sustained $10,000 in damages 
and whose negligence or fault was found to be responsible for 40% of the 
damage would receive $6,000 in compensation. If the same claimant were 
responsible for 99% of the negligence or fault that caused the damage, 
the claimant would receive $100 in compensation).
    (2) Negligence of the owner or operator of the fishing vessel or 
gear will reduce crewmember awards to the same extent that it reduces an 
award to the vessel's owner or operator.
    (f) Insurance proceeds. An award will be reduced by the amount the 
claimant has, or reasonably would have, received under a commercial 
policy of full hull and machinery and protection and indemnity 
insurance, whether or not such insurance was in effect at the time the 
casualty occurred.

    (b) If the claim is approved, the amount of compensation and the 
basis on which the amount was determined.


<R05>
Sec. 296.10  Agency review.

    (a) Within 30 days after the Chief, FDS, issues an initial

submitted evidence relating to the initial determination, may ask the 
Assistant Administrator, NMFS, or his designee, for a review of the 
initial determination.
    (b) The petitioner may submit written or oral evidence within 30 
days of filing the petition for review.


<R05>
Sec. 296.11  Final determination.

    (a) If a petition for review of an initial determination is filed 
within 30 days after the date the Chief, FSD, issues an initial 
determination, the Assistant Administrator, NMFS, or his designee will 
conduct a review of the initial determination, and will issue a final 
determination no later than 60 days after receipt of the request for 
review of the initial determination.
    (b) If a petition for review of an initial determination is not 
filed within 30 days after the day on which the Chief, FSD, issues an 
initial determination, the initial determination will become a final 
determination.

[[Page 298]]


<R05>
Sec. 296.12  Payment of costs.

    (a) By person denying responsibility for damage. Any person who is 
notified by the Interior Department and fails to respond or denies 
responsibility for the damages claimed will pay the costs of the 
proceedings if such person is subsequently found to be responsible for 
the damage claimed.
    (b) By the claimant. Any claimant who files a claim will pay the 
cost of the proceedings if such person is subsequently found to be 
responsible for the damage claimed.
    (c) By person denying responsibility for damage and the claimant. If 
more than one party is found to have responsibility for the damage 
claimed, then the cost of the proceedings will be apportioned between 
them.


<R05>
Sec. 296.13  Payment of award for claim.

    (a) Upon an initial determination, the Chief, Financial Services 
Division, shall immediately disburse the claim awarded if the claimant 
signed as part of his/her application a statement agreeing to repay all 
or any part of the award if the award should for any reason be 
subsequently reduced.
    (b) [Reserved]

[61 FR 6322, Feb. 20, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 296.14  Subrogation.

    (a) The claim application will contain a subrogation statement 
signed by the claimant as a condition of payment of the claim which:
    (1) Assigns to the Fund the claimant's rights against third parties; 
and
    (2) Provides that the claimant will assist the Fund in any 
reasonable way to pursue those rights.
    (b) Collection of subrogated rights. If a reasonable chance of 
successful collection exists, NMFS will refer any subrogated rights to 
the Justice Department for collection.
    (c) Any moneys recovered through subrogation shall be deposited into

part.
    (e) Refuse to allow an authorized officer to inspect any report or 
record required to be made or kept under this part.
    (f) Falsify, cover, or otherwise obscure, the name, home port, 
official number (if any), or any other similar marking or identification 
of any fishing vessel subject to this part such that the vessel cannot 
be readily identified from an enforcement vessel or aircraft.
    (g) Fail to comply immediately with any of the enforcement and 
boarding procedures specified in this part.
    (h) Refuse to allow an authorized officer to board a fishing vessel, 
or enter any other area of custody (i.e., any vessel, building, vehicle, 
live car, pound, pier, or dock facility where fish might be found) 
subject to such person's control, for the purpose of conducting any

the enforcement of this part or any other applicable law.
    (i) Destroy, stave, or dispose of in any manner, any fish, gear, 
cargo, or other matter, upon any communication or signal from an

    (q) Attempt to do any of the foregoing.


<R05>
Sec. 300.5  Facilitation of enforcement.

    (a) Compliance. The operator of, or any other person aboard, any 
fishing vessel subject to this part must immediately comply with 
instructions and signals issued by an authorized officer or CCAMLR 
inspector to stop the vessel, and with instructions to facilitate safe 
boarding and inspection of the vessel, its gear, equipment, fishing 
record (where applicable), and catch for purposes of enforcing this 
part.
    (b) Communications. (1) Upon being approached by a USCG vessel or 
aircraft, or other vessel or aircraft with an authorized officer or 
CCAMLR inspector aboard, the operator of a fishing vessel must be alert 
for communications conveying enforcement instructions.
    (2) VHF-FM radiotelephone is the preferred method of communicating 
between vessels. If the size of the vessel and the wind, sea, and 
visibility conditions allow, a loudhailer may be used instead of the 
radio. Hand signals, placards, high frequency radiotelephone, voice, 
flags, whistle or horn may be employed by an authorized officer or 
CCAMLR inspector, and message blocks may be dropped from an aircraft.
    (3) If other communications are not practicable, visual signals may 
be

[[Page 304]]

transmitted by flashing light directed at the vessel signaled. USCG 
units will normally use the flashing light signal ``L'' which, in the 
International Code of Signals, means ``you should stop your vessel 
instantly.''
    (4) Failure of a vessel's operator promptly to stop the vessel when 
directed to do so by an authorized officer or CCAMLR inspector, or by an 
enforcement vessel or aircraft, using loudhailer, radiotelephone, 
flashing light, flags, whistle, horn or other means constitutes prima 
facie evidence of the offense of refusal to allow an authorized officer 
or CCAMLR inspector to board.
    (5) A person aboard a vessel who does not understand a signal from 
an enforcement unit and who is unable to obtain clarification by 
loudhailer or radiotelephone must consider the signal to be a command to 
stop the vessel immediately.
    (c) Boarding. The operator of a vessel directed to stop must:
    (1) Monitor Channel 16, VHF-FM, if so equipped.
    (2) Stop immediately and lay to or, if appropriate and/or directed 
to do so by the authorized officer or CCAMLR inspector, maneuver in such 
a way as to allow the safe boarding of the vessel by the authorized 
officer or CCAMLR inspector and the boarding party.
    (3) Except for those vessels with a freeboard of 4 ft (1.25 m) or 
less, provide a safe ladder, if needed, for the authorized officer or 
CCAMLR inspector and boarding party to come aboard.
    (4) When necessary to facilitate the boarding or when requested by 
an authorized officer or CCAMLR inspector, provide a manrope or safety 
line, and illumination for the ladder.
    (5) Take such other actions as necessary to facilitate boarding and 
to ensure the safety of the authorized officer or CCAMLR inspector and 
the boarding party.
    (d) Signals. The following signals, extracted from the International 
Code of Signals, may be sent by flashing light by an enforcement unit 
when conditions do not allow communications by loudhailer or 
radiotelephone. Knowledge of these signals by vessel operators is not 
required. However, knowledge of these signals and appropriate action by 
a vessel operator may preclude the necessity of sending the signal ``L'' 
and the necessity for the vessel to stop instantly.
    (1) ``AA'' repeated (.- .-) is the call to an unknown station. The 
operator of the signaled vessel should respond by identifying the vessel 
by radiotelephone or by illuminating the vessel's identification.
    (2) ``RY-CY'' (.-. -.-- -.-. -.--) means ``you should proceed at 
slow speed, a boat is coming to you.'' This signal is normally employed 
when conditions allow an enforcement boarding without the necessity of 
the vessel being boarded coming to a complete stop, or, in some cases, 
without retrieval of fishing gear that may be in the water.
    (3) ``SQ3'' (... --.- ...--) means ``you should stop or heave to; I 
am going to board you.''

While applicants for permits may submit an application to any Regional 
Director, applicants are encouraged to submit their applications (with 
envelopes marked ``Attn: HSFCA Permits'') to the Regional Director with 
whom they normally interact on fisheries matters.


<R05>
Sec. 300.13  Vessel permits.

    (a) Eligibility. (1) Except for vessels having unpaid or overdue 
civil penalties, criminal fines, or other liabilities incurred in a 
judicial proceeding under any statute administered by NOAA, any high 
seas fishing vessel of the United States is eligible to receive a permit 
under this subpart, unless the vessel was previously authorized to be 
used for fishing on the high seas by a foreign nation, and--
    (i) The foreign nation suspended such authorization, because the 
vessel undermined the effectiveness of international conservation and 
management measures, and the suspension has not expired; or
    (ii) The foreign nation, within the 3 years preceding application 
for a permit under this section, withdrew such authorization, because 
the vessel undermined the effectiveness of international conservation 
and management measures.
    (2) The restrictions in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this 
section do not apply if ownership of the vessel has changed since the 
vessel undermined the effectiveness of international conservation and 
management measures, and the new owner has provided sufficient evidence 
to the Regional Director demonstrating that the owner and operator at 
the time the vessel undermined the effectiveness of such measures has no 
further legal, beneficial, or financial interest in, or control of, the 
vessel.
    (3) The restrictions in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this 
section do not apply if it is determined by the Regional Director that 
issuing a permit would not subvert the purposes of the Agreement.
    (b) Application forms. The owner or operator of a high seas fishing 
vessel may apply for a permit under this subpart by completing an 
application form. Applicants may obtain an application form from a 
Regional Director.
    (c) Application information. An applicant must submit a complete and 
accurate permit application, signed by the owner or operator, to the 
appropriate Regional Director.
    (d) Fees. NMFS will charge a fee to recover the administrative 
expenses of permit issuance. The amount of the fee will be determined in 
accordance with the procedures of the NOAA Finance Handbook, available 
from a Regional Director, for determining administrative costs of each 
special product or service. The fee is specified with the application 
form. The appropriate fee must accompany each application. Failure to 
pay the fee will preclude issuance of the permit. Payment by a 
commercial instrument later determined to be insufficiently funded will 
invalidate any permit.
    (e) Issuance. (1) Except as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 
904, the Regional Director will issue a permit, which will include 
appropriate conditions or restrictions, within 30 days of receipt of a 
completed application and payment of the appropriate fee.
    (2) The Regional Director will notify the applicant of any 
deficiency in the application.
    (f) Validity. Permits issued under this subpart are valid for 5 
years from the date of issuance. Renewal of a permit

[[Page 306]]

prior to its expiration is the responsibility of the permit holder. For 
a permit to remain valid to its expiration date, the vessel's USCG 
documentation or state registration must be kept current. A permit 
issued under this subpart is void when the name of the owner or vessel 
changes, or in the event the vessel is no longer eligible for U.S. 
documentation, such documentation is revoked or denied, or the vessel is 
removed from such documentation.
    (g) Change in application information. Any changes in vessel 
documentation status or other permit application information must be 
reported to the Regional Director in writing within 15 days of such 
changes.
    (h) Transfer. A permit issued under this subpart is not transferable 
or assignable to another vessel or owner; it is valid only for the 
vessel and owner to which it is issued.
    (i) Display. A valid permit, or a copy thereof, issued under this 
subpart must be on board the vessel while operating on the high seas and 
available for inspection by an authorized officer. Faxed copies of 
permits are acceptable.

change in previously submitted information within 10 days of the change.
    (3) Additional conditions and restrictions. The Assistant 
Administrator may revise the CEMP permit effective upon notification of 
the permit holder, to impose additional conditions and restrictions as 
necessary to achieve the purposes of the Convention, the Act and the 
CEMP Management Plan. The CEMP permit holder must, as soon as possible, 
notify any and all agents operating under the permit of any and all 
revisions or modifications to the permit.
    (k) Revocation or suspension. CEMP permits may be revoked or 
suspended based upon information received by the Assistant Administrator 
and such revocation or suspension shall be effective upon notification 
to the permit holder.
    (1) A CEMP permit may be revoked or suspended based on a violation 
of the permit, the Act, or this subpart.
    (2) Failure to report a change in the information submitted in a 
CEMP permit application within 10 days of the change is a violation of 
this subpart and voids the application or permit, as applicable. Title 
15 CFR part 904 governs permit sanctions under this subpart.
    (l) Exceptions. Entry into a Protected Site described in this 
section is lawful if committed under emergency conditions to prevent the 
loss of human life, compromise human safety, prevent the loss of vessels 
or aircraft, or to prevent environmental damage.
    (m) Protected sites. (1) Sites protected by the Antarctic Treaty and 
regulated under the ACA are listed at 45 CFR part 670 subparts G and H.
    (2) The following sites have been identified as CEMP Protected Sites 
subject to the regulatory authority of the Act:
    (i) Seal Islands, South Shetland Islands--The Seal Islands are 
composed of islands and skerries located approximately 7 km north of the 
northwest corner of Elephant Island, South Shetland Islands. The Seal 
Islands CEMP Protected Site includes the entire Seal Islands group, 
which is defined as Seal Island plus any land or rocks exposed at mean 
low tide within a distance of 5.5 km of the point of highest elevation 
on Seal Island. Seal Island is situated at 60 deg.59'14'' S. lat., 
55 deg.23'04'' W. long.
    (ii) Cape Shirreff and the San Telmo Islands. This designation takes 
effect on May 1, 1995. Cape Shirreff is a low, ice-free peninsula 
towards the western end of the north coast of Livingston Island, South 
Shetland Islands, situated at 62 deg.29' S. lat., 60 deg.47' W. long., 
between Barclay Bay and Hero Bay. San Telmo Island is the largest of a 
small group of ice-free rock islets, approximately 2 km west of Cape 
Shirreff. The boundaries of the Cape Shirreff CEMP Protected Site are 
identical to the boundaries of the Site of Special Scientific Interest 
No. 32, as specified by ATCM Recommendation XV-7. No manmade boundary 
markers indicate the limits of the SSSI or protected site. The 
boundaries are defined by natural features and include the entire area 
of the Cape Shirreff peninsula north of the glacier ice tongue margin, 
and most of the San Telmo Island group. For the purposes of the 
protected site, the entire area of Cape Shirreff and the San Telmo 
Island group is defined as any land or rocks exposed at mean low tide 
within the area delimited by the map of SSSI No. 32 and available from 
the Assistant Administrator.

a new fishery shall notify the Assistant Administrator no later than 
July 1 of the year in which he or she intends to initiate the fishery 
and shall not initiate the fishery pending CCAMLR review.
    (c) The notification shall be accompanied by information on:
    (1) The nature of the proposed fishery, including target species, 
methods of fishing, proposed region and any minimum level of catches 
that would be required to develop a viable fishery.
    (2) Biological information from comprehensive research/survey 
cruises, such as distribution, abundance, demographic data and 
information on stock identity.
    (3) Details of dependent and associated species and the likelihood 
of them being affected by the proposed fishery.
    (4) Information from other fisheries in the region or similar 
fisheries elsewhere that may assist in the valuation of potential yield.


<R05>
Sec. 300.106  Exploratory fisheries.

    (a) An exploratory fishery, for purposes of this section, is a 
fishery that was previously defined as a new fishery under Sec. 300.105.
    (b) A fishery will continue to be classified as an exploratory 
fishery until sufficient information is available to:
    (1) Evaluate the distribution, abundance, and demography of the 
target species, leading to an estimate of the fishery's potential yield.
    (2) Review the fishery's potential impacts on dependent and related 
species.
    (3) Allow the CCAMLR Scientific Committee to formulate and provide 
advice to the Commission on appropriate harvest catch levels and fishing 
gear.
    (c) Each vessel participating in an exploratory fishery must carry a 
scientific observer.

[[Page 326]]

    (d) The operator of any vessel engaging in an exploratory fishery 
must submit, by the date specified in the operator's harvesting permit, 
catch, effort, and related biological, ecological, and environmental 
data as required by a data collection plan for the fishery formulated by 
the CCAMLR Scientific Committee.
    (e) In addition to the requirements in Sec. 300.112, any individual 
planning to enter an exploratory fishery must notify the Assistant 
Administrator no later than 4 months in advance of the annual meeting of 
CCAMLR. The Assistant Administrator will not issue a permit to enter an 
exploratory fishery until after the requirements of Sec. 300.112 have 
been met and the meeting of CCAMLR, which receives and considers the 
notice made to the Assistant Administrator, has been concluded.


<R05>
Sec. 300.107  Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

    The operator of any vessel required to have a permit under this 
subpart must:
    (a) Accurately maintain on board the vessel a fishing logbook and 
all other reports and records required by its permit.
    (b) Make such reports and records available for inspection upon the 
request of an authorized officer or CCAMLR inspector.
    (c) Within the time specified in the permit, submit a copy of such 
reports and records to the Assistant Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 300.108  Vessel and gear identification.

    (a) Vessel identification. (1) The operator of each harvesting 
vessel assigned an IRCS must display that call sign amidships on both 
the port and starboard sides of the deckhouse or hull, so that it is 
visible from an enforcement or inspection vessel, and on an appropriate 
weather deck so that it is visible from the air.
    (2) The operator of each harvesting vessel not assigned an IRCS, 
such as a small trawler associated with a mothership or one of a pair of 
trawlers, must display the IRCS of the associated vessel, followed by a 
numerical suffix specific for the non-assigned vessel.
    (3) The vessel identification must be in a color in contrast to the 
background and must be permanently affixed to the harvesting vessel in 
block roman alphabet letters and arabic numerals at least 1 m in height 
for harvesting vessels over 20 m in length, and at least 0.5 m in height 
for all other harvesting vessels.
    (b) Navigational lights and shapes. Each harvesting vessel must 
display the lights and shapes prescribed by the International 
Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (TIAS 8587, and 1981 
amendment TIAS 10672), for the activity in which the harvesting vessel 
is engaged (as described at 33 CFR part 81).
    (c) Gear identification. (1) The operator of each harvesting vessel 
must ensure that all deployed fishing gear that is not physically and 
continuously attached to a harvesting vessel is clearly marked at the 
surface with a buoy displaying the vessel identification of the 
harvesting vessel (see paragraph (a) of this section) to which the gear 
belongs, a light visible for 2 miles at night in good visibility, and a 
radio buoy. Trawl codends passed from one vessel to another are 
considered continuously attached gear and do not have to be marked.
    (2) The operator of each harvesting vessel must ensure that deployed 
longlines, strings of traps or pots, and gillnets are marked at the 
surface at each terminal end with a buoy displaying the vessel 
identification of the harvesting vessel to which the gear belongs (see 
paragraph (a) of this section), a light visible for 2 miles at night in 
good visibility, and a radio buoy.
    (3) Unmarked or incorrectly identified fishing gear may be 
considered abandoned and may be disposed of in accordance with 
applicable Federal regulations by any authorized officer or CCAMLR 
inspector.
    (d) Maintenance. The operator of each harvesting vessel must:
    (1) Keep the vessel and gear identification clearly legible and in 
good repair.
    (2) Ensure that nothing on the harvesting vessel obstructs the view 
of the

[[Page 327]]

markings from an enforcement or inspection vessel or aircraft.
    (3) Ensure that the proper navigational lights and shapes are 
displayed for the harvesting vessel's activity and are properly 
functioning.


<R05>
Sec. 300.109  Gear disposal.

    (a) The operator of a harvesting vessel may not dump overboard, 
jettison or otherwise discard any article or substance that may 
interfere with other fishing vessels or gear, or that may catch fish or 
cause damage to any marine resource, including marine mammals and birds, 
except in cases of emergency involving the safety of the ship or crew, 
or as specifically authorized by communication from the appropriate USCG 
commander or authorized officer. These articles and substances include, 
but are not limited to, fishing gear, net scraps, bale straps, plastic 
bags, oil drums, petroleum containers, oil, toxic chemicals or any 
manmade items retrieved in a harvesting vessel's gear.
    (b) The operator of a harvesting vessel may not abandon fishing gear 
in Convention waters.
    (c) The operator of a harvesting vessel must provide a copy of the 
CCAMLR information brochure ``Marine Debris--A Potential Threat to 
Antarctic Marine Mammals'' to each member of the crew of the harvesting 
vessel and must display copies of the CCAMLR placard ``Avoidance of 
Incidental Mortality of Antarctic Marine Mammals'' in the wheelhouse and 
crew quarters of the harvesting vessels. Copies of the brochure and 
placard will be provided to each holder of a harvesting permit by NMFS 
when issuing the permit.


<R05>
Sec. 300.110  Mesh size.

    (a) The use of pelagic and bottom trawls having the mesh size in any 
part of a trawl less than indicated is prohibited for any directed 
fishing for the following Antarctic finfishes:
    (1) Notothenia rossii and Dissostichus eleginoides--120 mm.
    (2) Champsocephalus gunnari--90 mm.
    (3) Gobionotothen gibberifrons, Notothenia kempi and Lepidorhirus 
squamifrons--80 mm.
    (b) Any means or device that would reduce the size or obstruct the 
opening of the meshes is prohibited.
    (c) The following procedure will be used for determining compliance 
with mesh size requirements.
    (1) Description of gauges. (i) Gauges for determining mesh sizes 
will be 2 mm thick, flat, of durable material and capable of retaining 
their shape. They may have either a series of parallel-edged sides 
connected by intermediate tapering edges with a taper of one to eight on 
each side, or only tapering edges with the taper defined above. They 
will have a hole at the narrowest extremity.
    (ii) Each gauge will be inscribed on its face with the width in 
millimeters both on the parallel-sided section, if any, and on the 
tapering section. In the case of the latter, the width will be inscribed 
every 1 mm interval, but the indication of the width may appear at 
regular intervals other than 1 mm.
    (2) Use of the gauge. (i) The net will be stretched in the direction 
of the long diagonal of the meshes.
    (ii) A gauge as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section will 
be inserted by its narrowest extremity into the mesh opening in a 
direction perpendicular to the plane of the net.
    (iii) The gauge may be inserted into the mesh opening either with a 
manual force or using a weight or dynamometer, until it is stopped at 
the tapering edges by the resistance of the mesh.
    (3) Selection of meshes to be measured. (i) Meshes to be measured 
will form a series of 20 consecutive meshes chosen in the direction of 
the long axis of the net, except that the meshes to be measured need not 
be consecutive if the application of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this 
section prevents it.
    (ii) Meshes less than 50 cm from lacings, ropes, or codline will not 
be measured. This distance will be measured perpendicular to the 
lacings, ropes or codline with the net stretched in the direction of 
that measurement. No mesh will be measured which has been mended or 
broken or has attachments to the net fixed at that mesh.
    (iii) Nets will be measured only when wet and unfrozen.
    (4) The measurement of each mesh will be the width of the gauge at 
the

[[Page 328]]

point where the gauge is stopped, when using this gauge in accordance 
with paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (5) Determination of the mesh size of the net will be the 
arithmetical mean in millimeters of the measurements of the total number 
of meshes selected and measured as provided for in paragraphs (c) (3) 
and (4) of this section, the arithmetical mean being rounded up to the 
next millimeter.
    (6) Inspection procedure. (i) One series of 20 meshes, selected in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section, will be measured by 
inserting the gauge manually without using a weight or dynamometer. The 
mesh size of the net will then be determined in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(5) of this section. If the calculation of the mesh size 
shows that the mesh size does not appear to comply with the rules in 
force, then two additional series of 20 meshes selected in accordance 
with paragraph (c)(3) of this section will be measured. The mesh size 
will then be recalculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(5) of this 
section, taking into account the 60 meshes already measured; this 
recalculation will be the mesh size of the net.
    (ii) If the captain of the vessel contests the mesh size determined 
in accordance with paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, such measurement 
will not be considered for the determination of the mesh size and the 
net will be remeasured.
    (A) A weight or dynamometer attached to the gauge will be used for 
remeasurement. The choice of weight or dynamometer is at the discretion 
of the inspectors. The weight will be fixed to the hole in the narrowest 
extremity of the gauge using a hook. The dynamometer may either be fixed 
to the hole in the narrowest extremity of the gauge or be applied at the 
largest extremity of the gauge.
    (B) The accuracy of the weight or dynamometer must be certified by 
the appropriate national authority.
    (C) For nets of a mesh size of 35 mm or less as determined in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, a force of 19.61 
newtons (equivalent to a mass of 2 kg) will be applied, and for other 
nets, a force of 49.03 newtons (equivalent to a mass of 5 kg).
    (D) For the purposes of determining the mesh size in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(5) of this section, when using a weight or dynamometer, 
one series of 20 meshes only will be measured.


<R05>
Sec. 300.111  Framework for annual management measures.

    (a) Introduction. New management measures may be added and others 
modified through publication of a regulatory action in the Federal 
Register. The following framework process authorizes the implementation 
of measures that may affect the operation of the commercial or 
exploratory fisheries, gear, area restrictions, or changes in catch and/
or effort.
    (b) Preliminary notice. The Secretary of State shall publish 
preliminary notice in the Federal Register of the management measures 
adopted by the parties to the Convention.
    (c) Procedure. At its annual meeting, usually in October or 
November, the Commission may recommend new measures and that established 
measures be modified, removed, or re-instituted. After public notice of 
those recommendations by the Secretary of State and opportunity for 
public comment, and after considering the impact of instituting the 
measures and any public comment received by the Secretary of State, the 
Assistant Administrator may implement the management measures by notice 
in the Federal Register, with immediate force and effect. The 
notification in the Federal Register will summarize new management 
measures, and respond to any public comments received by the Secretary 
of State on the preliminary notice.
    (d) Types of management measures to be frameworked. Management 
measures that may be implemented by regulatory notice rather than by 
codified regulation are those that generally will not remain in effect 
for more than 12 months and include catch restrictions, time and area 
closures, and gear restrictions.


<R05>
Sec. 300.112  Harvesting permits.

    (a) General. (1) Every vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the 
United States that attempts to reduce or reduces any

[[Page 329]]

AMLR to possession must have a harvesting permit authorizing the attempt 
or reduction, unless the attempt or reduction occurs during recreational 
fishing or is covered by an individual permit. Boats launched from a 
vessel issued a harvesting permit do not require a separate permit, but 
are covered by the permit issued the launching vessel. Any enforcement 
action that results from the activities of a launched boat will be taken 
against the launching vessel.
    (2) Permits issued under this section do not authorize vessels or 
persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to harass, 
capture, harm, kill, harvest, or import marine mammals. No marine 
mammals may be taken in the course of commercial fishing operations 
unless the taking is allowed under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and/
or the Endangered Species Act pursuant to an exemption or permit granted 
by the appropriate agency.
    (b) Responsibility of owners and operators. (1) The owners and 
operators of each harvesting vessel are jointly and severally 
responsible for compliance with the Act, this subpart, and any permit 
issued under the Act and this subpart.
    (2) The owners and operators of each such vessel are responsible for 
the acts of their employees and agents constituting violations, 
regardless of whether the specific acts were authorized or forbidden by 
the owners or operators, and regardless of knowledge concerning their 
occurrence.
    (3) The owner of such vessel must report any sale, change in 
ownership, or other disposition of the vessel to the Assistant 
Administrator within 15 days of the occurrence.
    (c) Application. Application forms for harvesting permits are 
available from the Assistant Administrator (Attn: CCAMLR permits). A 
separate fully completed and accurate application must be submitted for 
each vessel for which a harvesting permit is requested at least 90 days 
before the date anticipated for the beginning of harvesting.
    (d) Issuance. The Assistant Administrator may issue a harvesting 
permit to a vessel if the Assistant Administrator determines that the 
harvesting described in the application will meet the requirements of 
the Act and will not:
    (1) Decrease the size of any harvested population to levels below 
those that ensure its stable recruitment. For this purpose, the 
Convention recommends that its size not be allowed to fall below a level 
close to that which ensures the greatest net annual increment.
    (2) Upset the ecological relationships between harvested, dependent, 
and related populations of AMLRs and the restoration of depleted 
populations to levels that will ensure stable recruitment.
    (3) Cause changes or increase the risk of changes in the marine 
ecosystem that are not potentially reversible over 2 or 3 decades, 
taking into account the state of available knowledge of the direct and 
indirect impact of harvesting, the effect of the introduction of alien 
species, the effects of associated activities on the marine ecosystem 
and of the effects of environmental changes, with the aim of making 
possible the sustained conservation of AMLRs.
    (4) Violate the management measures issued pursuant to Sec. 300.111 
of this subpart.
    (5) Violate any other conservation measures in force with respect to 
the United States under the Convention or the Act.
    (e) Duration. A harvesting permit is valid from its date of issuance 
to its date of expiration unless it is revoked or suspended.
    (f) Transfer. Permits are not transferable or assignable. A permit 
is valid only for the vessel to which it is issued.
    (g) Display. Each harvesting vessel when engaged in harvesting must 
either have on board an up-to-date copy of its harvesting permit or a 
fully completed and up-to-date harvesting vessel certificate and the 
vessel operator must produce it for inspection upon the request of an 
authorized officer or CCAMLR inspector. In order for the certificate to 
be considered complete, the vessel owner or operator must enter on it 
the name and IRCS of the vessel issued the harvesting permit, the number 
of the harvesting permit and its date of issuance and expiration, the 
harvesting authorized by the permit, and all conditions and restrictions

[[Page 330]]

contained in the permit. Blank certificates are available from the 
Assistant Administrator.
    (h) Changes in information submitted by permit applicants or 
holders--(1) Changes in pending applications. Applicants for a 
harvesting permit must report to the Assistant Administrator in writing 
any change in the information contained in the application. The 
processing period for the application will be extended as necessary to 
review the change.
    (2) Changes occurring after permit issuance--(i) Changes other than 
in the manner and amount of harvesting. The owner or operator of a 
vessel that has been issued a harvesting permit must report to the 
Assistant Administrator in writing any change in previously submitted 
information other than a proposed change in the location, manner, or 
amount of harvesting within 15 days of the change. Based on such 
reported information, the Assistant Administrator may revise the permit 
effective upon notification to the permit holder. As soon as possible, 
the vessel owner or operator must revise any harvesting vessel 
certificate evidencing the permit, accordingly.
    (ii) Requested changes in the location, manner, or amount of 
harvesting. Any changes in the manner or amount of harvesting must be 
proposed in writing to the Assistant Administrator and may not be 
undertaken unless authorized by the Assistant Administrator through a 
permit revision or issuance of a new permit. If a requested change in 
the location, manner, or amount of harvesting could significantly affect 
the status of any Antarctic marine living resource, the Assistant 
Administrator will treat the requested change as an application for a 
new permit and so notify the holder.
    (i) Additional conditions and restrictions. The Assistant 
Administrator may revise the harvesting permit, effective upon 
notification to the permit holder, to impose additional conditions and 
restrictions on the harvesting vessel as necessary to achieve the 
purposes of the Convention or the Act. The permit holder must, as soon 
as possible, direct the vessel operator to revise the harvesting vessel 
certificate, if any, accordingly.
    (j) Revision, suspension, or revocation for violations. A harvesting 
permit may be revised, suspended, or revoked if the harvesting vessel is 
involved in the commission of any violation of its permit, the Act, or 
this subpart. Failure to report a change in the information contained in 
an application within 15 days of the change is a violation of this 
subpart and voids the application or permit, as applicable. If a change 
in vessel ownership is not reported, the violation is chargeable to the 
previous owner. Title 15 CFR part 904 governs permit sanctions under 
this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 300.113  Import permits.

    (a) General. (1) Any AMLR may be imported into the United States if 
its harvest is authorized by an individual permit or a harvesting 
permit. The harvesting permit, the harvesting vessel certificate, or the 
individual permit, or a copy of any thereof, must accompany the import. 
AMLRs harvested by entities not subject to U.S. jurisdiction and, thus, 
not harvested under a U.S. issued permit (i.e., a harvesting permit or 
an individual permit), also may be imported into the United States if 
such harvesting will meet or met the requirements of the Act and will 
not or did not violate any conservation measure in force with respect to 
the United States under the Convention or the Act or violate any of the 
regulations in this subpart, including resource management measures 
contained therein. A NMFS issued import permit or copy thereof must 
accompany such an import as proof that the foreign harvested resources 
met such requirements. Further, the importer is required to complete and 
return to the Assistant Administrator, no later than 10 days after the 
date of the importation, an import ticket reporting the importation. 
However, in no event may a marine mammal be imported into the United 
States unless authorized and accompanied by an import permit issued 
under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and/or the Endangered Species 
Act.
    (2) A permit issued under this section does not authorize the 
harvest of any AMLRs.
    (b) Application. Application forms for import permits are available 
from the

[[Page 331]]

Assistant Administrator (Attn: CCAMLR permits). A fully completed and 
accurate application must be submitted for each import permit requested 
at least 30 days before the anticipated date of the importation.
    (c) Issuance. The Assistant Administrator may issue an import permit 
if the Assistant Administrator determines that the importation meets the 
requirements of the Act and that the resources were not or will not be 
harvested in violation of any conservation measure in force with respect 
to the United States or in violation of any regulation in this subpart. 
Blank import tickets will be attached to the permit. Additional blank 
import tickets are available from the Assistant Administrator.
    (d) Duration. An import permit is valid from its date of issuance to 
its date of expiration unless it is revoked or suspended.
    (e) Transfer. An import permit is not transferable or assignable.
    (f) Changes in information submitted by permit applicants or 
holders--(1) Changes in pending applications. Applicants for an import 
permit must report in writing to the Assistant Administrator any change 
in the information submitted in their import permit application. The 
processing period for the application will be extended as necessary to 
review the change.
    (2) Changes occurring after permit issuance. Any entity issued an 
import permit must report in writing to the Assistant Administrator any 
changes in previously submitted information. Any changes that would not 
result in a change in the importation authorized by the permit must be 
reported on the import ticket required to be submitted to the Assistant 
Administrator no later than 10 days after the date of importation. Any 
changes that would result in a change in the importation authorized by 
the permit, such as country of origin, type and quantity of the resource 
to be imported, and Convention statistical subarea from which the 
resource was harvested, must be proposed in writing to the Assistant 
Administrator and may not be undertaken unless authorized by the 
Assistant Administrator by a permit revision or new permit.
    (g) Revision, suspension, or revocation. An import permit may be 
revised, suspended, or revoked based upon information subsequently 
reported, effective upon notification to the permit holder. An import 
permit may be revised, suspended, or revoked, based upon a violation of 
the permit, the Act, or this subpart. Failure to report a change in the 
information contained in an import permit application is a violation of 
this subpart and voids the application or permit, as applicable. Title 
15 CFR part 904 governs permit sanctions under this subpart.
    (h) Disposition of resources not accompanied by required 
documentation. (1) When AMLRs are imported into the United States 
unaccompanied by a permit authorizing import, the importer must either:
    (i) Abandon the resources;
    (ii) Waive claim to the resources; or
    (iii) Place the resources into a bonded warehouse and attempt to 
obtain a permit authorizing their importation.
    (2) If, within 60 days of such resources being placed into a bonded 
warehouse, the District Director of the U.S. Customs Service receives 
documentation that import of the resources into the United States is 
authorized by a permit, the resources will be allowed entry. If 
documentation of a permit is not presented within 60 days, the 
importer's claim to the resources will be deemed waived.
    (3) When resources are abandoned or claim to them waived, the 
resources will be delivered to the Administrator of NOAA, or a designee, 
for storage or disposal as authorized by law.

harvesting vessel must provide authorized officers and CCAMLR inspectors 
access to all spaces where work is conducted or business papers and 
records are prepared or stored, including but not limited to personal 
quarters and areas within personal quarters. If inspection of a 
particular area would interfere with specific on-going scientific 
research, and if the operator of the harvesting vessel makes such 
assertion and produces an individual permit that covers that specific 
research, the authorized officer or CCAMLR inspector will not disturb 
the area, but will record the information pertaining to the denial of 
access.
    (2) The owner and operator of each harvesting vessel must provide to 
authorized officers and CCAMLR inspectors all records and documents 
pertaining to the harvesting activities of the vessel, including but not 
limited to production records, fishing logs, navigation logs, transfer 
records, product

[[Page 333]]

receipts, cargo stowage plans or records, draft or displacement 
calculations, customs documents or records, and an accurate hold plan 
reflecting the current structure of the vessel's storage and factory 
spaces.
    (3) Before leaving vessels that have been inspected, the CCAMLR 
inspector will give the master of the vessel a Certificate of Inspection 
and a written notification of any alleged violations of Commission 
measures in effect and will afford the master the opportunity to comment 
on it. The ship's master must sign the notification to acknowledge 
receipt and the opportunity to comment on it.
    (b) Reports by non-inspectors. All scientists, fishermen, and other 
non-inspectors present in the Convention area and subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States are encouraged to report any violation 
of Commission conservation and management measures observed in the 
Convention area to the Office of Ocean Affairs (CCAMLR Violations), 
Department of State, Room 5801, Washington, DC 20520.
    (c) Storage of AMLRs. The operator of each harvesting vessel storing 
AMLRs in a storage space on board the vessel must ensure that non-
resource items are neither stowed beneath nor covered by resource items, 
unless required to maintain the stability and safety of the vessel. Non-
resource items include, but are not limited to, portable conveyors, 
exhaust fans, ladders, nets, fuel bladders, extra bin boards, or other 
moveable non-resource items. These non-resource items may be in a 
resource storage space when necessary for the safety of the vessel or 
crew or for the storage of the items. Lumber, bin boards, or other 
dunnage may be used for shoring or bracing of product to ensure the 
safety of crew and to prevent shifting of cargo within the space.


<R05>
Sec. 300.117  Penalties.

    Any person or harvesting vessel found to be in violation of the Act, 
this subpart, or any permit issued under this subpart will be subject to 
the civil and criminal penalty provisions and forfeiture provisions 
prescribed in the Act, 15 CFR part 904, and other applicable laws.

to the vessel owner for each fishing vessel for which it has approved an 
application. That vessel will thereupon be authorized by the Russian 
Federation to fish in accordance with the Agreement and the terms and 
conditions set forth in the permit. The vessel owner is prohibited from 
transferring the permit to any other vessel or person. Any such 
transfer, or the sale or other transfer of the vessel, will immediately

authorities of the Russian Federation that it has accepted the 
conditions and restrictions as provided in paragraph (a) of this 
section. The permit will be rendered invalid by: The transfer or sale of 
the permit specified in paragraph (a) of this section; the failure to 
submit to NMFS any changes in permit application information as required 
by paragraph (a) of this section; failure to submit to NMFS any permit 
copy required by paragraph (b) of this section or any other information 
or report required by any other provision of this subpart; or the

    (ii) Including an invoice, packing list, bill of lading, or similar 
document to accompany the shipment that accurately states the name and 
address of the shipper and consignee, states the total number of 
packages or containers in the shipment, and for each species in the 
shipment specifies: The common name that identifies the species 
(examples include: chinook (or king) salmon; bluefin tuna; and whitetail 
deer); and the number of that species (or other appropriate measure of 
quantity such as gross or net weight). The invoice, packing list, bill 
of lading, or equivalent document must be securely attached to the

container, only the outermost container must be marked in accordance 
with this section, provided, that for live fish or wildlife that are 
packed in subcontainers within a larger packing container, if the 
subcontainers are numbered or labeled, the packing list, invoice, bill 
of lading, or other similar document, must reflect that number or label.

[[Page 347]]

    (4) A conveyance (truck, plane, boat, etc.) is not considered a 
container for purposes of requiring specific marking of the conveyance 
itself, provided that:
    (i) The fish or wildlife within the conveyance is carried loosely or 
is readily identifiable, and is accompanied by the document required by 
paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section; or
    (ii) The fish or wildlife is otherwise packaged and marked in 
accordance with this subpart.
    (b) The requirements of Sec. 300.160 of chapter III of this title do 
not apply to containers or packages containing--
    (1) Fox, nutria, rabbit, mink, chinchilla, marten, fisher, muskrat, 
and karakul that have been bred and born in captivity, or their 
products, if a signed statement certifying that the animals were bred 
and born in captivity accompanies the shipping documents;

                           Subpart A--General


<R05>
Sec. 402.01  Scope.

    (a) This part interprets and implements sections 7(a)-(d) [16 U.S.C. 
1536(a)-(d)] of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended 
(``Act''). Section 7(a) grants authority to and imposes requirements 
upon Federal agencies regarding endangered or threatened species of 
fish, wildlife, or plants (``listed species'') and habitat of such 
species that has been designated as critical (``critical habitat''). 
Section 7(a)(1) of the Act directs Federal agencies, in consultation 
with and with the assistance of the Secretary of the Interior or of 
Commerce, as appropriate, to utilize their authorities to further the 
purposes of the Act by carrying out conservation programs for listed 
species. Such affirmative conservation programs must comply with 
applicable permit requirements (50 CFR parts 17, 220, 222, and 227) for 
listed species and should be coordinated with the appropriate Secretary. 
Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires every Federal agency, in 
consultation with and with the assistance of the Secretary, to insure 
that any action it authorizes, funds, or carries out, in the United 
States or upon the high seas, is not likely to jeopardize the continued 
existence of any listed species or results in the destruction or adverse 
modification of critical habitat. Section 7(a)(3) of the Act authorizes 
a prospective permit or license applicant to request the issuing Federal 
agency to enter into early consultation with the Service on a proposed 
action to determine whether such action is likely to jeopardize the 
continued existence of listed species or result in the destruction or 
adverse modification of critical habitat. Section 7(a)(4) of the Act 
requires Federal agencies to confer with the Secretary on any action 
that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of proposed species 
or result in the destruction or adverse modification of proposed 
critical habitat. Section 7(b) of the Act requires the Secretary, after 
the conclusion of early or formal consultation, to issue a written 
statement setting forth the Secretary's opinion detailing how the agency 
action affects listed species

[[Page 354]]

or critical habitat Biological assessments are required under section 
7(c) of the Act if listed species or critical habitat may be present in 
the area affected by any major construction activity as defined in 
Sec. 404.02. Section 7(d) of the Act prohibits Federal agencies and 
applicants from making any irreversible or irretrievable commitment of 
resources which has the effect of foreclosing the formulation or 
implementation of reasonable and prudent alternatives which would avoid 
jeopardizing the continued existence of listed species or resulting in 
the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat. Section 
7(e)-(o)(1) of the Act provide procedures for granting exemptions from 
the requirements of section 7(a)(2). Regulations governing the 
submission of exemption applications are found at 50 CFR part 451, and 
regulations governing the exemption process are found at 50 CFR parts 
450, 452, and 453.
    (b) The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine 
Fisheries Service (NMFS) share responsibilities for administering the 
Act. The Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants are 
found in 50 CFR 17.11 and 17.12 and the designated critical habitats are 
found in 50 CFR 17.95 and 17.96 and 50 CFR part 226. Endangered or 
threatened species under the jurisdiction of the NMFS are located in 50 
CFR 222.23(a) and 227.4. If the subject species is cited in 50 CFR 
222.23(a) or 227.4, the Federal agency shall contact the NMFS. For all 
other listed species the Federal Agency shall contact the FWS.


<R05>
Sec. 402.02   Definitions.

    Act means the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 
1531 et seq.
    Action means all activities or programs of any kind authorized, 
funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the 
United States or upon the high seas. Examples include, but are not 
limited to:
    (a) actions intended to conserve listed species or their habitat;
    (b) the promulgation of regulations;
    (c) the granting of licenses, contracts, leases, easements, rights-
of-way, permits, or grants-in-aid; or
    (d) actions directly or indirectly causing modifications to the 
land, water, or air.
    Action area means all areas to be affected directly or indirectly by 
the Federal action and not merely the immediate area involved in the 
action.
    Applicant refers to any person, as defined in section 3(13) of the 
Act, who requires formal approval or authorization from a Federal agency 
as a prerequisite to conducting the action.
    Biological assessment refers to the information prepared by or under 
the direction of the Federal agency concerning listed and proposed 
species and designated and proposed critical habitat that may be present 
in the action area and the evaluation potential effects of the action on 
such species and habitat.
    Biological opinion is the document that states the opinion of the 
Service as to whether or not the Federal action is likely to jeopardize 
the continued existence of listed species or result in the destruction 
or adverse modification of critical habitat.
    Conference is a process which involves informal discussions between 
a Federal agency and the Service under section 7(a)(4) of the Act 
regarding the impact of an action on proposed species or proposed 
critical habitat and recommendations to minimize or avoid the adverse 
effects.
    Conservation recommendations are suggestions of the Service 
regarding discretionary measures to minimize or avoid adverse effects of 
a proposed action on listed species or critical habitat or regarding the 
development of information.
    Critical habitat refers to an area designated as critical habitat 
listed in 50 CFR parts 17 or 226.
    Cumulative effects are those effects of future State or private 
activities, not involving Federal activities, that are reasonably 
certain to occur within the action area of the Federal action subject to 
consultation.
    Designated non-Federal representative refers to a person designated 
by the Federal agency as its representative to conduct informal 
consultation and/or to prepare any biological assessment.
    Destruction or adverse modification means a direct or indirect 
alteration that appreciably diminishes the value

[[Page 355]]

of critical habitat for both the survival and recovery of a listed 
species. Such alterations include, but are not limited to, alterations 
adversely modifying any of those physical or biological features that 
were the basis for determining the habitat to be critical.
    Director refers to the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries for the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or his authorized 
representative; or the Fish and Wildlife Service regional director, or 
his authorized representative, for the region where the action would be 
carried out.
    Early consultation is a process requested by a Federal agency on 
behalf of a prospective applicant under section 7(a)(3) of the Act.
    Effects of the action refers to the direct and indirect effects of 
an action on the species or critical habitat, together with the effects 
of other activities that are interrelated or interdependent with that 
action, that will be added to the environmental baseline. The 
environmental baseline includes the past and present impacts of all 
Federal, State, or private actions and other human activities in the 
action area, the anticipated impacts of all proposed Federal projects in 
the action area that have already undergone formal or early section 7 
consultation, and the impact of State or private actions which are 
contemporaneous with the consultation in process. Indirect effects are 
those that are caused by the proposed action and are later in time, but 
still are reasonably certain to occur. Interrelated actions are those 
that are part of a larger action and depend on the larger action for 
their justification. Interdependent actions are those that have no 
independent utility apart from the action under consideration.
    Formal consultation is a process between the Service and the Federal 
agency that commences with the Federal agency's written request for 
consultation under section 7(a)(2) of the Act and concludes with the 
Service's issuance of the biological opinion under section 7(b)(3) of 
the Act.
    Incidental take refers to takings that result from, but are not the 
purpose of, carrying out an otherwise lawful activity conducted by the 
Federal agency or applicant.
    Informal consultation is an optional process that includes all 
discussions, correspondence, etc., between the Service and the Federal 
agency or the designated non-Federal representative prior to formal 
consultation, if required.
    Jeopardize the continued existence of means to engage in an action 
that reasonably would be expected, directly or indirectly, to reduce 
appreciably the likelihood of both the survival and recovery of a listed 
species in the wild by reducing the reproduction, numbers, or 
distribution of that species.
    Listed species means any species of fish, wildlife, or plant which 
has been determined to be endangered or threatened under section 4 of 
the Act. Listed species are found in 50 CFR 17.11-17.12.
    Major construction activity is a construction project (or other 
undertaking having similar physical impacts) which is a major Federal 
action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment as 
referred to in the National Environmental Policy Act [NEPA, 42 U.S.C. 
4332(2)(C)].
    Preliminary biological opinion refers to an opinion issued as a 
result of early consultation.
    Proposed critical habitat means habitat proposed in the Federal 
Register to be designated or revised as critical habitat under section 4 
of the Act for any listed or proposed species.
    Proposed species means any species of fish, wildlife, or plant that 
is proposed in the Federal Register to be listed under section 4 of the 
Act.
    Reasonable and prudent alternatives refer to alternative actions 
identified during formal consultation that can be implemented in a 
manner consistent with the intended purpose of the action, that can be 
implemented consistent with the scope of the Federal agency's legal 
authority and jurisdiction, that is economically and technologically 
feasible, and that the Director believes would avoid the likelihood of 
jeopardizing the continued existence of listed species or resulting in 
the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.
    Reasonable and prudent measures refer to those actions the Director 
believes necessary or appropriate to minimize

[[Page 356]]

the impacts, i.e., amount or extent, of incidental take.
    Recovery means improvement in the status of listed species to the 
point at which listing is no longer appropriate under the criteria set 
out in section 4(a)(1) of the Act.
    Service means the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the National 
Marine Fisheries Service, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 402.03  Applicability.

    Section 7 and the requirements of this part apply to all actions in 
which there is discretionary Federal involvement or control.


<R05>
Sec. 402.04  Counterpart regulations.

    The consultation procedures set forth in this part may be superseded 
for a particular Federal agency by joint counterpart regulations among 
that agency, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Marine 
Fisheries Service. Such counterpart regulations shall be published in 
the Federal Register in proposed form and shall be subject to public 
comment for at least 60 days before final rules are published.


<R05>
Sec. 402.05  Emergencies.

    (a) Where emergency circumstances mandate the need to consult in an 
expedited manner, consultation may be conducted informally through 
alternative procedures that the Director determines to be consistent 
with the requirements of sections 7(a)-(d) of the Act. This provision 
applies to situations involving acts of God, disasters, casualties, 
national defense or security emergencies, etc.
    (b) Formal consultation shall be initiated as soon as practicable 
after the emergency is under control. The Federal agency shall submit 
information on the nature of the emergency action(s), the justification 
for the expedited consultation, and the impacts to endangered or 
threatened species and their habitats. The Service will evaluate such 
information and issue a biological opinion including the information and 
recommendations given during the emergency consultation.


<R05>
Sec. 402.06  Coordination with other environmental reviews.

    (a) Consultation, conference, and biological assessment procedures 
under section 7 may be consolidated with interagency cooperation 
procedures required by other statutes, such as the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., implemented at 
40 CFR Parts 1500-1508) or the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (FWCA) 
(16 U.S.C. 661 et seq.). Satisfying the requirements of these other 
statutes, however, does not in itself relieve a Federal agency of its 
obligations to comply with the procedures set forth in this part or the 
substantive requirements of section 7. The Service will attempt to 
provide a coordinated review and analysis of all environmental 
requirements.
    (b) Where the consultation or conference has been consolidated with 
the interagency cooperation procedures required by other statutes such 
as NEPA or FWCA, the results should be included in the documents 
required by those statutes.


<R05>
Sec. 402.07  Designation of lead agency.

    When a particular action involves more than one Federal agency, the 
consultation and conference responsibilities may be fulfilled through a 
lead agency. Factors relevant in determining an appropriate lead agency 
include the time sequence in which the agencies would become involved, 
the magnitude of their respective involvement, and their relative 
expertise with respect to the environmental effects of the action. The 
Director shall be notified of the designation in writing by the lead 
agency.


<R05>
Sec. 402.08   Designation of non-Federal representative.

    A Federal agency may designate a non-Federal representative to 
conduct informal consultation or prepare a biological assessment by 
giving written notice to the Director of such designation. If a permit 
or license applicant is involved and is not the designated non-Federal 
representative, then the applicant and Federal agency must agree on the 
choice of the designated non-Federal representative. If a biological 
assessment is prepared by the designated

[[Page 357]]

non-Federal representative, the Federal agency shall furnish guidance 
and supervision and shall independently review and evaluate the scope 
and contents of the biological assessment. The ultimate responsibility 
for compliance with section 7 remains with the Federal agency.


<R05>
Sec. 402.09   Irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources.

    After initiation or reinitiation of consultation required under 
section 7(a)(2) of the Act, the Federal agency and any applicant shall 
make no irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources with 
respect to the agency action which has the effect of foreclosing the 
formulation or implementation of any reasonable and prudent alternatives 
which would avoid violating section 7(a)(2). This prohibition is in 
force during the consultation process and continues until the 
requirements of section 7(a)(2) are satisfied. This provision does not 
apply to the conference requirement for proposed species or proposed 
critical habitat under section 7(a)(4) of the Act.


<R04>
                   Subpart B--Consultation Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 402.10  Conference on proposed species or proposed critical habitat.

    (a) Each Federal agency shall confer with the Service on any action 
which is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any proposed 
species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of proposed 
critical habitat. The conference is designed to assist the Federal 
agency and any applicant in identifying and resolving potential 
conflicts at an early stage in the planning process.
    (b) The Federal agency shall initiate the conference with the 
Director. The Service may request a conference if, after a review of 
available information, it determines that a conference is required for a 
particular action.
    (c) A conference between a Federal agency and the Service shall 
consist of informal discussions concerning an action that is likely to 
jeopardize the continued existence of the proposed species or result in 
the destruction or adverse modification of the proposed critical habitat 
at issue. Applicants may be involved in these informal discussions to 
the greatest extent practicable. During the conference, the Service will 
make advisory recommendations, if any, on ways to minimize or avoid 
adverse effects. If the proposed species is subsequently listed or the 
proposed critical habitat is designated prior to completion of the 
action, the Federal agency must review the action to determine whether 
formal consultation is required.
    (d) If requested by the Federal agency and deemed appropriate by the 
Service, the conference may be conducted in accordance with the 
procedures for formal consultation in Sec. 402.14. An opinion issued at 
the conclusion of the conference may be adopted as the biological 
opinion when the species is listed or critical habitat is designated, 
but only if no significant new information is developed (including that 
developed during the rulemaking process on the proposed listing or 
critical habitat designation) and no significant changes to the Federal 
action are made that would alter the content of the opinion. An 
incidental take statement provided with a conference opinion does not 
become effective unless the Service adopts the opinion once the listing 
is final.
    (e) The conclusions reached during a conference and any 
recommendations shall be documented by the Service and provided to the 
Federal agency and to any applicant. The style and magnitude of this 
document will vary with the complexity of the conference. If formal 
consultation also is required for a particular action, then the Service 
will provide the results of the conference with the biological opinion.


<R05>
Sec. 402.11  Early consultation.

    (a) Purpose. Early consultation is designed to reduce the likelihood 
of conflicts between listed species or critical habitat and proposed 
actions and occurs prior to the filing of an application for a Federal 
permit or license. Although early consultation is conducted between the 
Service and the Federal agency, the prospective applicant should be 
involved throughout the consultation process.
    (b) Request by prospective applicant. If a prospective applicant has 
reason to

[[Page 358]]

believe that the prospective action may affect listed species or 
critical habitat, it may request the Federal agency to enter into early 
consultation with the Service. The prospective applicant must certify in 
writing to the Federal agency that (1) it has a definitive proposal 
outlining the action and its effects and (2) it intends to implement its 
proposal, if authorized.
    (c) Initiation of early consultation. If the Federal agency receives 
the prospective applicant's certification in paragraph (b) of this 
section, then the Federal agency shall initiate early consultation with 
the Service. This request shall be in writing and contain the 
information outlined in Sec. 402.14(c) and, if the action is a major 
construction activity, the biological assessment as outlined in 
Sec. 402.12.
    (d) Procedures and responsibilities. The procedures and 
responsibilities for early consultation are the same as outlined in 
Sec. 402.14(c)-(j) for formal consultation, except that all references 
to the ``applicant'' shall be treated as the ``prospective applicant'' 
and all references to the ``biological opinion'' or the ``opinion'' 
shall be treated as the ``preliminary biological opinion'' for the 
purpose of this section.
    (e) Preliminary biological opinion. The contents and conclusions of 
a preliminary biological opinion are the same as for a biological 
opinion issued after formal consultation except that the incidental take 
statement provided with a preliminary biological opinion does not 
constitute authority to take listed species.
    (f) Confirmation of preliminary biological opinion as final 
biological opinion. A preliminary biological opinion may be confirmed as 
a biological opinion issued after formal consultation if the Service 
reviews the proposed action and finds that there have been no 
significant changes in the action as planned or in the information used 
during the early consultation. A written request for confirmation of the 
preliminary biological opinion should be submitted after the prospective 
applicant applies to the Federal agency for a permit or license but 
prior to the issuance of such permit or license. Within 45 days of 
receipt of the Federal agency's request, the Service shall either:
    (1) Confirm that the preliminary biological opinion stands as a 
final biological opinion; or
    (2) If the findings noted above cannot be made, request that the 
Federal agency initiate formal consultation.


<R05>
Sec. 402.12   Biological assessments.

    (a) Purpose. A biological assessment shall evaluate the potential 
effects of the action on listed and proposed species and designated and 
proposed critical habitat and determine whether any such species or 
habitat are likely to be adversely affected by the action and is used in 
determining whether formal consultation or a conference is necessary.
    (b) Preparation requirement. (1) The procedures of this section are 
required for Federal actions that are ``major construction activities''; 
provided that a contract for construction was not entered into or actual 
construction was not begun on or before November 10, 1978. Any person, 
including those who may wish to apply for an exemption from section 
7(a)(2) of the Act, may prepare a biological assessment under the 
supervision of the Federal agency and in cooperation with the Service 
consistent with the procedures and requirements of this section. An 
exemption from the requirements of section 7(a)(2) is not permanent 
unless a biological assessment has been prepared.
    (2) The biological assessment shall be completed before any contract 
for construction is entered into and before construction is begun.
    (c) Request for information. The Federal agency or the designated 
non-Federal representative shall convey to the Director either (1) a 
written request for a list of any listed or proposed species or 
designated or proposed critical habitat that may be present in the 
action area; or (2) a written notification of the species and critical 
habitat that are being included in the biological assessment.
    (d) Director's response. Within 30 days of receipt of the 
notification of, or the request for, a species list, the Director shall 
either concur with or revise the list or, in those cases where no list 
has

[[Page 359]]

been provided, advise the Federal agency or the designated non-Federal 
representative in writing whether, based on the best scientific and 
commercial data available, any listed or proposed species or designated 
or proposed critical habitat may be present in the action area. In 
addition to listed and proposed species, the Director will provide a 
list of candidate species that may be present in the action area. 
Candidate species refers to any species being considered by the Service 
for listing as endangered or threatened species but not yet the subject 
of a proposed rule. Although candidate species have no legal status and 
are accorded no protection under the Act, their inclusion will alert the 
Federal agency of potential proposals or listings.
    (1) If the Director advises that no listed species or critical 
habitat may be present, the Federal agency need not prepare a biological 
assessment and further consultation is not required. If only proposed 
species or proposed critical habitat may be present in the action area, 
then the Federal agency must confer with the Service if required under 
Sec. 402.10, but preparation of a biological assessment is not required 
unless the proposed listing and/or designation becomes final.
    (2) If a listed species or critical habitat may be present in the 
action area, the Director will provide a species list or concur with the 
species list provided. The Director also will provide available 
information (or references thereto) regarding these species and critical 
habitat, and may recommend discretionary studies or surveys that may 
provide a better information base for the preparation of an assessment. 
Any recommendation for studies or surveys is not to be construed as the 
Service's opinion that the Federal agency has failed to satisfy the 
information standard of section 7(a)(2) of the Act.
    (e) Verification of current accuracy of species list. If the Federal 
agency or the designated non-Federal representative does not begin 
preparation of the biological assessment within 90 days of receipt of 
(or concurrence with) the species list, the Federal agency or the 
designated non-Federal representative must verify (formally or 
informally) with the Service the current accuracy of the species list at 
the time the preparation of the assessment is begun.
    (f) Contents. The contents of a biological assessment are at the 
discretion of the Federal agency and will depend on the nature of the 
Federal action. The following may be considered for inclusion:
    (1) The results of an on-site inspection of the area affected by the 
action to determine if listed or proposed species are present or occur 
seasonally.
    (2) The views of recognized experts on the species at issue.
    (3) A review of the literature and other information.
    (4) An analysis of the effects of the action on the species and 
habitat, including consideration of cumulative effects, and the results 
of any related studies.
    (5) An analysis of alternate actions considered by the Federal 
agency for the proposed action.
    (g) Incorporation by reference. If a proposed action requiring the 
preparation of a biological assessment is identical, or very similar, to 
a previous action for which a biological assessment was prepared, the 
Federal agency may fulfill the biological assessment requirement for the 
proposed action by incorporating by reference the earlier biological 
assessment, plus any supporting data from other documents that are 
pertinent to the consultation, into a written certification that:
    (1) The proposed action involves similar impacts to the same species 
in the same geographic area;
    (2) No new species have been listed or proposed or no new critical 
habitat designated or proposed for the action area; and
    (3) The biological assessment has been supplemented with any 
relevant changes in information.
    (h) Permit requirements. If conducting a biological assessment will 
involve the taking of a listed species, a permit under section 10 of the 
Act (16 U.S.C. 1539) and part 17 of this title (with respect to species 
under the jurisdiction of the FWS) or parts 220, 222, and 227 of this 
title (with respect to species under the jurisdiction of the NMFS) is 
required.

[[Page 360]]

    (i) Completion time. The Federal agency or the designated non- 
Federal representative shall complete the biological assessment within 
180 days after its initiation (receipt of or concurrence with the 
species list) unless a different period of time is agreed to by the 
Director and the Federal agency. If a permit or license applicant is 
involved, the 180-day period may not be extended unless the agency 
provides the applicant, before the close of the 180-day period, with a 
written statement setting forth the estimated length of the proposed 
extension and the reasons why such an extension is necessary.
    (j) Submission of biological assessment. The Federal agency shall 
submit the completed biological assessment to the Director for review. 
The Director will respond in writing within 30 days as to whether or not 
he concurs with the findings of the biological assessment. At the option 
of the Federal agency, formal consultation may be initiated under 
Sec. 402.14(c) concurrently with the submission of the assessment.
    (k) Use of the biological assessment. (1) The Federal agency shall 
use the biological assessment in determining whether formal consultation 
or a conference is required under Sec. 402.14 or Sec. 402.10, 
respectively. If the biological assessment indicates that there are no 
listed species or critical habitat present that are likely to be 
adversely affected by the action and the Director concurs as specified 
in paragraph (j) of this section, then formal consultation is not 
required. If the biological assessment indicates that the action is not 
likely to jeopardize the continued existence of proposed species or 
result in the destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical 
habitat, and the Director concurs, then a conference is not required.
    (2) The Director may use the results of the biological assessment in 
(i) determining whether to request the Federal agency to initiate formal 
consultation or a conference, (ii) formulating a biological opinion, or 
(iii) formulating a preliminary biological opinion.


<R05>
Sec. 402.13   Informal consultation.

    (a) Informal consultation is an optional process that includes all 
discussions, correspondence, etc., between the Service and the Federal 
agency or the designated non-Federal representative, designed to assist 
the Federal agency in determining whether formal consultation or a 
conference is required. If during informal consultation it is determined 
by the Federal agency, with the written concurrence of the Service, that 
the action is not likely to adversely affect listed species or critical 
habitat, the consultation process is terminated, and no further action 
is necessary.
    (b) During informal consultation, the Service may suggest 
modifications to the action that the Federal agency and any applicant 
could implement to avoid the likelihood of adverse effects to listed 
species or critical habitat.


<R05>
Sec. 402.14  Formal consultation.

    (a) Requirement for formal consultation. Each Federal agency shall 
review its actions at the earliest possible time to determine whether 
any action may affect listed species or critical habitat. If such a 
determination is made, formal consultation is required, except as noted 
in paragraph (b) of this section. The Director may request a Federal 
agency to enter into consultation if he identifies any action of that 
agency that may affect listed species or critical habitat and for which 
there has been no consultation. When such a request is made, the 
Director shall forward to the Federal agency a written explanation of 
the basis for the request.
    (b) Exceptions. (1) A Federal agency need not initiate formal 
consultation if, as a result of the preparation of a biological 
assessment under Sec. 402.12 or as a result of informal consultation 
with the Service under Sec. 402.13, the Federal agency determines, with 
the written concurrence of the Director, that the proposed action is not 
likely to adversely affect any listed species or critical habitat.
    (2) A Federal agency need not initiate formal consultation if a 
preliminary biological opinion, issued after early consultation under 
Sec. 402.11, is confirmed as the final biological opinion.

[[Page 361]]

    (c) Initiation of formal consultation. A written request to initiate 
formal consultation shall be submitted to the Director and shall 
include:
    (1) A description of the action to be considered;
    (2) A description of the specific area that may be affected by the 
action;
    (3) A description of any listed species or critical habitat that may 
be affected by the action;
    (4) A description of the manner in which the action may affect any 
listed species or critical habitat and an analysis of any cumulative 
effects;
    (5) Relevant reports, including any environmental impact statement, 
environmental assessment, or biological assessment prepared; and
    (6) Any other relevant available information on the action, the 
affected listed species, or critical habitat.

Formal consultation shall not be initiated by the Federal agency until 
any required biological assessment has been completed and submitted to 
the Director in accordance with Sec. 402.12. Any request for formal 
consultation may encompass, subject to the approval of the Director, a 
number of similar individual actions within a given geographical area or 
a segment of a comprehensive plan. This does not relieve the Federal 
agency of the requirements for considering the effects of the action as 
a whole.
    (d) Responsibility to provide best scientific and commercial data 
available. The Federal agency requesting formal consultation shall 
provide the Service with the best scientific and commercial data 
available or which can be obtained during the consultation for an 
adequate review of the effects that an action may have upon listed 
species or critical habitat. This information may include the results of 
studies or surveys conducted by the Federal agency or the designated 
non-Federal representative. The Federal agency shall provide any 
applicant with the opportunity to submit information for consideration 
during the consultation.
    (e) Duration and extension of formal consultation. Formal 
consultation concludes within 90 days after its initiation unless 
extended as provided below. If an applicant is not involved, the Service 
and the Federal agency may mutually agree to extend the consultation for 
a specific time period. If an applicant is involved, the Service and the 
Federal agency may mutually agree to extend the consultation provided 
that the Service submits to the applicant, before the close of the 90 
days, a written statement setting forth:
    (1) The reasons why a longer period is required,
    (2) The information that is required to complete the consultation, 
and
    (3) The estimated date on which the consultation will be completed.

A consultation involving an applicant cannot be extended for more than 
60 days without the consent of the applicant. Within 45 days after 
concluding formal consultation, the Service shall deliver a biological 
opinion to the Federal agency and any applicant.
    (f) Additional data. When the Service determines that additional 
data would provide a better information base from which to formulate a 
biological opinion, the Director may request an extension of formal 
consultation and request that the Federal agency obtain additional data 
to determine how or to what extent the action may affect listed species 
or critical habitat. If formal consultation is extended by mutual 
agreement according to Sec. 402.14(e), the Federal agency shall obtain, 
to the extent practicable, that data which can be developed within the 
scope of the extension. The responsibility for conducting and funding 
any studies belongs to the Federal agency and the applicant, not the 
Service. The Service's request for additional data is not to be 
construed as the Service's opinion that the Federal agency has failed to 
satisfy the information standard of section 7(a)(2) of the Act. If no 
extension of formal consultation is agreed to, the Director will issue a 
biological opinion using the best scientific and commercial data 
available.
    (g) Service responsibilities. Service responsibilities during formal 
consultation are as follows:
    (1) Review all relevant information provided by the Federal agency 
or otherwise available. Such review may include an on-site inspection of 
the action area with representatives of the Federal agency and the 
applicant.

[[Page 362]]

    (2) Evaluate the current status of the listed species or critical 
habitat.
    (3) Evaluate the effects of the action and cumulative effects on the 
listed species or critical habitat.
    (4) Formulate its biological opinion as to whether the action, taken 
together with cumulative effects, is likely to jeopardize the continued 
existence of listed species or result in the destruction or adverse 
modification of critical habitat.
    (5) Discuss with the Federal agency and any applicant the Service's 
review and evaluation conducted under paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of 
this section, the basis for any finding in the biological opinion, and 
the availability of reasonable and prudent alternatives (if a jeopardy 
opinion is to be issued) that the agency and the applicant can take to 
avoid violation of section 7(a)(2). The Service will utilize the 
expertise of the Federal agency and any applicant in identifying these 
alternatives. If requested, the Service shall make available to the 
Federal agency the draft biological opinion for the purpose of analyzing 
the reasonable and prudent alternatives. The 45-day period in which the 
biological opinion must be delivered will not be suspended unless the 
Federal agency secures the written consent of the applicant to an 
extension to a specific date. The applicant may request a copy of the 
draft opinion from the Federal agency. All comments on the draft 
biological opinion must be submitted to the Service through the Federal 
agency, although the applicant may send a copy of its comments directly 
to the Service. The Service will not issue its biological opinion prior 
to the 45-day or extended deadline while the draft is under review by 
the Federal agency. However, if the Federal agency submits comments to 
the Service regarding the draft biological opinion within 10 days of the 
deadline for issuing the opinion, the Service is entitled to an 
automatic 10-day extension on the deadline.
    (6) Formulate discretionary conservation recommendations, if any, 
which will assist the Federal agency in reducing or eliminating the 
impacts that its proposed action may have on listed species or critical 
habitat.
    (7) Formulate a statement concerning incidental take, if such take 
may occur.
    (8) In formulating its biological opinion, any reasonable and 
prudent alternatives, and any reasonable and prudent measures, the 
Service will use the best scientific and commercial data available and 
will give appropriate consideration to any beneficial actions taken by 
the Federal agency or applicant, including any actions taken prior to 
the initiation of consultation.
    (h) Biological opinions. The biological opinion shall include:
    (1) A summary of the information on which the opinion is based;
    (2) A detailed discussion of the effects of the action on listed 
species or critical habitat; and
    (3) The Service's opinion on whether the action is likely to 
jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or result in the 
destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat (a ``jeopardy 
biological opinion''); or, the action is not likely to jeopardize the 
continued existence of a listed species or result in the destruction or 
adverse modification of critical habitat (a ``no jeopardy'' biological 
opinion). A ``jeopardy'' biological opinion shall include reasonable and 
prudent alternatives, if any. If the Service is unable to develop such 
alternatives, it will indicate that to the best of its knowledge there 
are no reasonable and prudent alternatives.
    (i) Incidental take. (1) In those cases where the Service concludes 
that an action (or the implementation of any reasonable and prudent 
alternatives) and the resultant incidental take of listed species will 
not violate section 7(a)(2), and, in the case of marine mammals, where 
the taking is authorized pursuant to section 101(a)(5) of the Marine 
Mammal Protection Act of 1972, the Service will provide with the 
biological opinion a statement concerning incidental take that:
    (i) Specifies the impact, i.e., the amount or extent, of such 
incidental taking on the species;
    (ii) Specifies those reasonable and prudent measures that the 
Director considers necessary or appropriate to minimize such impact;

[[Page 363]]

    (iii) In the case of marine mammals, specifies those measures that 
are necessary to comply with section 101(a)(5) of the Marine Mammal 
Protection Act of 1972 and applicable regulations with regard to such 
taking;
    (iv) Sets forth the terms and conditions (including, but not limited 
to, reporting requirements) that must be complied with by the Federal 
agency or any applicant to implement the measures specified under 
paragraphs (i)(1)(ii) and (i)(1)(iii) of this section; and
    (v) Specifies the procedures to be used to handle or dispose of any 
individuals of a species actually taken.
    (2) Reasonable and prudent measures, along with the terms and 
conditions that implement them, cannot alter the basic design, location, 
scope, duration, or timing of the action and may involve only minor 
changes.
    (3) In order to monitor the impacts of incidental take, the Federal 
agency or any applicant must report the progress of the action and its 
impact on the species to the Service as specified in the incidental take 
statement. The reporting requirements will be established in accordance 
with 50 CFR 13.45 and 18.27 for FWS and 50 CFR 220.45 and 228.5 for 
NMFS.
    (4) If during the course of the action the amount or extent of 
incidental taking, as specified under paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this 
Section, is exceeded, the Federal agency must reinitiate consultation 
immediately.
    (5) Any taking which is subject to a statement as specified in 
paragraph (i)(1) of this section and which is in compliance with the 
terms and conditions of that statement is not a prohibited taking under 
the Act, and no other authorization or permit under the Act is required.
    (j) Conservation recommendations. The Service may provide with the 
biological opinion a statement containing discretionary conservation 
recommendations. Conservation recommendations are advisory and are not 
intended to carry any binding legal force.
    (k) Incremental steps. When the action is authorized by a statute 
that allows the agency to take incremental steps toward the completion 
of the action, the Service shall, if requested by the Federal agency, 
issue a biological opinion on the incremental step being considered, 
including its views on the entire action. Upon the issuance of such a 
biological opinion, the Federal agency may proceed with or authorize the 
incremental steps of the action if:
    (1) The biological opinion does not conclude that the incremental 
step would violate section 7(a)(2);
    (2) The Federal agency continues consultation with respect to the 
entire action and obtains biological opinions, as required, for each 
incremental step;
    (3) The Federal agency fulfills its continuing obligation to obtain 
sufficient data upon which to base the final biological opinion on the 
entire action;
    (4) The incremental step does not violate section 7(d) of the Act 
concerning irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources; and
    (5) There is a reasonable likelihood that the entire action will not 
violate section 7(a)(2) of the Act.
    (l) Termination of consultation. (1) Formal consultation is 
terminated with the issuance of the biological opinion.
    (2) If during any stage of consultation a Federal agency determines 
that its proposed action is not likely to occur, the consultation may be 
terminated by written notice to the Service.
    (3) If during any stage of consultation a Federal agency determines, 
with the concurrence of the Director, that its proposed action is not 
likely to adversely affect any listed species or critical habitat, the 
consultation is terminated.

Sec. 402.15  Responsibilities of Federal agency following issuance of a biological opinion.

    (a) Following the issuance of a biological opinion, the Federal 
agency shall determine whether and in what manner to proceed with the 
action in light of its section 7 obligations and the Service's 
biological opinion.
    (b) If a jeopardy biological opinion is issued, the Federal agency 
shall notify the Service of its final decision on the action.

[[Page 364]]

    (c) If the Federal agency determines that it cannot comply with the 
requirements of section 7(a)(2) after consultation with the Service, it 
may apply for an exemption. Procedures for exemption applications by 
Federal agencies and others are found in 50 CFR part 451.


<R05>
Sec. 402.16   Reinitiation of formal consultation.

    Reinitiation of formal consultation is required and shall be 
requested by the Federal agency or by the Service, where discretionary 
Federal involvement or control over the action has been retained or is 
authorized by law and:
    (a) If the amount or extent of taking specified in the incidental 
take statement is exceeded;
    (b) If new information reveals effects of the action that may affect 
listed species or critical habitat in a manner or to an extent not 
previously considered;
    (c) If the identified action is subsequently modified in a manner 
that causes an effect to the listed species or critical habitat that was 
not considered in the biological opinion; or
    (d) If a new species is listed or critical habitat designated that 
may be affected by the identified action.

<R05>
Sec. 403.01  Purpose and scope of regulations.

    The regulations contained in this part implement section 109 of the 
Act which, upon a finding by the Secretary of compliance with certain 
requirements, provides for the transfer of marine mammal management 
authority to the states.
    (a) The regulations of this part apply the procedures for the 
transfer of marine mammal management authority to a state, the form and 
minimum requirements of a state application for the transfer of 
management authority, the relationship between Federal and state 
wildlife agencies both prior and subsequent to the transfer of 
management authority, and the revocation and return of management 
authority to the Federal Government.
    (b) Nothing in this part shall prevent:
    (1) The taking of a marine mammal by or on behalf of a Federal, 
state or local government official, in accordance with Sec. 18.22 or 
Sec. 216.22 of this Title and section 109(h) of the Act, or (2) the 
adoption or enforcement of any state law or regulation relating to any 
marine mammal taken before December 21, 1972.
    (c) The information collection requirements contained in 
Secs. 403.03, 403.06, and 403.07 of this part do not require approval by 
the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., 
because there are fewer than 10 respondents annually.


<R05>
Sec. 403.02  Definitions.

    The following definitions apply to this part:
    (a) The term species includes any population stock.
    (b) Optimum Sustainable Population or OSP means a population size 
which falls within a range from the population level of a given species 
or stock which is the largest supportable within the ecosystem to the 
population level that results in maximum net productivity. Maximum net 
productivity is the greatest net annual increment in population numbers 
or biomass resulting from additions to the population due to 
reproduction and/or growth less losses due to natural mortality.
    (c) State management program means existing and proposed state 
statutes,

[[Page 365]]

regulations, policies and other authorities which form the framework for 
the conservation of a species of marine mammals.
    (d) State regulation means the whole or part of a state agency 
statement of general or particular applicability and future effect 
designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or 
describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of a 
state agency and which is duly promulgated in accordance with 
established procedure.
    (e) The Act means the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972, 
16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq., as amended by Pub. L. 97-58.
    (f) The Secretary means the Secretary of the Interior or the 
Secretary of Commerce, depending on the species involved. Under section 
3(11) of the Act, the Secretary of Commerce has jurisdiction over 
members of the order Cetacea and members, other than walruses, of the

    (d) In addition to the requirements contained in paragraphs (b) and 
(c) of this section, a request for the transfer of marine mammal 
management authority by the State of Alaska must contain the following 
concerning subsistence use of the species--
    (1) A statute and regulations concerning the take of marine mammals 
that ensure that
    (i) The taking of marine mammals species for subsistence uses will 
be the priority consumptive uses of the species;
    (ii) If restrictions on subsistence uses of the species are 
required, such restrictions shall be based upon the customary and direct 
dependence upon the species as the mainstay of livelihood, local 
residency, and the availability of alternative resources; and
    (iii) The taking of marine mammal species for subsistence uses is 
accomplished in a non-wasteful manner;
    (2) Statutes or regulations that ensure that the appropriate state 
agency will--
    (i) Authorize nonsubsistence consumptive uses of a marine mammal 
species only if such uses will have no significant adverse impact on 
subsistence uses of the species;
    (ii) Regulate nonsubsistence consumptive uses in a manner which, to 
the maximum extent practicable, provides economic opportunities, 
including, but not limited to, licensing of marine mammal hunting guides 
and the assignment of guiding areas, for residents of rural coastal 
villages of Alaska who engage in subsistence uses of the species; and
    (iii) Make written findings supporting the authorizations and 
regulations

[[Page 367]]

described in this paragraph based solely on the administrative record 
before the agency;
    (3) A narrative discussion of the statutes or regulations required

procedures concerning the regulation of nonsubsistence consumptive uses 
of marine mammals. This discussion must explain how the State's program 
satisfies the requirements of section 109(f) of the Act, namely that the 
regulation of nonsubsistence consumptive uses of marine mammals 
provides, to the maximum extent praticable, economic opportunities for 
the residents of rural coastal villages of Alaska who engage in 
subsistence uses of the species.
    (e) To assist states in preparing the state management program for 
submission, the Service will also, at the written request of any state, 
make a preliminary review of any aspects of the state management 
program. This review will be advisory in nature and shall not be binding 
upon the Services. Notwithstanding preliminary review by the Service, 
once any proposed aspect of the state management program has been 
prepared and submitted in final form, it shall be subject to final 
review and approval under paragraphs (f) through (h) of this section.
    (f)(1) After receiving the state's request, for management 
authority, the Service shall make an initial determination on whether 
the state's management program meets the requirements of the Act and 
these regulations.
    (2) Within 45 days after receiving the state's request, unless the 
state and the Service agree to another time period, the Service shall 
publish a general notice of its initial determination in the Federal 
Register together with, in the case of a positive determination, the 
text of a proposed rule to transfer management authority to the state. 
The general notice shall contain a summary of the major components of 
the state's management program and shall indicate where the full text of 
the management program may be inspected or copied. The public shall be 
allowed to submit written comments and to request an informal public 
hearing on the Service's initial determination and the state's 
management program within 60 days of publication of the general notice.
    (g) If requested, the Service may conduct an informal public hearing 
after publishing 30 days' advance notice of the date, location, and time 
of such hearing in the Federal Register.
    (h) After considering all comments and other relevant information, 
the Service shall publish in the Federal Register its final 
determination on whether the state has developed and will implement a 
management program that meets the requirement of the Act and these 
regulations. In the case of a positive final determination, the Service 
shall publish with the notice a final regulation transferring management 
authority for the species to the state after the following requirements 
are satisfied:
    (1) The state's determinations pursuant to Sec. 403.04 of this part 
are final and implemented under state law;
    (2) Any cooperative allocation agreement required under 
Sec. 403.05(a) of this part is implemented; and
    (3) The state has enacted and submitted to the Service laws and 
policies that are substantially the same as those provided pursuant to 
Sec. 403.03(a) in proposed form in the state's management program.


<R05>
Sec. 403.04  Determinations and hearings under section 109(c) of the MMPA.

    (a) Introduction. In order to gain approval of its marine mammal 
management program the state must provide for a process, consistent with 
section 109(c) of the Act, to determine the optimum sustainable 
population of the species and the maximum number of animals that may be 
taken from populations it manages without reducing the species below 
OSP. The state process must be completed before the state may exercise 
any management authority over the subject marine mammals, and it must 
include the elements set forth below.
    (b) Basis, purpose, and scope. The process set forth in this section 
is applicable to and required for only the determination of the OSP of 
the species and maximum number that may be taken without reducing it 
below its OSP and, in the case of Alaska if the species is below OSP, 
the maximum

[[Page 368]]

number of animals that may be taken, if any, for subsistence uses 
without preventing the species from increasing toward its OSP. The state 
need not allow the maximum take, as determined in accordance with this 
process, that is biologically permissible. The state may change 
regulations establishing bag limits, quotas, seasons, areas, manner of 
take, etc. within the maximum biologically permissible take pursuant to 
its other rulemaking criteria, authority, and procedures. Compliance 
with the process set forth in this section would not be required again 
unless the state proposes to modify its determinations of the status of 
the species with respect to its OSP or the maximum permissible take from 
that species.
    (c) Initial determination by the State. The state agency with 
responsibility for managing the species in the event management 
authority is transferred to the state shall make initial determinations 
on the basis of the best scientific evidence available of:
    (1) Whether or not it is at its OSP; (2) if so, the maximum number 
of that species that nay be taken without reducing it below its OSP; and 
(3) if not, in the case of Alaska, the maximum number of animals that 
may be taken, if any, for subsistence uses without preventing the 
species from increasing toward its OSP.
    (d) Notice and review of initial determinations and request for 
hearing. The state agency shall provide notice of its initial 
determinations to the Service and the public and shall provide access to 
or copies of the documentation supporting its determinations to the 
Service and the public. The state agency shall indicate, in the notice 
of its initial determinations, the location(s) and hours during which 
such documentation may be inspected, and the costs, if any of copies of 
such documentation. The state agency shall also indicate in the notice 
that any interested person may request a hearing regarding the initial 
determinations, and the state shall provide a reasonable time, not less 
than 30 days, for making the request, taking into account the time 
required to advise the public of the initial determinations and to make 
the supporting documentation readily available to interested persons for 
their consideration. If a request for a hearing is not made within the 
prescribed time period, the initial determinations shall be treated as 
final.
    (e) Notice of hearing. If a request for a hearing is made within the 
prescribed time period by any interested person, the state agency shall 
provide notice of the hearing to the Service and the public not less 
than 30 days in advance of the scheduled date(s) of the hearing(s). The 
notice shall include the date(s), location(s), and purpose of the 
hearing, a recitation of the initial determinations, the name(s) of the 
person(s) who will preside at the hearing, and the manner and date by 
which interested persons must notify the state agency or presiding 
officer(s) of their desire to participate in the hearing. The state 
shall also make available and distribute upon request a list of 
witnesses and description of the documentation and other evidence that 
will be relied upon by the state's witnesses in support of its initial 
determinations sufficiently in advance of the hearing date so as to 
allow interested persons to prepare questions and supporting or rebuttal 
testimony for the hearing.
    (f) Conduct of the hearing. (1) The hearing shall be publicly 
conducted and reported verbatim by an official reporter.
    (2) The state shall sponsor all written documentation in support of 
its determinations with witnesses who are able, by virtue of training 
and experience, to respond fully to cross-examination regarding the 
facts and conclusions contained therein provided that, except by 
agreement of the parties, the state agency may not call any witnesses or 
introduce any documentation into the record unless the advance notice 
requirements of paragraph (e) of this section are met with respect to 
such witnesses or documentation.
    (3) Any interested person who has notificed the state agency of his 
desire to participate in the hearing pursuant to paragraph (e) of this 
section may participate in the hearing by presenting oral or written 
testimony or cross-examining the witnesses or other parties with respect 
to matters relevant to

[[Page 369]]

the state's initial determinations, provided that any such written 
documentation must be sponsored by a witness who is able, by virtue of 
training and experience, to respond fully to cross-examination regarding 
the facts and conclusions contained therein.
    (4) The presiding officer(s) shall conduct the hearing in accordance 
with such other rules of evidence, criteria, and procedures as are 
necessary and appropriate for the expeditious and effective 
determination of the issues. The presiding officer(s) may provide for 
oral argument and/or written briefs at the end of the hearing.
    (5) Final determinations on the issues specified in paragraph (c) of 
this section must be supported by the best available scientific 
information so as to insure that any taking will be consistent with the 
maintenance of OSP.
    (g) Review of the hearing record and final determinations. (1) The 
state agency shall provide for either:
    (i) Review and evaluation of the hearing record by the presiding 
officer(s) and transmittal by the presiding officer(s) of recommended 
final determinations to the decision-maker(s) in the state agency; or
    (ii) Review and evaluation of the hearing record and final 
determinations by the state agency without benefit of any 
recommendations by the presiding officer(s). In any event, the final 
determinations by the state agency must be made solely on the basis of 
the record developed at the hearing. The state agency in making its 
final determinations, and/or presiding officer(s) in making his (their) 
recommended determinations, may not rely on oral or written evidence 
which was not presented at the hearing and made available to the parties 
for cross-examination and rebuttal testimony. Any such oral or written 
information transmitted to the presiding officer(s) or other members of 
the state agency responsible for the final determinations shall be 
treated as ex parte communications and may not be considered part of the 
record for decision.
    (2) The state agency shall make final determinations of the issues 
set forth in paragraph (c) of this section and shall include in its 
statement of final determinations a statement of findings and 
conclusions and the reasons or basis therefor.
    (3) The state agency shall advise the Service and the public of its 
final determinations and shall provide access to or copies of its 
decision document and Hearing Record.
    (h) Judicial review. The state agency's final determinations after a 
hearing must be supported by substantial evidence in the record of the 
hearing. Opportunity for judicial review of the state agency's final 
determinations must be available under state law. The scope of judicial 
review shall be equivalent to that provided for in 5 U.S.C. 706(2) (A) 
through (E).


<R05>
Sec. 403.05  State and Federal responsibilities after transfer of management authority.

    (a) After determinations required by section 403.04 of this part 
have been made in respect to a species whose range extends beyond the 
territorial waters of the state, the state shall not exercise management 
authority until a cooperative allocation agreement with the Secretary 
has been signed and the Service has transferred management authority 
pursuant to Sec. 403.03(h). The cooperative allocation agreement shall 
provide procedures for allocating, on a timely basis, the maximum amount 
of take as determined by the state pursuant to Sec. 403.04 of this part. 
Such allocation shall give first priority to incidental take within the 
zone described in section 3(14)(B) of the Act as provided for under 
section 101(a) of the Act, except that in the case of Alaska, first 
priority shall be given to subsistence use.
    (b) For those species to which paragraph (a) of this section 
applies, the state may request the Service to regulate the taking of the 
species within the zone described in section 3(14)(B) of the Act for 
subsistence uses and/or hunting in a manner consistent with the 
regulation by the state of such taking within the state. If such a 
request is made, the Service shall adopt and enforce within such zone, 
such of the state's regulatory provisions as the Service considers to be 
consistent with the administration within such zone of section 101(a) of 
the Act.

[[Page 370]]

    (c) If management authority for a species has been transferred to a 
state pursuant to this subpart, the Service shall provide to the state 
an opportunity to review all requests for permits to remove live animals 
from habitat within the state for scientific research or public display 
purposes. If the state finds that issuance of the permit would not be 
consistent with its management program for the species:
    (1) The state shall so inform the Service, together with the reasons 
for such finding, within 30 days of its receipt of the application, and 
the Service shall not issue the permit; and
    (2) The Service shall provide to the permit applicant and the state 
an opportunity to adjust the permit application or otherwise reconcile 
it with the state management program for the species.
    (d) After management of a species has been transferred to the state, 
state and Federal authorities shall cooperate to the maximum extent 
practicable in conserving the species of marine mammals.


<R05>
Sec. 403.06  Monitoring and review of state management program.

    (a) The Service has responsibility to monitor and review 
implementation of all state management programs approved pursuant to 
this part.
    (b) In order to facilitate such review, each state to which 
management authority has been transferred shall submit an annual report, 
not later than 120 days after the close of such state's first full 
fiscal or calendar year following the effective date of the Service's 
approval of the State management program, and at the same time each 
following year, or at such other time as may be agreed upon. The repot 
shall contain the following information current for each reporting 
period:
    (1) Any changes in the state laws which comprise those aspects of 
the state management program submitted pursuant to Sec. 403.03(b), and, 
in the case of Alaska, Sec. 403.03(d), of this part;
    (2) Pertinent new data on the marine mammal species or the marine 
ecosystems in question including a summary of the status, trend and 
general health of the species;
    (3) A summary of available information relating to takings under the 
state management program;
    (4) A summary of state actions to protect species' habitat;
    (5) A summary of all state research activity on the species;
    (6) Any significant changes in the information provided with the 
original request for transfer of management authority;
    (7) A summary of enforcement activity;
    (8) A summary of budget and staffing levels for the marine mammal 
activities in the categories of research, management and enforcement;
    (9) Any other information which the Service may request, consistent 
with the Act as amended, or which the state deems necessary or advisable 
to facilitate review by the Service of state management of the species.
    (c) Each state having an approved management program shall file a 
report, in a timely manner, not to exceed 45 days from the occurrence of 
any of the following:
    (1) Any change in a relevant state law (amendments, repealers, or 
new legislation or regulations or judicial precedent) as submitted 
pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(5), and in the case of Alaska, 
paragraph (d), of Sec. 403.03 of this part that may impair the State's 
ability to implement the program;
    (2) Any significant natural or manmade occurrence or any new 
scientific information that may warrant reconsideration of the 
determinations made pursuant to Sec. 403.04 of this part.
    (d) All components of the state request for transfer of management 
authority, as well as annual reports submitted under paragraph (b) of 
this section and any reports submitted under paragraph (c) of this 
section, shall be available for inspection and copying at the Office of 
the Chief, Division of Wildlife Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, Department of the Interior, Washington, DC 20240, or, as 
appropriate, at the Office of Protected Species and Habitat 
Conservation, National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 
20235, and at

[[Page 371]]

the appropriate Service's regional office.


<R05>
Sec. 403.07  Revocation and return of state management authority.

    (a) Revocation of management. The Service shall have responsibility 
to review management of a species transferred to a state under this part 
and to determine whether or not the implementation of the state 
management program continues to comply with the requirements of the Act, 
this part and the state's approved management program.
    (1) Upon receipt of any substantial factual information suggesting 
that the state management program is not being implemented or is being 
implemented in a manner inconsistent with the Act, this part, or the 
state's approved management program, the Service shall, as soon as 
practicable but not later than 30 days after receipt, determine whether 
or not the state continues to comply with the requirements of the Act, 
this part and the state's approved management program.
    (2) Whenever pursuant to a review as specified in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section, the Service determines that any substantial aspect of 
the state management program is not in compliance with the requirements 
of the Act, this part or the state's approved management program, it 
shall provide written notice to the state of its intent to revoke 
management authority, together with a statement, in detail, of those 
actions or failures to act upon which such intent to revoke is based. 
The Service shall publish notice of such intent to revoke in the Federal 
Register and invite public comment thereon, and shall conduct an 
informal public hearing on the matter if requested by the state or if 
the Service otherwise determines it to be necessary. The Service shall 
provide to the state an opportunity for consultation between the Service 
and the state concerning such actions or failures and necessary remedial 
actions to be taken by the state.
    (3) If within 90 days after notice is provided under paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, the state has not taken such remedial measures 
as are necessary, in the judgment of the Service, to bring the state 
management program into compliance with the provision of the Act, this 
part and the state's approved management program, the Service shall 
revoke the transfer of management authority by written notice to the 
state and publication in the Federal Register.
    (b) Voluntary return of management authority to the Service. (1) If 
a state desires to return management of a species of marine mammals to 
the Service, it shall provide the Service notice of intent to return 
management. The Service shall accept the return of management, and such 
return shall become effective, upon publication of a notice in the 
Federal Register to this effect no sooner than 30 days (except in an 
emergency as determined by the Service) nor longer than 60 days after 
the state has provided notice of its intent to return management or 
unless otherwise agreed upon.
    (2) If implementation of any aspect of the state management program 
is enjoined by court order, the state shall advise the Service of such 
injunction and its effect on the state management program. If the state 
determines that the effect of the injunction is to preclude effective 
conservation and management of the species under the terms of the state 
management program, it shall so notify the Service and such notification 
shall be treated as a notice of intent to return management as provided 
in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If the state determines that the 
injunction does not preclude effective conservation and management of 
marine mammals under the terms of the state management program, it shall 
so notify the Service together with the basis for the state's 
determination and such notice shall be treated as a report submitted 
pursuant to the terms of Sec. 403.06(c)(1) of this part. In either case, 
the state shall provide notice to the Service as soon as practicable but 
not more than 30 days after issuance of the injunction. Management 
authority returned to the Service pursuant to this paragraph may be re-
transferred to the state, notwithstanding the requirements of 
Sec. 403.03, when, in the judgment of the Service, the cause for return 
of management authority to the Service has been alleviated in such a way 
as to

[[Page 372]]

allow effective conservation and management of the species consistent 
with the requirements of the Act and this part.
    (c) When revocation of a management authority pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section becomes final, or when a state returns management 
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the Service shall resume such 
management authority and provide for the conservation of the species 
within the state in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

    (a) The definitions of terms in 50 CFR 402.02 shall apply to this 
part 424, except as otherwise stated.
    (b) Candidate means any species being considered by the Secretary 
for listing as an endangered or a threatened species, but not yet the 
subject of a proposed rule.
    (c) Conservation, conserve, and conserving mean to use and the use 
of all methods and procedures that are necessary to bring any endangered 
or threatened species to the point at which the measures provided 
pursuant to the Act are no longer necessary. Such methods and procedures 
include, but are not limited to, all activities associated with 
scientific resources management such as research, census, law 
enforcement, habitat acquisition and maintenance, propagation, live 
trapping, and transplantation, and, in the extraordinary case where 
population pressures within a given ecosystem cannot be otherwise 
relieved, may include regulated taking.
    (d) Critical habitat means (1) the specific areas within the 
geographical area currently occupied by a species, at the time it is 
listed in accordance with the Act, on which are found those physical or 
biological features (i) essential to the conservation of the species and 
(ii) that may require special management considerations or protection, 
and

[[Page 373]]

(2) specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by a species 
at the time it is listed upon a determination by the Secretary that such 
areas are essential for the conservation of the species.
    (e) Endangered species means a species that is in danger of 
extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.
    (f) List or lists means the Lists of Endangered and Threatened 
Wildlife and Plants found at 50 CFR 17.11(h) or 17.12(h).
    (g) Plant means any member of the plant kingdom, including, without 
limitation, seeds, roots, and other parts thereof.
    (h) Public hearing means an informal hearing to provide the public 
with the opportunity to give comments and to permit an exchange of

    (i) Secretary means the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary 
of Commerce, as appropriate, or their authorized representatives.
    (j) Special management considerations or protection means any 
methods or procedures useful in protecting physical and biological 
features of the environment for the conservation of listed species.
    (k) Species includes any species or subspecies of fish, wildlife, or 
plant, and any distinct population segment of any vertebrate species 
that interbreeds when mature. Excluded is any species of the Class 
Insecta determined by the Secretary to constitute a pest whose 
protection under the provisions of the Act would present an overwhelming 
and overriding risk to man.
    (l) State agency means any State agency, department, board, 
commission, or other governmental entity that is responsible for the 
management and conservation of fish, plant, or wildlife resources within 
a State.
    (m) Threatened species means any species that is likely to become an 
endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a 
significant portion of its range.
    (n) Wildlife or fish and wildlife means any member of the animal 
kingdom, including without limitation, any vertebrate, mollusk, 
crustacean, arthropod, or other invertebrate, and includes any part, 
product, egg, or offspring thereof, or the dead body or parts thereof.

                    Subpart B--Revision of the Lists


<R05>
Sec. 424.10  General.

    The Secretary may add a species to the lists or designate critical 
habitat, delete a species or critical habitat, change the listed status 
of a species, revise the boundary of an area designated as critical 
habitat, or adopt or modify special rules (see 50 CFR 17.40-17.48 and 
parts 222 and 227) applied to a threatened species only in accordance 
with the procedures of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 424.11  Factors for listing, delisting, or reclassifying species.

    (a) Any species or taxonomic group of species (e.g., genus, 
subgenus) as defined in Sec. 424.02(k) is eligible for listing under the 
Act. A taxon of higher rank than species may be listed only if all 
included species are individually found to be endangered or threatened. 
In determining whether a particular taxon or population is a species for 
the purposes of the Act, the Secretary shall rely on standard taxonomic 
distinctions and the biological expertise of the Department and the 
scientific community concerning the relevant taxonomic group.
    (b) The Secretary shall make any determination required by 
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section solely on the basis of the best 
available scientific and commercial information regarding a species' 
status, without reference to possible economic or other impacts of such 
determination.
    (c) A species shall be listed or reclassified if the Secretary 
determines, on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data 
available after conducting a review of the species' status, that the 
species is endangered or threatened because of any one or a combination 
of the following factors:
    (1) The present or threatened destruction, modification, or 
curtailment of its habitat or range;
    (2) Over utilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or 
educational purposes;
    (3) Disease or predation;

[[Page 374]]

    (4) The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or
    (5) Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued 
existence.
    (d) The factors considered in delisting a species are those in 
paragraph (c) of this section as they relate to the definitions of 
endangered or threatened species. Such removal must be supported by the 
best scientific and commercial data available to the Secretary after 
conducting a review of the status of the species. A species may be 
delisted only if such data substantiate that it is neither endangered 
nor threatened for one or more of the following reasons:
    (1) Extinction. Unless all individuals of the listed species had 
been previously identified and located, and were later found to be 
extirpated from their previous range, a sufficient period of time must 
be allowed before delisting to indicate clearly that the species is 
extinct.
    (2) Recovery. The principal goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service is to return listed 
species to a point at which protection under the Act is no longer 
required. A species may be delisted on the basis of recovery only if the 
best scientific and commercial data available indicate that it is no 
longer endangered or threatened.
    (3) Original data for classification in error. Subsequent 
investigations may show that the best scientific or commercial data 
available when the species was listed, or the interpretation of such 
data, were in error.
    (e) The fact that a species of fish, wildlife, or plant is protected 
by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild 
Fauna and Flora (see part 23 of this title 50) or a similar 
international agreement on such species, or has been identified as 
requiring protection from unrestricted commerce by any foreign nation, 
or to be in danger of extinction or likely to become so within the 
foreseeable future by any State agency or by any agency of a foreign 
nation that is responsible for the conservation of fish, wildlife, or 
plants, may constitute evidence that the species is endangered or 
threatened. The weight given such evidence will vary depending on the 
international agreement in question, the criteria pursuant to which the 
species is eligible for protection under such authorities, and the 
degree of protection afforded the species. The Secretary shall give 
consideration to any species protected under such an international 
agreement, or by any State or foreign nation, to determine whether the 
species is endangered or threatened.
    (f) The Secretary shall take into account, in making determinations 
under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, those efforts, if any, being 
made by any State or foreign nation, or any political subdivision of a 
State or foreign nation, to protect such species, whether by predator 
control, protection of habitat and food supply, or other conservation 
practices, within any area under its jurisdiction, or on the high seas.


<R05>
Sec. 424.12  Criteria for designating critical habitat.

    (a) Critical habitat shall be specified to the maximum extent 
prudent and determinable at the time a species is proposed for listing. 
If designation of critical habitat is not prudent or if critical habitat 
is not determinable, the reasons for not designating critical habitat 
will be stated in the publication of proposed and final rules listing a 
species. A final designation of critical habitat shall be made on the 
basis of the best scientific data available, after taking into 
consideration the probable economic and other impacts of making such a 
designation in accordance with Sec. 424.19.
    (1) A designation of critical habitat is not prudent when one or 
both of the following situations exist:
    (i) The species is threatened by taking or other human activity, and 
identification of critical habitat can be expected to increase the 
degree of such threat to the species, or
    (ii) Such designation of critical habitat would not be beneficial to 
the species.
    (2) Critical habitat is not determinable when one or both of the 
following situations exist:
    (i) Information sufficient to perform required analyses of the 
impacts of the designation is lacking, or
    (ii) The biological needs of the species are not sufficiently well 
known to

[[Page 375]]

permit identification of an area as critical habitat.
    (b) In determining what areas are critical habitat, the Secretary 
shall consider those physical and biological features that are essential 
to the conservation of a given species and that may require special 
management considerations or protection. Such requirements include, but 
are not limited to the following:
    (1) Space for individual and population growth, and for normal 
behavior;
    (2) Food, water, air, light, minerals, or other nutritional or 
physiological requirements;
    (3) Cover or shelter;
    (4) Sites for breeding, reproduction, rearing of offspring, 
germination, or seed dispersal; and generally;
    (5) Habitats that are protected from disturbance or are 
representative of the historic geographical and ecological distributions 
of a species.

When considering the designation of critical habitat, the Secretary 
shall focus on the principal biological or physical constituent elements 
within the defined area that are essential to the conservation of the 
species. Known primary constituent elements shall be listed with the 
critical habitat description. Primary constituent elements may include, 
but are not limited to, the following: roost sites, nesting grounds, 
spawning sites, feeding sites, seasonal wetland or dryland, water 
quality or quantity, host species or plant pollinator, geological 
formation, vegetation type, tide, and specific soil types.
    (c) Each critical habitat will be defined by specific limits using 
reference points and lines as found on standard topographic maps of the 
area. Each area will be referenced to the State(s), county(ies), or 
other local governmental units within which all or part of the critical 
habitat is located. Unless otherwise indicated within the critical 
habitat descriptions, the names of the State(s) and county(ies) are 
provided for information only and do not constitute the boundaries of 
the area. Ephemeral reference points (e.g., trees, sand bars) shall not 
be used in defining critical habitat.
    (d) When several habitats, each satisfying the requirements for 
designation as critical habitat, are located in proximity to one 
another, an inclusive area may be designated as critical habitat.

    Example: Several dozen or more small ponds, lakes, and springs are 
found in a small local area. The entire area could be designated 
critical habitat if it were concluded that the upland areas were 
essential to the conservation of an aquatic species located in the ponds 
and lakes.

    (e) The Secretary shall designate as critical habitat areas outside 
the geographical area presently occupied by a species only when a 
designation limited to its present range would be inadequate to ensure 
the conservation of the species.
    (f) Critical habitat may be designated for those species listed as 
threatened or endangered but for which no critical habitat has been 
previously designated.
    (g) Existing critical habitat may be revised according to procedures 
in this section as new data become available to the Secretary.
    (h) Critical habitat shall not be designated within foreign 
countries or in other areas outside of United States jurisdiction.


<R05>
Sec. 424.13  Sources of information and relevant data.

    When considering any revision of the lists, the Secretary shall 
consult as appropriate with affected States, interested persons and 
organizations, other affected Federal agencies, and, in cooperation with 
the Secretary of State, with the country or countries in which the 
species concerned are normally found or whose citizens harvest such 
species from the high seas. Data reviewed by the Secretary may include, 
but are not limited to scientific or commercial publications, 
administrative reports, maps or other graphic materials, information 
received from experts on the subject, and comments from interested 
parties.


<R05>
Sec. 424.14  Petitions.

    (a) General. Any interested person may submit a written petition to 
the Secretary requesting that one of the actions described in 
Sec. 424.10 be taken. Such a document must clearly identify itself as a 
petition and be dated. It

[[Page 376]]

must contain the name, signature, address, telephone number, if any, and 
the association, institution, or business affiliation, if any, of the 
petitioner. The Secretary shall acknowledge in writing receipt of such a 
petition within 30 days.
    (b) Petitions to list, delist, or reclassify species. (1) To the 
maximum extent practicable, within 90 days of receiving a petition to 
list, delist, or reclassify a species, the Secretary shall make a 
finding as to whether the petition presents substantial scientific or 
commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be 
warranted. For the purposes of this section, ``substantial information'' 
is that amount of information that would lead a reasonable person to 
believe that the measure proposed in the petition may be warranted. The 
Secretary shall promptly publish such finding in the Federal Register 
and so notify the petitioner.
    (2) In making a finding under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the 
Secretary shall consider whether such petition--
    (i) Clearly indicates the administrative measure recommended and 
gives the scientific and any common name of the species involved;
    (ii) Contains detailed narrative justification for the recommended 
measure, describing, based on available information, past and present 
numbers and distribution of the species involved and any threats faced 
by the species;
    (iii) Provides information regarding the status of the species over 
all or a significant portion of its range; and
    (iv) Is accompanied by appropriate supporting documentation in the 
form of bibliographic references, reprints of pertinent publications, 
copies of reports or letters from authorities, and maps.

The petitioner may provide information that describes any recommended 
critical habitat as to boundaries and physical features, and indicates 
any benefits and/or adverse effects on the species that would result 
from such designation. Such information, however, will not be a basis 
for the determination of the substantiality of a petition.
    (3) Upon making a positive finding under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, the Secretary shall commence a review of the status of the 
species concerned and shall make, within 12 months of receipt of such 
petition, one of the following findings:
    (i) The petitioned action is not warranted, in which case the 
Secretary shall promptly publish such finding in the Federal Register 
and so notify the petitioner.
    (ii) The petitioned action is warranted, in which case the Secretary 
shall promptly publish in the Federal Register a proposed regulation to 
implement the action pursuant to Sec. 424.16 of this part, or
    (iii) The petitioned action is warranted, but that--
    (A) The immediate proposal and timely promulgation of a regulation 
to implement the petitioned action is precluded because of other pending 
proposals to list, delist, or reclassify species, and
    (B) Expeditious progress is being made to list, delist, or 
reclassify qualified species,

in which case, such finding shall be promptly published in the Federal 
Register together with a description and evaluation of the reasons and 
data on which the finding is based.
    (4) If a finding is made under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section 
with regard to any petition, the Secretary shall, within 12 months of 
such finding, again make one of the findings described in paragraph 
(b)(3) with regard to such petition, but no further finding of 
substantial information will be required.
    (c) Petitions to revise critical habitat. (1) To the maximum extent 
practicable, within 90 days of receiving a petition to revise a critical 
habitat designation, the Secretary shall make a finding as to whether 
the petition presents substantial scienific information indicating that 
the revision may be warranted. The Secretary shall promptly publish such 
finding in the Federal Register and so notify the petitioner.
    (2) In making the finding required by paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, the Secretary shall consider whether a petition contains--

[[Page 377]]

    (i) Information indicating that areas petitioned to be added to 
critical habitat contain physical and biological features essential to, 
and that may require special management to provide for, the conservation 
of the species involved; or
    (ii) Information indicating that areas designated as critical 
habitat do not contain resources essential to, or do not require special 
management to provide for, the conservation of the species involved.
    (3) Within 12 months after receiving a petition found under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section to present substantial information 
indicating that revision of a critical habitat may be warranted, the 
Secretary shall determine how he intends to proceed with the requested 
revision, and shall promptly publish notice of such intention in the 
Federal Register.
    (d) Petitions to designate critical habitat or adopt special rules. 
Upon receiving a petition to designate critical habitat or to adopt a 
special rule to provide for the conservation of a species, the Secretary 
shall promptly conduct a review in accordance with the Administrative 
Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) and applicable Departmental regulations, 
and take appropriate action.


<R05>
Sec. 424.15  Notices of review.

    (a) If the Secretary finds that one of the actions described in 
Sec. 424.10 may be warranted, but that the available evidence is not 
sufficiently definitive to justify proposing the action at that time, a 
notice of review may be published in the Federal Register. The notice 
will describe the measure under consideration, briefly explain the 
reasons for considering the action, and solicit comments and additional 
information on the action under consideration.
    (b) The Secretary from time to time also may publish notices of 
review containing the names of species that are considered to be 
candidates for listing under the Act and indicating whether sufficient 
scientific or commercial information is then available to warrant 
proposing to list such species, the names of species no longer being 
considered for listing, or the names of listed species being considered 
for delisting or reclassification. However, none of the substantive or 
procedural provisions of the Act apply to a species that is designated 
as a candidate for listing.
    (c) Such notices of review will invite comment from all interested 
parties regarding the status of the species named. At the time of 
publication of such a notice, notification in writing will be sent to 
State agencies in any affected States, known affected Federal agencies, 
and, to the greatest extent practicable, through the Secretary of State, 
to the governments of any foreign countries in which the subject species 
normally occur.


<R05>
Sec. 424.16  Proposed rules.

    (a) General. Based on the information received through Secs. 424.13, 
424.14, 424.15, and 424.21, or through other available avenues, the 
Secretary may propose revising the lists as described in Sec. 424.10.
    (b) Contents. A notice of a proposed rule to carry out one of the 
actions described in Sec. 424.10 shall contain the complete text of the 
proposed rule, a summary of the data on which the proposal is based 
(including, as appropriate, citation of pertinent information sources), 
and shall show the relationship of such data to the rule proposed. If 
such a rule designates or revises critical habitat, such summary shall, 
to the maximum extent practicable, include a brief description and 
evaluation of those activities (whether public or private) that, in the 
opinion of the Secretary, if undertaken, may adversely modify such 
habitat, or may be affected by such designation. Any proposed rule to 
designate or revise critical habitat shall contain a map of such 
habitat. Any such notice proposing the listing, delisting, or 
reclassification of a species or the designation or revision of critical 
habitat shall also include a summary of factors affecting the species 
and/or critical habitat.
    (c) Procedures--(1) Notifications. In the case of any proposed rule 
to list, delist, or reclassify a species, or to designate or revise 
critical habitat, the Secretary shall--
    (i) Publish notice of the proposal in the Federal Register;
    (ii) Give actual notice of the proposed regulation (including the 
complete text of the regulation) to the

[[Page 378]]

State agency in each State in which the species is believed to occur, 
and to each county or equivalent jurisdiction therein in which the 
species is believed to occur, and invite the comment of each such agency 
and jurisdiction;
    (iii) Give notice of the proposed regulation to any Federal 
agencies, local authorities, or private individuals or organizations 
known to be affected by the rule;
    (iv) Insofar as practical, and in cooperation with the Secretary of 
State, give notice of the proposed regulation to list, delist, or 
reclassify a species to each foreign nation in which the species is 
believed to occur or whose citizens harvest the species on the high 
seas, and invite the comment of such nation;
    (v) Give notice of the proposed regulation to such professional 
scientific organizations as the Secretary deems appropriate; and
    (vi) Publish a summary of the proposed regulation in a newspaper of 
general circulation in each area of the United States in which the 
species is believed to occur.
    (2) Period of public comments. At least 60 days shall be allowed for 
public comment following publication in the Federal Register of a rule 
proposing the listing, delisting, or reclassification of a species, or 
the designation or revision of critical habitat. All other proposed 
rules shall be subject to a comment period of at least 30 days following 
publication in the Federal Register. The Secretary may extend or reopen 
the period for public comment on a proposed rule upon a finding that 
there is good cause to do so. A notice of any such extension or 
reopening shall be published in the Federal Register, and shall specify 
the basis for so doing.
    (3) Public hearings. The Secretary shall promptly hold at least one 
public hearing if any person so requests within 45 days of publication 
of a proposed regulation to list, delist, or reclassify a species, or to 
designate or revise critical habitat. Notice of the location and time of 
any such hearing shall be published in the Federal Register not less 
than 15 days before the hearing is held.


<R05>
Sec. 424.17  Time limits and required actions.

    (a) General. (1) Within 1 year of the publication of a rule 
proposing to determine whether a species is an endangered or threatened 
species, or to designate or revise critical habitat, the Secretary shall 
publish one of the following in the Federal Register:
    (i) A final rule to implement such determination or revision,
    (ii) A finding that such revision should not be made,
    (iii) A notice withdrawing the proposed rule upon a finding that 
available evidence does not justify the action proposed by the rule, or
    (iv) A notice extending such 1-year period by an additional period 
of not more than 6 months because there is substantial disagreement 
among scientists knowledgeable about the species concerned regarding the 
sufficiency or accuracy of the available data relevant to the 
determination or revision concerned.
    (2) If an extension is made under paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this 
section, the Secretary shall, within the extended period, take one of 
the actions described in paragraphs (a)(1) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this 
section.
    (3) If a proposed rule is withdrawn under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of 
this section, the notice of withdrawal shall set forth the basis upon 
which the proposed rule has been found not to be supported by available 
evidence. The Secretary shall not again propose a rule withdrawn under 
such provision except on the basis of sufficient new information that 
warrants a reproposal.
    (b) Critical habitat designations. A final rule designating critical 
habitat of an endangered or a threatened species shall to the extent 
permissible under Sec. 424.12 be published concurrently with the final 
rule listing such species, unless the Secretary deems that--
    (1) It is essential to the conservation of such species that it be 
listed promptly; or
    (2) Critical habitat of such species is not then determinable,

in which case, the Secretary, with respect to the proposed regulation to 
designate such habitat, may extend the 1-year period specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section by not more than one

[[Page 379]]

additional year. Not later than the close of such additional year the 
Secretary must publish a final regulation, based on such data as may be 
available at that time, designating, to the maximum extent prudent, such 
habitat.


<R05>
Sec. 424.18  Final rules--general.

    (a) Contents. A final rule promulgated to carry out the purposes of 
the Act will be published in the Federal Register. This publication will 
contain the complete text of the rule, a summary of the comments and 
recommendations received in response to the proposal (including 
applicable public hearings), summaries of the data on which the rule is 
based and the relationship of such data to the final rule, and a 
description of any conservation measures available under the rule. 
Publication of a final rule to list, delist, or reclassify a species or 
designate or revise critical habitat shall also provide a summary of 
factors affecting the species. A rule designating or revising critical 
habitat will also contain a description of the boundaries and a map of 
such habitat and will, to the maximum extent practicable, be accompanied 
by a brief description and evaluation of those activities (whether 
public or private) that might occur in the area and which, in the 
opinion of the Secretary, may adversly modify such habitat or be 
affected by such designation.
    (b) Effective date. A final rule shall take effect--
    (1) Not less than 30 days after it is published in the Federal 
Register, except as otherwise provided for good cause found and 
published with the rule; and
    (2) Not less than 90 days after (i) publication in the Federal 
Register of the proposed rule, and (ii) actual notification of any 
affected State agencies and counties or equivalent jurisdictions in 
accordance with Sec. 424.16(c)(1)(ii).
    (c) Disagreement with State agency. If a State agency, given notice 
of a proposed rule in accordance with Sec. 424.16(c)(1)(ii), submits 
comments disagreeing in whole or in part with a proposed rule, and the 
Secretary issues a final rule that is in conflict with such comments, or 
if the Secretary fails to adopt a regulation for which a State agency 
has made a petition in accordance with Sec. 424.14, the Secretary shall 
provide such agency with a written justification for the failure to 
adopt a rule consistent with the agency's comments or petition.


<R05>
Sec. 424.19  Final rules--impact analysis of critical habitat.

    The Secretary shall identify any significant activities that would 
either affect an area considered for designation as critical habitat or 
be likely to be affected by the designation, and shall, after proposing 
designation of such an area, consider the probable economic and other 
impacts of the designation upon proposed or ongoing activities. The 
Secretary may exclude any portion of such an area from the critical 
habitat if the benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefits of 
specifying the area as part of the critical habitat. The Secretary shall 
not exclude any such area if, based on the best scientific and 
commercial data available, he determines that the failure to designate 
that area as critical habitat will result in the extinction of the 
species concerned.


<R05>
Sec. 424.20  Emergency rules.

    (a) Sections 424.16, 424.17, 424.18, and 424.19 notwithstanding, the 
Secretary may at any time issue a regulation implementing any action 
described in Sec. 424.10 in regard to any emergency posing a significant 
risk to the well-being of a species of fish, wildlife, or plant. Such 
rules shall, at the discretion of the Secretary, take effect immediately 
on publication in the Federal Register. In the case of any such action 
that applies to a resident species, the Secretary shall give actual 
notice of such regulation to the State agency in each State in which 
such species is believed to occur. Publication in the Federal Register 
of such an emergency rule shall provide detailed reasons why the rule is 
necessary. An emergency rule shall cease to have force and effect after 
240 days unless the procedures described in Secs. 424.16, 424.17, 
424.18, and 424.19 (as appropriate) have been complied with during that 
period.

[[Page 380]]

    (b) If at any time after issuing an emergency rule, the Secretary 
determines, on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data 
available, that substantial evidence does not then exist to warrant such 
rule, it shall be withdrawn.


<R05>
Sec. 424.21  Periodic review.

    At least once every 5 years, the Secretary shall conduct a review of 
each listed species to determine whether it should be delisted or 
reclassified. Each such determination shall be made in accordance with 
Secs. 424.11, 424.16, and 424.17 of this part, as appropriate. A notice 
announcing those species under active review will be published in the 
Federal Register. Notwithstanding this section's provisions, the 
Secretary may review the status of any species at any time based upon a 
petition (see Sec. 424.14) or upon other data available to the Service.

measures. The Committee shall publish its decision and order in the 
Federal Register as soon as practicable.
    (c) Permanent exemptions. Under section 7(h)(2) of the Act, an 
exemption granted by the Committee shall constitute a permanent 
exemption with respect to all endangered or threatened species for the 
purposes of completing such agency action--
    (1) Regardless of whether the species was identified in the 
biological assessment, and
    (2) Only if a biological assessment has been conducted under section 
7(c) of the Act with respect to such agency action. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, an exemption shall not be permanent if--
    (i) The Secretary finds, based on the best scientific and commercial 
data available, that such exemption would result in the extinction of a 
species that was not the subject of consultation under section 7(a)(2) 
of the Act or was not identified in any biological assessment conducted 
under section 7(c) of the Act, and
    (ii) The Committee determines within 60 days after the date of the 
Secretary's finding that the exemption should not be permanent.

If the Secretary makes a finding that the exemption would result in the 
extinction of a species, as specified above, the Committee shall meet 
with respect to the matter within 30 days after the date of the finding. 
During the 60 day period following the Secretary's determination, the 
holder of the exemption shall refrain from any action which would result 
in extinction of the species.
    (d) Finding by the Secretary of Defense. If the Secretary of Defense 
finds in writing that an exemption for the agency action is necessary 
for reasons of national security, the Committee shall grant the 
exemption notwithstanding any other provision in this part.

Sec. 501.1   Purpose and scope.

    (a) Purpose. The purpose of these rules is to fulfill the 
responsibilities of the Marine Mammal Commission (the ``Commission'') 
under section 3 of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a(f) (the 
``Act'') by establishing procedures whereby an individual will be 
notified if any system of records maintained by the Commission contains 
a record pertaining to him or her; by defining the times and places at 
which records will be made available and the identification requirements 
which must be met by any individual requesting access to them; by 
establishing procedures for disclosure to an individual, on request, of 
any record pertaining to him or her; and by establishing procedures for 
processing, reviewing, and making a final determination on requests of 
individuals to correct or amend a record pertaining to him or her, 
including a provision for administrative appeal of initial adverse 
determinations on such requests. These rules are promulgated with 
particular attention to the purposes and goals of the Act, and in 
accordance therewith provide for relative ease of access to records 
pertaining to an individual, and for maintenance by the Commission of 
only those records which are current, accurate, necessary, relevant and 
complete with respect to the purposes for which they were collected.
    (b) Scope. These rules apply only to ``record'' contained in 
``systems of records,'' defined by the Act as follows:

    The term ``record'' means any item, collection, or grouping of 
information about an individual that is maintained by an agency, 
including, but not limited to, his education, financial transactions, 
medical history, and criminal or employment history and that contains 
his name, or the identifying number, symbol, or other identifying 
particular assigned to the individual, such as a finger or voice print 
or a photograph;
    The term ``system of records'' means of group of any record under 
the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the 
name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other 
identifying particular assigned to the individual.

Notices with respect to the systems maintained by the Commission have 
been published in the Federal Register, as required by the Act. These 
rules pertain only to the systems of records disclosed in such notices, 
and to any systems that may become the subject of a notice at any time 
in the future.
    (c) Nothing in these rules shall be construed as pertaining to 
requests made under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552.


<R05>
Sec. 501.2   Definitions.

    (a) As used in this part:
    (1) The term Act means the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a.
    (2) The term Commission means the Marine Mammal Commission.
    (3) The term Director means the Executive Director of the Marine 
Mammal Commission.
    (4) The term Privacy Officer means an individual designated by the 
Director to receive all requests regarding the existence of records, 
requests for access and requests for correction or amendment; to review 
and make initial determinations regarding all such requests; and to 
provide assistance to any individual wishing to exercise his or her 
rights under the Act.
    (b) Other terms shall be used in this part in accordance with the 
definitions contained in section 3 of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 
552a(a).

[[Page 393]]


<R05>
Sec. 501.3   Procedure for responding to requests regarding the existence of records pertaining to an individual.

    Any individual may submit a request to be notified whether a system 
of records, with respect to which the Commission has published a notice 
in the Federal Register, contains a record pertaining to him or her. 
Requests may be made in writing to the Privacy Officer or by appearing 
in person at the Commission offices located at 1625 I Street, NW., Room 
307, Washington, DC 20006 between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. 
on any working day. Systems of records that are the subject of a request 
should be identified by reference to the system name designated in the 
Notice of Systems of Records published in the Federal Register. In the 
event a system name is not known to the individual, a general request 
will suffice if it indicates reasons for the belief that a record 
pertaining to the named individual is maintained by the Commission. 
Receipt of inquiries submitted by mail will be acknowledged within 10 
days of receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public 
holidays) unless a response can also be prepared and forwarded to the 
individual within that time.


<R05>
Sec. 501.4   Requests for access--times, places and requirements for identification of individuals.

    Requests for access to a system of records pertaining to any 
individual may be made by that individual by mail addressed to the 
Privacy Officer, or by submitting a written request in person at the 
Commission offices located at 1625 I Street, NW., Room 307, Washington, 
DC 20006, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on any working day. 
Assistance in gaining access under this section, securing an amendment 
or correction under Sec. 501.6, or preparing an appeal under 
Secs. 501.5(d) and 501.8 shall be provided by the Privacy Officer on 
request directed to the Commission office. An individual appearing in 
person at the Commission offices will be granted immediate access to any 
records to which that individual is entitled under the Act upon 
satisfactory proof of identity by means of a document bearing the 
individual's photograph or signature. For requests made by mail, 
identification of the individual shall be adequate if established by 
means of submitting a certificate of a notary public, or equivalent 
officer empowered to administer oaths, substantially in accord with the 
following:

    City of ------------ County of --------------: ss (Name of 
individual) who affixed (his) (her) signature below in my presence, came 
before me, a (Title), in the aforesaid County and State, this ------ day 
of ------, 19--, and established (his)(her) identity to my satisfaction.
    My Commission expires --------------.

The certificate shall not be required, however, for written requests 
pertaining to non-sensitive information or to information which would be 
required to be made available under the Freedom of Information Act. The 
Privacy Officer shall determine the adequacy of any proof of identity 
offered by an individual.

[41 FR 5, Jan. 2, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 501.5   Disclosure of requested information.

    (a) Upon request and satisfactory proof of identity, an individual 
appearing at the Commission offices shall be given immediate access to 
and permission to review any record, contained in a system of records, 
pertaining to him or her, shall be allowed to have a person of his/her 
choosing accompany him/her, and shall be given a copy of all or any 
portion of the record. The individual to which access is granted shall 
be required to sign a written statement authorizing the presence of the 
person who accompanies him or her, and authorizing discussion of his or 
her record in the presence of the accompanying person.
    (b) Requests made by mail to the Privacy Officer at the Commission 
offices will be acknowledged within 10 days from date of receipt 
(excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). This 
acknowledgement shall advise the individual whether access to the record 
will be granted and, if access is granted, copies of such records shall 
be enclosed.
    (c) If the Privacy Officer initially determines to deny access to 
all or any portion of a record, notice of denial

[[Page 394]]

shall be given to the individual in writing, within 30 days (excluding 
Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) after acknowledgement is given, and 
shall include the following:
    (1) The precise record to which access is being denied;
    (2) The reason for denial, including a citation to the appropriate 
provisions of the Act and of these Rules;
    (3) A statement that the denial may be appealed to the Director;
    (4) A statement of what steps must be taken to perfect an appeal to 
the Director; and,
    (5) A statement that the individual has a right to judicial review 
under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1) of any final denial issued by the Director.
    (d) Administrative appeal of an initial denial, in whole or in part, 
of any request for access to a record, shall be available. An individual 
may appeal by submitting to the Director a written request for 
reconsideration stating therein specific reasons for reversal which 
address directly the reasons for denial stated in the initial notice of 
denial. If access is denied on appeal, a final notice of denial shall be 
sent to the individual within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and 
holidays), and shall state with particularity the grounds for rejecting 
all reasons for reversal submitted by the individual. The denial shall 
then be deemed final for purposes of obtaining judicial review.

[40 FR 49276, Oct. 21, 1975, as amended at 41 FR 5, Jan. 2, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 501.6   Requests for correction or amendment of a record.

    (a) Any individual may request the correction or amendment of a 
record pertaining to him or her in writing addressed to the Privacy 
Officer at the Commission offices. Verification of identity required for 
such requests shall be the same as that specified in Sec. 501.4 of this 
part with respect to requests for access. Records sought to be amended 
must be identified with as much specificity as is practicable under the 
circumstances of the request, and at a minimum, should refer to the 
system name designated in the Notice of System Records published in the 
Federal Register, the type of record in which the information thought to 
be improperly maintained or incorrect is contained, and the precise 
information that is the subject of the request (for example, system 
name, description of record, paragraph, sentence, line, words). 
Assistance in identifying a record, and in otherwise preparing a 
request, may be obtained by contacting the Privacy Officer at the 
Commission offices.
    (b) A request should, in addition to identifying the individual and 
the record sought to be amended or corrected, include:
    (1) The specific wording or other information to be deleted, if any;
    (2) The specific wording or other information to be inserted, if 
any, and the exact place in the record at which it is to be inserted, 
and,
    (3) A statement of the basis for the requested amendment or 
correction (e.g. that the record is inaccurate, unnecessary, irrelevant, 
untimely, or incomplete), together with supporting documents, if any, 
which substantiate the statement.


<R05>
Sec. 501.7   Agency review of requests for amendment or correction of a record.

    (a) Where possible, each request for amendment or correction shall 
be reviewed, and a determination on the request made, by the Privacy 
Officer within 10 days of receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and 
holidays). Requests shall be acknowledged within that period where 
insufficient information has been provided to enable action to be taken. 
An acknowledgement shall inform the individual making the request of the 
estimated time within which a disposition of the request is expected to 
be made, and shall prescribe such further information as may be 
necessary to process the request. The request shall be granted, or an 
initial decision to deny shall be made, within ten days of receipt of 
all information specified in the acknowledgement (excluding Saturdays, 
Sundays and holidays).
    (b) Within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) after 
arriving at a decision on a request, the Privacy Officer shall either:

[[Page 395]]

    (1) Make the requested amendment or correction, in whole or in part, 
and advise the individual in writing of such action; or,
    (2) Advise the individual in writing that the request has been 
initially denied, in whole or in part, stating, with respect to those 
portions denied;
    (i) The date of the denial;
    (ii) The reasons for the denial, including a citation to an 
appropriate section of the Act and these Rules; and,
    (iii) The right of the individual to prosecute an appeal and to 
obtain judicial review should a final denial result from the appeal.
    (c) In reviewing a request for amendment or correction of a record, 
the Privacy Officer shall consider the following criteria:
    (1) The sufficiency of the evidence submitted by the individual;
    (2) The factual accuracy of the information sought to be amended or 
corrected;
    (3) The relevance and necessity of the information sought to be 
amended or corrected in terms of the purposes for which it was 
collected;
    (4) The timeliness and currency of the information sought to be 
amended or corrected in terms of the purposes for which it was 
collected;
    (5) The completeness of the information sought to be amended or 
corrected in terms of the purposes for which it was collected;
    (6) The degree of possibility that denial of the request could 
unfairly result in determinations adverse to the individual;
    (7) The character of the record sought to be corrected or amended; 
and,
    (8) The propriety and feasibility of complying with the specific 
means of correction or amendment requested by the individual. If an 
amendment or correction is otherwise permissible under the Act and other 
relevant statutes, a request shall be denied only if the individual has 
failed to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, the propriety 
of the amendment or correction in light of these criteria.

[40 FR 49276, Oct. 21, 1975, as amended at 41 FR 5, Jan. 2, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 501.8   Appeal of initial denial of a request for amendment or correction.

    (a) The initial denial of a request for amendment or correction may 
be appealed by submitting to the Director the following appeal papers:
    (1) A copy of the original request for amendment or correction;
    (2) A copy of the initial denial; and
    (3) A precise statement of the reasons for the individual's belief 
that the denial is in error, referring specifically to the criteria 
contained in Sec. 501.7(c)(1) through (8).

The appeal must be signed by the individual. While these papers normally 
will constitute the entire Record on Appeal, the Director may add 
additional information, from sources other than the individual, where 
necessary to facilitate a final determination. Any such additional 
information added to the record shall promptly be disclosed to the 
individual to the greatest extent possible, and an opportunity for 
comment thereon shall be afforded prior to the final determination. 
Appeals should be submitted to the Director within 90 days after the 
date of the initial denial.
    (b) The Director shall issue a final determination on appeal within 
thirty days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) 
from the date on which a completed Record on Appeal (including any 
additional information deemed necessary) is received. Review, and final 
determination by the Director, shall be based upon the criteria 
specified in Sec. 501.7(c)(1) through (8).
    (c) If the appeal is resolved favorably to the individual, the final 
determination shall specify the amendments or corrections to be made. 
Copies of the final determination shall be transmitted promptly to the 
individual and to the Privacy Officer. The Privacy Officer shall make 
the requested amendment or correction and advise the individual in 
writing of such action.
    (d) If the appeal is denied, the final determination shall state, 
with particularity, the reasons for denial, including a citation to an 
appropriate section of the Act and of these Rules.

[[Page 396]]

The final determination shall be forwarded promptly to the individual, 
together with a notice which shall inform the individual of his or her 
right to submit to the Privacy Officer, for inclusion in the record, a 
concise statement of grounds for disagreement with the final 
determination. Receipt of any such statement shall be acknowledged by 
the Privacy Officer, and all subsequent and prior users of the record 
shall be provided copies of the statement. The notice shall also inform 
the individual of his or her right, under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1), to obtain 
judicial review of the final determination.

[40 FR 49276, Oct. 21, 1975, as amended at 41 FR 5, Jan. 2, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 501.9   Fees.

    A fee of $0.10 shall be charged for each copy of each page of a 
record made, by photocopy or similar process, at the request of an 
individual. No fee shall be charged for copies made at the initiative of 
the Commission incident to granting access to a record. A total copying 
fee of $2.00 or less may be waived by the Privacy Officer, but fees for 
all requests made contemporaneously by an individual shall be aggregated 
to determine the total fee.

which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy;
    (7) Investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but 
only to the extent that the production of such records would:
    (i) Interfere with enforcement proceedings,
    (ii) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial 
adjudication,
    (iii) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,
    (iv) Disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case 
of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the 
course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful 
national security intelligence investigation, confidential information 
furnished only by the confidential source,

Sec. 520.3   Definitions.

    As used in these regulations:
    (a) The term Commission means the Marine Mammal Commission;
    (b) The term Director means the Executive Director of the Marine 
Mammal Commission;
    (c) The term exempt materials means those materials described in 
Sec. 520.2(b);
    (d) The term non-exempt materials refers to all materials described 
in Sec. 520.2(a), but not included in Sec. 520.2(b); and
    (e) The term General Counsel means the General Counsel of the Marine 
Mammal Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 520.4   Availability of materials.

    (a) All non-exempt materials shall be available for inspection 
during normal business hours at the Commission offices, 1625 I Street, 
NW., Room 307, Washington, DC. Space shall be made available at that 
location for the use of any person who is granted permission to inspect 
such materials.
    (b) Requests to inspect, and obtain copies of, any material 
maintained by the Commission may be made in person at the Commission 
offices, or submitted in writing to the Executive Director, Marine 
Mammal Commission, 1625 I St., NW., Room 307, Washington, DC 20006. Each 
request should include a reasonable description of the material being 
sought, and should contain sufficient detail to facilitate retrieval of 
the material without undue delay. The Commission staff shall assist to 
the extent practicable in identifying material that is imprecisely 
described by the person requesting such material.
    (c) An initial determination whether, and to what extent, to grant 
each request shall be made by the General Counsel or his delegate within 
10 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after 
receipt of that request. The person making the request shall be notified 
immediately of the determination made. In making such determinations, it 
shall first be considered whether the material requested is of a type 
described in Sec. 520.2(a); if it is, the request shall be granted 
unless the material is exempted by Sec. 520.2(b). If the material 
requested is not of a type described in Sec. 520.2(a), or is the subject 
of one or more exemptions, the request shall be denied.
    (d) If a determination is made to grant a request, the relevant 
material shall promptly be made available for inspection at the 
Commission offices. Copies of the material disclosed shall be furnished 
within a reasonable time after payment of the fee specified in 
Sec. 520.7. Copies of less than 10 pages of material requested in person 
ordinarily will be furnished immediately following the determination to 
grant the request and payment of the fee. Larger numbers of copies may 
be furnished at the earliest convenience of the Commission staff, but 
must be furnished within a reasonable time following payment of the fee.
    (e) Whenever required to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of 
personal privacy, the General Counsel or his delegate shall determine 
that identifying details shall be deleted from an opinion, statement of 
policy, interpretation, or staff manual or instruction to which access 
is granted or of which copies are furnished. Where portions of the 
requested material are exempt under Sec. 520.2(b), and are reasonably 
segregable from the remainder of the material, those portions shall be 
excised from the material disclosed. Whenever details are deleted or 
portions are excised and not disclosed, the notification shall include 
the information specified in Sec. 520.4(f).
    (f) If a determination is made to deny a request, the notification 
shall include a statement of the reasons for such action, shall set 
forth the name and position of the person responsible for the denial, 
and shall advise the requester

    (a) An appeal to the Director of any denial, in whole or in part, of 
a request for access to and copies of material may be made by submission 
of a written request for reconsideration. Such requests must state 
specific reasons for reconsideration that address directly the grounds 
upon which the denial was based. Requests should be addressed to the 
Director at the Commission offices.
    (b) The Director shall make a determination with respect to any 
appeal within 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public 
holidays) after receipt of the request for reconsideration. The person 
making such a request shall immediately be notified by mail of the 
determination.
    (c) If the initial denial is reversed by the Director, any material 
with which the reversal is concerned shall be made available for 
inspection, and copies shall be furnished, in accordance with 
Sec. 520.4(d).
    (d) If the denial is upheld, in whole or in part, the Director shall 
include in the notification a statement of the requester's right of 
judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4), and the names and positions of 
the persons responsible for the denial.


<R05>
Sec. 520.6   Extensions of time.

    (a) Whenever unusual circumstances exist, as set forth in 
Sec. 520.6(b), the times within which determinations must be made by the 
General Counsel on requests for access (10 working days), and by the 
Director on requests for reconsideration (20 working days), may be 
extended by written notice to the requester. The notice shall set forth 
the reasons for such extension, and the date on which a determination is 
expected to be made. The maximum extension of time allowed under this 
section shall be 10 working days, but shall be utilized only to the 
extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular 
request.
    (b) As used in this section, ``unusual circumstances'' shall mean:
    (1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from 
field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the 
Commission offices;
    (2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a 
voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are the subject 
of a single request; or
    (3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all 
practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in 
the determination of the request or among two or more components of the 
agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.


<R05>
Sec. 520.7   Fees.

    (a) The following standard charges for document search and 
duplication, based on the direct costs of such services, must be paid 
before access to, or copies of material will be granted under these 
regulations:
    (1) Search: $4.00 per person-hour for clerical time; $8.00 per 
person-hour for professional or supervisory time;
    (2) Duplication: $0.10 per page of photocopied material.
    (b) The Commission shall furnish without charge, or at a reduced 
charge, copies of any material disclosed pursuant to these regulations, 
whenever the General Counsel or the Director determines that waiver or 
reduction of the fee is in the public interest because furnishing the 
information can be considered as primarily benefiting the general 
public.

[[Page 401]]


<R05>
Sec. 530.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to establish procedures which supplement 
the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations and provide for 
the implementation of those provisions identified in Sec. 1507.3(b) of 
the regulations which are applicable to the activities of the Commission 
in light of its statutory functions and responsibilities.


<R05>
Sec. 530.2  Ensuring that environmental documents are actually considered in agency decision-making.

    Section 1505.1 of the NEPA regulations contains requirements to 
ensure adequate consideration of environmental documents in agency 
decision-making. To implement these requirements, Commission officials 
shall:
    (a) Consider all relevant environmental documents in evaluating 
proposals for agency actions;
    (b) Ensure that all relevant environmental documents, comments, and 
responses accompany the proposal through existing agency review 
processes;
    (c) Consider only those alternatives encompassed by the range of 
alternatives discussed in the relevant environmental documents when 
evaluating any proposal for action by the Commission which is likely to 
significantly affect the quality of the human environment; and
    (d) Where an environmental impact statement (EIS) has been prepared, 
consider the specific alternatives analyzed in the EIS when evaluating 
the proposal which is the subject of the EIS. All Commission officials 
directly involved in developing, evaluating, and/or reaching decisions 
on proposed actions shall consider relevant environmental documents and 
comply with the applicable provisions of the NEPA process.


<R05>
Sec. 530.3  Typical classes of action.

    Section 1507.3(b)(2), in conjunction with Sec. 1508.4, requires 
agencies to identify typical classes of action that warrant similar 
treatment under NEPA with respect to the preparation of EIS's or 
environmental assessments. As a general matter, the Commission's 
activities do not include actions for which EIS's or environmental 
assessments are required. Its activities involve:
    (a) Consultation with and recommendations to other Federal agencies 
for actions relating to marine mammal protection and conservation for 
which an EIS or environmental assessment is either not required by the 
NEPA regulations or for which an EIS or environmental assessment is 
prepared by another Federal agency; and
    (b) Research contracts relating to policy issues, biological-
ecological data needed to make sound management decisions, and better 
methods for collecting and analyzing data. These activities are not, by 
themselves, major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of 
the human environment and the Commission's activities are therefore 
categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare an EIS or 
environmental assessment except for proposals for legislation which are 
initiated by the Commission, for which the Commission shall develop 
environmental assessments or EIS's, as appropriate, in accordance with 
the NEPA regulations. The Commission shall independently determine 
whether an EIS or an environmental assessment is required where:
    (1) A proposal for agency action is not covered by one of the 
typical classes of action above; or
    (2) For actions which are covered, the presence of extraordinary 
circumstances indicates that some other level of environmental review 
may be appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 530.4  Environmental information.

    Interested persons may contact the Office of the General Counsel for 
information regarding the Commission's compliance with NEPA.

<R05>


Sec.
540.1  Policy.
540.2  Program.
540.3  Procedures.

    Authority: Executive Order 12356.


[[Page 402]]




<R05>
Sec. 540.1  Policy.

    It is the policy of the Marine Mammal Commission to act in 
accordance with Executive Order 12356 in matters relating to national 
security information.

[44 FR 55381, Sept. 26, 1979]


<R05>
Sec. 540.2  Program.

    The Executive Director is designated as the Commission's official 
responsible for implementation and oversight of information security 
programs and procedures. He acts as the recipient of questions, 
suggestions, and complaints regarding all elements of this program, and 
is solely responsible for changes to it and for insuring that it is at 
all times consistent with Executive Order 12356. The Executive Director 
also serves as the Commission's official contact for requests for 
declassification of materials submitted under the provisions of 
Executive Order 12356, regardless of the point of origin of such 
requests. He is responsible for assuring that requests submitted under 
the Freedom of Information Act are handled in accordance with that Act 
and that declassification requests submitted under the provisions of 
Executive Order 12356 are acted upon within 60 days of receipt.

[44 FR 55381, Sept. 26, 1979]


<R05>
Sec. 540.3  Procedures.

    (a) Mandatory declassification review. All requests for mandatory 
review shall be handled by the Executive Director or his designee. Under 
no circumstances shall the Exective Director refuse to confirm the 
existence or non-existence of a document requested under the Freedom of 
Information Act or the mandatory review provisions of Executive Order 
12356, unless the fact of its existence or non-existence would itself be 
classified under Executive Order 12356. Requests for declassification 
shall be acted upon promptly providing that the request reasonably 
describes the information which is the subject of the request for 
declassification. In light of the fact that the Commission does not have 
original classification authority and national security information in 
its custody has been classified by another Federal agency, the Executive 
Director will refer all requests for national security information in 
its custody to the Federal agency that classified it or, if the agency 
that classified it has either ceased to exist or transferred the 
information in conjunction with a transfer of functions, to the 
appropriate federal agency exercising original classification authority 
with respect to the same subject, for review and disposition in 
accordance with Executive Order 12356 and that agency's regulations and 
guidelines.
    (b) Exceptional cases. When an employee or contractor of the 
Commission originates information that is believed to require 
classification, the Executive Director shall ensure that it is protected 
in accordance with Executive Order 12356 and shall promptly transmit it 
under appropriate safeguards to the agency with appropriate subject 
matter jurisdiction and classification authority for review and action 
in accordance with the Order and that agency's regulations and 
guidelines.
    (c) Derivative classification. Derivative classification markings 
shall be applied to information that is in substance the same as 
information that is already classified, in accordance with Executive 
Order 12356, Section 2-1, unless it is determined through inquiries made 
to the originators of the classified information or other appropriate 
persons that the paraphrasing, restating, or summarizing of the 
classified information obviates the need for its classification, in 
which case the information shall be issued as unclassified or shall be 
marked appropriately. After verifying the current level of 
classification so far as practicable, paper copies of such derivatively 
classified information shall be marked so as to indicate:
    (1) The source of the original classification;
    (2) The identity of the Commission employee originating the 
derivatively classified document;
    (3) The dates or events for declassification or review for 
declassification indicated on the classified source material; and
    (4) Any additional authorized markings appearing on the source 
material.

[[Page 403]]

    (d) Handling. All classified documents shall be delivered to the 
Executive Director or his designee immediately upon receipt. All 
potential recipients of such documents shall be advised of the names of 
such designees and updated information as necessary. In the event that 
the Executive Director or his designee is not available to receive such 
documents, they shall be turned over to the Administrative Officer and 
secured, unopened, in the combination safe located in the Commission 
offices until the Executive Director or his designee is available. Under 
no circumstances shall classified materials that cannot be delivered to 
the Executive Director or his designee be stored other than in the 
designated safe.
    (e) Reproduction. Reproduction of classified material shall take 
place only in accordance with Executive Order 12356, its implementing 
directives, and any limitations imposed by the originator. Should copies 
be made, they are subject to the same controls as the original document. 
Records showing the number and distribution of copies shall be 
maintained, where required by the Executive Order, by the Administrative 
Officer and the log stored with the original documents. These measures 
shall not restrict reproduction for the purposes of mandatory review.
    (f) Storage. All classified documents shall be stored in the 
combination safe located in the Commission's offices. The combination 
shall be changed as required by ISOO Directive No. 1, dated June 23, 
1982. The combination shall be known only to the Executive Director and 
his designees with the appropriate security clearance.
    (g) Employee education. All employees who have been granted a 
security clearance and who have occasion to handle classified materials 
shall be advised of handling, reproduction, and storage procedures and 
shall be required to review Executive Order 12356 and appropriate ISOO 
directives. This shall be effected by a memorandum to all affected 
employees at the time these procedures are implemented. New employees 
will be instructed in procedures as they enter employment with the 
Commission.
    (h) Agency terminology. The use of the terms ``Top Secret'', 
``Secret'', and ``Confidential'' shall be limited to materials 
classified for national security purposes.

<R05>
Sec. 550.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 550.150, no qualified 
handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be

<R05>
Sec. 550.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does 
not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons; or
    (2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 550.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or

[[Page 407]]

such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not 
result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless 
ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the 
program or activity.
    (b) Methods. The agency may comply with the requirements of this 
section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of 
services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, 
home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, 
alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, 
use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in 
making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. The agency is nor required to make structural 
changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in 
achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making 
alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements 
to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as 
amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In 
choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this 
section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer 
programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most 
integrated setting appropriate.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by June 6, 1986, except that 
where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by April 7, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by October 7, 1986, a transition plan setting 
forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall 
provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped 
persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped 
persons;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.

Sec. 550.151  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the 
Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 
CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this 
section.

Sec. 550.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
handicapped person.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.

[[Page 408]]

    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 550.160 would result 
in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result 
in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or 
her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in 
the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must 
be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would 
result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any 
other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens 
but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, 
handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or 
activity.

classified pursuant to that Executive order;

manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or

particular types of matters to be withheld;

information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;

constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;

records or information would:
    (i) Interfere with enforcement proceedings,
    (ii) Deprive a person of a right to either a fair trial or an 
impartial ajudication,
    (iii) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,

authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency 
conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, 
confidential information furnished only by the confidential source or 
sources,
    (v) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or
    (vi) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement

the proposed action or where the Commission is required by law to make 
such disclosure on its own initiative prior to taking final action on 
the proposal; or
