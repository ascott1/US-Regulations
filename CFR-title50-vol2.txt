                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 2003), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

provided in part 23 of this subchapter.
    (b) The regulations identify those species of wildlife and plants 
determined by the Director to be endangered or threatened with 
extinction under section 4(a) of the Act and also carry over the species 
and subspecies of wildlife designated as endangered under the Endangered 
Species Conservation Act of 1969 (83 Stat. 275, 16 U.S.C. 668cc-1 to 6) 
which are deemed endangered species under section 4(c)(3) of the Act.

[40 FR 44415, Sept. 26, 1975, as amended at 42 FR 10465, Feb. 22, 1977]

[[Page 6]]


<R05>
Sec.  17.2  Scope of regulations.

    (a) The regulations of this part apply only to endangered and 
threatened wildlife and plants.
    (b) By agreement between the Service and the National Marine 
Fisheries Service, the jurisdiction of the Department of Commerce has 
been specifically defined to include certain species, while jurisdiction 
is shared in regard to certain other species. Such species are footnoted 
in subpart B of this part, and reference is given to special rules of 
the National Marine Fisheries Service for those species.
    (c) The provisions in this part are in addition to, and are not in 
lieu of, other regulations of this subchapter B which may require a 
permit or prescribe additional restrictions or conditions for the 
importation, exportation, and interstate transportation of wildlife.
    (d) The examples used in this part are provided solely for the 
convenience of the public, and to explain the intent and meaning of the 
regulation to which they refer. They have no legal significance.
    (e) Certain of the wildlife and plants listed in Sec. Sec.  17.11 
and 17.12 as endangered or threatened are included in Appendix I, II or

of this subchapter.

[40 FR 44415, Sept. 26, 1975, as amended at 42 FR 10465, Feb. 22, 1977]


<R05>
Sec.  17.3  Definitions.

    In addition to the definitions contained in part 10 of this 
subchapter, and unless the context otherwise requires, in this part 17:
    Act means the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543; 
87 Stat. 884);
    Adequately covered means, with respect to species listed pursuant to 
section 4 of the ESA, that a proposed conservation plan has satisfied 
the permit issuance criteria under section 10(a)(2)(B) of the ESA for 
the species covered by the plan, and, with respect to unlisted species, 
that a proposed conservation plan has satisfied the permit issuance 
criteria under section 10(a)(2)(B) of the ESA that would otherwise apply 
if the unlisted species covered by the plan were actually listed. For 
the Services to cover a species under a conservation plan, it must be 
listed on the section 10(a)(1)(B) permit.
    Alaskan Native means a person defined in the Alaska Native Claims 
Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1603(b) (85 Stat. 588)) as a citizen of the 
United States who is of one-fourth degree or more Alaska Indian 
(including Tsimshian Indians enrolled or not enrolled in the Metlaktla 
Indian Community), Eskimo, or Aleut blood, or combination thereof. The 
term includes any Native, as so defined, either or both of whose 
adoptive parents are not Natives. It also includes, in the absence of 
proof of a minimum blood quantum, any citizen of the United States who 
is regarded as an Alaska Native by the Native village or town of which 
he claims to be a member and whose father or mother is (or, if deceased, 
was) regarded as Native by any Native village or Native town. Any 
citizen enrolled by the Secretary pursuant to section 5 of the Alaska 
Native Claims Settlement Act shall be conclusively presumed to be an 
Alaskan Native for purposes of this part;
    Authentic native articles of handicrafts and clothing means items 
made by an Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo which (a) were commonly produced on 
or before December 28, 1973, and (b) are composed wholly or in some 
significant respect of natural materials, and (c) are significantly 
altered from their natural form and which are produced, decorated, or 
fashioned in the exercise of traditional native handicrafts without the 
use of pantographs, multiple carvers, or similar mass copying devices. 
Improved methods of production utilizing modern implements such as 
sewing machines or modern techniques at a tannery registered pursuant to 
Sec.  18.23(c) of this subchapter (in the case of marine mammals) may be 
used so long as no large scale mass production industry results. 
Traditional native handicrafts include, but are not limited to, weaving, 
carving, stitching, sewing, lacing, beading, drawing, and painting. The 
formation of traditional native groups

[[Page 7]]

such as cooperatives, is permitted so long as no large scale mass 
production results;
    Bred in captivity or captive-bred refers to wildlife, including 
eggs, born or otherwise produced in captivity from parents that mated or 
otherwise transferred gametes in captivity, if reproduction is sexual, 
or from parents that were in captivity when development of the progeny 
began, if development is asexual.
    Captivity means that living wildlife is held in a controlled 
environment that is intensively manipulated by man for the purpose of 
producing wildlife of the selected species, and that has boundaries 
designed to prevent animal, eggs or gametes of the selected species from 
entering or leaving the controlled environment. General characteristics 
of captivity may include but are not limited to artificial housing, 
waste removal, health care, protection from predators, and artificially 
supplied food.
    Changed circumstances means changes in circumstances affecting a 
species or geographic area covered by a conservation plan that can 
reasonably be anticipated by plan developers and the Service and that 
can be planned for (e.g., the listing of new species, or a fire or other 
natural catastrophic event in areas prone to such events).
    Conservation plan means the plan required by section 10(a)(2)(A) of 
the ESA that an applicant must submit when applying for an incidental 
take permit. Conservation plans also are known as ``habitat conservation 
plans'' or ``HCPs.''
    Conserved habitat areas means areas explicitly designated for 
habitat restoration, acquisition, protection, or other conservation 
purposes under a conservation plan.
    Convention means the Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, TIAS 8249.
    Enhance the propagation or survival, when used in reference to 
wildlife in captivity, includes but is not limited to the following 
activities when it can be shown that such activities would not be 
detrimental to the survival of wild or captive populations of the 
affected species:
    (a) Provision of health care, management of populations by culling, 
contraception, euthanasia, grouping or handling of wildlife to control 
survivorship and reproduction, and similar normal practices of animal 
husbandry needed to maintain captive populations that are self-
sustaining and that possess as much genetic vitality as possible;
    (b) Accumulation and holding of living wildlife that is not 
immediately needed or suitable for propagative or scientific purposes, 
and the transfer of such wildlife between persons in order to relieve 
crowding or other problems hindering the propagation or survival of the 
captive population at the location from which the wildlife would be 
removed; and
    (c) Exhibition of living wildlife in a manner designed to educate 
the public about the ecological role and conservation needs of the 
affected species.
    Endangered means a species of wildlife listed in Sec.  17.11 or a 
species of plant listed in Sec.  17.12 and designated as endangered.
    Harass in the definition of ``take'' in the Act means an intentional 
or negligent act or omission which creates the likelihood of injury to 
wildlife by annoying it to such an extent as to significantly disrupt 
normal behavioral patterns which include, but are not limited to, 
breeding, feeding, or sheltering. This definition, when applied to 
captive wildlife, does not include generally accepted:
    (1) Animal husbandry practices that meet or exceed the minimum 
standards for facilities and care under the Animal Welfare Act,
    (2) Breeding procedures, or
    (3) Provisions of veterinary care for confining, tranquilizing, or 
anesthetizing, when such practices, procedures, or provisions are not 
likely to to result in injury to the wildlife.
    Harm in the definition of ``take'' in the Act means an act which 
actually kills or injures wildlife. Such act may include significant 
habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures 
wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns, 
including breeding, feeding or sheltering.
    Incidental taking means any taking otherwise prohibited, if such 
taking is

[[Page 8]]

incidental to, and not the purpose of, the carrying out of an otherwise 
lawful activity.
    Industry or trade in the definition of ``commercial activity'' in 
the Act means the actual or intended transfer of wildlife or plants from 
one person to another person in the pursuit of gain or profit;
    Native village or town means any community, association, tribe, clan 
or group;
    Operating conservation program means those conservation management 
activities which are expressly agreed upon and described in a 
conservation plan or its Implementing Agreement, if any, and which are 
to be undertaken for the affected species when implementing an approved 
conservation plan, including measures to respond to changed 
circumstances.
    Population means a group of fish or wildlife in the same taxon below 
the subspecific level, in common spatial arrangement that interbreed 
when mature;
    Properly implemented conservation plan means any conservation plan, 
Implementing Agreement and permit whose commitments and provisions have 
been or are being fully implemented by the permittee.
    Specimen means any animal or plant, or any part, product, egg, seed 
or root of any animal or plant;
    Subsistence means the use of endangered or threatened wildlife for 
food, clothing, shelter, heating, transportation and other uses 
necessary to maintain the life of the taker of the wildlife, or those 
who depend upon the taker to provide them with such subsistence, and 
includes selling any edible portions of such wildlife in native villages 
and towns in Alaska for native consumption within native villages and 
towns;
    Threatened means a species of wildlife listed in Sec.  17.11 or 
plant listed in Sec.  17.12 and designated as threatened.
    Unforeseen circumstances means changes in circumstances affecting a 
species or geographic area covered by a conservation plan that could not 
reasonably have been anticipated by plan developers and the Service at 
the time of the conservation plan's negotiation and development, and 
that result in a substantial and adverse change in the status of the 
covered species.
    Wasteful manner means any taking or method of taking which is likely 
to result in the killing or injury of endangered or threatened wildlife 
beyond those needed for subsistence purposes, or which results in the 
waste of a substantial portion of the wildlife, and includes without 
limitation the employment of a method of taking which is not likely to 
assure the capture or killing of the wildlife, or which is not 
immediately followed by a reasonable effort to retrieve the wildlife.

Sec.  17.4  Pre-Act wildlife.

    (a) The prohibitions defined in subparts C and D of this part 17 
shall not apply to any activity involving endangered or threatened 
wildlife which was held in captivity or in a controlled environment on 
December 28, 1973: Provided,
    (1) That the purposes of such holding were not contrary to the 
purposes of the Act; and
    (2) That the wildlife was not held in the course of a commercial 
activity.

    Example 1. On January 25, 1974, a tourist buys a stuffed hawksbill 
turtle (an endangered species listed since June, 1970), in a foreign 
country. On December 28, 1973, the stuffed turtle had been on display 
for sale. The tourist imports the stuffed turtle into the United States 
on January 26, 1974. This is a violation of the Act since the stuffed 
turtle was held for commercial purposes on December 28, 1973.
    Example 2. On December 27, 1973 (or earlier), a tourist buys a 
leopard skin coat (the leopard has been listed as endangered since March 
1972) for his wife in a foreign country. On January 5, he imports it 
into the United States. He has not committed a violation since on 
December 28, 1973, he was the owner of the coat, for personal purposes, 
and the chain of commerce had ended with the sale on the 27th. Even if 
he did not finish paying for the coat for another year, as long as he 
had possession of it, and he was not going to resell it, but was using 
it for personal purposes, the Act does not apply to that coat.
    Example 3. On or before December 28, 1973, a hunter kills a leopard 
legally in Africa. He has the leopard mounted and imports it into

[[Page 9]]

the United States in March 1974. The importation is not subject to the 
Act. The hunter has not engaged in a commercial activity, even though he 
bought the services of a guide, outfitters, and a taxidermist to help 
him take, preserve, and import the leopard. This applies even if the 
trophy was in the possession of the taxidermist on December 28, 1973.
    Example 4. On January 15, 1974, a hunter kills a leopard legally in 
Africa. He has the leopard mounted and imports it into the United States 
in June 1974. This importation is a violation of the Act since the 
leopard was not in captivity or a controlled environment on December 28, 
1973.

    (b) Service officers or Customs officers may refuse to clear 
endangered or threatened wildlife for importation into or exportation 
from the United States, pursuant to Sec.  14.53 of this subchapter, 
until the importer or exporter can demonstrate that the exemption 
referred to in this section applies. Exempt status may be established by 
any sufficient evidence, including an affidavit containing the 
following:
    (1) The affiant's name and address;
    (2) Identification of the affiant;
    (3) Identification of the endangered or threatened wildlife which is 
the subject of the affidavit;
    (4) A statement by the affiant that to the best of his knowledge and 
belief, the endangered or threatened wildlife which is the subject of 
the affidavit was in captivity or in a controlled environment on 
December 28, 1973, and was not being held for purposes contrary to the 
Act or in the course of a commercial activity;
    (5) A statement by the affiant in the following language:

    The foregoing is principally based on the attached exhibits which, 
to the best of my knowledge and belief, are complete, true and correct. 
I understand that this affidavit is being submitted for the purpose of 
inducing the Federal Government to recognize an exempt status regarding 
(insert description of wildlife), under the Endangered Species Act of 
1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543), and regulations promulgated thereunder, and 
that any false statements may subject me to the criminal penalties of 18 
U.S.C. 1001.

    (6) As an attachment, records or other available evidence to show:
    (i) That the wildlife in question was being held in captivity or in 
a controlled environment on December 28, 1973;
    (ii) The purpose for which the wildlife was being held; and
    (iii) The nature of such holding (to establish that no commercial 
activity was involved).
    (c) This section applies only to wildlife born on or prior to 
December 28, 1973. It does not apply to the progeny of any such wildlife 
born after December 28, 1973.


<R05>
Sec.  17.5  Alaska natives.

    (a) The provisions of subpart C of this part relating to the 
importation or the taking of endangered wildlife, and any provision of 
subpart D of this part relating to the importation or the taking of 
threatened wildlife, shall not apply to:
    (1) Any Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo who is an Alaskan native and who 
resides in Alaska; or
    (2) Any non-native permanent resident of an Alaskan native village 
who is primarily dependent upon the taking of wildlife for consumption 
or for the creation and sale of authentic native articles of handicrafts 
and clothing:

If the taking is primarily for subsistence purposes, and is not 
accomplished in a wasteful manner.
    (b) Edible portions of endangered or threatened wildlife taken or 
imported pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section may be sold in native 
villages or towns in Alaska for native consumption within native 
villages and towns in Alaska.
    (c) Non-edible by-products of endangered or threatened wildlife 
taken or imported pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section may be sold 
in interstate commerce when made into authentic native articles of 
handicrafts and clothing.


<R05>
Sec.  17.6  State cooperative agreements. [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec.  17.7  Raptor exemption.

    (a) The prohibitions found in Sec. Sec.  17.21 and 17.31 do not 
apply to any raptor [a live migratory bird of the Order Falconiformes or 
the Order Strigiformes, other than a bald eagle (Haliaeetus 
leucocephalus) or a golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos)] legally held in 
captivity or

[[Page 10]]

in a controlled environment on November 10, 1978, or to any of its 
progeny, which is:
    (1) Possessed and banded in compliance with the terms of a valid 
permit issued under part 21 of this chapter; and
    (2) Identified in the earliest applicable annual report required to 
be filed by a permittee under part 21 of this chapter as in a 
permittee's possession on November 10, 1978, or as the progeny of such a 
raptor.
    (b) This section does not apply to any raptor intentionally returned 
to the wild.

Sec.  17.8  Permit applications and information collection requirements.

    (a) Address permit applications for activities affecting species 
listed under the Endangered Species Act, as amended, as follows:
    (1) Address activities affecting endangered and threatened species 
that are native to the United States to the Regional Director for the 
Region in which the activity is to take place. You can find addresses 
for the Regional Directors in 50 CFR 2.2. Send applications for 
interstate commerce in native endangered and threatened species to the 
Regional Director with lead responsibility for the species. To determine 
the appropriate region, call the nearest Regional Office:

Region 1 (Portland, OR): 503-231-6241
Region 2 (Albuquerque, NM): 505-248-6920
Region 3 (Twin Cities, MN): 612-713-5343
Region 4 (Atlanta, GA): 404-679-7313
Region 5 (Hadley, MA): 413-253-8628
Region 6 (Denver, CO): 303-236-8155, ext 263
Region 7 (Anchorage, AK): 907-786-3620
Headquarters (Washington, DC): 703-358-2106

    (2) Submit permit applications for activities affecting native 
endangered and threatened species in international movement or commerce, 
and all activities affecting nonnative endangered and threatened species 
to the Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, (Attention Office of 
Management Authority), 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, Room 700, Arlington, VA 
22203.
    (b) The Office of Management and Budget approved the information 
collection requirements contained in this part 17 under 44 U.S.C. 3507 
and assigned OMB Control Numbers 1018-0093 and 1018-0094. The Service 
may not conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to respond to, a 
collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB 
control number. We are collecting this information to provide 
information necessary to evaluate permit applications. We will use this 
information to review permit applications and make decisions, according 
to criteria established in various Federal wildlife conservation 
statutes and regulations, on the issuance, suspension, revocation, or 
denial of permits. You must respond to obtain or retain a permit. We 
estimate the public reporting burden for these reporting requirements to 
vary from 2 to 2\1/2\ hours per response, including time for reviewing 
instructions, gathering and maintaining data, and completing and 
reviewing the forms. Direct comments regarding the burden estimate or 
any other aspect of these reporting requirements to the Service 
Information Collection Control Officer, MS-222 ARLSQ, U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, Washington, DC 20240, or the Office of Management and 
Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (1018-0093/0094), Washington, DC

                             Subpart B_Lists


<R05>
Sec.  17.11  Endangered and threatened wildlife.

    (a) The list in this section contains the names of all species of 
wildlife which have been determined by the Services to be Endangered or 
Threatened. It also contains the names of species of wildlife treated as 
Endangered or Threatened because they are sufficiently similar in 
appearance to Endangered or Threatened species (see Sec.  17.50 et 
seq.).
    (b) The columns entitled ``Common Name,'' ``Scientific Name,'' and 
``Vertebrate Population Where Endangered or Threatened'' define the 
species of wildlife within the meaning of the Act. Thus, differently 
classified geographic populations of the same vertebrate subspecies or 
species shall be identified by their differing geographic boundaries, 
even though the other two columns are identical. The

[[Page 11]]

term ``Entire'' means that all populations throughout the present range 
of a vertebrate species are listed. Although common names are included, 
they cannot be relied upon for identification of any specimen, since 
they may vary greatly in local usage. The Services shall use the most 
recently accepted scientific name. In cases in which confusion might 
arise, a synonym(s) will be provided in parentheses. The Services shall 
rely to the extent practicable on the International Code of Zoological 
Nomenclature.
    (c) In the ``Status'' column the following symbols are used: ``E'' 
for Endangered, ``T'' for Threatened, and ``E [or T] (S/A)'' for 
similarity of appearance species.
    (d) The other data in the list are nonregulatory in nature and are 
provided for the information of the reader. In the annual revision and 
compilation of this title, the following information may be amended 
without public notice: the spelling of species' names, historical range, 
footnotes, references to certain other applicable portions of this 
title, synonyms, and more current names. In any of these revised 
entries, neither the species, as defined in paragraph (b) of this 
section, nor its status may be changed without following the procedures 
of part 424 of this title.
    (e) The ``historic range'' indicates the known general distribution 
of the species or subspecies as reported in the current scientific 
literature. The present distribution may be greatly reduced from this 
historic range. This column does not imply any limitation on the 
application of the prohibitions in the Act or implementing rules. Such 
prohibitions apply to all individuals of the species, wherever found.
    (f)(1) A footnote to the Federal Register publication(s) listing or 
reclassifying a species is indicated under the column ``When listed.'' 
Footnote numbers to Sec. Sec.  17.11 and 17.12 are in the same numerical 
sequence, since plants and animals may be listed in the same Federal 
Register document. That document, at least since 1973, includes a 
statement indicating the basis for the listing, as well as the effective 
date(s) of said listing.
    (2) The ``Special rules'' and ``Critical habitat'' columns provide a 
cross reference to other sections in parts 17, 222, 226, or 227. The 
``Special rules'' column will also be used to cite the special rules 
that describe experimental populations and determine if they are 
essential or nonessential. Separate listing will be made for 
experimental populations, and the status column will include the 
following symbols: ``XE'' for an essential experimental population and 
``XN'' for a nonessential experimental population. The term ``NA'' (not 
applicable) appearing in either of these two columns indicates that 
there are no special rules and/or critical habitat for that particular 
species. However, all other appropriate rules in parts 17, 217 through 
227, and 402 still apply to that species. In addition, there may be 
other rules in this title that relate to such wildlife, e.g., port-of-
entry requirements. It is not intended that the references in the 
``Special rules'' column list all the regulations of the two Services 
which might apply to the species or to the regulations of other Federal 
agencies or State or local governments.
    (g) The listing of a particular taxon includes all lower taxonomic 
units. For example, the genus Hylobates (gibbons) is listed as 
Endangered throughout its entire range (China, India, and SE Asia); 
consequently, all species, subspecies, and populations of that genus are 
considered listed as Endangered for the purposes of the Act. In 1978 (43 
FR 6230-6233) the species Haliaeetus leucocephalus (bald eagle) was 
listed as Threatened in ``USA (WA, OR, MN, WI, MI)'' rather than its 
entire population; thus, all individuals of the bald eagle found in 
those five States are considered listed as Threatened for the purposes 
of the Act.

printed volume and on GPO Access.


<R05>
Sec.  17.12  Endangered and threatened plants.

    (a) The list in this section contains the names of all species of 
plants which have been determined by the Services to be Endangered or 
Threatened. It also contains the names of species of plants treated as 
Endangered or Threatened because they are sufficiently similar in 
appearance to Endangered or Threatened species (see Sec.  17.50 et 
seq.).
    (b) The columns entitled ``Scientific name'' and ``Common name'' 
define the species of plant within the meaning of the Act. Although 
common names are included, they cannot be relied upon for identification 
of any specimen, since they may vary greatly in local usage. The 
Services shall use the most recently accepted scientific name. In cases 
in which confusion might arise, a synonym(s) will be provided in 
parentheses. The Services shall rely to the extent practicable on the 
International Code of Botanical Nomenclature.
    (c) In the ``Status'' column the following symbols are used: ``E'' 
for Endangered, ``T'' for Threatened, and ``E [or T] (S/A)'' for 
similarity of appearance species.
    (d) The other data in the list are nonregulatory in nature and are 
provided for the information of the reader. In the annual revision and 
compilation of this title, the following information may be amended 
without public notice: the spelling of species' names, historical range, 
footnotes, references to certain other applicable portions of this 
title, synonyms, and more current names. In any of these revised 
entries, neither the species, as defined in paragraph (b) of this 
section, nor its status may be changed without following the procedures 
of part 424 of this title.
    (e) The ``Historic range'' indicates the known general distribution 
of the species or subspecies as reported in the current scientific 
literature. The present distribution may be greatly reduced from this 
historic range. This column does not imply any limitation on the 
application of the prohibitions in the Act or implementing rules. Such 
prohibitions apply to all individuals of the plant species, wherever 
found.
    (f)(1) A footnote to the Federal Register publication(s) listing or 
reclassifying a species is indicated under the column ``When listed.'' 
Footnote numbers to Sec. Sec.  17.11 and 17.12 are in the same numerical 
sequence, since plants and animals may be listed in the same Federal 
Register document. That document, at least since 1973, includes a 
statement indicating the basis for the listing, as well as the effective 
date(s) of said listing.
    (2) The ``Special rules'' and ``Critical habitat'' columns provide a 
cross reference to other sections in parts 17, 222, 226, or 227. The 
``Special rules'' column will also be used to cite the special rules 
which describe experimental populations and determine if they are 
essential or nonessential. Separate listings will be made for 
experimental populations, and the status column will include the 
following symbols: ``XE'' for an essential experimental population and 
``XN'' for a nonessential experimental population. The term ``NA'' (not 
applicable) appearing in either of these two columns indicates that 
there are no special rules and/or critical habitat for that particular 
species. However, all other appropriate rules in parts 17, 217 through 
227, and 402 still apply to that species. In addition, there may be 
other rules in this title that relate to such plants, e.g., port-of-
entry requirements. It is not intended that the references in the 
``Special rules'' column list all the regulations of the two Services 
which might apply to the species or to the regulations of other Federal 
agencies or State or local governments.
    (g) The listing of a particular taxon includes all lower taxonomic 
units (see Sec.  17.11(g) for examples).
    (h) The ``List of Endangered and Threatened Plants'' is provided 
below:

<R04>
                      Subpart C_Endangered Wildlife


<R05>
Sec.  17.21  Prohibitions.

    (a) Except as provided in subpart A of this part, or under permits 
issued pursuant to Sec.  17.22 or Sec.  17.23, it is unlawful for any 
person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to commit, to 
attempt to commit, to solicit another to commit or to cause to be 
committed, any of the acts described in paragraphs (b) through (f) of 
this section in regard to any endangered wildlife.
    (b) Import or export. It is unlawful to import or to export any 
endangered wildlife. Any shipment in transit through the United States 
is an importation and an exportation, whether or not it has entered the 
country for customs purposes.
    (c) Take. (1) It is unlawful to take endangered wildlife within the 
United States, within the territorial sea of the United States, or upon 
the high seas. The high seas shall be all waters seaward of the 
territorial sea of the United States, except waters officially 
recognized by the United States as the territorial sea of another 
country, under international law.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, any person may 
take endangered wildlife in defense of his own life or the lives of 
others.
    (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, any employee 
or agent of the Service, any other Federal land management agency, the 
National Marine Fisheries Service, or a State conservation agency, who 
is designated by his agency for such purposes, may, when acting in the 
course of his official

[[Page 81]]

duties, take endangered wildlife without a permit if such action is 
necessary to:
    (i) Aid a sick, injured or orphaned specimen; or
    (ii) Dispose of a dead specimen; or
    (iii) Salvage a dead specimen which may be useful for scientific 
study; or
    (iv) Remove specimens which constitute a demonstrable but 
nonimmediate threat to human safety, provided that the taking is done in 
a humane manner; the taking may involve killing or injuring only if it 
has not been reasonably possible to eliminate such threat by live-
capturing and releasing the specimen unharmed, in a remote area.
    (4) Any taking under paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section must 
be reported in writing to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Office of 
Law Enforcement, 4401 North Fairfax Drive, LE-3000, Arlington, VA 22203, 
within five days. The specimen may only be retained, disposed of, or 
salvaged under directions from the Office of Law Enforcement.
    (5) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, any qualified 
employee or agent of a State Conservation Agency which is a party to a 
Cooperative Agreement with the Service in accordance with section 6(c) 
of the Act, who is designated by his agency for such purposes, may, when 
acting in the course of his official duties take those endangered 
species which are covered by an approved cooperative agreement for 
conservation programs in accordance with the Cooperative Agreement, 
provided that such taking is not reasonably anticipated to result in:
    (i) The death or permanent disabling of the specimen;
    (ii) The removal of the specimen from the State where the taking 
occurred;
    (iii) The introduction of the specimen so taken, or of any progeny 
derived from such a specimen, into an area beyond the historical range 
of the species; or
    (iv) The holding of the specimen in captivity for a period of more 
than 45 consecutive days.
    (d) Possession and other acts with unlawfully taken wildlife. (1) It 
is unlawful to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship, by any 
means whatsoever, any endangered wildlife which was taken in violation 
of paragraph (c) of this section.

    Example A person captures a whooping crane in Texas and gives it to 
a second person, who puts it in a closed van and drives thirty miles, to 
another location in Texas. The second person then gives the whooping 
crane to a third person, who is apprehended with the bird in his 
possession. All three have violated the law--the first by illegally 
taking the whooping crane; the second by transporting an illegally taken 
whooping crane; and the third by possessing an illegally taken whooping 
crane.

    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, Federal and 
State law enforcement officers may possess, deliver, carry, transport or 
ship any endangered wildlife taken in violation of the Act as necessary 
in performing their official duties.
    (e) Interstate or foreign commerce. It is unlawful to deliver, 
receive, carry transport, or ship in interstate or foreign commerce, by 
any means whatsoever, and in the course of a commercial activity, any 
endangered wildlife.
    (f) Sale or offer for sale. (1) It is unlawful to sell or to offer 
for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any endangered wildlife.
    (2) An advertisement for the sale of endangered wildlife which 
carries a warning to the effect that no sale may be consummated until a 
permit has been obtained from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service shall 
not be considered an offer for sale within the meaning of this section.
    (g) Captive-bred wildlife. (1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b), (c), 
(e) and (f) of this section, any person may take; export or re-import; 
deliver, receive, carry, transport or ship in interstate or foreign 
commerce, in the course of a commercial activity; or sell or offer for 
sale in interstate or foreign commerce any endangered wildlife that is 
bred in captivity in the United States provided either that the wildlife 
is of a taxon listed in paragraph (g)(6) of this section, or that the 
following conditions are met:
    (i) The wildlife is of a species having a natural geographic 
distribution not including any part of the United States, or the 
wildlife is of a species that the Director has determined to be

[[Page 82]]

eligible in accordance with paragraph (g)(5) of this section;
    (ii) The purpose of such activity is to enhance the propagation or 
survival of the affected species;
    (iii) Such activity does not involve interstate or foreign commerce, 
in the course of a commercial activity, with respect to non-living 
wildlife;
    (iv) Each specimen of wildlife to be re-imported is uniquely 
identified by a band, tattoo or other means that was reported in writing 
to an official of the Service at a port of export prior to export from 
the United States; and
    (v) Any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States who 
engages in any of the activities authorized by this paragraph does so in 
accordance with paragraphs (g) (2), (3) and (4) of this section, and 
with all other applicable regulations in this Subchapter B.
    (2) Any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States 
seeking to engage in any of the activities authorized by this paragraph 
must first register with the Service (Office of Management Authority, 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, 
Virginia 22203). Requests for registration must be submitted on an 
official application form (Form 3-200-41) provided by the Service, and 
must include the following information:
    (i) The types of wildlife sought to be covered by the registration, 
identified by common and scientific name to the taxonomic level of 
family, genus or species;
    (ii) A description of the applicant's experience in maintaining and 
propagating the types of wildlife sought to be covered by the 
registration, and when appropriate, in conducting research directly 
related to maintaining and propagating such wildlife;
    (iii) Photograph(s) or other evidence clearly depicting the 
facilities where such wildlife will be maintained; and
    (iv) a copy of the applicant's license or registration, if any, 
under the animal welfare regulations of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture (9 CFR part 2).
    (3) Upon receiving a complete application, the Director will decide 
whether or not the registration will be approved. In making this 
decision, the Director will consider, in addition to the general 
criteria in Sec.  13.21(b) of this subchapter, whether the expertise, 
facilities or other resources available to the applicant appear adequate 
to enhance the propagation or survival of the affected wildlife. Public 
education activities may not be the sole basis to justify issuance of a 
registration or to otherwise establish eligibility for the exception 
granted in paragraph (g)(1) of this section. Each person so registered 
must maintain accurate written records of activities conducted under the 
registration, and allow reasonable access to Service agents for 
inspection purposes as set forth in Sec. Sec.  13.46 and 13.47. Each 
person registered must submit to the Director an individual written 
annual report of activities, including all births, deaths and transfers 
of any type.
    (4) Any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States 
seeking to export or conduct foreign commerce in captive-bred endangered 
wildlife that will not remain under the care of that person must first 
obtain approval by providing written evidence to satisfy the Director 
that the proposed recipient of the wildlife has expertise, facilities or 
other resources adequate to enhance the propagation or survival of such 
wildlife and that the proposed recipient will use such wildlife for 
purposes of enhancing the propagation or survival of the affected 
species.
    (5)(i) The Director will use the following criteria to determine if 
wildlife of any species having a natural geographic distribution that 
includes any part of the United States is eligible for the provisions of 
this paragraph:
    (A) Whether there is a low demand for taking of the species from 
wild populations, either because of the success of captive breeding or 
because of other reasons, and
    (B) Whether the wild populations of the species are effectively 
protected from unauthorized taking as a result of the inaccessibility of 
their habitat to humans or as a result of the effectiveness of law 
enforcement.
    (ii) The Director will follow the procedures set forth in the Act 
and in the regulations thereunder with respect to petitions and 
notification of the public and governors of affected States when

[[Page 83]]

determining the eligibility of species for purposes of this paragraph.
    (iii) In accordance with the criteria in paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this 
section, the Director has determined the following species to be 
eligible for the provisions of this paragraph:

Laysan duck (Anas laysanensis).

    (6) Any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States 
seeking to engage in any of the activities authorized by paragraph 
(g)(1) of this section may do so without first registering with the 
Service with respect to the bar-tailed pheasant (Syrmaticus humiae), 
Elliot's pheasant (S. ellioti), Mikado pheasant (S. mikado), brown eared 
pheasant (Crossoptilon mantchuricum), white eared pheasant (C. 
crossoptilon), cheer pheasant (Catreus wallichii), Edward's pheasant 
(Lophura edwardsi), Swinhoe's pheasant (L. swinhoii), Chinese monal 
(Lophophorus lhuysii), and Palawan peacock pheasant (Polyplectron 
emphanum); parakeets of the species Neophema pulchella and N. splendida; 
the Laysan duck (Anas laysanensis); the white-winged wood duck (Cairina 
scutulata); and the inter-subspecific crossed or ``generic'' tiger 
(Panthera tigris) (i e., specimens not identified or identifiable as 
members of the Bengal, Sumatran, Siberian or Indochinese subspecies 
(Panthera tigris tigris, P.t. sumatrae, P.t. altaica and P.t. corbetti, 
respectively) provided:
    (i) The purpose of such activity is to enhance the propagation or

Sec.  17.22  Permits for scientific purposes, enhancement of propagation 
or survival, or for incidental taking.

    Upon receipt of a complete application, the Director may issue a 
permit authorizing any activity otherwise prohibited by Sec.  17.21, in 
accordance with the issuance criteria of this section, for scientific 
purposes, for enhancing the propagation or survival, or for the 
incidental taking of endangered wildlife. Such permits may authorize a 
single transaction, a series of transactions, or a number of activities 
over a specific period of time. (See Sec.  17.32 for permits for 
threatened species.) The Director shall publish notice in the Federal 
Register of each application for a permit that is made under this 
section. Each notice shall invite the submission from interested 
parties, within 30 days after the date of the notice, of written data, 
views, or arguments with respect to the application. The 30-day period 
may be waived by the Director in an emergency situation where the life 
or health of an endangered animal is threatened and no reasonable 
alternative is available to the applicant. Notice of any such waiver 
shall be published in the Federal Register within 10 days following 
issuance of the permit.
    (a)(1) Application requirements for permits for scientific purposes 
or for the enhancement of propagation or survival. A person wishing to 
get a permit for an activity prohibited by Sec.  17.21 submits an 
application for activities under this

[[Page 84]]

paragraph. The Service provides Form 3-200 for the application to which 
all of the following must be attained:
    (i) The common and scientific names of the species sought to the 
covered by the permit, as well as the number, age, and sex of such 
species, and the activity sought to be authorized (such as taking, 
exporting, selling in interstate commerce);
    (ii) A statement as to whether, at the time of application, the 
wildlife sought to be covered by the permit (A) is still in the wild, 
(B) has already been removed from the wild, or (C) was born in 
captivity;
    (iii) A resume of the applicant's attempts to obtain the wildlife 
sought to be covered by the permit in a manner which would not cause the 
death or removal from the wild of such wildlife;
    (iv) If the wildlife sought to be covered by the permit has already 
been removed from the wild, the country and place where such removal 
occurred; if the wildlife sought to be covered by the permit was born in 
captivity, the country and place where such wildlife was born;
    (v) A complete description and address of the institution or other 
facility where the wildlife sought to be covered by the permit will be 
used, displayed, or maintained;
    (vi) If the applicant seeks to have live wildlife covered by the 
permit, a complete description, including photographs or diagrams, of 
the facilities to house and/or care for the wildlife and a resume of the 
experience of those person who will be caring for the wildlife;
    (vii) A full statement of the reasons why the applicant is justified 
in obtaining a permit including the details of the activities sought to 
be authorized by the permit;
    (viii) If the application is for the purpose of enhancement of 
propagation, a statement of the applicant's willingness to participate 
in a cooperative breeding program and to maintain or contribute data to 
a studbook;
    (2) Issuance criteria. Upon receiving an application completed in 
accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Director will 
decide whether or not a permit should be issued. In making this 
decision, the Director shall consider, in addition to the general 
criteria in Sec.  13.21(b) of this subchapter, the following factors:
    (i) Whether the purpose for which the permit is required is adequate 
to justify removing from the wild or otherwise changing the status of 
the wildlife sought to be covered by the permit;
    (ii) The probable direct and indirect effect which issuing the 
permit would have on the wild populations of the wildlife sought to be 
covered by the permit;
    (iii) Whether the permit, if issued, would in any way, directly or 
indirectly, conflict with any known program intended to enhance the 
survival probabilities of the population from which the wildlife sought 
to be covered by the permit was or would be removed;
    (iv) Whether the purpose for which the permit is required would be 
likely to reduce the threat of extinction facing the species of wildlife 
sought to be covered by the permit;
    (v) The opinions or views of scientists or other persons or 
organizations having expertise concerning the wildlife or other matters 
germane to the application; and
    (vi) Whether the expertise, facilities, or other resources available 
to the applicant appear adequate to successfully accomplish the 
objectives stated in the application.
    (3) Permit conditions. In addition to the general conditions set 
forth in part 13 of this subchapter, every permit issued under this 
paragraph shall be subject to the special condition that the escape of 
living wildlife covered by the permit shall be immediately reported to 
the Service office designated in the permit.
    (4) Duration of permits. The duration of permits issued under this 
paragraph shall be designated on the face of the permit.
    (b)(1) Application requirements for permits for incidental taking. A 
person wishing to get a permit for an activity prohibited by Sec.  
17.21(c) submits an application for activities under this paragraph. The 
Service provides Form 3-200 for the application to which all of the 
following must be attached:
    (i) A complete description of the activity sought to be authorized;

[[Page 85]]

    (ii) The common and scientific names of the species sought to be 
covered by the permit, as well as the number, age, and sex of such 
species, if known;
    (iii) A conservation plan that specifies:
    (A) The impact that will likely result from such taking;
    (B) What steps the applicant will take to monitor, minimize, and 
mitigate such impacts, the funding that will be available to implement 
such steps, and the procedures to be used to deal with unforeseen 
circumstances;
    (C) What alternative actions to such taking the applicant considered 
and the reasons why such alternatives are not proposed to be utilized; 
and
    (D) Such other measures that the Director may require as being 
necessary or appropriate for purposes of the plan;
    (2) Issuance criteria. (i) Upon receiving an application completed 
in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Director will 
decide whether or not a permit should be issued. The Director shall 
consider the general issuance criteria in Sec.  13.21(b) of this 
subchapter, except for Sec.  13.21(b)(4), and shall issue the permit if 
he or she finds that:
    (A) The taking will be incidental;
    (B) The applicant will, to the maximum extent practicable, minimize 
and mitigate the impacts of such takings;
    (C) The applicant will ensure that adequate funding for the 
conservation plan and procedures to deal with unforeseen circumstances 
will be provided;
    (D) The taking will not appreciably reduce the likelihood of the 
survival and recovery of the species in the wild;
    (E) The measures, if any, required under paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(D) of 
this section will be met; and
    (F) He or she has received such other assurances as he or she may 
require that the plan will be implemented.
    (ii) In making his or her decision, the Director shall also consider 
the anticipated duration and geographic scope of the applicant's planned 
activities, including the amount of listed species habitat that is 
involved and the degree to which listed species and their habitats are 
affected.
    (3) Permit conditions. In addition to the general conditions set 
forth in part 13 of this subchapter, every permit issued under this 
paragraph shall contain such terms and conditions as the Director deems 
necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the permit and the 
conservation plan including, but not limited to, monitoring and 
reporting requirements deemed necessary for determining whether such 
terms and conditions are being complied with. The Director shall rely 
upon existing reporting requirements to the maximum extent practicable.
    (4) Duration of permits. The duration of permits issued under this 
paragraph shall be sufficient to provide adequate assurances to the 
permittee to commit funding necessary for the activities authorized by 
the permit, including conservation activities and land use restrictions. 
In determining the duration of a permit, the Director shall consider the 
duration of the planned activities, as well as the possible positive and 
negative effects associated with permits of the proposed duration on 
listed species, including the extent to which the conservation plan will 
enhance the habitat of listed species and increase the long-term 
survivability of such species.
    (5) Assurances provided to permittee in case of changed or 
unforeseen circumstances. The assurances in this paragraph (b)(5) apply 
only to incidental take permits issued in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section where the conservation plan is being properly 
implemented, and apply only with respect to species adequately covered 
by the conservation plan. These assurances cannot be provided to Federal 
agencies. This rule does not apply to incidental take permits issued 
prior to March 25, 1998. The assurances provided in incidental take 
permits issued prior to March 25, 1998 remain in effect, and those 
permits will not be revised as a result of this rulemaking.
    (i) Changed circumstances provided for in the plan. If additional 
conservation and mitigation measures are deemed necessary to respond to 
changed circumstances and were provided for in the plan's operating 
conservation program, the permittee will implement the measures 
specified in the plan.
    (ii) Changed circumstances not provided for in the plan. If 
additional conservation and mitigation measures are deemed necessary to 
respond to

[[Page 86]]

changed circumstances and such measures were not provided for in the 
plan's operating conservation program, the Director will not require any 
conservation and mitigation measures in addition to those provided for 
in the plan without the consent of the permittee, provided the plan is 
being properly implemented.
    (iii) Unforeseen circumstances. (A) In negotiating unforeseen 
circumstances, the Director will not require the commitment of 
additional land, water, or financial compensation or additional 
restrictions on the use of land, water, or other natural resources 
beyond the level otherwise agreed upon for the species covered by the 
conservation plan without the consent of the permittee.
    (B) If additional conservation and mitigation measures are deemed 
necessary to respond to unforeseen circumstances, the Director may 
require additional measures of the permittee where the conservation plan 
is being properly implemented, but only if such measures are limited to 
modifications within conserved habitat areas, if any, or to the 
conservation plan's operating conservation program for the affected 
species, and maintain the original terms of the conservation plan to the 
maximum extent possible. Additional conservation and mitigation measures 
will not involve the commitment of additional land, water or financial 
compensation or additional restrictions on the use of land, water, or 
other natural resources otherwise available for development or use under 
the original terms of the conservation plan without the consent of the 
permittee.
    (C) The Director will have the burden of demonstrating that 
unforeseen circumstances exist, using the best scientific and commercial 
data available. These findings must be clearly documented and based upon 
reliable technical information regarding the status and habitat 
requirements of the affected species. The Director will consider, but 
not be limited to, the following factors:
    (1) Size of the current range of the affected species;
    (2) Percentage of range adversely affected by the conservation plan;
    (3) Percentage of range conserved by the conservation plan;
    (4) Ecological significance of that portion of the range affected by 
the conservation plan;
    (5) Level of knowledge about the affected species and the degree of 
specificity of the species' conservation program under the conservation 
plan; and
    (6) Whether failure to adopt additional conservation measures would 
appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery of the 
affected species in the wild.
    (6) Nothing in this rule will be construed to limit or constrain the 
Director, any Federal, State, local, or Tribal government agency, or a 
private entity, from taking additional actions at its own expense to 
protect or conserve a species included in a conservation plan.
    (7) Discontinuance of permit activity. Notwithstanding the 
provisions of Sec.  13.26 of this subchapter, a permittee under this 
paragraph (b) remains responsible for any outstanding minimization and 
mitigation measures required under the terms of the permit for take that 
occurs prior to surrender of the permit and such minimization and 
mitigation measures as may be required pursuant to the termination 
provisions of an implementing agreement, habitat conservation plan, or 
permit even after surrendering the permit to the Service pursuant to 
Sec.  13.26 of this subchapter. The permit shall be deemed canceled only 
upon a determination by the Service that such minimization and 
mitigation measures have been implemented. Upon surrender of the permit, 
no further take shall be authorized under the terms of the surrendered 
permit.
    (8) Criteria for Revocation. A permit issued under this paragraph 
(b) may not be revoked for any reason except those set forth in Sec.  
13.28(a)(1) through (4) of this subchapter or unless continuation of the 
permitted activity would be inconsistent with the criterion set forth in 
16 U.S.C. 1539(a)(2)(B)(iv) and the inconsistency has not been remedied 
in a timely fashion.
    (c)(1) Application requirements for permits for the enhancement of 
survival through Safe Harbor Agreements. The applicant must submit an 
application for a permit under this paragraph (c) to

[[Page 87]]

the appropriate Regional Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, for 
the Region where the applicant resides or where the proposed activity is 
to occur (for appropriate addresses, see 50 CFR 10.22), if the applicant 
wishes to engage in any activity prohibited by Sec.  17.21. The 
applicant must submit an official Service application form (3-200.54) 
that includes the following information:
    (i) The common and scientific names of the listed species for which 
the applicant requests incidental take authorization;
    (ii) A description of the land use or water management activity for 
which the applicant requests incidental take authorization; and
    (iii) A Safe Harbor Agreement that complies with the requirements of 
the Safe Harbor policy available from the Service.
    (2) Issuance criteria. Upon receiving an application completed in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Director will 
decide whether or not to issue a permit. The Director shall consider the 
general issuance criteria in Sec.  13.21(b) of this subchapter, except 
for Sec.  13.21(b)(4), and may issue the permit if he or she finds:
    (i) The take will be incidental to an otherwise lawful activity and 
will be in accordance with the terms of the Safe Harbor Agreement;
    (ii) The implementation of the terms of the Safe Harbor Agreement 
will provide a net conservation benefit to the affected listed species 
by contributing to the recovery of listed species included in the permit 
and the Safe Harbor Agreement otherwise complies with the Safe Harbor 
policy available from the Service;
    (iii) The probable direct and indirect effects of any authorized 
take will not appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery 
in the wild of any listed species;
    (iv) Implementation of the terms of the Safe Harbor Agreement is 
consistent with applicable Federal, State, and Tribal laws and 
regulations;
    (v) Implementation of the terms of the Safe Harbor Agreement will 
not be in conflict with any ongoing conservation or recovery programs 
for listed species covered by the permit; and
    (vi) The applicant has shown capability for and commitment to 
implementing all of the terms of the Safe Harbor Agreement.
    (3) Permit conditions. In addition to any applicable general permit 
conditions set forth in part 13 of this subchapter, every permit issued 
under this paragraph (c) is subject to the following special conditions:
    (i) A requirement for the participating property owner to notify the 
Service of any transfer of lands subject to a Safe Harbor Agreement;
    (ii) A requirement for the property owner to notify the Service at 
least 30 days in advance, but preferably as far in advance as possible, 
of when he or she expects to incidentally take any listed species 
covered under the permit. Such notification will provide the Service 
with an opportunity to translocate affected individuals of the species, 
if possible and appropriate; and
    (iii) Any additional requirements or conditions the Director deems 
necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the permit and the 
Safe Harbor Agreement.
    (4) Permit effective date. Permits issued under this paragraph (c) 
become effective the day of issuance for species covered by the Safe 
Harbor Agreement.
    (5) Assurances provided to permittee. (i) The assurances in 
paragraph (c)(5) (ii) of this section (c)(5) apply only to Safe Harbor 
permits issued in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section where 
the Safe Harbor Agreement is being properly implemented, and apply only 
with respect to species covered by the Agreement and permit. These 
assurances cannot be provided to Federal agencies. The assurances 
provided in this section apply only to Safe Harbor permits issued after 
July 19, 1999.
    (ii) If additional conservation and mitigation measures are deemed 
necessary, the Director may require additional measures of the 
permittee, but only if such measures are limited to modifications within 
conserved habitat areas, if any, for the affected species and maintain 
the original terms of the Safe Harbor Agreement to the maximum extent 
possible. Additional conservation and mitigation measures will

[[Page 88]]

not involve the commitment of additional land, water or financial 
compensation or additional restrictions on the use of land, water, or 
other natural resources otherwise available for development or use under 
the original terms of the Safe Harbor Agreement without the consent of 
the permittee.
    (6) Additional actions. Nothing in this rule will be construed to 
limit or constrain the Director, any Federal, State, local or Tribal 
government agency, or a private entity, from taking additional actions 
at its own expense to protect or conserve a species included in a Safe 
Harbor Agreement.
    (7) Criteria for revocation. A permit issued under this paragraph 
(c) may not be revoked for any reason except those set forth in Sec.  
13.28(a) (1) through (4) of this subchapter or unless continuation of 
the permitted activity would be inconsistent with the criterion set 
forth in Sec.  17.22(c)(2)(iii) and the inconsistency has not been 
remedied in a timely fashion.
    (8) Duration of permits. The duration of permits issued under this 
paragraph (c) must be sufficient to provide a net conservation benefit 
to species covered in the enhancement of survival permit. In determining 
the duration of a permit, the Director will consider the duration of the 
planned activities, as well as the positive and negative effects 
associated with permits of the proposed duration on covered species, 
including the extent to which the conservation activities included in 
the Safe Harbor Agreement will enhance the survival and contribute to 
the recovery of listed species included in the permit.
    (d)(1) Application requirements for permits for the enhancement of 
survival through Candidate Conservation Agreements with Assurances. The 
applicant must submit an application for a permit under this paragraph 
(d) to the appropriate Regional Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, for the Region where the applicant resides or where the 
proposed activity is to occur (for appropriate addresses, see 50 CFR 
10.22). When a species covered by a Candidate Conservation Agreement 
with Assurances is listed as endangered and the applicant wishes to 
engage in activities identified in the Agreement and otherwise 
prohibited by Sec.  17.31, the applicant must apply for an enhancement 
of survival permit for species covered by the Agreement. The permit will 
become valid if and when covered proposed, candidate or other unlisted 
species is listed as an endangered species. The applicant must submit an 
official Service application form (3-200.54) that includes the following 
information:
    (i) The common and scientific names of the species for which the 
applicant requests incidental take authorization;
    (ii) A description of the land use or water management activity for 
which the applicant requests incidental take authorization; and
    (iii) A Candidate Conservation Agreement that complies with the 
requirements of the Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances 
policy available from the Service.
    (2) Issuance criteria. Upon receiving an application completed in 
accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Director will 
decide whether or not to issue a permit. The Director shall consider the 
general issuance criteria in Sec.  13.21(b) of this subchapter, except 
for Sec.  13.21(b)(4), and may issue the permit if he or she finds:
    (i) The take will be incidental to an otherwise lawful activity and 
will be in accordance with the terms of the Candidate Conservation 
Agreement;
    (ii) The Candidate Conservation Agreement complies with the 
requirements of the Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances 
policy available from the Service;
    (iii) The probable direct and indirect effects of any authorized 
take will not appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery 
in the wild of any species;
    (iv) Implementation of the terms of the Candidate Conservation 
Agreement is consistent with applicable Federal, State, and Tribal laws 
and regulations;
    (v) Implementation of the terms of the Candidate Conservation 
Agreement will not be in conflict with any ongoing conservation programs 
for species covered by the permit; and
    (vi) The applicant has shown capability for and commitment to 
implementing all of the terms of the Candidate Conservation Agreement.

[[Page 89]]

    (3) Permit conditions. In addition to any applicable general permit 
conditions set forth in part 13 of this subchapter, every permit issued 
under this paragraph (d) is subject to the following special conditions:
    (i) A requirement for the property owner to notify the Service of 
any transfer of lands subject to a Candidate Conservation Agreement;
    (ii) A requirement for the property owner to notify the Service at 
least 30 days in advance, but preferably as far in advance as possible, 
of when he or she expects to incidentally take any species covered under 
the permit. Such notification will provide the Service with an 
opportunity to translocate affected individuals of the species, if 
possible and appropriate; and
    (iii) Any additional requirements or conditions the Director deems 
necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the permit and the 
Candidate Conservation Agreement.
    (4) Permit effective date. Permits issued under this paragraph (d) 
become effective for a species covered by a Candidate Conservation 
Agreement on the effective date of a final rule that lists a covered 
species as endangered.
    (5) Assurances provided to permittee in case of changed or 
unforeseen circumstances. The assurances in this paragraph (d)(5) apply 
only to permits issued in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) where the 
Candidate Conservation with Assurances Agreement is being properly 
implemented, and apply only with respect to species adequately covered 
by the Candidate Conservation with Assurances Agreement. These 
assurances cannot be provided to Federal agencies.
    (i) Changed circumstances provided for in the Agreement. If 
additional conservation and mitigation measures are deemed necessary to 
respond to changed circumstances and were provided for in the 
Agreement's operating conservation program, the permittee will implement 
the measures specified in the Agreement.
    (ii) Changed circumstances not provided for in the Agreement. If 
additional conservation and mitigation measures are deemed necessary to 
respond to changed circumstances and such measures were not provided for 
in the Agreement's operating conservation program, the Director will not 
require any conservation and mitigation measures in addition to those 
provided for in the Agreement without the consent of the permittee, 
provided the Agreement is being properly implemented.
    (iii) Unforeseen circumstances. (A) In negotiating unforeseen 
circumstances, the Director will not require the commitment of 
additional land, water, or financial compensation or additional 
restrictions on the use of land, water, or other natural resources 
beyond the level otherwise agreed upon for the species covered by the 
Agreement without the consent of the permittee.
    (B) If additional conservation and mitigation measures are deemed 
necessary to respond to unforeseen circumstances, the Director may 
require additional measures of the permittee where the Agreement is 
being properly implemented, but only if such measures are limited to 
modifications within conserved habitat areas, if any, or to the 
Agreement's operating conservation program for the affected species, and 
maintain the original terms of the Agreement to the maximum extent 
possible. Additional conservation and mitigation measures will not 
involve the commitment of additional land, water or financial 
compensation or additional restrictions on the use of land, water, or 
other natural resources otherwise available for development or use under 
the original terms of the Agreement without the consent of the 
permittee.
    (C) The Director will have the burden of demonstrating that 
unforeseen circumstances exist, using the best scientific and commercial 
data available. These findings must be clearly documented and based upon 
reliable technical information regarding the status and habitat 
requirements of the affected species. The Director will consider, but 
not be limited to, the following factors:
    (1) Size of the current range of the affected species;
    (2) Percentage of range adversely affected by the Agreement;
    (3) Percentage of range conserved by the Agreement;

[[Page 90]]

    (4) Ecological significance of that portion of the range affected by 
the Agreement;
    (5) Level of knowledge about the affected species and the degree of 
specificity of the species' conservation program under the Agreement; 
and
    (6) Whether failure to adopt additional conservation measures would 
appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery of the 
affected species in the wild.
    (6) Additional actions. Nothing in this rule will be construed to 
limit or constrain the Director, any Federal, State, local or Tribal 
government agency, or a private entity, from taking additional actions 
at its own expense to protect or conserve a species included in a 
Candidate Conservation with Assurances Agreement.
    (7) Criteria for revocation. A permit issued under this paragraph 
(d) may not be revoked for any reason except those set forth in Sec.  
13.28(a)(1) through (4) of this subchapter or unless continuation of the 
permitted activity would be inconsistent with the criterion set forth in 
paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section and the inconsistency has not been 
remedied in a timely fashion.
    (8) Duration of the Candidate Conservation Agreement. The duration 
of a Candidate Conservation Agreement covered by a permit issued under 
this paragraph (d) must be sufficient to enable the Director to 
determine that the benefits of the conservation measures in the 
Agreement, when combined with those benefits that would be achieved if 
it is assumed that the conservation measures would also be implemented 
on other necessary properties, would preclude or remove any need to list 
the species covered by the Agreement.
    (e) Objection to permit issuance. (1) In regard to any notice of a 
permit application published in the Federal Register, any interested 
party that objects to the issuance of a permit, in whole or in part, 
may, during the comment period specified in the notice, request 
notification of the final action to be taken on the application. A 
separate written request shall be made for each permit application. Such 
a request shall specify the Service's permit application number and 
state the reasons why that party believes the applicant does not meet 
the issuance criteria contained in Sec. Sec.  13.21 and 17.22 of this 
subchapter or other reasons why the permit should not be issued.
    (2) If the Service decides to issue a permit contrary to objections 
received pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, then the Service 
shall, at least ten days prior to issuance of the permit, make 
reasonable efforts to contact by telephone or other expedient means, any 
party who has made a request pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section and inform that party of the issuance of the permit. However, 
the Service may reduce the time period or dispense with such notice if 
it determines that time is of the essence and that delay in issuance of 
the permit would: (i) Harm the specimen or population involved; or (ii) 
unduly hinder the actions authorized under the permit.
    (3) The Service will notify any party filing an objection and 
request for notice under paragraph (c)(1) of this section of the final 
action taken on the application, in writing. If the Service has reduced 
or dispensed with the notice period referred to in paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section, it will include its reasons therefore in such written 
notice.

Sec.  17.23  Economic hardship permits.

    Upon receipt of a complete application, the Director may issue a 
permit authorizing any activity otherwise prohibited by Sec.  17.21, in 
accordance with the issuance criteria of this section in order to 
prevent undue economic hardship. The Director shall publish notice in 
the Federal Register of each application for a permit that is made under 
this section. Each notice shall invite the submission from interested 
parties, within 30 days after the date of the notice, of written data, 
views, or arguments with respect to the application. The 30-day period 
may be waived by the Director in an emergency situation where the life 
or health of an endangered animal is threatened and no reasonable 
alternative is available to the

[[Page 91]]

applicant. Notice of any such waiver shall be published in the Federal 
Register within 10 days following issuance of the permit.
    (a) Application requirements. Applications for permits under this 
section must be submitted to the Director by the person allegedly 
suffering undue economic hardship because his desired activity is 
prohibited by Sec.  17.21. Each application must be submitted on an 
official application form (Form 3-200) provided by the Service, and must 
include, as an attachment, all of the information required in Sec.  
17.22 plus the following additional information:
    (1) The possible legal, economic or subsistence alternatives to the 
activity sought to be authorized by the permit;
    (2) A full statement, accompanied by copies of all relevant 
contracts and correspondence, showing the appli- cant's involvement with 
the wildlife sought to be covered by the permit (as well as his 
involvement with similar wildlife), including, where applicable, that 
portion of applicant's income derived from the taking of such wildlife, 
or the subsistence use of such wildlife, during the calendar year 
immediately preceding either the notice in the Federal Register of 
review of the status of the species or of the proposal to list such 
wildlife as endangered, whichever is earliest;
    (3) Where applicable, proof of a contract or other binding legal 
obligation which:
    (i) Deals specifically with the wildlife sought to be covered by the 
permit;
    (ii) Became binding prior to the date when the notice of a review of 
the status of the species or the notice of proposed rulemaking proposing 
to list such wildlife as endangered was published in the Federal 
Register, whichever is earlier; and
    (iii) Will cause monetary loss of a given dollar amount if the 
permit sought under this section is not granted.
    (b) Issuance criteria. Upon receiving an application completed in 
accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the Director will decide 
whether or not a permit should be issued under any of the three 
categories of economic hardship, as defined in section 10(b)(2) of the 
Act. In making his decisions, the Director shall consider, in addition 
to the general criteria in Sec.  13.21(b) of this subchapter, the 
following factors:
    (1) Whether the purpose for which the permit is being requested is 
adequate to justify removing from the wild or otherwise changing the 
status of the wildlife sought to be covered by the permit;
    (2) The probable direct and indirect effect which issuing the permit 
would have on the wild populations of the wildlife sought to be covered 
by the permit;
    (3) The economic, legal, subsistence, or other alternatives or 
relief available to the applicant;
    (4) The amount of evidence that the applicant was in fact party to a 
contract or other binding legal obligation which;
    (i) Deals specifically with the wildlife sought to be covered by the 
permit; and
    (ii) Became binding prior to the date when the notice of a review of 
the status of the species or the notice of proposed rulemaking proposing 
to list such wildlife as endangered was published in the Federal 
Register, whichever is earlier.
    (5) The severity of economic hardship which the contract or other 
binding legal obligation referred to in paragraph (b)(4) of this section 
would cause if the permit were denied;
    (6) Where applicable, the portion of the applicant's income which 
would be lost if the permit were denied, and the relationship of that 
portion to the balance of his income;
    (7) Where applicable, the nature and extent of subsistence taking 
generally by the applicant; and
    (8) The likelihood that applicant can reasonably carry out his 
desired activity within one year from the date a notice is published in 
the Federal Register to review status of such wildlife, or to list such 
wildlife as endangered, whichever is earlier.
    (c) Permit conditions. In addition to the general conditions set 
forth in part 13 of this subchapter, every permit issued under this 
section shall be subject to the following special conditions:
    (1) In addition to any reporting requirements contained in the 
permit itself, the permittee shall also submit

[[Page 92]]

to the Director a written report of his activities pursuant to the 
permit. Such report must be postmarked or actually delivered no later 
than 10 days after completion of the activity.
    (2) The death or escape of all living wildlife covered by the permit 
shall be immediately reported to the Service's office designated in the 
permit.
    (d) Duration of permits issued under this section shall be 
designated on the face of the permit. No permit issued under this 
section, however, shall be valid for more than one year from the date a 
notice is published in the Federal Register to review status of such 
wildlife, or to list such wildlife as endangered, whichever is earlier.

Sec.  17.32  Permits--general.

    Upon receipt of a complete application the Director may issue a 
permit for any activity otherwise prohibited with regard to threatened 
wildlife. Such permit shall be governed by the provisions of this 
section unless a special rule applicable to the wildlife, appearing in 
Sec. Sec.  17.40 to 17.48, of this part provides otherwise. Permits 
issued under this section must be for one of the following purposes: 
Scientific purposes, or the enhancement of propagation or survival, or 
economic hardship, or zoological exhibition, or educational purposes, or 
incidental taking, or special purposes consistent with the purposes of 
the Act. Such permits may authorize a single transaction, a series of 
transactions, or a number of activities over a specific period of time.
    (a)(1) Application requirements for permits for scientific purposes, 
or the enhancement of propagation or survival, or economic hardship, or 
zoological exhibition, or educational purposes, or special purposes 
consistent with the purposes of the Act. A person wishing to get a 
permit for an activity prohibited by Sec.  17.31 submits an application 
for activities under this paragraph. The Service provides Form 3-200 for 
the application to which as much of the following information relating 
to the purpose of the permit must be attached:
    (i) The Common and scientific names of the species sought to be 
covered by the permit, as well as the number, age, and sex of such 
species, and the activity sought to be authorized (such as taking, 
exporting, selling in interstate commerce);
    (ii) A statement as to whether, at the time of application, the 
wildlife sought to be covered by the permit (A) is still in the wild, 
(B) has already been removed from the wild, or (C) was born in 
captivity;
    (iii) A resume of the applicant's attempts to obtain the wildlife 
sought to be covered by the permit in a manner which would not cause the 
death or removal from the wild of such wildlife;
    (iv) If the wildlife sought to be covered by the permit has already 
been removed from the wild, the country and place where such removal 
occurred; if the wildlife sought to be covered by permit was born in 
captivity, the country and place where such wildlife was born;

[[Page 93]]

    (v) A complete description and address of the institution or other 
facility where the wildlife sought to be covered by the permit will be 
used, displayed, or maintained;
    (vi) If the applicant seeks to have live wildlife covered by the 
permit, a complete description, including photographs or diagrams, of 
the facilities to house and/or care for the wildlife and a resume of the 
experience of those persons who will be caring for the wildlife;
    (vii) A full statement of the reasons why the applicant is justified 
in obtaining a permit including the details of the activities sought to 
be authorized by the permit;
    (viii) If the application is for the purpose of enhancement of 
propagation, a statement of the applicant's willingness to participate 
in a cooperative breeding program and to maintain or contribute data to 
a studbook;
    (2) Issuance criteria. Upon receiving an application completed in 
accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Director will 
decide whether or not a permit should be issued. In making this 
decision, the Director shall consider, in addition to the general 
criteria in Sec.  13.21(b) of this subchapter, the following factors:
    (i) Whether the purpose for which the permit is required is adequate 
to justify removing from the wild or otherwise changing the status of 
the wildlife sought to be covered by the permit;
    (ii) The probable direct and indirect effect which issuing the 
permit would have on the wild populations of the wildlife sought to be 
covered by the permit;
    (iii) Whether the permit, if issued, would in any way, directly or 
indirectly, conflict with any known program intended to enhance the 
survival probabilities of the population from which the wildlife sought 
to be covered by the permit was or would be removed;
    (iv) Whether the purpose for which the permit is required would be 
likely to reduce the threat of extinction facing the species of wildlife 
sought to be covered by the permit;
    (v) The opinions or views of scientists or other persons or 
organizations having expertise concerning the wildlife or other matters 
germane to the application; and
    (vi) Whether the expertise, facilities, or other resources available 
to the applicant appear adequate to successfully accomplish the 
objectives stated in the application.
    (3) Permit conditions. In addition to the general conditions set 
forth in part 13 of this subchapter, every permit issued under this 
paragraph shall be subject to the special condition that the escape of 
living wildlife covered by the permit shall be immediately reported to 
the Service office designated in the permit.
    (4) Duration of permits. The duration of permits issued under this 
paragraph shall be designated on the face of the permit.
    (b)(1) Application requirements for permits for incidental taking. 
(i) A person wishing to get a permit for an activity prohibited by Sec.  
17.31 submits an application for activities under this paragraph.
    (ii) The director shall publish notice in the Federal Register of 
each application for a permit that is made under this section. Each 
notice shall invite the submission from interested parties, within 30 
days after the date of the notice, of written data, views, or arguments 
with respect to the application.
    (iii) Each application must be submitted on an official application 
(Form 3-200) provided by the Service, and must include as an attachment, 
all of the following information:
    (A) A complete description of the activity sought to be authorized;
    (B) The common and scientific names of the species sought to be 
covered by the permit, as well as the number, age, and sex of such 
species, if known;
    (C) A conservation plan that specifies:
    (1) The impact that will likely result from such taking;
    (2) What steps the applicant will take to monitor, minimize, and 
mitigate such impacts, the funding that will be available to implement 
such steps, and the procedures to be used to deal with unforeseen 
circumstances;
    (3) What alternative actions to such taking the applicant considered 
and the reasons why such alternatives are not proposed to be utilized; 
and

[[Page 94]]

    (4) Such other measures that the Director may require as being 
necessary or appropriate for purposes of the plan.
    (2) Issuance criteria. (i) Upon receiving an application completed 
in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Director will 
decide whether or not a permit should be issued. The Director shall 
consider the general issuance criteria in 13.21(b) of this subchapter, 
except for 13.21(b)(4), and shall issue the permit if he or she finds 
that:
    (A) The taking will be incidental;
    (B) The applicant will, to the maximum extent practicable, minimize 
and mitigate the impacts of such takings;
    (C) The applicant will ensure that adequate funding for the 
conservation plan and procedures to deal with unforeseen circumstances 
will be provided;
    (D) The taking will not appreciably reduce the likelihood of the 
survival and recovery of the species in the wild;
    (E) The measures, if any, required under paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(D) of 
this section will be met; and
    (F) He or she has received such other assurances as he or she may 
require that the plan will be implemented.
    (ii) In making his or her decision, the Director shall also consider 
the anticipated duration and geographic scope of the applicant's planned 
activities, including the amount of listed species habitat that is 
involved and the degree to which listed species and their habitats are 
affected.
    (3) Permit conditions. In addition to the general conditions set 
forth in part 13 of this subchapter, every permit issued under this 
paragraph shall contain such terms and conditions as the Director deems 
necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the permit and the 
conservation plan including, but not limited to, monitoring and 
reporting requirements deemed necessary for determining whether such 
terms and conditions are being complied with. The Director shall rely 
upon existing reporting requirements to the maximum extent practicable.
    (4) Duration of permits. The duration of permits issued under this 
paragraph shall be sufficient to provide adequate assurances to the 
permittee to commit funding necessary for the activities authorized by 
the permit, including conservation activities and land use restrictions. 
In determining the duration of a permit, the Director shall consider the 
duration of the planned activities, as well as the possible positive and 
negative effects associated with permits of the proposed duration on 
listed species, including the extent to which the conservation plan will 
enhance the habitat of listed species and increase the long-term 
survivability of such species.
    (5) Assurances provided to permittee in case of changed or 
unforeseen circumstances. The assurances in this paragraph (b)(5) apply 
only to incidental take permits issued in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section where the conservation plan is being properly 
implemented, and apply only with respect to species adequately covered 
by the conservation plan. These assurances cannot be provided to Federal 
agencies. This rule does not apply to incidental take permits issued 
prior to March 25, 1998. The assurances provided in incidental take 
permits issued prior to March 25, 1998 remain in effect, and those 
permits will not be revised as a result of this rulemaking.
    (i) Changed circumstances provided for in the plan. If additional 
conservation and mitigation measures are deemed necessary to respond to 
changed circumstances and were provided for in the plan's operating 
conservation program, the permittee will implement the measures 
specified in the plan.
    (ii) Changed circumstances not provided for in the plan. If 
additional conservation and mitigation measures are deemed necessary to 
respond to changed circumstances and such measures were not provided for 
in the plan's operating conservation program, the Director will not 
require any conservation and mitigation measures in addition to those 
provided for in the plan without the consent of the permittee, provided 
the plan is being properly implemented.
    (iii) Unforeseen circumstances. (A) In negotiating unforeseen 
circumstances, the Director will not require the commitment of 
additional land, water, or financial compensation or additional 
restrictions on the use of land, water, or other natural resources 
beyond the

[[Page 95]]

level otherwise agreed upon for the species covered by the conservation 
plan without the consent of the permittee.
    (B) If additional conservation and mitigation measures are deemed 
necessary to respond to unforeseen circumstances, the Director may 
require additional measures of the permittee where the conservation plan 
is being properly implemented, but only if such measures are limited to 
modifications within conserved habitat areas, if any, or to the 
conservation plan's operating conservation program for the affected 
species, and maintain the original terms of the conservation plan to the 
maximum extent possible. Additional conservation and mitigation measures 
will not involve the commitment of additional land, water or financial 
compensation or additional restrictions on the use of land, water, or 
other natural resources otherwise available for development or use under 
the original terms of the conservation plan without the consent of the 
permittee.
    (C) The Director will have the burden of demonstrating that such 
unforeseen circumstances exist, using the best scientific and commercial 
data available. These findings must be clearly documented and based upon 
reliable technical information regarding the status and habitat 
requirements of the affected species. The Director will consider, but 
not be limited to, the following factors:
    (1) Size of the current range of the affected species;
    (2) Percentage of range adversely affected by the conservation plan;
    (3) Percentage of range conserved by the conservation plan;
    (4) Ecological significance of that portion of the range affected by 
the conservation plan;
    (5) Level of knowledge about the affected species and the degree of 
specificity of the species' conservation program under the conservation 
plan; and
    (6) Whether failure to adopt additional conservation measures would 
appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery of the 
affected species in the wild.
    (6) Nothing in this rule will be construed to limit or constrain the 
Director, any Federal, State, local, or Tribal government agency, or a 
private entity, from taking additional actions at its own expense to 
protect or conserve a species included in a conservation plan.
    (7) Discontinuance of permit activity. Notwithstanding the 
provisions of Sec.  13.26 of this subchapter, a permittee under this 
paragraph (b) remains responsible for any outstanding minimization and 
mitigation measures required under the terms of the permit for take that 
occurs prior to surrender of the permit and such minimization and 
mitigation measures as may be required pursuant to the termination 
provisions of an implementing agreement, habitat conservation plan, or 
permit even after surrendering the permit to the Service pursuant to 
Sec.  13.26 of this subchapter. The permit shall be deemed canceled only 
upon a determination by the Service that such minimization and 
mitigation measures have been implemented. Upon surrender of the permit, 
no further take shall be authorized under the terms of the surrendered 
permit.
    (8) Criteria for revocation. A permit issued under this paragraph 
(b) may not be revoked for any reason except those set forth in Sec.  
13.28(a)(1) through (4) of this subchapter or unless continuation of the 
permitted activity would be inconsistent with the criterion set forth in 
16 U.S.C. 1539(a)(2)(B)(iv) and the inconsistency has not been remedied 
in a timely fashion.
    (c)(1) Application requirements for permits for the enhancement of 
survival through Safe Harbor Agreements. The applicant must submit an 
application for a permit under this paragraph (c) to the appropriate 
Regional Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, for the Region where 
the applicant resides or where the proposed action is to occur (for 
appropriate addresses, see 50 CFR 10.22), if the applicant wishes to 
engage in any activity prohibited by Sec.  17.31. The applicant must 
submit an official Service application form (3-200.54) that includes the 
following information:
    (i) The common and scientific names of the listed species for which 
the applicant requests incidental take authorization;
    (ii) A description of the land use or water management activity for 
which

[[Page 96]]

the applicant requests incidental take authorization;
    (iii) A Safe Harbor Agreement that complies with the requirements of 
the Safe Harbor policy available from the Service; and
    (iv) The Director must publish notice in the Federal Register of 
each application for a permit that is made under this paragraph (c). 
Each notice must invite the submission from interested parties within 30 
days after the date of the notice of written data, views, or arguments 
with respect to the application. The procedures included in Sec.  
17.22(e) for permit objection apply to any notice published by the 
Director under this paragraph (c).
    (2) Issuance criteria. Upon receiving an application completed in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Director will 
decide whether or not to issue a permit. The Director shall consider the 
general issuance criteria in Sec.  13.21(b) of this subchapter, except 
for Sec.  13.21(b)(4), and may issue the permit if he or she finds:
    (i) The take will be incidental to an otherwise lawful activity and 
will be in accordance with the terms of the Safe Harbor Agreement;
    (ii) The implementation of the terms of the Safe Harbor Agreement 
will provide a net conservation benefit to the affected listed species 
by contributing to the recovery of listed species included in the permit 
and the Safe Harbor Agreement otherwise complies with the Safe Harbor 
policy available from the Service;
    (iii) The probable direct and indirect effects of any authorized 
take will not appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery 
in the wild of any listed species;
    (iv) Implementation of the terms of the Safe Harbor Agreement is 
consistent with applicable Federal, State, and Tribal laws and 
regulations;
    (v) Implementation of the terms of the Safe Harbor Agreement will 
not be in conflict with any ongoing conservation or recovery programs 
for listed species covered by the permit; and
    (vi) The applicant has shown capability for and commitment to 
implementing all of the terms of the Safe Harbor Agreement.
    (3) Permit conditions. In addition to any applicable general permit 
conditions set forth in part 13 of this subchapter, every permit issued 
under this paragraph (c) is subject to the following special conditions:
    (i) A requirement for the participating property owner to notify the 
Service of any transfer of lands subject to a Safe Harbor Agreement;
    (ii) A requirement for the property owner to notify the Service at 
least 30 days in advance, but preferably as far in advance as possible, 
of when he or she expects to incidentally take any listed species 
covered under the permit. Such notification will provide the Service 
with an opportunity to translocate affected individuals of the species, 
if possible and appropriate; and
    (iii) Any additional requirements or conditions the Director deems 
necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the permit and the 
Safe Harbor Agreement.
    (4) Permit effective date. Permits issued under this paragraph (c) 
become effective the day of issuance for species covered by the Safe 
Harbor Agreement.
    (5) Assurances provided to permittee. (i) The assurances in 
subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph (c)(5) apply only to Safe Harbor 
permits issued in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section where 
the Safe Harbor Agreement is being properly implemented, and apply only 
with respect to species covered by the Agreement and permit. These 
assurances cannot be provided to Federal agencies. The assurances 
provided in this section apply only to Safe Harbor permits issued after 
July 19, 1999.
    (ii) If additional conservation and mitigation measures are deemed 
necessary, the Director may require additional measures of the 
permittee, but only if such measures are limited to modifications within 
conserved habitat areas, if any, for the affected species and maintain 
the original terms of the Safe Harbor Agreement to the maximum extent 
possible. Additional conservation and mitigation measures will not 
involve the commitment of additional land, water or financial 
compensation or additional restrictions on the use of land, water, or 
other natural resources otherwise available for development or use under 
the original terms

[[Page 97]]

of the Safe Harbor Agreement without the consent of the permittee.
    (6) Additional actions. Nothing in this rule will be construed to 
limit or constrain the Director, any Federal, State, local or Tribal 
government agency, or a private entity, from taking additional actions 
at its own expense to protect or conserve a species included in a Safe 
Harbor Agreement.
    (7) Criteria for revocation. A permit issued under this paragraph 
(c) may not be revoked for any reason except those set forth in Sec.  
13.28(a)(1) through (4) of this subchapter or unless continuation of the 
permitted activity would be inconsistent with the criterion set forth in 
17.22(c)(2)(iii) and the inconsistency has not been remedied in a timely 
fashion.
    (8) Duration of permits. The duration of permits issued under this 
paragraph (c) must be sufficient to provide a net conservation benefit 
to species covered in the enhancement of survival permit. In determining 
the duration of a permit, the Director will consider the duration of the 
planned activities, as well as the positive and negative effects 
associated with permits of the proposed duration on covered species, 
including the extent to which the conservation activities included in 
the Safe Harbor Agreement will enhance the survival and contribute to 
the recovery of listed species included in the permit.
    (d)(1) Application requirements for permits for the enhancement of 
survival through Candidate Conservation Agreements with Assurances. The 
applicant must submit an application for a permit under this paragraph 
(d) to the appropriate Regional Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, for the Region where the applicant resides or where the 
proposed activity is to occur (for appropriate addresses, see 50 CFR 
10.22). When a species covered by a Candidate Conservation Agreement 
with Assurances is listed as threatened and the applicant wishes to 
engage in activities identified in the Agreement and otherwise 
prohibited by Sec.  17.31, the applicant must apply for an enhancement 
of survival permit for species covered by the Agreement. The permit will 
become valid if and when covered proposed, candidate or other unlisted 
species is listed as a threatened species. The applicant must submit an 
official Service application form (3-200.54) that includes the following 
information:
    (i) The common and scientific names of the species for which the 
applicant requests incidental take authorization;
    (ii) A description of the land use or water management activity for 
which the applicant requests incidental take authorization; and
    (iii) A Candidate Conservation Agreement that complies with the 
requirements of the Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances 
policy available from the Service.
    (iv) The Director must publish notice in the Federal Register of 
each application for a permit that is made under this paragraph (d). 
Each notice must invite the submission from interested parties within 30 
days after the date of the notice of written data, views, or arguments 
with respect to the application. The procedures included in Sec.  
17.22(e) for permit objection apply to any notice published by the 
Director under this paragraph (d).
    (2) Issuance criteria. Upon receiving an application completed in 
accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Director will 
decide whether or not to issue a permit. The Director shall consider the 
general issuance criteria in Sec.  13.21(b) of this subchapter, except 
for Sec.  13.21(b)(4), and may issue the permit if he or she finds:
    (i) The take will be incidental to an otherwise lawful activity and 
will be in accordance with the terms of the Candidate Conservation 
Agreement;
    (ii) The Candidate Conservation Agreement complies with the 
requirements of the Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances 
policy available from the Service;
    (iii) The probable direct and indirect effects of any authorized 
take will not appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery 
in the wild of any species;
    (iv) Implementation of the terms of the Candidate Conservation 
Agreement is consistent with applicable Federal, State, and Tribal laws 
and regulations;
    (v) Implementation of the terms of the Candidate Conservation 
Agreement will not be in conflict with any ongoing

[[Page 98]]

conservation programs for species covered by the permit; and
    (vi) The applicant has shown capability for and commitment to 
implementing all of the terms of the Candidate Conservation Agreement.
    (3) Permit conditions. In addition to any applicable general permit 
conditions set forth in part 13 of this subchapter, every permit issued 
under this paragraph (d) is subject to the following special conditions:
    (i) A requirement for the property owner to notify the Service of 
any transfer of lands subject to a Candidate Conservation Agreement;
    (ii) A requirement for the property owner to notify the Service at 
least 30 days in advance, but preferably as far in advance as possible, 
of when he or she expects to incidentally take any species covered under 
the permit. Such notification will provide the Service with an 
opportunity to translocate affected individuals of the species, if 
possible and appropriate; and
    (iii) Any additional requirements or conditions the Director deems 
necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the permit and the 
Candidate Conservation Agreement.
    (4) Permit effective date. Permits issued under this paragraph (d) 
become effective for a species covered by a Candidate Conservation 
Agreement on the effective date of a final rule that lists a covered 
species as threatened.
    (5) Assurances provided to permittee in case of changed or 
unforeseen circumstances. The assurances in this paragraph (d)(5) apply 
only to permits issued in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) where the 
Candidate Conservation with Assurances Agreement is being properly 
implemented, and apply only with respect to species adequately covered 
by the Candidate Conservation with Assurances Agreement. These 
assurances cannot be provided to Federal agencies.
    (i) Changed circumstances provided for in the Agreement. If 
additional conservation and mitigation measures are deemed necessary to 
respond to changed circumstances and were provided for in the 
Agreement's operating conservation program, the permittee will implement 
the measures specified in the Agreement.
    (ii) Changed circumstances not provided for in the Agreement. If 
additional conservation and mitigation measures are deemed necessary to 
respond to changed circumstances and such measures were not provided for 
in the Agreement's operating conservation program, the Director will not 
require any conservation and mitigation measures in addition to those 
provided for in the Agreement without the consent of the permittee, 
provided the Agreement is being properly implemented.
    (iii) Unforeseen circumstances. (A) In negotiating unforeseen 
circumstances, the Director will not require the commitment of 
additional land, water, or financial compensation or additional 
restrictions on the use of land, water, or other natural resources 
beyond the level otherwise agreed upon for the species covered by the 
Agreement without the consent of the permittee.
    (B) If additional conservation and mitigation measures are deemed 
necessary to respond to unforeseen circumstances, the Director may 
require additional measures of the permittee where the Agreement is 
being properly implemented, but only if such measures are limited to 
modifications within conserved habitat areas, if any, or to the 
Agreement's operating conservation program for the affected species, and 
maintain the original terms of the Agreement to the maximum extent 
possible. Additional conservation and mitigation measures will not 
involve the commitment of additional land, water or financial 
compensation or additional restrictions on the use of land, water, or 
other natural resources otherwise available for development or use under 
the original terms of the Agreement without the consent of the 
permittee.
    (C) The Director will have the burden of demonstrating that 
unforeseen circumstances exist, using the best scientific and commercial 
data available. These findings must be clearly documented and based upon 
reliable technical information regarding the status and habitat 
requirements of the affected species. The Director will consider, but 
not be limited to, the following factors:
    (1) Size of the current range of the affected species;

[[Page 99]]

    (2) Percentage of range adversely affected by the Agreement;
    (3) Percentage of range conserved by the Agreement;
    (4) Ecological significance of that portion of the range affected by 
the Agreement;
    (5) Level of knowledge about the affected species and the degree of 
specificity of the species' conservation program under the Agreement; 
and
    (6) Whether failure to adopt additional conservation measures would 
appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery of the 
affected species in the wild.
    (6) Additional actions. Nothing in this rule will be construed to 
limit or constrain the Director, any Federal, State, local or Tribal 
government agency, or a private entity, from taking additional actions 
at its own expense to protect or conserve a species included in a 
Candidate Conservation with Assurances Agreement.
    (7) Criteria for revocation. A permit issued under this paragraph 
(d) may not be revoked for any reason except those set forth in Sec.  
13.28(a)(1) through (4) of this subchapter or unless continuation of the 
permitted activity would be inconsistent with the criterion set forth in 
paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section and the inconsistency has not been 
remedied in a timely fashion.
    (8) Duration of the Candidate Conservation Agreement. The duration 
of a Candidate Conservation Agreement covered by a permit issued under 
this paragraph (d) must be sufficient to enable the Director to 
determine that the benefits of the conservation measures in the 
Agreement, when combined with those benefits that would be achieved if 
it is assumed that the conservation measures would also be implemented 
on other necessary properties, would preclude or remove any need to list 
the species covered by the Agreement.

received notice of that country's African elephant ivory quota for the 
year of export;
    (B) All of the permit requirements of 50 CFR parts 13 and 23 have 
been complied with;
    (C) A determination is made that the killing of the animal whose 
trophy is intended for import would enhance survival of the species; and
    (D) The trophy is legibly marked by means of punch-dies, under a 
marking and registration system established by the country of origin, 
that includes the following information: Country of origin represented 
by the two-letter code established by the International Organization for 
Standardization (see appendix A to chapter I) followed by the 
registration number assigned to the last two digits of the year of 
registration and the weight of raw ivory to the nearest kilogram. Any 
mark must be placed on the lip mark area and indicated by a flash of 
color which serves as a background for such mark.
    (f) Leopard. (1) Except as noted in paragraph (f)(2) of this 
section, all prohibitions of Sec.  17.31 of this part and exemptions of 
Sec.  17.32 of this part shall apply to the leopard populations 
occurring in southern Africa to the south of a line running along the 
borders of the following countries: Gabon/Rio Muni; Gabon/Cameroon; 
Congo/Cameroon; Congo/Central African Republic; Zaire/Central African 
Republic; Zaire/Sudan; Uganda/Sudan; Kenya/Sudan; Kenya/Ethiopia; Kenya/
Somalia.
    (2) A sport-hunted leopard trophy legally taken after the effective 
date of this rulemaking, from the area south of the line delineated 
above, may be imported into the United States without a Threatened 
Species permit pursuant to Sec.  17.32 of this part, provided that the 
applicable provisions of 50 CFR part 23 have been met.
    (g) Utah prairie dog (Cynomys parvidens). (1) Except as noted in 
paragraph (g)(2) of this section, all prohibitions of 50 CFR 17.31 (a) 
and (b), and exemptions of 50 CFR 17.32 shall apply to the Utah prairie 
dog.
    (2) A Utah prairie dog may be taken on private land throughout its 
range under a permit issued by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, 
in accordance with the laws of the State of Utah, provided that such 
taking does not exceed 6,000 animals annually and that such taking is 
confined to the period from June 1 to December 31. Records on permitted 
take maintained by the State shall be made available to the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service on request.
    (3) If the Service receives substantive evidence that takings 
pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section are having an effect that 
is inconsistent with the conservation of the Utah prairie dog, the 
Service may immediately prohibit or restrict such taking as appropriate 
for the conservation of the species.
    (h) Mountain lion (Felis concolor). (1) Except as allowed in 
paragraphs (h)(2), (h)(3), and (h)(4) of this section, no person shall 
take any free-living mountain lion (Felis concolor) in Florida.

days. The specimen may only be retained, disposed of, or salvaged in

[[Page 107]]

accordance with directions from the Service.
    (i) Louisiana black bear (Ursus americanus luteolus). (1) Except as 
noted in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, all prohibitions of 
Sec. 17.31 and exemptions of Sec.  17.32 shall apply to any black bear 
within the historic range of the Louisiana black bear (Texas, Louisiana 
and Mississippi).
    (2) Subsection 17.40(i)(1) and Sec.  17.31 shall not prohibit 
effects incidental to normal forest management activities within the 
historic range of the Louisiana black bear except for activities causing 
damage to or loss of den trees, den tree sites or candidate den trees. 
For purposes of this exemption, normal forest management activities are 
defined as those activities that support a sustained yield of timber 
products and wildlife habitats, thereby maintaining forestland 
conditions in occupied habitat. For purposes of this special rule, 
candidate den trees are considered to be bald cypress and tupelo gum 
with visible cavities, having a minimum diameter at breast height (DBH) 
of 36 inches, and occurring in or along rivers, lakes, streams, bayous, 
sloughs, or other water bodies.
    (3) This express exemption for normal forest management activities 
provided by this special rule is subject to modification or withdrawal 
if the Service determines that this provision fails to further the 
conservation of the Louisiana black bear.
    (j) Argali (Ovis ammon) in Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, and Tajikistan--(1) 
Except as noted in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, all prohibitions of 
Sec.  17.31 of this part and exemptions of Sec.  17.32 of this part 
shall apply to this species in Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, and Tajikistan

    (Note-- In all other parts of its range the argali is classified as 
endangered and covered by Sec.  17.21).

    (2) Upon receiving from the governments of Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, and 
Tajikistan properly documented and verifiable certification that (i) 
argali populations in those countries are sufficiently large to sustain 
sport hunting, (ii) regulating authorities have the capacity to obtain 
sound data on these populations, (iii) regulating authorities recognize 
these populations as a valuable resource and have the legal and 
practical capacity to manage them as such, (iv) the habitat of these 
populations is secure, (v) regulating authorities can ensure that the 
involved trophies have in fact been legally taken from the specified 
populations, and (vi) funds derived from the involved sport hunting are 
applied primarily to argali conservation, the Director may, consistent 
with the purposes of the Act, authorize by publication of a notice in 
the Federal Register the importation of personal sport-hunted argali 
trophies, taken legally in Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, and Tajikistan after 
the date of such notice, without a Threatened Species permit pursuant to 
Sec.  17.32 of this part, provided that the applicable provisions of 50 
CFR part 23 have been met.
    (k) Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis).
    (1) What lynx does this special rule apply to? The regulations in 
this paragraph (k) apply to all wild and captive lynx in the contiguous 
United States.
    (2) What activities are prohibited for wild lynx? All prohibitions 
and provisions of 50 CFR 17.31 and 17.32 apply to wild lynx found in the 
contiguous United States.
    (3) What is considered a captive lynx?
    (i) For purposes of this paragraph (k), captive lynx means lynx, 
whether alive or dead, and any part or product, if the specimen was in 
captivity at the time of the listing, born in captivity, or lawfully 
imported or transported into the contiguous United States.
    (ii) Lynx that were either born or held in captivity and then 
released into the wild are considered wild.
    (4) What activities are allowed for captive lynx?
    (i) Take. You may take lawfully obtained captive lynx without a 
permit.
    (ii) Import and export. You may export captive live lynx, parts or 
products of captive lynx provided the specimens are tagged with 
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna 
and Flora (CITES) export tags and/or accompanied by a valid CITES export 
permit. You may import lawfully obtained lynx that originated outside 
the United States when you follow the requirements of CITES.

[[Page 108]]

    (iii) Interstate commerce. You may deliver, receive, carry, 
transport, ship, sell, offer to sell, purchase, or offer to purchase in 
interstate commerce captive lynx and captive lynx parts and products in 
accordance with State or tribal laws and regulations. In addition, lynx 
pelts that are properly tagged with valid CITES export tags also qualify 
for this exemption on interstate commerce.
    (5) Are any activities not allowed or restricted for captive lynx? 
You must comply with all applicable State and tribal laws and 
regulations. Violation of State or tribal law will also be a violation 
of the Act.
    (l) Preble's meadow jumping mouse (Zapus hudsonius preblei).
    (1) What is the definition of take? To harass, harm, pursue, hunt, 
shoot, wound, trap, kill, or collect; or attempt to engage in any such 
conduct. Incidental take is that which occurs when it is incidental to 
and not the purpose of an otherwise lawful activity. Any take that is 
not authorized by permit provided through section 7 or section 10 of the 
Act or that is not covered by the exemptions described below is 
considered illegal take.
    (2) When is take of Preble's meadow jumping mice allowed? Take of 
Preble's meadow jumping mice resulting from the following legally 
conducted activities, in certain circumstances as described below, is 
allowed:
    (i) Take under permits. Any person with a valid permit issued by the 
Service under Sec.  17.32 may take Preble's meadow jumping mice pursuant 
to the terms of the permit.
    (ii) Rodent control. Preble's meadow jumping mice may be taken 
incidental to rodent control undertaken within 10 feet of or inside any 
structure. ``Rodent control'' includes control of mice and rats by 
trapping, capturing, or otherwise physically capturing or killing, or 
poisoning by any substance registered with the Environmental Protection 
Agency as required by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and 
Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136) and applied consistent with its labeling. 
``Structure'' includes but is not limited to any building, stable, grain 
silo, corral, barn, shed, water or sewage treatment equipment or 
facility, enclosed parking structure, shelter, gazebo, bandshell, or 
restroom complex.
    (iii) Established, ongoing agricultural activities. Preble's meadow 
jumping mice may be taken incidental to agricultural activities, 
including grazing, plowing, seeding, cultivating, minor drainage, 
burning, mowing, and harvesting, as long as these activities are 
established, ongoing activities and do not increase impacts to or 
further encroach upon the Preble's meadow jumping mouse or its habitat. 
New agricultural activities or those that expand the footprint or 
intensity of the activity are not considered to be established, ongoing 
activities.
    (iv) Maintenance and replacement of existing landscaping. Preble's 
meadow jumping mice may be taken incidental to the maintenance and 
replacement of any landscaping and related structures and improvements, 
as long as they are currently in place and no increase in impervious 
surfaces would result from their maintenance and improvement. 
Construction of new structures or improvements or expansion of the 
landscaping in a manner that increases impervious surfaces would not be 
considered maintenance and replacement of existing landscaping.
    (v) Existing uses of water. Preble's meadow jumping mice may be 
taken incidentally as a result of existing uses of water associated with 
the exercise of perfected water rights pursuant to State law and 
interstate compacts and decrees. (A ``perfected water right'' is a right 
that has been put to beneficial use and has been permitted, decreed, or 
adjudicated pursuant to State law.) Increasing the use or altering the 
location of use of an existing water right would not be considered an 
existing use of water.
    (vi) Noxious weed control. Preble's meadow jumping mice may be taken 
incidental to noxious weed control that is conducted in accordance with:
    (A) Federal law, including Environmental Protection Agency label 
restrictions;
    (B) Applicable State laws for noxious weed control;
    (C) Applicable county bulletins;
    (D) Herbicide application guidelines as prescribed by herbicide 
manufacturers; and

[[Page 109]]

    (E) Any future revisions to the authorities listed in paragraphs 
(1)(2)(vi)(A) through (D) of this section that apply to the herbicides 
proposed for use within the species' range.
    (vii) Ditch maintenance activities. Preble's meadow jumping mice may 
be taken incidental to normal and customary ditch maintenance activities 
only if the activities:
    (A) Result in the annual loss of no more than \1/4\ mile of riparian 
shrub habitat per linear mile of ditch, including burning of ditches 
that results in the annual loss of no more than \1/4\ mile of riparian 
shrub habitat per linear mile of ditch.
    (B) Are performed within the historic footprint of the surface 
disturbance associated with ditches and related infrastructure, and
    (C) Follow the Best Management Practices described in paragraphs 
(l)(2)(vii)(C)(1) through (3) of this section.
    (1) Persons engaged in ditch maintenance activities shall avoid, to 
the maximum extent practicable, impacts to shrub vegetation. For 
example, if accessing the ditch for maintenance or repair activities 
from an area containing no shrubs is possible, then damage to adjacent 
shrub vegetation shall be avoided.
    (2) Persons engaged in placement or sidecasting of silt and debris 
removed during ditch cleaning, vegetation or mulch from mowing or 
cutting, and other material from ditch maintenance shall, to the maximum 
extent practicable, avoid shrub habitat and at no time disturb more than 
\1/4\-mile of riparian shrub habitat per linear mile of ditch within any 
calendar year.
    (3) To the maximum extent practicable, all ditch maintenance 
activities should be carried out during the Preble's hibernation season, 
November through April.
    (D) All ditch maintenance activities carried out during the Preble's 
active season, May through October, should be conducted during daylight 
hours only.
    (E) Ditch maintenance activities that would result in permanent or 
long-term loss of potential habitat that would not be considered normal 
or customary include replacement of existing infrastructure with 
components of substantially different materials and design, such as 
replacement of open ditches with pipeline or concrete-lined ditches, 
replacement of an existing gravel access road with a permanently paved 
road, or replacement of an earthen diversion structure with a rip-rap 
and concrete structure, and construction of new infrastructure or the 
movement of existing infrastructure to new locations, such as 
realignment of a ditch, building a new access road, or installation of 
new diversion works where none previously existed.
    (3) When is take of Preble's not allowed? (i) Any manner of take not 
described under paragraph (l) (2) of this section.
    (ii) No person may import or export, ship in interstate commerce in 
the course of commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale in 
interstate or foreign commerce any Preble's meadow jumping mice.
    (iii) No person, except for an authorized person may possess, sell, 
deliver, carry, transport, or ship any Preble's meadow jumping mice that 
have been taken illegally.
    (4) How long is this rule effective? This rule is effective for a 
period of 36 months from May 22, 2001.
    (5) Where does this rule apply? The take exemptions provided by this 
rule are applicable within the entire range of the Preble's meadow 
jumping mouse.
    (m) Vicu[ntilde]a. This paragraph (m) applies to the threatened 
vicu[ntilde]a (Vicugna vicugna).
    (1) What activities involving vicu[ntilde]a are prohibited by this 
rule? (i) Appendix I populations. All provisions of Sec.  17.31 (a) and 
(b) and Sec.  17.32 apply to vicu[ntilde]a and vicu[ntilde]a parts and 
products originating from populations currently listed in Appendix I of 
the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild 
Fauna and Flora (CITES).
    (ii) Import, export, and re-export. Except as provided in paragraph 
(m)(2) of this section, you must not import, export, or re-export, or 
present for export or re-export without valid CITES permits 
vicu[ntilde]a or vicu[ntilde]a parts and products originating from 
populations listed in Appendix II of CITES.
    (iii) Commercial activity. Except as provided in paragraph (m)(2) of 
this

[[Page 110]]

section, you must not sell or offer for sale, deliver, receive, carry, 
transport, or ship in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a 
commercial activity vicu[ntilde]a or vicu[ntilde]a parts and products 
from populations listed in Appendix II of CITES.
    (iv) It is unlawful for any person subject to the jurisdiction of 
the United States to commit, attempt to commit, solicit to commit, or 
cause to be committed any acts described in paragraphs (m)(1)(ii)-(iii) 
of this section.
    (2) What activities involving vicu[ntilde]a are allowed by this 
rule? You may import, export, or re-export, or place in interstate or 
foreign commerce, vicu[ntilde]a products, consisting of either raw fiber 
or items and cloth made, or partially made, from vicu[ntilde]a fiber, 
without a threatened species permit issued according to Sec.  17.32 only 
when the provisions in parts 13, 14, and 23 of this chapter and the 
requirements of the applicable subparagraphs of this paragraph (m)(2) 
have been met:
    (i) Import, export, or re-export. You may import, export, or re-
export into or from the United States vicu[ntilde]a products, consisting 
of either raw fiber or items and cloth made, or partially made, from 
vicu[ntilde]a fiber originating in a country authorized under paragraph 
(m)(4) of this section, provided the following conditions are met:
    (A) The vicu[ntilde]a product must comply with all CITES product 
annotations as given in the CITES Secretariat's official list of the 
CITES Appendices, and all imports, exports, and re-exports must be 
identified as follows:
    (1) Cloth and cloth products: The reverse side of cloth and cloth 
products must bear the logo adopted by countries signatory to the 
``Conve[ntilde]o para la Conservaci[oacute]n y Manejo de la 
Vicu[ntilde]a'', and the words ``VICU[Ntilde]A-(Country of Origin)'' 
(where country of origin is the name of the original exporting country 
where the vicu[ntilde]a fiber in the products originated, either 
Argentina, Bolivia, or Chile) or ``VICU[Ntilde]A-PERU-ARTESANIA'' (for 
Peru only).
    (2) Finished vicu[ntilde]a products (including luxury handicrafts 
and knitted articles) and any bulk shipments of raw fiber: The product 
or shipment must have a seal or identification tag with codes describing 
the origin of the vicu[ntilde]a product, the trademark or label 
(``VICU[Ntilde]A-(Country of Origin)'' (where country of origin is the 
name of the original exporting country where the vicu[ntilde]a fiber in 
the products originated, either Argentina, Bolivia, or Chile) or 
``VICU[Ntilde]A-PERU-ARTESANIA'' (for Peru only), and the CITES export 
permit number, where country of origin is the name of the original 
exporting country where the vicu[ntilde]a fiber in the products 
originated.
    (B) The shipment must be accompanied by a CITES permit or 
certificate that contains the following information:
    (1) The country of origin, its export permit number, and date of 
issuance.
    (2) If re-export, the country of re-export, its certificate number, 
and date of issuance.
    (3) If applicable, the country of last re-export, its certificate 
number, and date of issuance.
    (C) At the time of import, for each shipment covered by this 
exception, the country of origin and each country of re-export involved 
in the trade of a particular shipment must have designated both a CITES 
Management Authority and Scientific Authority, and have not been 
identified by the CITES Conference of the Parties, the CITES Standing 
Committee, or in a Notification from the CITES Secretariat as a country 
from which Parties should not accept permits. A listing of all countries 
that have not designated both a Management Authority and Scientific 
Authority, or that have been identified as a country from which Parties 
should not accept permits is available by writing: The Division of 
Management Authority, ARLSQ Room 700, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service, Arlington, VA 22203. The list is also on our 
website (http://international.fws.gov).
    (ii) Noncommercial accompanying baggage. The conditions described in 
paragraph (m)(2)(i) of this section also apply to noncommercial personal 
effects in accompanying baggage or household effects from Appendix II 
populations. Such items are treated the same as Appendix II commercial 
shipments, and must comply with the same documentary requirements. All 
other noncommercial personal effects

[[Page 111]]

in accompanying baggage or household effects require both a CITES 
Appendix I permit and a permit as described in Sec.  17.32.
    (iii) Embryos, gametes, blood, other tissue samples, and live 
animals. This special rule does not apply to embryos, gametes, blood, or 
other tissue samples of vicu[ntilde]a, or to live vicu[ntilde]a. Import 
of such specimens requires an import permit as described in Sec.  17.32 
in addition to CITES Appendix I import and export permits, and will be 
issued only for bona fide scientific research contributing to 
conservation of the species in the wild.
    (3) When and how will the Service inform the public of additional 
restrictions in trade of vicu[ntilde]a? Except in rare cases involving 
extenuating circumstances that do not adversely affect the conservation 
of the species, we will issue an information notice that identifies a 
restriction on trade in specimens of vicu[ntilde]a addressed in this 
paragraph (m) if any of the following criteria are met:
    (i) The country is listed in a Notification to the Parties by the 
CITES Secretariat as lacking a designated Management or Scientific 
Authority that issues CITES documents or their equivalent.
    (ii) The country is identified in any action adopted by the 
Conference of the Parties to the Convention, the Convention's Standing 
Committee, or in a Notification issued by the CITES Secretariat, whereby 
Parties are asked not to accept shipments of specimens of any CITES-
listed species from the country in question.
    (iii) The Service's Division of Scientific Authority 
administratively determines that the conservation or management status 
of threatened vicu[ntilde]a populations in a range country has changed, 
such that continued recovery of the vicu[ntilde]a population in that 
country may be compromised, as a result of one or more of the following 
factors:
    (A) A change in range country laws or regulations that lessens 
protection for vicu[ntilde]a;
    (B) A change in range country management programs that lessens 
protection for vicu[ntilde]a;
    (C) A documented decline in wild vicu[ntilde]a population numbers;
    (D) A documented increase in poaching of vicu[ntilde]a;

quantity; or
    (F) Other natural or man-made factors affecting the species' 
recovery.
    (iv) A listing of all countries that have not designated both a 
Management Authority and Scientific Authority, or that have been 
identified as a country from which Parties should not accept permits is 
available by writing: The Division of Management Authority, ARLSQ Room 
700, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Arlington, 
VA 22203. The list is also on our website (http://
international.fws.gov).
    (4) What must vicu[ntilde]a range countries do in order to be 
authorized under the special rule to export to the United States? (i) 
Annual Report. Range country governments (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and 
Peru) wishing to export specimens of vicu[ntilde]a to the United States 
will need to provide an annual report containing the most recent 
information available on the status of the species, following the 
information guidelines specified below. The first submission of a status 
report will be required as of July 1, 2003, and every year thereafter on 
the anniversary of that date. For each range country, the following 
information should be provided in the annual report:
    (A) A description of any revisions to the management program, 
especially any changes in management approaches or emphasis;
    (B) New information obtained in the last year on vicu[ntilde]a 
distribution, population status, or population trends, for the country 
as a whole or for specific protected areas, and a detailed description 
of the methodology used to obtain such information;
    (C) Results of any research projects concluded in the last year on 
the biology of vicu[ntilde]a in the wild, particularly its population 
biology, habitat use, and genetics, and a description of any new 
research projects undertaken on the biology of vicu[ntilde]a in the 
wild, particularly its population biology, habitat use, and genetics;
    (D) A description of any changes to national and/or provincial laws 
and

[[Page 112]]

programs relating to vicu[ntilde]a conservation, in particular those 
laws and regulations related to harvest and use of the vicu[ntilde]a, 
and export of vicu[ntilde]a parts and products;
    (E) A description of any changes in the number or size of natural 
reserves or national parks that provide protected habitat for the 
vicu[ntilde]a;
    (E) A summary of law enforcement activities undertaken in the last 
year, and a description of any changes in programs to prevent poaching, 
smuggling, and illegal commercialization of the vicu[ntilde]a;
    (F) A description of the current management and harvest (or 
``sustainable use'') programs for wild populations of the vicu[ntilde]a, 
including: any changes in the location and population size of wild 
populations being managed for sustainable use; any changes in the 
harvest management practices being used for each population; any changes 
in current harvest quotas for wild populations, if any; any changes in 
protocols for translocations undertaken as part of the use program; a 
summary of the specific financial costs of and revenues generated by the 
sustainable use program over the last year; and a summary of documented 
conservation benefits resulting from the sustainable use program over 
the last year;
    (G) A description of current management and harvest (or 
``sustainable use'') programs for captive and so-called ``semi-captive'' 
populations of the vicu[ntilde]a, including: any changes in the number 
and location of all captive and ``semi-captive'' populations; any 
changes in the size (ha) of each captive enclosure and the number of 
vicu[ntilde]a maintained therein; any changes in protocols for 
translocations undertaken as part of the use program; a summary of the 
financial costs of and revenues generated by the sustainable use program 
over the last year; and documented conservation benefits resulting from 
the sustainable use program over the last year (information on captive 
and ``semi-captive'' populations must be separate from that provided for 
wild populations); and
    (H) Export data for the last year.
    (ii) The Service's Division of Scientific Authority will conduct a 
review every 2 years, using information in the annual reports, to 
determine whether range country management programs are effectively 
achieving conservation benefits for the vicu[ntilde]a. Failure to submit 
an annual report could result in a restriction on trade in specimens of 
vicu[ntilde]a as addressed in paragraph (m)(3) of this section. Based on 
information contained in the annual reports and any other pertinent 
information it has available, the Service may restrict trade from a 
range country, as addressed in paragraph (m)(3) of this section, if it 
determines that the conservation or management status of threatened 
vicu[ntilde]a populations in a range country has changed, such that 
continued recovery of the vicu[ntilde]a population in that country may 
be compromised. Trade restrictions may result from one or more of the 
following factors:
    (A) A change in range country laws or regulations that lessens 
protection for vicu[ntilde]a;
    (B) A change in range country management programs that lessens 
protection for vicu[ntilde]a;
    (C) A documented decline in wild vicu[ntilde]a population numbers;
    (D) A documented increase in poaching of vicu[ntilde]a;
    (E) A documented decline in vicu[ntilde]a habitat quality or 
quantity; or
    (F) Other natural or man-made factors affecting the species' 
recovery.

during the previous breeding season, have produced at least two pups 
that survived until December 31 of the year of their birth.
    (iii) Domestic animals. Animals that have been selectively bred over 
many generations to enhance specific traits for their use by humans, 
including use as pets. This includes livestock (as defined below) and 
dogs.
    (iv) Livestock. Cattle, sheep, horses, mules, and herding or guard 
animals (llamas, donkeys, and certain special-use breeds of dogs 
commonly used for guarding or herding livestock) or as otherwise defined 
in State and tribal wolf management plans as approved by the Service. 
This excludes dogs that are not being used for livestock guarding or 
herding.
    (v) Noninjurious. Does not cause either temporary or permanent 
physical damage or death.
    (vi) Opportunistic harassment. Harassment without the conduct of 
prior purposeful actions to attract, track, wait for, or search out the 
wolf.
    (vii) Problem wolves. Wolves that attack livestock, or wolves that 
twice in a calendar year attack domestic animals other than livestock.
    (viii) Public land. Federal land and any other public land 
designated in State and tribal wolf management plans as approved by the 
Service.
    (ix) Remove. Place in captivity or kill or release in another 
location.
    (x) Wounded. Exhibiting torn flesh and bleeding or other evidence of 
physical damage caused by a wolf bite.
    (3) Allowable forms of take of gray wolves. The following 
activities, only in the specific circumstances described in paragraph 
(n) of this section, are allowed: opportunistic harassment; intentional 
harassment; taking on private land; taking on public land; taking in 
response to impacts on wild ungulates; taking in defense of human life; 
taking to protect human safety; taking by government agents to remove 
problem wolves; incidental take; taking under permits; and taking per 
authorizations for agency employees. Other than as expressly provided in 
this rule, all the prohibitions of Sec.  17.31(a) and (b) apply, and all 
other take activities are considered a violation of section 9 of the 
Act. Any wolf, or wolf part, taken legally must be turned over to the 
Service unless otherwise specified in paragraph (n) of this section. Any 
taking of wolves must be reported to the Service as outlined in 
paragraph (n)(6) of this section.
    (i) Opportunistic harassment. Landowners on their own land and 
livestock producers or permittees who are legally using public land 
under valid livestock grazing allotments may conduct opportunistic 
harassment of any gray wolf in a noninjurious manner at any time. 
Opportunistic harassment must be reported to the Service within 7 days 
as outlined in paragraph (n)(6) of this section.
    (ii) Intentional harassment. After we or our designated agent have 
confirmed persistent wolf activity on privately owned land or on a 
public land grazing allotment, we may, pursuant to Sec.  17.32, issue a 
90-day permit, with appropriate conditions, to any landowner to harass 
wolves in a potentially injurious manner (such as by projectiles 
designed to be nonlethal to larger mammals). The harassment must occur 
as specifically identified in the Service permit.
    (iii) Taking by landowners on private land. Landowners may take 
wolves on privately owned land in the following two additional 
circumstances:
    (A) Any landowner may take a gray wolf that is in the act of biting, 
wounding, or killing livestock or dogs, provided that the landowner 
provides evidence of animal(s) freshly (less than 24 hours) wounded or 
killed by wolves, and we or our designated agent are able to confirm 
that the animal(s) were wounded or killed by wolves. The taking of any 
wolf without such evidence may be referred to the appropriate 
authorities for prosecution.
    (B) A private landowner may be issued a limited duration permit 
pursuant to Sec.  17.32 to take a gray wolf on the landowner's private 
land if:
    (1) This private property or an adjacent private property has had at 
least two depredations by wolves on livestock or dogs that have been 
confirmed by us or our designated agent; and
    (2) We or our designated agent have determined that wolves are 
routinely present on that private property and

[[Page 114]]

present a significant risk to the health and safety of livestock or 
dogs. The landowner must conduct the take in compliance with the permit 
issued by the Service.
    (iv) Take on public land. Under the authority of Sec.  17.32, we may 
issue permits to take gray wolves under certain circumstances to 
livestock producers or permittees who are legally using public land 
under valid livestock grazing allotments. The permits, which may be 
valid for up to 45 days, can allow the take of a gray wolf that is in 
the act of killing, wounding, or biting livestock, after we or our 
designated agent have confirmed that wolves have previously wounded or 
killed livestock, and agency efforts to resolve the problem have been 
completed and were ineffective. We or our designated agent will 
investigate and determine if the previously wounded or killed livestock 
were wounded or killed by wolves. There must be evidence of livestock 
freshly wounded or killed by wolves. The taking of any wolf without such 
evidence may be referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.
    (v) Take in response to wild ungulate impacts. If wolves are causing 
unacceptable impacts to wild ungulate populations, a State or tribe may 
capture and move wolves to other areas within the States identified in 
paragraph (n) of this section or experimental populations areas in 
Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming established under section 10(j) of the Act 
and delineated in Sec.  17.84(i). In order for this provision to apply, 
the States or tribes must define in their wolf management plan such 
unacceptable impacts, describe how they will be measured, and identify 
possible mitigation measures. Before wolves can be captured and moved, 
we must approve these plans and determine that such actions will not 
inhibit wolf population growth toward recovery levels. In addition, if, 
after 10 breeding pairs are established in the State, we determine that 
wolves are causing unacceptable impacts to wild ungulate populations, we 
may, in cooperation with the appropriate State fish and game agencies or 
tribes, capture and move wolves to other areas within the States 
identified in paragraph (n) of this section or experimental populations 
areas in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming.
    (vi) Take in defense of human life. Any person may take a gray wolf 
in defense of the individual's life or the life of another person. The 
unauthorized taking of a wolf without an immediate and direct threat to 
human life may be referred to the appropriate authorities for 
prosecution.
    (vii) Take to protect human safety. We or a Federal land management 
agency or a State or tribal conservation agency may promptly remove any 
wolf that we or our designated agent determines to be a demonstrable but 
nonimmediate threat to human life or safety.
    (viii) Take of problem wolves by Service personnel or our designated 
agent. We or our designated agent may carry out aversive conditioning, 
nonlethal control, relocation, permanent placement in captivity, or 
lethal control of problem wolves. If nonlethal depredation control 
activities occurring on public lands result in the capture, prior to 
October 1, of a female wolf showing signs that she is still raising pups 
of the year (e.g., evidence of lactation, recent sightings with pups), 
whether or not she is captured with her pups, then she and her pups may 
be released at or near the site of capture. Female wolves with pups may 
be removed if continued depredation occurs. Problem wolves that 
depredate on domestic animals more than twice in a calendar year, 
including female wolves with pups regardless of whether on public or 
private lands, may be moved or removed from the wild. To determine the 
presence of problem wolves, we or our agents will consider all of the 
following:
    (A) Evidence of wounded livestock or other domestic animals or 
remains of a carcass that shows that the injury or death was caused by 
wolves;
    (B) The likelihood that additional losses may occur if no control 
action is taken;
    (C) Any evidence of unusual attractants or artificial or intentional 
feeding of wolves; and
    (D) Evidence that, on public lands, if animal husbandry practices 
were previously identified in existing approved allotment plans and 
annual operating

[[Page 115]]

plans for allotments, they were followed.
    (ix) Incidental take. Take of a gray wolf is allowed if the take was 
accidental and incidental to an otherwise lawful activity and if 
reasonable due care was practiced to avoid such taking. Incidental take 
is not allowed if the take is not accidental or if reasonable due care 
was not practiced to avoid such taking; we may refer such taking to the 
appropriate authorities for prosecution. Shooters have the 
responsibility to identify their target before shooting. Shooting a wolf 
as a result of mistaking it for another species is not considered 
accidental and may be referred to the appropriate authorities for 
prosecution.
    (x) Take under permits. Any person with a valid permit issued by the 
Service under Sec.  17.32 may take wolves in the wild, pursuant to terms 
of the permit.
    (xi) Additional taking authorizations for agency employees. When 
acting in the course of official duties, any employee of the Service or 
appropriate Federal, State, or tribal agency, who is designated as an 
agent in writing for such purposes by the Service, may take a wolf or 
wolf-like canid for the following purposes; such take must be reported 
to the Service within 15 days as outlined in paragraph (n)(6) of this 
section and specimens may be retained or disposed of only in accordance 
with directions from the Service:
    (A) Scientific purposes;
    (B) Avoiding conflict with human activities;
    (C) Improving wolf survival and recovery prospects;
    (D) Aiding or euthanizing sick, injured, or orphaned wolves;
    (E) Disposing of a dead specimen;
    (F) Salvaging a dead specimen that may be used for scientific study;
    (G) Aiding in law enforcement investigations involving wolves; or
    (H) Preventing wolves with abnormal physical or behavioral 
characteristics, as determined by the Service, from passing on those 
traits to other wolves.
    (4) Prohibited take of gray wolves. (i) Any manner of take not 
described under paragraph (n)(3) of this section.
    (ii) No person may possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever, any wolf or wolf part from 
the State of origin taken in violation of the regulations in paragraph 
(n) of this section or in violation of applicable State or tribal fish 
and wildlife laws or regulations or the Act.
    (iii) In addition to the offenses defined in paragraph (n) of this 
section, we consider any attempts to commit, solicitations of another to 
commit, or actions that cause to be committed any such offenses to be 
unlawful.
    (iv) Use of unlawfully taken wolves. No person, except for an 
authorized person, may possess, deliver, carry, transport, or ship a 
gray wolf taken unlawfully.
    (5) Federal land use. Restrictions on the use of any Federal lands 
may be put in place to prevent the take of wolves at active den sites 
between April 1 and June 30. Otherwise, no additional land-use 
restrictions on Federal lands, except for National Parks or National 
Wildlife Refuges, will be necessary to reduce or prevent take of wolves 
solely to benefit gray wolf recovery under the Act. This prohibition 
does not preclude restricting land use when necessary to reduce negative 
impacts of wolf restoration efforts on other endangered or threatened 
species.
    (6) Reporting requirements. Except as otherwise specified in 
paragraph (n) of this section or in a permit issued under Sec.  17.32, 
any taking of a gray wolf must be reported to the Service within 24 
hours. We will allow additional reasonable time if access to the site is 
limited. Report wolf takings, including opportunistic harassment, to 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Western Gray Wolf Recovery Coordinator 
(100 N. Park, <greek-i>320, Helena, MT 59601; 406-449-5225 extension 
204; facsimile 406-449-5339), or a Service-designated representative of 
another Federal, State, or tribal agency. Unless otherwise specified in 
paragraph (n) of this section, any wolf or wolf part, taken legally must 
be turned over to the Service, which will determine the disposition of 
any live or dead wolves.
    (o) Gray wolf (Canis lupus) in North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, 
Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, and 
Ohio.

[[Page 116]]

    (1) Definitions of terms used in paragraph (o) of this section.
    (i) Domestic animals. Animals that have been selectively bred over 
many generations to enhance specific traits for their use by humans, 
including use as pets.
    (ii) Livestock. Cattle, sheep, horses, and mules or as otherwise 
defined in State and tribal wolf management plans.
    (2) Allowable forms of take of gray wolves. The following 
activities, in certain circumstances as described below, are allowed: 
Take in defense of human life; take to protect human safety; take to 
aid, salvage, or dispose; take for depredation control; take under 
cooperative agreements; and take under permit. As stated in Sec.  
17.31(c), the provisions of this paragraph (o) contain all the 
applicable take prohibitions and exceptions; all other take activities 
in these States are considered a violation of section 9 of the Act. Any 
wolf, or wolf part, taken legally must be turned over to the Service 
unless otherwise specified in paragraph (o) of this section. Any taking 
of wolves must be reported to the Service as outlined in paragraph 
(o)(4) of this section.
    (i) Take in defense of human life. Any person may take a gray wolf 
in defense of the individual's life or the life of another person. The 
unauthorized taking of a wolf without an immediate and direct threat to 
human life may be referred to the appropriate authorities for 
prosecution.
    (ii) Take to protect human safety. We or a Federal land management 
agency or a State or tribal conservation agency, or an agent of one of 
these agencies who is designated in writing for such purpose, may 
promptly remove any wolf that the agency determines to be a demonstrable 
but nonimmediate threat to human life or safety.
    (iii) Allowable take for aiding, salvaging, or disposing of 
specimens. When acting in the course of official duties, any authorized 
employee or agent of the Service, any other Federal land management 
agency or the wildlife conservation agency of a State or of a federally 
recognized Native American tribe, who is designated by his/her agency 
for such purposes, may take a gray wolf in the person's area of 
jurisdiction without a Federal permit if such action is necessary for 
the following purposes; such take must be reported to the Service within 
15 days as outlined in paragraph (o)(4) of this section, and specimens 
may be retained or disposed of only in accordance with directions from 
the Service:
    (A) Aiding a sick, injured, or orphaned specimen;
    (B) Disposing of a dead specimen; or
    (C) Salvaging a dead specimen that may be useful for scientific 
study or for traditional cultural purposes by Native American tribes.
    (iv) Allowable take for depredation control. When acting in the 
course of official duties, any authorized employee or agent of the 
Service, of the wildlife conservation agency of a State, or of a 
federally recognized Native American tribe, who is designated by his/her 
agency for such purposes, may take a gray wolf or wolves within the 
person's State or, in the case of a tribal employee, within that 
person's Reservation boundaries, in response to depredation by a gray 
wolf on lawfully present livestock or domestic animals. However, such 
taking must be preceded by a determination by one of the agencies listed 
in paragraph (o) of this section that the depredation was likely to have 
been caused by a gray wolf and depredation at the site is likely to 
continue in the absence of a taking. In addition, such taking must be 
performed in a humane manner and occur within 1 mile of the place where 
the depredation occurred if in Michigan or Wisconsin, and within 4 miles 
of the place where the depredation occurred if in the remaining area 
covered by paragraph (o) of this section. Any young of the year taken by 
trapping on or before August 1 of that year must be released. Any take 
for depredation control must reported to the Service within 15 days as 
outlined in paragraph (o)(4) of this section. The specimen may be 
retained or disposed of only in accordance with directions from the 
Service.
    (v) Take under section 6 cooperative agreements. When acting in the 
course of official duties, any authorized employee or agent of the State 
wildlife conservation agencies in the area covered by paragraph (o) of 
this section, who is designated by his/her agency for

[[Page 117]]

such purposes under a cooperative agreement under section 6 of the Act, 
may take a gray wolf in his/her respective State to carry out scientific 
research or conservation programs. Such takings must be reported to the 
Service as specified in the reporting provisions of the cooperative 
agreement.
    (vi) Take under permit. Any person who has a permit under Sec.  
17.32 may carry out activities as specified by the permit with regard to

    (ii) Export and commercial transactions. Except as may be authorized 
by a permit issued underSec.  17.32, no person may sell or offer for 
sale in interstate commerce, import or export, or, in the course of a 
commercial activity, transport or receive any gray wolves from the 
States, or portions thereof, covered by paragraph (o) of this section.
    (iii) In addition to the offenses defined in paragraph (o) of this 
section, we consider any attempts to commit, solicitations of another to 
commit, or actions that cause to be committed any such offenses to be 
unlawful.
    (iv) Use of unlawfully taken wolves. No person, except for an 
authorized person, may possess, deliver, carry, transport, or ship a 
gray wolf taken unlawfully in the area covered by paragraph (o) of this 
section.
    (4) Reporting requirements. Except as otherwise specified in 
paragraph (o) of this section or in a permit issued under Sec.  17.32, 
any taking must be reported to the Service within 24 hours. Report wolf 
takings in North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas to 303-236-
7540, and in Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, and 
Ohio to 612-713-5320, or a Service-designated representative of another 
Federal, State, or tribal agency. (Individuals who are hearing-impaired 
or speech-impaired may call the Federal Relay Service at 1-800-877-
8337.) Unless otherwise specified in paragraph (o) of this section, any 
wolf or wolf part, taken legally must be turned over to the Service, 
which will determine the disposition of any live or dead wolves.
    (5) Take regulations for States in the Eastern Gray Wolf Distinct 
Population Segment (DPS) not covered by this paragraph (o). This special 
rule does not apply to the States of Minnesota, Pennsylvania, New 
Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont, New 
Hampshire, and Maine. While these States are included in the Eastern 
DPS, this special regulation does not apply to the entire DPS, and it 
specifically does not apply to these 10 States. Gray wolves in these 
States, other than Minnesota, are covered by the prohibitions of Sec.  
17.31(a) and (b), which apply to all threatened species that are not 
subject to a special regulation. Gray wolves in Minnesota are covered by 
a separate special regulation in paragraph (d) of this section.

Sec.  17.41  Special rules--birds.

    (a) Bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) wherever listed as 
threatened under Sec.  17.11(h).
    (1) Applicable provisions. All prohibitions and measures of 
Sec. Sec.  17.31 and 17.32 shall apply to any threatened bald eagle, 
except that any permit issued under Sec.  21.22 or part 22 of this 
chapter shall be deemed to satisfy all requirements of Sec. Sec.  17.31 
and 17.32 for that authorized activity, and a second permit shall not be 
required under Sec.  17.32. A permit is required under Sec.  17.32 for 
any activity not covered by any permit issued under Sec.  21.22 or part 
22 of this chapter.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (b) Coastal California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica 
californica). (1) Except as noted in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this 
section, all prohibitions of Sec.  17.31(a) and (b) shall apply to the 
coastal California gnatcatcher.

[[Page 118]]

    (2) Incidental take of the coastal California gnatcatcher will not 
be considered a violation of section 9 of the Endangered Species Act of 
1973, as amended (Act), if it results from activities conducted pursuant 
to the State of California's Natural Community Conservation Planning Act 
of 1991 (NCCP), and in accordance with a NCCP plan for the protection of 
coastal sage scrub habitat, prepared consistent with the State's NCCP 
Conservation and Process Guidelines, provided that:
    (i) The NCCP plan has been prepared, approved, and implemented 
pursuant to California Fish and Game Code sections 2800-2840; and
    (ii) The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) has issued written 
concurrence that the NCCP plan meets the standards set forth in 50 CFR 
17.32(b)(2). The Service shall issue its concurrence pursuant to the 
provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), dated December 4, 
1991, between the California Department of Fish and Game and the Service 
regarding coastal sage scrub natural community conservation planning in 
southern California. (Copies of the State's NCCP Conservation and 
Process Guidelines and the MOU are available from the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, Carlsbad Field Office, 2730 Loker Avenue West, 
Carlsbad, CA 92008.) The Service shall monitor the implementation of the 
NCCP plan and may revoke its concurrence under this paragraph (b)(2)(ii) 
if the NCCP plan, as implemented, fails to adhere to the standards set 
forth in 50 CFR 17.32(b)(2).
    (3) During the period that a NCCP plan referred to in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section is being prepared, incidental take of the coastal 
California gnatcatcher will not be a violation of section 9 of the Act 
if such take occurs within an area under the jurisdiction of a local 
government agency that is enrolled and actively engaged in the 
preparation of such a plan and such take results from activities 
conducted in accordance with the NCCP Conservation Guidelines and 
Process Guidelines.
    (4) The Service will monitor the implementation of the NCCP 
Conservation and Process Guidelines as a whole, and will conduct a 
review every 6 months to determine whether the guidelines, as 
implemented, are effective in progressing toward or meeting regional and 
subregional conservation objectives during the interim planning period. 
If the Service determines that the guidelines are not effecting adequate 
progress toward or meeting regional and subregional conservation 
objectives, the Service will consult with the California Department of 
Fish and Game pursuant to the MOU to seek appropriate modification of 
the guidelines or their application as defined therein. If appropriate 
modification of the guidelines or their application as defined therein 
does not occur, the Service may revoke the interim take provisions of 
this special rule on a subregional or subarea basis. The Service will 
publish the findings for revocation in the Federal Register and provide 
for a 30-day public comment period prior to the effective date for 
revoking the provisions of the special rule in a particular area. 
Revocation would result in the reinstatement of the take prohibitions 
set forth under 50 CFR 17.31(a) and (b) in the affected NCCP area.

or foreign commerce in live crocodiles, crocodilian skins, meat, skulls, 
and other parts or products may be allowed without a threatened species 
permit issued pursuant to 50 CFR 17.32 when the provisions in 50 CFR 
parts 13, 14, and 23, and the applicable paragraphs set out below have 
been met.
    (i) Import, export, or re-export of crocodilian skins and parts. The 
import, export, or re-export into/from the United States of crocodilian 
skins and parts of Nile crocodiles listed in Appendix II of the 
Convention, and of saltwater crocodiles originating in Australia must 
meet the following conditions:
    (A) All crocodilian parts must be in a transparent, sealed 
container, and each container imported into or presented for export or 
re-export from the United States after July 24, 1997,
    (1) Must have a parts tag attached in such a way that opening of the 
container will preclude reuse of an undamaged tag,
    (2) This parts tag must contain a description of the contents and 
total weight of the container, and
    (3) This parts tag must reference the number of the CITES permit 
issued to allow the export or re-export of the container;

being effectively implemented by a specific country, the Service will 
prohibit or restrict imports from such country(s) as appropriate for the 
conservation of the species.
    (F) At the time of import, for each shipment covered by this 
exception, the country of origin and each country of re-export involved 
in the trade of a particular shipment is not subject to a Schedule III 
Notice of Information pertaining to all wildlife or any members of the 
Order Crocodylia that may prohibit or restrict imports. A listing of all 
countries that are subject to such a Schedule III Notice of Information 
will be available by writing: The Office of Management Authority, ARLSQ 
Room 430, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,

Secretariat or other reliable sources that the tagging resolution is not 
being effectively implemented by a specific country, the Service will 
prohibit or restrict imports from such countries as appropriate for the 
conservation of the species.
    (C) At the time of import, for each shipment covered by this 
exception, the country of origin and each country of re-export involved 
in the trade of a particular shipment is not subject to a Schedule III 
Notice of Information pertaining to all wildlife or any member of the 
Order Crocodylia that may prohibit or restrict imports. A listing of all 
countries that are subject to such a Schedule III Notice of Information 
will be available by writing: The Office of Management Authority, ARLSQ 
Room 430, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 
Arlington, Virginia, 22203.
    (iii) Shipments of eggs, skulls, meat, scientific specimens and live

required by 50 CFR part 17, provided that unmounted skins bear an 
intact, uncut tag from the country of origin or such a tag accompanies 
mounted specimens in accordance with the tagging resolution.
    (4) Notice of Information. Except in rare cases involving 
extenuating circumstances that do not adversely affect the conservation 
of the species, the Service will issue a Schedule III Notice of 
Information banning or restricting trade in specimens of crocodilians 
addressed in this paragraph (c) if any of the following criteria are

and composed, totally or in part, of yacare caiman, brown caiman, or 
common caiman.
    (iv) Country of re-export means those intermediary countries that 
import and re-export caiman skins, parts, and/or products. However, we 
will not consider intermediary countries those through which caiman 
skins, parts, and/or products are shipped while remaining under Customs 
control.
    (v) Universal Tagging System Resolution means the CITES (Convention 
on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) 
resolution entitled ``Universal Tagging System for the Identification of 
Crocodilian Skins'' and numbered Conf. 9.22, and any subsequent 
revisions.
    (2) What activities involving yacare caiman (Caiman yacare), the 
common caiman (Caiman crocodilus crocodilus), and the brown caiman 
(Caiman crocodilus fuscus) are prohibited by this rule? (i) Import, 
export, and re-export. Except for the activities described in paragraph 
(g)(3) of this section, it is unlawful to import, export, re-export, or 
present for export or re-export without valid permits (as required under 
50 CFR parts 17 and 23) any caiman or their skins, other parts or

    (3) What activities involving yacare caiman (Caiman yacare), the 
common caiman (Caiman crocodilus crocodilus), and the brown caiman 
(Caiman crocodilus fuscus) are allowed by this rule? The import/export/
re-export of, or the interstate/foreign commerce in caiman skins, other 
parts, or products may be allowed without a threatened species permit 
(issued according to 50 CFR 17.32) only when the provisions in 50 CFR 
parts 13, 14, and 23, and the requirements of the applicable paragraphs 
below have been met.
    (i) Import, export, or re-export. The import, export, or re-export 
into/from the United States of caiman skins, parts, or products may be 
allowed provided the following conditions are met:
    (A) Each caiman skin imported into or exported or re-exported from 
the United States after the effective date of the final rule must bear 
either:
    (1) An intact, uncut tag from the country of origin meeting all the 
requirements of the CITES Universal Tagging System Resolution, or
    (2) An intact, uncut replacement tag from the country of re-export 
where the original tags were lost or removed from raw, tanned, and/or 
processed skins. These replacement tags must meet all the requirements 
of the CITES Universal Tagging System Resolution, except showing the 
country of re-export instead of the country of origin, provided those 
re-exporting countries have implemented an administrative system for the

Universal Tagging System Resolution. If a shipment contains more than 25 
percent replacement tags, the Management Authority of the re-exporting 
country must consult with the U.S. Office of Management Authority before 
clearance of the shipment. Such shipments may be seized if we determine 
that the requirements of the CITES Universal Tagging System Resolution 
have not been met.

[[Page 124]]

    (B) In accordance with the CITES Universal Tagging System 
Resolution, all caiman parts must be placed in a transparent, sealed 
container. Each container imported, exported, or re-exported into/from 
the United States after the effective date of the rule:
    (1) Must have a parts tag attached in such a way that opening of the 
container will prevent later reuse of such tag; and
    (2) The parts tag must contain a description of the contents plus 
total weight of the container and its contents.
    (C) The information on the export permit or re-export certificate 
must be the same as that on the skin and part tags, carry the same 
permit or certificate number, and be validated by the government 
authority designated as the CITES document-issuing authority.
    (D) The CITES permit or certificate accompanying shipments of caiman 
skins, parts, or products must contain the following information:
    (1) The country of origin, its export permit number, and date of 
issuance;
    (2) If re-export, the country of re-export, its certificate number, 
and date of issuance; and
    (3) If applicable, the country of previous re-export, its 
certificate number, and date of issuance.
    (E) The country of origin and any intermediary country(s) must be 
effectively implementing the CITES Universal Tagging System Resolution. 
If we receive persuasive information from the CITES Secretariat or other

the CITES Universal Tagging System Resolution, we will prohibit or 
restrict imports from such country(s) as appropriate for the 
conservation of the species.
    (F) At the time of import, for each shipment covered by this 
exception, the country of origin and each country of re-export involved 
in the trade of a particular shipment must not be subject to a Schedule 
III Notice of Information (see paragraph (g)(4) of this section) 
prohibiting or restricting imports of all wildlife or any members of the 
Order Crocodylia. A listing of all countries subject to such a Schedule 
III Notice of Information is available by writing to: Office of 
Management Authority, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Mail Stop ARLSQ-
700, Washington, DC 20240, or via e-mail at r9oma@fws.gov.
    (ii) Shipment of skulls, processed meat, and scientific specimens. 
The import, export, and re-export into/from the United States of skulls, 
processed meat, and scientific specimens of caiman is allowed without

of part 23 are met.
    (iii) Noncommercial accompanying baggage. The conditions described 
in paragraphs (g)(3)(i) and (ii) for skins, skulls, meat, other parts, 
and products made of specimens of caiman do not apply to non-commercial 
personal effects in accompanying baggage or household effects.
    (iv) Eggs and live specimens. This special rule does not apply to 
live specimens or eggs of caiman. Import of such specimens requires an 
import permit as described in 50 CFR 17.32.
    (4) When and how will we inform you of additional restrictions in 
trade of yacare caiman (Caiman yacare), the common caiman (Caiman 
crocodilus crocodilus), and the brown caiman (Caiman crocodilus fuscus)? 
Except in rare cases involving extenuating circumstances that do not 
adversely affect the conservation of the species, the Service will issue 
a Notice of Information announcing additional CITES restrictions in 
trade in specimens of caiman dealt with in this paragraph (g) if any of 
the following criteria are met:
    (i) The country is listed in a Notification to the Parties by the 
CITES Secretariat as not having designated Management and Scientific 
Authorities that issue CITES documents or their equivalent.
    (ii) The country is identified in any action adopted by the 
Conference of the Parties to the Convention, the Convention's Standing 
Committee, or in a Notification issued by the CITES Secretariat, whereby 
Parties are asked not to accept shipments of specimens of any CITES-
listed species from the country in question or of any crocodilian 
species listed in the CITES appendices.
    (iii) We determine, based on information from the CITES Secretariat 
or other reliable sources, that the country

[[Page 125]]

is not effectively implementing the CITES Universal Tagging System 
Resolution.
    (5) What are the approved information collection requirements in 
this rule? The Office of Management and Budget approved the information 
collection requirements contained in this special rule under the 
Paperwork Reduction Act and assigned clearance number 1018-0093 as part 
of the permit requirements contained in Part 23 of Title 50. We may not 
conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to respond to, a collection 
of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. 
The collection of information under this rule is done to provide 
information necessary to evaluate permit applications. We will use this 
information to review permit applications and make decisions, according 
to criteria established in various Federal wildlife conservation 
statutes and regulations, on the issuance, suspension, revocation, or 
denial of permits. You must respond to obtain or retain a permit. We 
estimate the public reporting burden for these reporting requirements to 
vary from 20 minutes to 2 hours per response, with an average of 1 hour 
per response, including time for reviewing instructions, gathering and 
maintaining data, and completing and reviewing the forms.

<R05>
Sec.  17.50  General.

    (a) Whenever a species which is not Endangered or Threatened closely 
resembles an Endangered or Threatened species, such species may be 
treated as either Endangered or Threatened if the director makes such 
determination in accordance with section 4(e) of the Act and the 
criteria of paragraph (b) of this section. After the Director has made 
such determination in accordance with the notification procedures 
specified in the Act, such species shall appear in the list in Sec.  
17.11 (Wildlife) or Sec.  17.12 (Plants) with the notation ``(S/A)'' 
(similarity of appearance) in the ``Status'' column, following either a 
letter ``E'' or a letter ``T'' to indicate whether the species is being 
treated as Endangered or Threatened.
    (b) In determining whether to treat a species as Endangered or 
Threatened due to similarity of appearance, the Director shall consider 
the criteria in section 4(e) of the Act, as indicated below:
    (1) The degree of difficulty enforcement personnel would have in 
distinguishing the species, at the point in question, from an Endangered 
or Threatened species (including those cases where the criteria for 
recognition of a species are based on geographical boundaries);
    (2) The additional threat posed to the Endangered or Threatened 
species by the loss of control occasioned because of the similarity of 
appearance; and
    (3) The probability that so designating a similar species will 
substantially facilitate enforcement and further the purposes and policy 
of the Act.

    Example 1. The ABC sparrow is Endangered wildlife. The ABD sparrow 
is a subspecies that is so similar to the ABC sparrow that when found 
outside their normal habitat, the two cannot readily be distinguished by 
law enforcement personnel. The ABD sparrow is

listed in Sec.  17.11, after following the proper procedures as follows:

    Example 2. Suppose the ABC sparrow is listed as Endangered in only a 
portion of its range. Within the meaning of the Act, the ABC sparrow as 
defined by geographic boundaries is a species. The ABC sparrow which 
occurs beyond those boundaries is a different species, even though it is 
identical, except in location, to the listed species. If the criteria of 
this section were met, the two species would be listed as follows:

    Example 3. The XY cactus has been determined to be an Endangered 
species. The XZ cactus so closely resembles the XY cactus that 
enforcement personnel cannot distinguish between the two. The Endangered 
XY cactus could be illegally sold as the non-endangered XZ species, thus 
posing an additional threat to the Endangered species. After following 
the proper procedures, the XZ cactus would be placed on the list and 
treated as though it was an Endangered species. This entry would appear 
as follows:

Sec.  17.52  Permits--similarity of appearance.

    Upon receipt of a complete application and unless otherwise 
indicated in a special rule, the Director may issue permits for any 
activity otherwise prohibited with a species designated as Endangered or 
Threatened due to its similarity of appearance. Such a permit may 
authorize a single transaction, a series of transactions, or a number of 
activities over a specified period of time.
    (a) Application requirements. An application for a permit under this 
section must be submitted to the Director by the person who wishes to 
engage in the prohibited activity. The permit for activities involving 
interstate commerce of plants must be obtained by the seller; in the 
case of wildlife, the permit

[[Page 132]]

must be obtained by the buyer. The application must be submitted on an 
official application form (Form 3-200) provided by the Service, or must 
contain the general information and certification required by Sec.  
13.12(a) of this subchapter. It must include, as an attachment, all of 
the following information: Documentary evidence, sworn affidavits, or 
other information to show species identification and the origin of the 
wildlife or plant in question. This information may be in the form of 
hunting licenses, hide seals, official stamps, export documents, bills 
of sales, certification, expert opinion, or other appropriate 
information.
    (b) Issuance criteria. Upon receiving an application completed in 
accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the Director will decide 
whether or not a permit should be issued. In making his decision, the 
Director shall consider, in addition to the general criteria, in Sec.  
13.21(b) of this subchapter, the following factors:
    (1) Whether the information submitted by the applicant appears 
reliable;
    (2) Whether the information submitted by the applicant adequately 
identifies the wildlife or plant in question so as to distinguish it 
from any Endangered or Threatened wildlife or plant.
    (c) Permit conditions. In addition to the general conditions set 
forth in part 13 of this subchapter, every permit issued under this 
section shall be subject to the following special conditions:
    (1) If indicated in the permit, a special mark, to be specified in 
the permit, must be applied to the wildlife or plant, and remain for the 
time designated in the permit;
    (2) A copy of the permit or an identification label, which includes 
the scientific name and the permit number, must accompany the wildlife 
or plant or its container during the course of any activity subject to 
these regulations.
    (d) Duration of permits. The duration of a permit issued under this 
section shall be designated on the face of the permit.

Sec.  17.80  Definitions.

    (a) The term experimental population means an introduced and/or 
designated population (including any off-spring arising solely 
therefrom) that has been so designated in accordance with the procedures 
of this subpart but only when, and at such times as the population is 
wholly separate geographically from nonexperimental populations of the 
same species. Where part of an experimental population overlaps with 
natural populations of the same species on a particular occasion, but is 
wholly separate at other times, specimens of the experimental population 
will not be recognized as such while in the area of overlap. That is, 
experimental status will only be recognized outside the areas of 
overlap. Thus, such a population shall be treated as experimental only 
when the times of geographic separation are reasonably predictable; 
e.g., fixed migration patterns, natural or man-made barriers. A 
population is not treated as experimental if total separation will occur 
solely as a

[[Page 140]]

result of random and unpredictable events.
    (b) The term essential experimental population means an experimental 
population whose loss would be likely to appreciably reduce the 
likelihood of the survival of the species in the wild. All other 
experimental populations are to be classified as nonessential.


<R05>
Sec.  17.81  Listing.

    (a) The Secretary may designate as an experimental population a 
population of endangered or threatened species that has been or will be 
released into suitable natural habitat outside the species' current 
natural range (but within its probable historic range, absent a finding 
by the Director in the extreme case that the primary habitat of the 
species has been unsuitably and irreversibly altered or destroyed), 
subject to the further conditions specified in this section; provided, 
that all designations of experimental populations must proceed by 
regulation adopted in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553 and the requirements 
of this subpart.
    (b) Before authorizing the release as an experimental population of 
any population (including eggs, propagules, or individuals) of an 
endangered or threatened species, and before authorizing any necessary 
transportation to conduct the release, the Secretary must find by 
regulation that such release will further the conservation of the 
species. In making such a finding the Secretary shall utilize the best 
scientific and commercial data available to consider:
    (1) Any possible adverse effects on extant populations of a species 
as a result of removal of individuals, eggs, or propagules for 
introduction elsewhere;
    (2) The likelihood that any such experimental population will become 
established and survive in the foreseeable future;
    (3) The relative effects that establishment of an experimental 
population will have on the recovery of the species; and
    (4) The extent to which the introduced population may be affected by 
existing or anticipated Federal or State actions or private activities 
within or adjacent to the experimental population area.

The Secretary may issue a permit under section 10(a)(1)(A) of the Act, 
if appropriate under the standards set out in subsections 10(d) and (j) 
of the Act, to allow acts necessary for the establishment and 
maintenance of an experimental population.
    (c) Any regulation promulgated under paragraph (a) of this section 
shall provide:
    (1) Appropriate means to identify the experimental population, 
including, but not limited to, its actual or proposed location, actual 
or anticipated migration, number of specimens released or to be 
released, and other criteria appropriate to identify the experimental 
population(s);
    (2) A finding, based solely on the best scientific and commercial 
data available, and the supporting factual basis, on whether the 
experimental population is, or is not, essential to the continued 
existence of the species in the wild;
    (3) Management restrictions, protective measures, or other special 
management concerns of that population, which may include but are not 
limited to, measures to isolate and/or contain the experimental 
population designated in the regulation from natural populations; and
    (4) A process for periodic review and evaluation of the success or 
failure of the release and the effect of the release on the conservation 
and recovery of the species.
    (d) The Fish and Wildlife Service shall consult with appropriate 
State fish and wildlife agencies, local governmental entities, affected 
Federal agencies, and affected private landowners in developing and 
implementing experimental population rules. When appropriate, a public 
meeting will be conducted with interested members of the public. Any 
regulation promulgated pursuant to this section shall, to the maximum 
extent practicable, represent an agreement between the Fish and Wildlife 
Service, the affected State and Federal agencies and persons holding any 
interest in land which may be affected by the establishment of an 
experimental population.

[[Page 141]]

    (e) Any population of an endangered species or a threatened species 
determined by the Secretary to be an experimental population in 
accordance with this subpart shall be identified by special rule in 
Sec. Sec.  17.84--17.86 as appropriate and separately listed in Sec.  
17.11(h) (wildlife) or Sec.  17.12(h) (plants) as appropriate.
    (f) The Secretary may designate critical habitat as defined in 
section (3)(5)(A) of the Act for an essential experimental population as 
determined pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Any designation 
of critical habitat for an essential experimental population will be 
made in accordance with section 4 of the Act. No designation of critical 
habitat will be made for nonessential populations. In those situations 
where a portion or all of an essential experimental population overlaps 
with a natural population of the species during certain periods of the 
year, no critical habitat shall be designated for the area of overlap 
unless implemented as a revision to critical habitat of the natural 
population for reasons unrelated to the overlap itself.


<R05>
Sec.  17.82  Prohibitions.

    Any population determined by the Secretary to be an experimental 
population shall be treated as if it were listed as a threatened species 
for purposes of establishing protective regulations under section 4(d) 
of the Act with respect to such population. The Special rules 
(protective regulations) adopted for an experimental population under 
Sec.  17.81 will contain applicable prohibitions, as appropriate, and 
exceptions for that population.


<R05>
Sec.  17.83  Interagency cooperation.

    (a) Any experimental population designated for a listed species (1) 
determined pursuant to Sec.  17.81(c)(2) of this subpart not to be 
essential to the survival of that species and (2) not occurring within 
the National Park System or the National Wildlife Refuge System, shall 
be treated for purposes of section 7 (other than subsection (a)(1) 
thereof) as a species proposed to be listed under the Act as a 
threatened species.
    (b) Any experimental population designated for a listed species that 
either (1) has been determined pursuant to Sec.  17.81(c)(2) of this 
subpart to be essential to the survival of that species, of (2) occurs 
within the National Park System or the National Wildlife Refuge System 
as now or hereafter constituted, shall be treated for purposes of 
section 7 of the Act as a threatened species. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, any biological opinion prepared pursuant to section 7(b) of 
the Act and any agency determination made pursuant to section 7(a) of 
the Act shall consider any experimental and nonexperimental populations 
to constitute a single listed species for the purposes of conducting the 
analyses under such sections.


<R05>
Sec.  17.84  Special rules--vertebrates.

    (a) Delmarva Peninsula fox squirrel (Sciurus niger cinereus). (1) 
The Delmarva Peninsula fox squirrel population identified in paragraph 
(a)(6) of this section is a nonessential experimental population.
    (2) No person shall take this species, except:
    (i) For educational purposes, scientific purposes, the enhancement 
of propagation or survival of the species, zoological exhibition, and 
other conservation purposes consistent with the Act and in accordance 
with applicable State fish and wildlife conservation laws and 
regulations; or
    (ii) Incidental to recreational activities.
    (3) Any violation of applicable State fish and wildlife conservation 
laws or regulations with respect to the taking of this species (other 
than incidental taking as described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this 
section) will also be a violation of the Endangered Species Act.
    (4) No person shall possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever, any such species taken in 
violation of these regulations or in violation of applicable State fish 
and wildlife laws or regulations or the Endangered Species Act.
    (5) It is unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, solicit 
another to commit, or cause to be committed, any offense defined in 
paragraph (a)(2) or (4) of this section.
    (6) The site for reintroduction of Delmarva Peninsula fox squirrel 
is totally

[[Page 142]]

isolated from existing populations of this species. The nearest extant 
population is in the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge approximately 
50 miles from the reintroduction site. The reintroduction site is within 
the historic range of this species and is located at the Assawoman 
Wildlife Area, Sussex County, Delaware. Observation of previous releases 
have shown that fox squirrels have not traveled more than 2 or 3 miles 
from release sites, therefore, the possibility of this population 
contacting extant wild populations is unlikely.
    (7) The reintroduced population will be checked periodically to 
determine its condition and the success of the reintroduction. Of 
special concern will be the establishment of breeding pairs and the 
reproductive success of the population. The movement patterns of the 
released individuals and the overall health of the population will also 
be observed.
    (b) Colorado squawfish (Ptychocheilus lucius) and woundfin 
(Plagopterus argentissimus). (1) The Colorado squawfish and woundfin 
populations identified in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, are 
experimental, nonessential populations.
    (2) No person shall take the species, except in accordance with 
applicable State or Tribal fish and wildlife conservation laws and 
regulations in the following instances:
    (i) For educational purposes, scientific purposes, the enhancement 
of propagation or survival of the species, zoological exhibition, and 
other conservation purposes consistent with the Act; or
    (ii) Incidental to otherwise lawful activities, provided that the 
individual fish taken, if still alive, is immediately returned to its 
habitat.
    (3) Any violation of applicable State or Tribal fish and wildlife 
conservation laws or regulations with respect to the taking of this 
species (other than incidental taking as described in paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii) of this section) will also be a violation of the Endangered 
Species Act.
    (4) No person shall possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export, by any means whatsoever, any such species taken in 
violation of these regulations or in violation of applicable State or 
Tribal fish and wildlife laws or regulations.
    (5) It is unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, solicit 
another to commit, or cause to be committed, any offense defined in 
paragraphs (b) (2) through (4) of this section.
    (6) All of the sites for reintroduction of Colorado squawfish and 
woundfin are totally isolated from existing populations of these 
species. The nearest population of Colorado squawfish is above Lake 
Powell in the Green and Colorado Rivers, an upstream distance of at 
least 800 miles including 6 mainstream dams, and 200 miles of dry 
riverbed. Woundfin are similarly isolated (450 miles distant, 200 miles 
of dry streambed and 5 mainstream dams). All reintroduction sites are 
within the probable historic range of these species and are as follows:

                           Colorado Squawfish

    (i) Arizona: Gila County. Salt River from Roosevelt Dam upstream to 
U.S Highway 60 bridge.
    (ii) Arizona: Gila and Yavapai Counties. Verde River from Horseshoe 
Dam upstream to Perkinsville.
    The lower segments of large streams which flow into these two 
sections of river may, from time to time, be inhabited by Colorado 
squawfish. Downstream movement of squawfish in these areas will be 
restricted by dams and upstream movement is limited by lack of suitable 
habitat.

                                Woundfin

    (i) Arizona: Gila and Yavapai Counties. Verde River from backwaters 
of Horseshoe Reservoir upstream to Perkinsville.
    (ii) Arizona: Graham and Greenlee Counties. Gila River from 
backwaters of San Carlos Reservoir upstream to Arizona/New Mexico State 
line.
    (iii) Arizona: Greenlee County. San Francisco River from its 
junction with the Gila River upstream to the Arizona/New Mexico State 
line.
    (iv) Arizona: Gila County. Tonto Creek, from Punkin Center upstream 
to Gisela.
    (v) Arizona: Yavapai County. Hassayampa River, from Red Cliff 
upstream to Wagoner.
    The movement of woundfin beyond these areas will be limited to the 
lower portion of larger tributaries where suitable habitat exists. 
Downstream movement is limited by

[[Page 143]]

dams, reservoirs, and dry streambed. Upstream movement from these areas 
is restricted due to the absence of habitat. Upstream areas are too cold 
and the gradient is too steep to support populations of woundfin.

    (7) The reintroduced populations will be checked annually to 
determine their condition. A seining survey will be used to determine 
population expansion or contraction, reproduction success, and general 
health condition of the fish.
    (c) Red wolf (Canis rufus). (1) The red wolf populations identified 
in paragraphs (c)(9)(i) and (c)(9)(ii) of this section are nonessential 
experimental populations.
    (2) No person may take this species, except as provided in 
paragraphs (c)(3) through (5) and (10) of this section.
    (3) Any person with a valid permit issued by the Service under Sec.  
17.32 may take red wolves for educational purposes, scientific purposes, 
the enhancement of propagation or survival of the species, zoological 
exhibition, and other conservation purposes consistent with the Act and 
in accordance with applicable State fish and wildlife conservation laws 
and regulations;
    (4)(i) Any person may take red wolves found on private land in the 
areas defined in paragraphs (c)(9) (i) and (ii) of this section, 
Provided that such taking is not intentional or willful, or is in 
defense of that person's own life or the lives of others; and that such 
taking is reported within 24 hours to the refuge manager (for the red 
wolf population defined in paragraph (c)(9)(i) of this section), the 
Park superintendent (for the red wolf population defined in paragraph 
(c)(9)(ii) of this section), or the State wildlife enforcement officer 
for investigation.
    (ii) Any person may take red wolves found on lands owned or managed 
by Federal, State, or local government agencies in the areas defined in 
paragraphs (c)(9) (i) and (ii) of this section, Provided that such 
taking is incidental to lawful activities, is unavoidable, 
unintentional, and not exhibiting a lack of reasonable due care, or is 
in defense of that person's own life or the lives of others, and that 
such taking is reported within 24 hours to the refuge manager (for the 
red wolf population defined in paragraph (c)(9)(i) of this section), the 
Park superintendent (for the red wolf population defined in paragraph 
(c)(9)(ii) of this section), or the State wildlife enforcement officer 
for investigation.
    (iii) Any private landowner, or any other individual having his or 
her permission, may take red wolves found on his or her property in the 
areas defined in paragraphs (c)(9) (i) and (ii) of this section when the 
wolves are in the act of killing livestock or pets, Provided that 
freshly wounded or killed livestock or pets are evident and that all 
such taking shall be reported within 24 hours to the refuge manager (for 
the red wolf population defined in paragraph (c)(9)(i) of this section), 
the Park superintendent (for the red wolf population defined in 
paragraph (c)(9)(ii) of this section), or the State wildlife enforcement 
officer for investigation.
    (iv) Any private landowner, or any other individual having his or 
her permission, may harass red wolves found on his or her property in 
the areas defined in paragraphs (c)(9) (i) and (ii) of this section, 
Provided that all such harassment is by methods that are not lethal or 
physically injurious to the red wolf and is reported within 24 hours to 
the refuge manager (for the red wolf population defined in paragraph 
(c)(9)(i) of this section), the Park superintendent (for the red wolf 
population defined in paragraph (c)(9)(ii) of this section), or the 
State wildlife enforcement officer, as noted in paragraph (c)(6) of this 
section for investigation.
    (v) Any private landowner may take red wolves found on his or her 
property in the areas defined in paragraphs (c)(9) (i) and (ii) of this 
section after efforts by project personnel to capture such animals have 
been abandoned, Provided that the Service project leader or biologist 
has approved such actions in writing and all such taking shall be 
reported within 24 hours to the Service project leader or biologist, the 
refuge manager (for the red wolf population defined in paragraph 
(c)(9)(i) of this section), the Park superintendent (for the red wolf 
population defined in paragraph (c)(9)(ii) of this section), or the 
State wildlife enforcement officer for investigation.

[[Page 144]]

    (vi) The provisions of paragraphs (4) (i) through (v) of this 
section apply to red wolves found in areas outside the areas defined in 
paragraphs (c)(9) (i) and (ii) of this section, with the exception that 
reporting of taking or harassment to the refuge manager, Park 
superintendent, or State wildlife enforcement officer, while encouraged, 
is not required.
    (5) Any employee or agent of the Service or State conservation 
agency who is designated for such purposes, when acting in the course of 
official duties, may take a red wolf if such action is necessary to:
    (i) Aid a sick, injured, or orphaned specimen;
    (ii) Dispose of a dead specimen, or salvage a dead specimen which 
may be useful for scientific study;
    (iii) Take an animal that constitutes a demonstrable but non-
immediate threat to human safety or that is responsible for depredations 
to lawfully present domestic animals or other personal property, if it 
has not been possible to otherwise eliminate such depredation or loss of 
personal property, Provided That such taking must be done in a humane 
manner, and may involve killing or injuring the animal only if it has 
not been possible to eliminate such threat by live capturing and 
releasing the specimen unharmed on the refuge or Park;
    (iv) Move an animal for genetic purposes.
    (6) Any taking pursuant to paragraphs (c) (3) through (5) of this 
section must be immediately reported to either the Refuge Manager, 
Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge, Manteo, North Carolina, 
telephone 919/473-1131, or the Superintendent, Great Smoky Mountains 
National Park, Gatlinburg, Tennessee, telephone 615/436-1294. Either of 
these persons will determine disposition of any live or dead specimens.
    (7) No person shall possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever, any such species taken in 
violation of these regulations or in violation of applicable State fish 
and wildlife laws or regulations or the Endangered Species Act.
    (8) It is unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, solicit 
another to commit, or cause to be committed, any offense defined in 
paragraphs (c) (2) through (7) of this section.
    (9)(i) The Alligator River reintroduction site is within the 
historic range of the species in North Carolina, in Dare, Hyde, Tyrrell, 
and Washington Counties; because of its proximity and potential 
conservation value, Beaufort County is also included in the experimental 
population designation.
    (ii) The red wolf also historically occurred on lands that now 
comprise the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The Park encompasses 
properties within Haywood and Swain Counties in North Carolina, and 
Blount, Cocke, and Sevier Counties in Tennessee. Graham, Jackson, and 
Madison Counties in North Carolina, and Monroe County in Tennessee, are 
also included in the experimental designation because of the close 
proximity of these counties to the Park boundary.
    (iii) Except for the three island propagation projects and these 
small reintroduced populations, the red wolf is extirpated from the 
wild. Therefore, there are no other extant populations with which the 
refuge or Park experimental populations could come into contact.
    (10) The reintroduced populations will be monitored closely for the 
duration of the project, generally using radio telemetry as appropriate. 
All animals released or captured will be vaccinated against diseases 
prevalent in canids prior to release. Any animal that is determined to 
be in need of special care or that moves onto lands where the landowner 
requests their removal will be recaptured, if possible, by Service and/
or Park Service and/or designated State wildlife agency personnel and 
will be given appropriate care. Such animals will be released back into 
the wild as soon as possible, unless physical or behavioral problems 
make it necessary to return the animals to a captive-breeding facility.
    (11) The status of the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge 
project will be reevaluated by October 1, 1992, to determine future 
management status and needs. This review will take into account the 
reproductive success of the

[[Page 145]]

mated pairs, movement patterns of individual animals, food habits, and 
overall health of the population. The duration of the first phase of the 
Park project is estimated to be 10 to 12 months. After that period, an 
assessment of the reintroduction potential of the Park for red wolves 
will be made. If a second phase of reintroduction is attempted, the 
duration of that phase will be better defined during the assessment. 
However, it is presently thought that a second phase would last for 3 
years, after which time the red wolf would be treated as a resident 
species within the Park. Throughout these periods, the experimental and 
nonessential designation of the animals will remain in effect.
    (d) Southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis). (1) Definitions. The 
definitions set out in Sec.  17.3 apply to this paragraph (d). For 
purposes of this paragraph--
    (i) The term defense-related agency action means an agency action 
proposed to be carried out directly by a military department, which does 
not have as its intended purpose the taking of southern sea otters. For 
purposes of this definition, the United States Coast Guard is not a 
military department.
    (ii) The term management zone means that area delineated in 
paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section which surrounds the translocation 
zone and separates the translocation zone from the existing range of the 
parent population and adjacent range where expansion of the parent 
population is necessary for the recovery of southern sea otters.
    (iii) The term member of the experimental population of southern sea 
otters includes any southern sea otter, alive or dead, found within the 
translocation zone or the management zone, and any part or product of 
any such southern sea otter.
    (iv) The term parent population means the population of southern sea 
otters existing along the central California coast north of the 
management zone.
    (v) The term translocation zone means the area delineated in 
paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section within which an experimental 
population of southern sea otters is released and contained.
    (vi) The term established experimental population of southern sea 
otters means a translocated population that meets the following 
criteria: An estimated combined minimum of 150 healthy male and female 
sea otters residing within the translocation zone, little or no 
emigration into the management zone occurring, and a minimum annual 
recruitment to the experimental population in the translocation zone of 
20 sea otters for at least 3 years of the latest 5-year period, or 
replacement yield sufficient to maintain the experimental population at 
or near carrying capacity during the post-establishment and growth phase 
or carrying capacity phase of the experimental population.
    (vii) The term stabilized population is a population of sea otters 
within the translocation zone at the conclusion of the movement of 
animals from the parent population, except for purposes of genetic 
enhancement, which (A) is equal to or greater than the number of otters 
that were released from the holding pens alive and healthy, or 70 
otters, whichever is less, and (B) is exhibiting growth. A stabilized 
population would represent the point at which the experimental 
population shifts from the transplant stage to the initial growth and 
reestablishment stage.
    (viii) The term carrying capacity means the ecological state in 
which the numbers of sea otters within the translocation zone remain 
relatively constant and in balance with the available food supply.
    (2) Description of experimental population. The experimental 
population of southern sea otters shall include all southern sea otters 
found within the translocation zone or the management zone. The Service 
will translocate no more than 70 southern sea otters during the first 
year, supplemented as necessary with up to 70 otters per year in 
subsequent years from the parent population to the translocation zone. 
Although a maximum of 250 southern sea otters may be moved from the 
parent population in order to establish the experimental population in 
the translocation zone, it is not likely that supplemental translocation 
after the initial 70 will involve more than small numbers of southern 
sea otters, although under this plan a maximum of 70 could be moved if 
needed in each year up to a total of 250. The majority

[[Page 146]]

of animals translocated each year will be weaned, immature sea otters 
with a sex ratio of about 4 to 1, females to males. Of the adult sea 
otters selected for translocation, approximately 3 out of every 4 
animals will be female.
    (3) Translocation process--(i) Capture. Capture locations will be 
selected primarily from the southern third of the range of the parent 
population. Sea otters will be captured using diver-held devices, dip 
nets, surface entangling nets, or other methods which may be proven to 
be safe and effective in the future. All captured otters will be tagged 
and examined by a veterinarian experienced in treating marine mammals.
    (ii) Transport. All animals to be translocated will be transported 
directly to the translocation zone or held in specially constructed 
holding facilities prior to their movement to the translocation zone. 
Access to and care of animals will be restricted to Federal and State 
personnel and designated agents directly involved with the 
translocation. Each captured animal will be placed in a carrying cage 
and transported by truck to the local airport, from which point they 
will be flown to the translocation zone. From there they will be trucked 
to the release site.
    (iii) Release. The animals will be released directly into the wild 
from their transport cages, or held for up to 5 days in secured floating 
pens at the release site. No more than 10 individuals will be held in 
any pen, and adult males will be held separately. When held in floating 
pens the animals will be released passively by opening the floating pens 
and allowing animals to leave at will.
    (iv) Monitoring. Monitoring will be conducted on both the parent 
population and the experimental population by State and Federal 
biologists and their designated agents. Monitoring the parent population 
will be done to determine the effects of removal of otters on the growth 
and range expansion or recession of the parent population. Monitoring of 
the parent population will continue at least through the translocation 
period and into the foreseeable future. Monitoring of the experimental 
population will begin with the first release of translocated otters and 
will continue at least until either the new population reaches the 
carrying capacity of the habitat and establishes an equilibrium density 
or the translocation is determined to have failed. Monitoring will 
include intensive studies of changes in key components of the nearshore 
ecosystem of the translocation zone including benthic organisms, kelp 
and finfish. Monitoring, using ground and aerial observations, will also 
include intensive observation and documentation of the movements, 
distribution, foraging and reproductive behavior, dispersal tendencies, 
growth and reproductive rates, prey selection, and social interactions 
of sea otters in the experimental population. Results of monitoring the 
experimental population and the parent population will also be compared 
and evaluated.
    (v) Protection. At least two law enforcement officers will be 
specifically assigned, at least for the initial three- to five-year 
period after the actual translocation of animals, to conduct patrols and 
prevent illegal taking of southern sea otters in the translocation zone. 
Cooperative enforcement arrangements will be developed with other 
agencies having law enforcement activities in the area such as the U.S. 
Coast Guard, National Marine Fisheries Service, California Department of 
Fish and Game, U.S. Navy, and National Park Service to assist with 
protecting the experimental population.
    (4) Translocation zone. (i) There is established a translocation 
zone for southern sea otters comprised of San Nicolas Island, Begg Rock, 
and the surrounding waters within the following coordinates:

                        N. Latitude/W. Longitude

33[deg]27.8[min]/119[deg]34.3[min]

    (iii) Prohibitions. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4)(iv), all 
of the provisions in Sec.  17.21 (a) through (f) shall apply to any 
member of the experimental population of southern sea otters within the 
translocation zone.
    (iv) Exceptions. The prohibitions of paragraph (d)(4)(iii) shall not 
apply to:
    (A) Any act by the Service, the California Department of Fish and 
Game, or an authorized agent of the Service or the California Department 
of Fish and Game that is necessary to effect the relocation or 
management of any southern sea otter under the provisions of this 
paragraph;
    (B) Any taking of a member of the experimental population of 
southern sea otters that is incidental to, and not the purpose of, the 
carrying out of a defense-related agency action as defined in paragraph 
(d)(1)(i) of this section; or
    (C) Any act authorized by a permit issued under Sec.  17.32.
    (5) Management zone. (i) There is established a management zone for 
southern sea otters comprised of all waters, islands, islets, and land 
areas seaward of mean high tide subject to the jurisdiction of the 
United States located south of Point Conception, California 
(34[deg]26.9[min] N. Latitude), except for any area within the 
translocation zone delineated in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section.

(d)(4)(ii) of this section.
    (iii) Prohibitions. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(5)(iv), all 
of the provisions in Sec.  17.21 (a) through (f) shall apply to any 
member of the experimental population of southern sea otters within the 
management zone.
    (iv) Exceptions. The prohibitions of paragraph (d)(5)(iii) shall not 
apply to:
    (A) Any act by the Service, the California Department of Fish and 
Game, or an authorized agent of the Service or the California Department 
of Fish and Game that is necessary to effect the relocation or 
management of any southern sea otter under the provisions of this 
paragraph;
    (B) Any taking of a member of the experimental population of 
southern sea otters that is incidental to, and not the purpose of, the 
carrying out of an otherwise lawful activity within the management zone 
delineated in paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section; or
    (C) Any act authorized by a permit issued under Sec.  17.32.
    (6) Containment. The following containment measures, listed in order 
of preference, will be employed to prevent significant emigration of 
southern sea otters from San Nicolas Island and occupation of habitat 
within the management zone:
    (i) Capture of animals within the management zone for return to the 
experimental population or to the range of the parent population using 
non-lethal means. If verified sightings of one or more sea otters are 
made at any location within the management zone, field crews will be 
mobilized as soon as weather and sea conditions permit, to capture and 
remove the otter(s) from the zone. Capture will be done by experienced 
State and/or Federal personnel or other designated agents, using one or 
more of the same techniques used in the translocation effort, such as 
diver-held devices; surface entangling nets; dip nets; or other 
effective methods which may be developed for capturing sea otters in the 
future. Animals either will be flown or moved by air-conditioned van to 
the release site.
    (ii) Artificial reduction of fecundity for some sea otters within 
the experimental population. [Reserved]
    (iii) Selective or random, non-lethal removal of members of the 
experimental population within the translocation zone. [Reserved]

Containment measures will be administered by the Fish and Wildlife 
Service's Office of Sea Otter Management and Coordination (OSOMC), in 
consultation and cooperation with the California Department of Fish and 
Game. The OSOMC will work closely with State biologists to remove otters 
from the management zone. Federal funding received through the normal 
appropriations process will be used for research, protection, and 
containment of the experimental population. Grants to the State of 
California under 16 U.S.C. 1535, may be employed to facilitate the 
measures outlined above. Public donations for management and containment 
of the experimental population will be accepted with assistance from the 
National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.
    (7) Effects of translocation on recovery and interagency 
cooperation--(i) Background. The Recovery Plan specifically describes 
the importance of translocation to the delisting of the southern sea 
otter under the Endangered Species Act. The Plan states:

    Sea otter translocation, if properly designed and implemented, 
should provide the necessary foundation for ultimately obtaining the 
Recovery Plan's objective and restoring the southern sea otter to a non-
threatened status and maintaining OSP by: (i) Establishing a second 
colony (or colonies) sufficiently distant from the present population 
such that a smaller portion of southern sea otters will be jeopardized 
in the event of a large-scale oil spill, and (ii) establishing a data 
base for identifying the optimal sustainable population level for the 
sea otter.


Thus the translocation, and establishment of a population of sea otters 
has been identified by the Recovery Plan as a critical action necessary 
for the recovery and delisting of the species. With regard to the 
relationship of a successful translocation to the initiation of a 
delisting action under the Endangered Species Act. The Plan states:

    Delisting should be considered when the southern sea otter 
population is stable or increasing at sustainable rates in a large 
enough area of their original habitat that only a small proportion of 
the population

[[Page 149]]

would be decimated by any single natural or man-caused catastrophe. To 
reach this point: (1) At least one additional population of sea otters 
must be established outside the current population range, (2) the 
existing population of sea otters and its habitat must be protected, and 
(3) the threat from oil spills or other major environmental changes must 
be minimized.


The successful establishment of the experimental population to be 
carried out pursuant to this rule should fully satisfy the first 
criterion specified above from the Recovery Plan, provided that the 
parent population is showing sustained growth and expanding its range 
from its present size and distribution. However, if such growth and 
expansion is not occurring, the establishment of a single new population 
may not be sufficient to satisfy the broader criterion that the 
population must be increasing at a sustainable rate in a large enough 
area of their original habitat that only a small proportion of the 
population would be decimated by any single natural or man-caused 
catastrophe.
    (ii) Effect on recovery. The translocation will not influence the 
legal status of the species until such time as the Service determines 
that the experimental population is established. Once established, other 
factors such as the status of the parent population and completion of 
other recovery tasks will be considered. If the experimental population 
becomes established and the other recovery tasks identified in the 
recovery plan for the southern sea otter are attained, the southern sea 
otter will be eligible for consideration for delisting in accordance 
with the requirements of 50 CFR 424.11(d). If a catastrophic event were 
to significantly diminish the parent population, the size of the 
experimental population would be a factor in determining whether or not 
the southern sea otter should remain listed as ``threatened'' or 
reclassified as ``endangered,'' or if relisting should be considered if 
a delisting action had been completed.
    (iii) Effect on interagency cooperation. In determining the 
likelihood of jeopardy or non-jeopardy opinions for proposed Federal 
actions that ``may affect'' southern sea otters, the probability of 
jeopardy determinations will decrease proportionally for comparable 
projects with comparable types of impacts as the experimental population 
grows from the point of being established toward the maximum number that 
its habitat can support, i.e., carrying capacity. Thus, there is an 
inverse relationship between the size of the experimental population 
(after being determined to be established) and the probability of 
jeopardy determinations associated with section 7 consultations under 
the Endangered Species Act for projects affecting either the parent or 
the experimental population. However, the status of the experimental 
population is not the only factor to be considered in section 7 
evaluations. The status of the parent population, as well as the 
cumulative impacts, baseline level of threats, and effects of the action 
on either population, will also be taken into account. In addition to 
considering the size of the experimental population, the contribution 
that such population could make toward helping restore a damaged parent 
population will also be a factor that will be considered during section 
7 evaluations. For section 7 purposes, once the translocated otters 
become stabilized and enter into the initial growth and reestablishment 
stage, but before meeting the criteria for an established population, 
the experimental population will have an existence value that will be 
taken into consideration both quantitatively and qualitatively. Its 
numbers will be added to those of the parent population for purposes of 
analyzing the impacts of a Federal action on the southern sea otter 
population. Moreover, during the initial growth and reestablishment 
stage, as part of the analysis of the impacts on the population as a 
whole, the impacts of proposed Federal actions will be analyzed to 
clearly determine the relative risk to each of the two populations 
(parent population and the experimental population).
    (8) Determination of a failed translocation. The translocation would 
generally be considered to have failed if one or more of the following 
conditions exists:
    (i) If, after the first year following initiation of translocation 
or any subsequent year, no translocated otters remain within the 
translocation zone and

[[Page 150]]

the reasons for emigration or mortality cannot be identified and/or 
remedied;
    (ii) If, within three years from the initial transplant, fewer than 
25 otters remain in the translocation zone and the reason for emigration 
or mortality cannot be identified and/or remedied;
    (iii) If, after two years following the completion of the transplant 
phase, the experimental population is declining at a significant rate 
and the translocated otters are not showing signs of successful 
reproduction (i.e., no pupping is observed); however, termination of the 
project under this and the previous criterion may be delayed if 
reproduction is occurring and the degree of dispersal into the 
management zone is small enough that the efforts to continue to remove 
otters from the management zone are acceptable to the Service and 
California Department of Fish and Game;
    (iv) If the Service determines, in consultation with the affected 
State and Marine Mammal Commission, that otters are dispersing from the 
translocation zone and becoming established within the management zone 
in sufficient numbers to demonstrate that containment cannot be 
successfully accomplished. This standard is not intended to apply to 
situations in which individuals or small numbers of otters are sighted 
within the management zone or temporarily manage to elude capture. 
Instead, it is meant to be applied when it becomes apparent that, over 
time, otters are relocating from the translocation zone to the 
management zone in such numbers that: (A) An independent breeding colony 
is likely to become established within the management zone, or (B) they 
could cause economic damage to fishery resources within the management 
zone. It is expected that the Service could make this determination 
within a year provided sufficient information is available;
    (v) If the health and well-being of the experimental population 
should become threatened to the point that the colony's continued 
survival is unlikely, despite the protections given to it by the 
Service, State, and applicable laws and regulations. An example would be 
if an overriding military action for national security was proposed that 
would threaten to devastate the colony and removal of the otters was 
determined to be the only viable way of preventing the loss of the 
individuals.
    (vi) If, based on any one of these criteria, the Service concludes, 
after consultation with the affected State and Marine Mammal Commission, 
that the translocation has failed to produce a viable, contained 
experimental population, this rulemaking will be amended to terminate 
the experimental population, and all otters remaining within the 
translocation zone will be captured and all healthy otters will be 
placed back into the range of the parent population. Efforts to maintain 
the management zone free of otters will be curtailed after all 
reasonable efforts have been made to remove all otters that are still 
within the management zone at the time of the decision to terminate the 
translocated population. A joint State-Service consultation will 
determine when all reasonable efforts have been made and additional 
efforts would be futile.
    (vii) Prior to declaring the translocation a failure, a full 
evaluation will be conducted into the probable causes of the failure. If 
the causes could be determined, and legal and reasonable remedial 
measures identified and implemented, consideration will be given to 
continuing to maintain the translocated population. If such reasonable 
measures cannot be identified and implemented, the results of the 
evaluation will be published in the Federal Register with a proposed 
rulemaking to terminate the experimental population.
    (e) Yellowfin madtom (Noturus flavipinnis).
    (1) Where is the yellowfin madtom designated as a nonessential 
experimental population (NEP)? We have designated two populations of 
this species as NEPs: the North Fork Holston River Watershed NEP and the 
Tellico River NEP.
    (i) The North Fork Holston River Watershed NEP area is within the 
species' historic range and is defined as follows: The North Fork 
Holston River watershed, Washington, Smyth, and Scott Counties, 
Virginia; South Fork Holston

[[Page 151]]

River watershed upstream to Ft. Patrick Henry Dam, Sullivan County, 
Tennessee; and the Holston River from the confluence of the North and 
South Forks downstream to the John Sevier Detention Lake Dam, Hawkins 
County, Tennessee. This site is totally isolated from existing 
populations of this species by large Tennessee River tributaries and 
reservoirs. As the species is not known to inhabit reservoirs and 
because individuals of the species are not likely to move 100 river 
miles through these large reservoirs, the possibility that this 
population could come in contact with extant wild populations is 
unlikely.
    (ii) The Tellico River NEP area is within the species' historic 
range and is defined as follows: The Tellico River, between the 
backwaters of the Tellico Reservoir (approximately Tellico River mile 19 
(30.4 kilometers) and Tellico River mile 33 (52.8 kilometers), near the 
Tellico Ranger Station, Monroe County, Tennessee. This species is not 
currently known to exist in the Tellico River or its tributaries. Based 
on its habitat requirements, we do not expect this species to become 
established outside this NEP area. However, if individuals of this 
population move upstream or downstream or into tributaries outside the 
designated NEP area, we would presume that they came from the 
reintroduced population. We would then amend this rule and enlarge the 
boundaries of the NEP area to include the entire range of the expanded 
population.
    (2) We do not intend to change the NEP designations to ``essential 
experimental,'' ``threatened,'' or ``endangered'' within the NEP areas. 
Additionally, we will not designate critical habitat for these NEPs, as 
provided by 16 U.S.C. 1539(j)(2)(C)(ii).
    (3) What activities are not allowed in the NEP areas?
    (i) Except as expressly allowed in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, 
all the prohibitions of Sec.  17.31 (a) and (b) apply to the fishes 
identified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (ii) Any manner of take not described under paragraph (e)(4) of this 
section is prohibited in the NEP area. We may refer unauthorized take of 
these fishes to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.
    (iii) You may not possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever any of the identified fishes, 
or parts thereof, that are taken or possessed in violation of paragraph 
(e)(3) of this section or in violation of the applicable State fish and 
wildlife laws or regulations or the Act.
    (iv) You may not attempt to commit, solicit another to commit, or 
cause to be committed any offense defined in paragraph (e)(3) of this 
section.
    (4) What take is allowed in the NEP area? Take of this species that 
is incidental to an otherwise legal activity, such as recreation (e.g., 
fishing, boating, wading, trapping, or swimming), forestry, agriculture, 
and other activities that are in accordance with Federal, State, and 
local laws and regulations, is allowed.
    (5) How will the effectiveness of these reintroductions be 
monitored? We will prepare periodic progress reports and fully evaluate 
these reintroduction efforts after 5 and 10 years to determine whether 
to continue or terminate the reintroduction efforts.
    (f) Guam Rail (Rallus owstoni). (1) The Guam rail population 
identified in paragraph (f)(7) of this section is a nonessential 
experimental population.
    (2) No person shall take this species, except:
    (i) In accordance with a valid permit issued by the Service under 
Sec.  17.32 for educational purposes, scientific purposes, the 
enhancement of propagation or survival of the species, zoological 
exhibition, and other conservation purposes consistent with the Act; or
    (ii) As authorized by the laws and regulations of the Commonwealth 
of the Northern Mariana Islands, after the Service has made the 
determination that the experimental population has become well 
established and occupies all suitable habitat island-wide.
    (3) Any employee of the Service, the Commonwealth of the Northern 
Mariana Islands Division of Fish and Wildlife, or the Guam Division of 
Aquatic and Wildlife Resources who is designated for such purposes, may, 
when acting in the course of official duties, take a Guam rail without a 
permit if such action is necessary to:

[[Page 152]]

    (i) Aid a sick, injured, or orphaned specimen;
    (ii) Dispose of a dead specimen;
    (iii) Salvage a dead specimen that may be useful for scientific 
study; or
    (iv) Take an animal that is responsible for depredations to personal 
property if it has not been possible to otherwise eliminate such 
depredations and/or loss of personal property, provided that such taking 
must be done in a humane manner and may involve injuring or killing the 
bird only if it has not been possible to eliminate depredations by live 
capturing and releasing the specimen unharmed in other suitable 
habitats.
    (4) Any violation of applicable commonwealth of the Northern Mariana 
Islands fish and wildlife conservation laws or regulations with respect 
to the taking of this species (other than taking as described in 
paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section) will also be a violation of the 
Endangered Species Act.
    (5) No person shall possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever, any such species taken in 
violation of these regulations or in violation of applicable 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands fish and wildlife laws or 
regulations or the Endangered Species Act.
    (6) It is unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, solicit 
another to commit, or cause to be committed, any offense defined in 
paragraphs (f) (2) through (5) of this section.
    (7) The sites for introduction of Guam rails on Rota, Commonwealth 
of the Northern Mariana Islands, are on an island separated from Guam by 
50 kilometers of ocean. The last known observation of an individual of 
this species occurred near the northern tip of Guam, which is closest to 
the island of Rota. No intermingling of these populations will occur 
since this species has been extirpated in the wild on Guam. The Rota 
release sites are of necessity outside the historic range of the Guam 
rail, as described in this regulation, because its primary range has 
been unsuitably and irreversibly destroyed by the brown tree snake.
    (8) The nonessential experimental population on Rota will be checked 
periodically by staff of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana 
Islands Division of Fish and Wildlife and cooperating staff from the 
University of Tennessee to determine dispersal patterns, mortality, and 
reproductive success. The overall success of the releases and general 
health of the population will also be assessed.
    (g) Black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes).
    (1) The black-footed ferret populations identified in paragraph 
(g)(9)(i) through (vii) of this section are nonessential experimental 
populations. We will manage each of these populations in accordance with 
their respective management plans.
    (2) No person may take this species in the wild in the experimental 
population area, except as provided in paragraphs (g)(3), (4), (5), and 
(10) of this section.
    (3) Any person with a valid permit issued by the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service (Service) under section 17.32 may take black-footed 
ferrets in the wild in the experimental population areas.
    (4) Any employee or agent of the Service or appropriate State 
wildlife agency designated for such purposes, acting in the course of 
official duties, may take a black-footed ferret in the wild in the 
experimental population areas if such action is necessary:
    (i) For scientific purposes;
    (ii) To relocate a ferret to avoid conflict with human activities;
    (iii) To relocate a ferret that has moved outside the Little Snake 
Black-footed Ferret Management Area/Coyote Basin Primary Management Zone 
or the Rosebud Sioux Reservation Experimental Population Area when that 
relocation is necessary to protect the ferret or is requested by an 
affected landowner or land manager, or whose removal is requested 
pursuant to paragraph (g)(12) of this section.
    (iv) To relocate ferrets within the experimental population area to 
improve ferret survival and recovery prospects;
    (v) To relocate ferrets from the experimental population areas into 
other ferret reintroduction areas or captivity;
    (vi) To aid a sick, injured, or orphaned animal; or

[[Page 153]]

    (vii) To salvage a dead specimen for scientific purposes.
    (5) A person may take a ferret in the wild within the experimental 
population areas, provided such take is incidental to and not the 
purpose of, the carrying out of an otherwise lawful activity and if such 
ferret injury or mortality was unavoidable, unintentional, and did not 
result from negligent conduct. Such conduct is not considered 
intentional or ``knowing take'' for the purposes of this regulation, and 
the Service will not take legal action for such conduct. However, we 
will refer cases of knowing take to the appropriate authorities for 
prosecution.
    (6) You must report any taking pursuant to paragraphs (g)(3), 
(4)(vi) and (vii), and (5) of this section to the appropriate Service 
Field Supervisor, who will determine the disposition of any live or dead 
specimens.
    (i) Report such taking in the Shirley Basin/Medicine Bow 
experimental population area to the Field Supervisor, Ecological 
Services, Fish and Wildlife Service, Cheyenne, Wyoming (telephone: 307/
772-2374).
    (ii) Report such taking in the Conata Basin/Badlands experimental 
population area to the Field Supervisor, Ecological Services, Fish and 
Wildlife Service, Pierre, South Dakota (telephone: 605/224-8693).
    (iii) Report such taking in the northcentral Montana experimental 
population area to the Field Supervisor, Ecological Services, Fish and 
Wildlife Service, Helena, Montana (telephone: 406/449-5225).
    (iv) Report such taking in the Aubrey Valley experimental population 
area to the Field Supervisor, Ecological Services, Fish and Wildlife 
Service, Phoenix, Arizona (telephone: 602/640-2720).
    (v) Report such taking in the northwestern Colorado/northeastern 
Utah experimental population area to the appropriate Field Supervisor, 
Ecological Services, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Lakewood, Colorado 
(telephone: 303/275-2370), or Salt Lake City, Utah (telephone: 801/524-
5001).
    (vi) Report such taking in the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe 
Experimental Population Area to the Field Supervisor, Ecological 
Services, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Pierre, South Dakota 
(telephone 605/224-8693).
    (vii) Report such taking in the Rosebud Sioux Reservation 
Experimental Population Area to the Field Supervisor, Ecological 
Services, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Pierre, South Dakota 
(telephone 605/224-8693).
    (7) No person shall possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever, any ferret or part thereof 
from the experimental populations taken in violation of these 
regulations or in violation of applicable State fish and wildlife laws 
or regulations or the Endangered Species Act.
    (8) It is unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, solicit 
another to commit, or cause to commit, any offense defined in paragraphs 
(g)(2) and (7) of this section.
    (9) The sites for reintroduction of black-footed ferrets are within 
the historical range of the species.
    (i) We consider the Shirley Basin/Medicine Bow Management Area on 
the attached map of Wyoming to be the core recovery area for this 
species in southeastern Wyoming. The boundaries of the nonessential 
experimental population are that part of Wyoming south and east of the 
North Platte River within Natrona, Carbon, and Albany Counties (see 
Wyoming map). All marked ferrets found in the wild within these 
boundaries prior to the first breeding season following the first year 
of releases constituted the nonessential experimental population during 
this period. All ferrets found in the wild within these boundaries 
during and after the first breeding season following the first year of 
releases comprise the nonessential experimental population, thereafter.
    (ii) We consider the Conata Basin/Badlands Reintroduction Area on 
the attached map for South Dakota to be the core recovery area for this 
species in southwestern South Dakota. The boundaries of the nonessential 
experimental population area occur north of State Highway 44 and BIA 
Highway 2 east of the Cheyenne River and BIA Highway 41, south of I-90, 
and west of State Highway 73 within Pennington, Shannon, and Jackson 
Counties, South Dakota. Any black-footed ferret found

[[Page 154]]

in the wild within these boundaries is part of the nonessential 
experimental population after the first breeding season following the 
first year of releases of black-footed ferret in the Reintroduction 
Area. A black-footed ferret occurring outside the experimental 
population area in South Dakota is considered as endangered but may be 
captured for genetic testing. We will dispose of the captured animal in 
one of the following ways if necessary:
    (A) We may return an animal genetically related to the experimental 
population to the Reintroduction Area or to a captive facility.
    (B) Under an existing contingency plan, we will use up to nine 
black-footed ferrets genetically unrelated to the experimental 
population in the captive-breeding program. If a landowner outside the 
experimental population area wishes to retain black-footed ferrets on 
his property, we will develop a conservation agreement or easement with 
the landowner.
    (iii) We consider the Northcentral Montana Reintroduction Area shown 
on the attached map for Montana to be the core recovery area for this 
species in northcentral Montana. The boundaries of the nonessential 
experimental population are those parts of Phillips and Blaine Counties, 
Montana, described as the area bounded on the north beginning at the 
northwest corner of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation on the Milk 
River; east following the Milk River to the east Phillips County line; 
then south along said line to the Missouri River; then west along the 
Missouri River to the west boundary of Phillips County; then north along 
said county line to the west boundary of Fort Belknap Indian 
Reservation; then further north along said boundary to the point of 
origin at the Milk River. All marked ferrets found in the wild within 
these boundaries prior to the first breeding season following the first 
year of releases constituted the nonessential experimental population 
during this period. All ferrets found in the wild within these 
boundaries during and after the first breeding season following the 
first year of releases comprise the nonessential experimental population 
thereafter. A black-footed ferret occurring outside the experimental 
area in Montana is initially considered as endangered but may be 
captured for genetic testing. We will dispose of the captured animal in 
one of the following ways if necessary:
    (A) We may return an animal genetically related to the experimental 
population to the reintroduction area or to a captive facility.
    (B) Under an existing contingency plan, we will use up to nine 
black-footed ferrets genetically unrelated to the experimental 
population in the captive-breeding program. If a landowner outside the 
experimental population area wishes to retain black-footed ferrets on 
his property, we will develop a conservation agreement or easement with 
the landowner.
    (iv) We consider the Aubrey Valley Experimental Population Area 
shown on the attached map for Arizona to be the core recovery area for 
this species in northwestern Arizona. The boundary of the nonessential 
experimental population area is those parts of Coconino, Mohave, and 
Yavapai Counties that include the Aubrey Valley west of the Aubrey 
Cliffs, starting from Chino Point, north along the crest of the Aubrey 
cliffs to the Supai Road (State Route 18), southwest along the Supai 
Road to Township 26 North, then west to Range 11 West, then south to the 
Hualapai Indian Reservation boundary, then east and northeast along the 
Hualapai Indian Reservation boundary to U.S. Highway Route 66; then 
southeast along Route 66 for approximately 6 km (2.3 miles) to a point 
intercepting the east boundary of section 27, Township 25 North, Range 9 
West; then south along a line to where the Atchison-Topeka Railroad 
enters Yampa Divide Canyon; then southeast along the Atchison-Topeka 
Railroad alignment to the intersection of the Range 9 West/Range 8 West 
boundary; then south to the SE corner of section 12, Township 24 North, 
Range 9 West; then southeast to SE corner section 20, Township 24 West, 
Range 8 West; then south to the SE corner section 29, Township 24 North, 
Range 8 West; then southeast to the half section point on the east 
boundary line of section 33, Township 24 North, Range 8 West; then 
northeast

[[Page 155]]

to the SE corner of section 27, Township 24 North, Range 8 West; then 
southeast to the SE corner Section 35, Township 24 North, Range 8 West; 
then southeast to the half section point on the east boundary line of 
section 12, Township 23 North, Range 8 West; then southeast to the SE 
corner of section 8, Township 23 North, Range 7 West; then southeast to 
the SE corner of section 16, Township 23 North, Range 7 West; then east 
to the half section point of the north boundary line of section 14, 
Township 23 North, Range 7 West; then south to the half section point on 
the north boundary line of section 26, Township 23 North, Range 7 West; 
then east along section line to route 66; then southeast along route 66 
to the point of origin at Chino Point. Any black-footed ferrets found in 
the wild within these boundaries is part of the nonessential 
experimental population after the first breeding season following the 
first year of releases of ferrets into the reintroduction area. A black-
footed ferret occurring outside the experimental area in Arizona is 
initially considered as endangered but may be captured for genetic 
testing. We will dispose of the captured animal in one of the following 
ways if necessary:
    (A) We may return an animal genetically related to the experimental 
population to the reintroduction area or to a captive facility. If a 
landowner outside the experimental population area wishes to retain 
black-footed ferrets on his property, we will develop a conservation 
agreement or easement with the landowner.
    (B) Under an existing contingency plan, we will use up to nine 
black-footed ferrets genetically unrelated to the experimental 
population in the captive-breeding program. If a landowner outside the 
experimental population area wishes to retain black-footed ferrets on 
his property, we will develop a conservation agreement or easement with 
the landowner.
    (v) We consider the Little Snake Black-footed Ferret Management Area 
in Colorado and the Coyote Basin Black-footed Ferret Primary Management 
Zone in Utah as the initial recovery sites for this species within the 
Northwestern Colorado/Northeastern Utah Experimental Population Area 
(see Colorado/Utah map). The boundaries of the nonessential Experimental 
Population Area will be all of Moffat and Rio Blanco Counties in 
Colorado west of Colorado State Highway 13; all of Uintah and Duchesne 
Counties in Utah; and in Sweetwater County, Wyoming, the line between 
Range 96 and 97 West (eastern edge), Range 102 and 103 West (western 
edge), and Township 14 and 15 North (northern edge). All marked ferrets 
found in the wild within these boundaries prior to the first breeding 
season following the first year of release will constitute the 
nonessential experimental population during this period. All ferrets 
found in the wild within these boundaries during and after the first 
breeding season following the first year of releases of ferrets into the 
reintroduction area will comprise the nonessential experimental 
population thereafter. A black-footed ferret occurring outside the 
Experimental Population Area is initially considered as endangered but 
may be captured for genetic testing. We will dispose of the captured 
animal in one of the following ways if necessary:
    (A) We may return an animal genetically related to the experimental 
population to the Reintroduction Area or to a captive facility.
    (B) Under an existing contingency plan, we will use up to nine 
black-footed ferrets genetically unrelated to the experimental 
population in the captive-breeding program. If a landowner outside the 
experimental population area wishes to retain black-footed ferrets on 
his property, we will develop a conservation agreement or easement with 
the landowner.
    (vi) The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Reintroduction Area is shown on 
the map of north-central South Dakota at the end of paragraph (g) of 
this section. The boundaries of the nonessential experimental population 
area are the exterior boundaries of the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation 
which includes all of Dewey and Ziebach Counties, South Dakota. Any 
black-footed ferret found in the wild within these counties will be 
considered part of the nonessential experimental population after the 
first breeding season following the first year of black-footed

[[Page 156]]

ferret release. A black-footed ferret occurring outside the Experimental 
Population Area in north-central South Dakota would initially be 
considered as endangered but may be captured for genetic testing. When a 
ferret is found outside the Experimental Population Area, the following 
may occur:
    (A) If an animal is genetically determined to have originated from 
the experimental population, we may return it to the reintroduction area 
or to a captive-breeding facility.
    (B) If an animal is determined to be genetically unrelated to the 
experimental population, we will place it in captivity under an existing 
contingency plan. Up to nine black-footed ferrets may be taken for use 
in the captive-breeding program.
    (vii) The Rosebud Sioux Reservation Experimental Population Area is 
shown on the map of south-central South Dakota at the end of paragraph 
(g) of this section. The boundaries of the nonessential experimental 
population area include all of Gregory, Mellette, Todd, and Tripp 
Counties in South Dakota. Any black-footed ferret found within these 
four counties will be considered part of the nonessential experimental 
population after the first breeding season following the first year of 
black-footed ferret release. A black-footed ferret occurring outside the 
nonessential experimental population area in south-central South Dakota 
will initially be considered as endangered but may be captured for 
genetic testing. If necessary, disposition of the captured animal may 
occur in the following ways:
    (A) If an animal is genetically determined to have originated from 
the experimental population, we may return it to the reintroduction area 
or to a captive-breeding facility.
    (B) If an animal is determined to be genetically unrelated to the 
experimental population, we will place it in captivity under an existing 
contingency plan. Up to nine black-footed ferrets may be taken for use 
in the captive-breeding program.
    (10) Monitoring the reintroduced populations will occur continually 
during the life of the project, including the use of radio telemetry and 
other remote sensing devices, as appropriate. Vaccination of all 
released animals will occur prior to release, as appropriate, to prevent 
diseases prevalent in mustelids. Any animal that is sick, injured, or 
otherwise in need of special care may be captured by authorized 
personnel of the Service or appropriate State wildlife agency or their 
agents and given appropriate care. Such an animal may be released back 
to its appropriate reintroduction area or another authorized site as 
soon as possible, unless physical or behavioral problems make it 
necessary to return the animal to captivity.
    (11) We will reevaluate the status of the experimental population 
within the first five years after the first year of release of black-
footed ferrets to determine future management needs. This review will 
take into account the reproductive success and movement patterns of the 
individuals released into the area, as well as the overall health of the 
experimental population and the prairie dog ecosystem in the above 
described areas. We will propose reclassification of the black-footed 
ferret when we meet the appropriate recovery objectives for the species.
    (12) We will not include a reevaluation of the ``nonessential 
experimental'' designation for these populations during our review of 
the initial five year reintroduction program. We do not foresee any 
likely situation justifying alteration of the nonessential experimental 
status of these populations. Should any such alteration prove necessary 
and it results in a substantial modification to black-footed ferret 
management on non-Federal lands, any private landowner who consented to 
the introduction of black-footed ferrets on their lands may rescind 
their consent, and at their request, we will relocate the ferrets 
pursuant to paragraph (g)(4)(iii) of this section.

    (h) Whooping crane (Grus americana). (1) The whooping crane 
populations identified in paragraphs (h)(9)(i) through (iii) of this 
section are nonessential experimental populations.

[[Page 164]]

    (2) No person may take this species in the wild in the experimental 
population areas except when such take is accidental and incidental to 
an otherwise lawful activity, or as provided in paragraphs (h)(3) and 
(4) of this section. Examples of otherwise lawful activities include, 
but are not limited to, agricultural practices, pesticide application, 
water management, construction, recreation, trapping, or hunting, when 
such activities are in full compliance with all applicable laws and 
regulations.
    (3) Any person with a valid permit issued by the Fish and Wildlife 
Service (Service) under Sec.  17.32 may take whooping cranes in the wild 
in the experimental population area for educational purposes, scientific 
purposes, the enhancement of propagation or survival of the species, and 
other conservation purposes consistent with the Act and in accordance 
with applicable State fish and wildlife conservation laws and 
regulations.
    (4) Any employee or agent of the Service or State wildlife agency 
who is designated for such purposes, when acting in the course of 
official duties, may take a whooping crane in the wild in the 
experimental population area if such action is necessary to:
    (i) Relocate a whooping crane to avoid conflict with human 
activities;
    (ii) Relocate a whooping crane that has moved outside the eastern 
U.S. population area identified in paragraph (h)(9)(iii) of this 
section, or the Kissimmee Prairie or Rocky Mountain range of the 
experimental populations, when removal is necessary or requested and is 
authorized by a valid permit under Sec.  17.22;
    (iii) Relocate whooping cranes within the experimental population 
areas to improve survival and recovery prospects;
    (iv) Relocate whooping cranes from the experimental population areas 
into captivity;
    (v) Aid a sick, injured, or orphaned specimen; or
    (vi) Dispose of a dead specimen, or salvage a dead specimen which 
may be useful for scientific study.
    (5) Any taking pursuant to paragraphs (h)(3) and (4) of this section 
must be immediately reported to the National Whooping Crane Coordinator, 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O. Box 100, Austwell, Texas 77950 
(Phone: 361-286-3559), who, in conjunction with his counterpart in the 
Canadian Wildlife Service, will determine the disposition of any live or 
dead specimens.
    (6) No person shall possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever, any such species from the 
experimental populations taken in violation of these regulations or in 
violation of applicable State fish and wildlife laws or regulations or 
the Endangered Species Act.
    (7) It is unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, solicit 
another to commit, or cause to be committed, any offense defined in 
paragraphs (h) (2) through (6) of this section.
    (8) The Service will not mandate any closure of areas, including 
National Wildlife Refuges, during hunting or conservation order seasons 
or closure or modification of hunting or conservation order seasons in 
the following situations:
    (i) For the purpose of avoiding take of the nonessential 
experimental population identified in paragraph (h)(9)(iii) of this 
section;
    (ii) If a clearly marked whooping crane from the nonessential 
experimental population identified in (h)(9)(iii) wanders outside the 
designated NEP area. In these situations, the Service will attempt to 
capture the stray bird and return it to the appropriate area if removal 
is requested by the State.
    (9) All whooping cranes found in the wild within the boundaries 
listed in paragraphs (h)(9)(i) through (iii) of this section will be 
considered nonessential experimental animals. Geographic areas the 
nonessential experimental populations may inhabit include the 
following--
    (i) The entire State of Florida. The reintroduction site is the 
Kissimmee Prairie portions of Polk, Osceola, Highlands, and Okeechobee 
Counties. Current information indicates that the Kissimmee Prairie is 
within the historic range of the whooping crane in Florida.
    (A) No other natural populations of whooping cranes are likely to 
come into contact with the experimental

[[Page 165]]

population at Kissimmee Prairie. The only natural extant population, 
known as the Aransas/Wood Buffalo National Park population occurs well 
west of the Mississippi River. This population nests in the Northwest 
Territories and adjacent areas of Alberta, Canada, primarily within the 
boundaries of the Wood Buffalo National Park, and winters along the 
Central Texas Gulf of Mexico coast at Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. 
The only other extant eastern U.S. population is the nonessential 
experimental population described in paragraph (h)(9)(iii) of this 
section. Remnant individuals of the Rocky Mountain nonessential 
experimental population occur in the western United States as described 
in paragraph (h)(9)(ii) of this section.
    (B) Whooping cranes adhere to ancestral breeding grounds, leaving 
little possibility that individuals from the extant Aransas/Wood Buffalo 
National Park population will stray into Florida or the Rocky Mountain 
Population. Studies of whooping cranes have shown that migration is a 
learned rather than an innate behavior. The experimental population 
released at Kissimmee Prairie is expected to remain mostly within the 
prairie region of central Florida.
    (ii) The States of Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Utah, and the 
western half of Wyoming. Wooping cranes in this area do not come in 
contact with whooping cranes of the Aransas/Wood Buffalo Population; and
    (iii) That portion of the eastern contiguous United States which 
includes the States of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, 
Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, 
Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, 
West Virginia, and Wisconsin. (See map following paragraph (h)(11) of 
this section). Whooping cranes within this population are expected to 
occur mostly within the States of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, 
Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and Florida, which is within the historic 
range of the whooping crane in the United States. The additional States 
included within the experimental population area are those expected to 
receive occasional use by the cranes, or which may be used as breeding 
or wintering areas in the event of future population expansion. Whooping 
cranes in this population are not expected to come in contact with 
whooping cranes of the Aransas/Wood Buffalo National Park Population.
    (10) The reintroduced populations will be monitored during the 
duration of the projects by the use of radio telemetry and other 
appropriate measures. Any animal that is determined to be sick, injured, 
or otherwise in need of special care will be recaptured to the extent 
possible by Service and/or State wildlife personnel or their designated 
agent and given appropriate care. Such animals will be released back to 
the wild as soon as possible, unless physical or behavioral problems 
make it necessary to return them to a captive breeding facility.
    (11) The status of the experimental populations will be reevaluated 
periodically to determine future management needs. This review will take 
into account the reproductive success and movement patterns of the 
individuals released within the experimental population areas.

    (i) Gray wolf (Canis lupus). (1) The gray wolves (wolf) identified 
in paragraph (i)(7) of this section are nonessential experimental. These 
wolves will be managed in accordance with the respective provisions of 
this section.
    (2) The Service finds that reintroduction of nonessential 
experimental gray wolves, as defined in (i)(7) of this section, will 
further the conservation of the species.
    (3) No person may take this species in the wild in an experimental 
population area except as provided in paragraphs (i)(3), (7), and (8) of 
this section.
    (i) Landowners on their private land and livestock producers (i.e., 
producers of cattle, sheep, horses, and mules or as defined in State and 
tribal wolf management plans as approved by the Service) that are 
legally using public land (Federal land and any other public lands 
designated in State and tribal wolf management plans as approved by the 
Service) may harass any wolf in an opportunistic (the wolf cannot be 
purposely attracted, tracked, waited for, or searched out, then 
harassed) and noninjurious (no temporary or permanent physical damage 
may result) manner at any time, Provided that such harassment is non-
lethal or is not physically injurious to the gray wolf and is reported 
within 7 days to the Service project leader for wolf reintroduction or 
agency representative designated by the Service.
    (ii) Any livestock producers on their private land may take 
(including to kill or injure) a wolf in the act of killing, wounding, or 
biting livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules or as defined in 
State and tribal wolf management plans as approved by the Service), 
Provided that such incidents are to be immediately reported within 24 
hours to the Service project leader for wolf reintroduction or agency 
representative designated by the Service, and livestock freshly (less 
than 24 hours) wounded (torn flesh and bleeding) or killed by wolves 
must be evident. Service or other Service authorized agencies will 
confirm if livestock were wounded or killed by wolves. The taking of any 
wolf without such evidence may be referred to the appropriate 
authorities for prosecution.

[[Page 167]]

    (iii) Any livestock producer or permittee with livestock grazing 
allotments on public land may receive a written permit, valid for up to 
45 days, from the Service or other agencies designated by the Service, 
to take (including to kill or injure) a wolf that is in the act of 
killing, wounding, or biting livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules 
or as defined in State and tribal wolf management plans as approved by 
the Service), Provided that six or more breeding pairs of wolves have 
been documented in the experimental population area and the Service or 
other agencies authorized by the Service has confirmed that the 
livestock losses were caused by wolves and have completed agency efforts 
to resolve the problem. Such take must be reported immediately within 24 
hours to the Service project leader for wolf reintroduction or agency 
representative designated by the Service. There must be evidence of 
freshly wounded or killed livestock by wolves. Service or other Service 
authorized agencies will investigate and determine if the livestock were 
wounded or killed by wolves. The taking of any wolf without such 
evidence may be referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.
    (iv) Potentially affected States and tribes may capture and 
translocate wolves to other areas within an experimental population area 
as described in paragraph (i)(7), Provided the level of wolf predation 
is negatively impacting localized ungulate populations at an 
unacceptable level. Such translocations cannot inhibit wolf population 
recovery. The States and tribes will define such unacceptable impacts, 
how they would be measured, and identify other possible mitigation in 
their State or tribal wolf management plans. These plans must be 
approved by the Service before such movement of wolves may be conducted.
    (v) The Service, or agencies authorized by the Service, may promptly 
remove (place in captivity or kill) any wolf the Service or agency 
authorized by the Service determines to present a threat to human life 
or safety.
    (vi) Any person may harass or take (kill or injure) a wolf in self 
defense or in defense of others, Provided that such take is reported 
immediately (within 24 hours) to the Service reintroduction project 
leader or Service designated agent. The taking of a wolf without an 
immediate and direct threat to human life may be referred to the 
appropriate authorities for prosecution.
    (vii) The Service or agencies designated by the Service may take 
wolves that are determined to be ``problem'' wolves. Problem wolves are 
defined as wolves that in a calendar year attack livestock (cattle, 
sheep, horses, and mules) or as defined by State and tribal wolf 
management plans approved by the Service or wolves that twice in a 
calendar year attack domestic animals (all domestic animals other than 
livestock). Authorized take includes, but is not limited to non-lethal 
measures such as: aversive conditioning, nonlethal control, and/or 
translocating wolves. Such taking may be done when five or fewer 
breeding pairs are established in a experimental population area. If the 
take results in a wolf mortality, then evidence that the mortality was 
nondeliberate, accidental, nonnegligent, and unavoidable must be 
provided. When six or more breeding pairs are established in the 
experimental population area, lethal control of problem wolves or 
permanent placement in captivity will be authorized but only after other 
methods to resolve livestock depredations have been exhausted. 
Depredations occurring on Federal lands or other public lands identified 
in State or tribal wolf management plans and prior to six breeding pairs 
becoming established in an experimental population area may result in 
capture and release of the female wolf with pups, and her pups at or 
near the site of capture prior to October 1. All wolves on private land, 
including female wolves with pups, may be relocated or moved to other 
areas within the experimental population area if continued depredation 
occurs. Wolves attacking domestic animals other than livestock, 
including pets on private land, two or more times in a calendar year 
will be relocated. All chronic problem wolves (wolves that depredate on 
domestic animals after being moved once for previous domestic animal 
depredations) will be removed from the wild (killed or placed

[[Page 168]]

in captivity). The following three criteria will be used in determining 
the status of problem wolves within the nonessential experimental 
population area:
    (A) There must be evidence of wounded livestock or partial remains 
of a livestock carcass that clearly shows that the injury or death was 
caused by wolves. Such evidence is essential since wolves may feed on 
carrion which they found and did not kill. There must be reason to 
believe that additional livestock losses would occur if no control 
action is taken.
    (B) There must be no evidence of artificial or intentional feeding 
of wolves. Improperly disposed of livestock carcasses in the area of 
depredation will be considered attractants. Livestock carrion or 
carcasses on public land, not being used as bait under an agency 
authorized control action, must be removed or otherwise disposed so that 
it will not attract wolves.
    (C) On public lands, animal husbandry practices previously 
identified in existing approved allotment plans and annual operating 
plans for allotments must have been followed.
    (viii) Any person may take a gray wolf found in an area defined in 
paragraph (i)(7), Provided that the take is incidental to an otherwise 
lawful activity, accidental, unavoidable, unintentional, not resulting 
from negligent conduct lacking reasonable due care, and due care was 
exercised to avoid taking a gray wolf. Such taking is to be reported 
within 24 hours to a Service or Service-designated authority. Take that 
does not conform with such provisions may be referred to the appropriate 
authorities for prosecution.
    (ix) Service or other Federal, State, or tribal personnel may 
receive written authorization from the Service to take animals under 
special circumstances. Wolves may be live captured and translocated to 
resolve demonstrated conflicts with ungulate populations or with other 
species listed under the Act, or when they are found outside of the 
designated experimental population area. Take procedures in such 
instances would involve live capture and release to a remote area or 
placement in a captive facility, if the animal is clearly unfit to 
remain in the wild. Killing of wolves will be a last resort and is only 
authorized when live capture attempts have failed or there is clear 
endangerment to human life.
    (x) Any person with a valid permit issued by the Service under Sec.  
17.32 may take wolves in the wild in the experimental population area, 
pursuant to terms of the permit.
    (xi) Any employee or agent of the Service or appropriate Federal, 
State, or tribal agency, who is designated in writing for such purposes 
by the Service, when acting in the course of official duties, may take a 
wolf from the wild within the experimental population area, if such 
action is for:
    (A) Scientific purposes;
    (B) To relocate wolves to avoid conflict with human activities;
    (C) To relocate wolves within the experimental population areas to 
improve wolf survival and recovery prospects;
    (D) To relocate wolves that have moved outside the experimental 
population area back into the experimental population area;
    (E) To aid or euthanize sick, injured, or orphaned wolves;
    (F) To salvage a dead specimen which may be used for scientific 
study; or
    (G) To aid in law enforcement investigations involving wolves.
    (xii) Any taking pursuant to this section must be reported 
immediately (within 24 hours) to the appropriate Service or Service-
designated agency, which will determine the disposition of any live or 
dead specimens.
    (4) Human access to areas with facilities where wolves are confined 
may be restricted at the discretion of Federal, State, and tribal land 
management agencies. When five or fewer breeding pairs are in an 
experimental population area, land-use restrictions may also be employed 
on an as-needed basis, at the discretion of Federal land management and 
natural resources agencies to control intrusive human disturbance around 
active wolf den sites. Such temporary restrictions on human access, when 
five or fewer breeding pairs are established in an experimental 
population area, may be required between April 1 and June 30, within 1 
mile of active wolf den or rendezvous sites and would only apply to 
public lands or

[[Page 169]]

other such lands designated in State and tribal wolf management plans. 
When six or more breeding pairs are established in an experimental 
population area, no land-use restrictions may be employed outside of 
national parks or national wildlife refuges, unless wolf populations 
fail to maintain positive growth rates toward population recovery levels 
for 2 consecutive years. If such a situation arose, State and tribal 
agencies would identify, recommend, and implement corrective management 
actions within 1 year, possibly including appropriate land-use 
restrictions to promote growth of the wolf population.
    (5) No person shall possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever, any wolf or part thereof from 
the experimental populations taken in violation of the regulations in 
paragraph (i) of this section or in violation of applicable State or 
tribal fish and wildlife laws or regulations or the Endangered Species 
Act.
    (6) It is unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, solicit 
another to commit, or cause to be committed any offense defined in this 
section.
    (7) The site for reintroduction is within the historic range of the 
species:
    (i) The central Idaho area is shown on the following map. The 
boundaries of the nonessential experimental population area will be 
those portions of Idaho that are south of Interstate Highway 90 and west 
of Interstate 15, and those portions of Montana south of Interstate 90, 
Highway 93 and 12 from Missoula, Montana west of Interstate 15.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN91.007

    (ii) The Yellowstone Management Area is shown on the following map. 
The boundaries of the nonessential experimental population area will be 
that portion of Idaho that is east of Interstate Highway 15; that 
portion of Montana that is east of Interstate Highway 15 and south of 
the Missouri River from Great Falls, Montana, to the eastern Montana 
border; and all of Wyoming.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN91.008


[[Page 170]]


    (iii) All wolves found in the wild within the boundaries of this 
paragraph (i)(7) after the first releases will be considered 
nonessential experimental animals. In the conterminous United States, a 
wolf that is outside an experimental area (as defined in paragraph 
(i)(7) of this section) would be considered as endangered (or threatened 
if in Minnesota) unless it is marked or otherwise known to be an 
experimental animal; such a wolf may be captured for examination and 
genetic testing by the Service or Service-designated agency. Disposition 
of the captured animal may take any of the following courses:
    (A) If the animal was not involved in conflicts with humans and is 
determined likely to be an experimental wolf, it will be returned to the 
reintroduction area.
    (B) If the animal is determined likely to be an experimental wolf 
and was involved in conflicts with humans as identified in the 
management plan for the closest experimental area, it may be relocated, 
placed in captivity, or killed.
    (C) If the animal is determined not likely to be an experimental 
animal, it will be managed according to any Service approved plans for 
that area or will be marked and released near its point of capture.
    (D) If the animal is determined not to be a wild gray wolf or if the 
Service or agencies designated by the Service determine the animal shows 
physical or behavioral evidence of hybridization with other canids, such 
as domestic dogs or coyotes, or of being an animal raised in captivity, 
it will be returned to captivity or killed.
    (8) The reintroduced wolves will be monitored during the life of the 
project, including by the use of radio telemetry and other remote 
sensing devices as appropriate. All released animals will be vaccinated 
against diseases and parasites prevalent in canids, as appropriate, 
prior to release and during subsequent handling. Any animal that is 
sick, injured, or otherwise in need of special care may be captured by 
authorized personnel of the Service or Service-designated agencies and 
given appropriate care. Such an animal will be released back into its 
respective reintroduction area as soon as possible, unless physical or 
behavioral problems make it necessary to return the animal to captivity 
or euthanize it.
    (9) The status of the experimental population will be reevaluated 
within the first 3 years, after the first year of releases of wolves, to 
determine future management needs and if further reintroductions are 
required. This review will take into account the reproductive success 
and movement patterns of the individuals released in the area, as well 
as the overall health and fate of the experimental wolves. Once recovery 
goals are met for downlisting or delisting the species, a rule will be 
proposed to address downlisting or delisting.
    (10) The Service does not intend to reevaluate the ``nonessential 
experimental'' designation. The Service does not foresee any likely 
situation which would result in changing the nonessential experimental 
status until the gray wolf is recovered and delisted in the northern 
Rocky Mountains according to provisions outlined in the Act. However, if 
the wolf population does not demonstrate positive growth toward recovery 
goals for 2 consecutive years, the affected States and tribes, in 
cooperation with the Service, would, within 1 year, identify and 
initiate wolf management strategies, including appropriate public review 
and comment, to ensure continued wolf population growth toward recovery 
levels. All reintroduced wolves designated as nonessential experimental 
will be removed from the wild and the experimental population status and 
regulations revoked when (i) legal actions or lawsuits change the wolves 
status to endangered under the Act or (ii) within 90 days of the initial 
release date, naturally occurring wolves, consisting of two breeding 
pairs that for 2 consecutive years have each successfully raised two 
offspring, are discovered in the experimental population area. The 
naturally occurring wolves would be managed and protected as endangered 
species under the Act.
    (j) California condor (Gymnogyps californianus). (1) The California 
condor (Gymnogyps californianus) population identified in paragraph 
(j)(8) of this section is a nonessential experimental

[[Page 171]]

population, and the release of such population will further the 
conservation of the species.
    (2) You must not take any California condor in the wild in the 
experimental population area except as provided by this rule:
    (i) Throughout the entire California condor experimental population 
area, you will not be in violation of the Endangered Species Act (Act) 
if you unavoidably and unintentionally take (including killing or 
injuring) a California condor, provided such take is non-negligent and 
incidental to a lawful activity, such as hunting, driving, or 
recreational activities, and you report the take as soon as possible as 
provided under paragraph 5 below.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (3) If you have a valid permit issued by the Service under Sec.  
17.32, you may take California condors in the wild in the experimental 
population area, pursuant to the terms of the permit.
    (4) Any employee or agent of the Fish and Wildlife Service 
(Service), Bureau of Land Management or appropriate State wildlife 
agency, who is designated for such purposes, when acting in the course 
of official duties, may take a California condor from the wild in the 
experimental population area and vicinity if such action is necessary:
    (i) For scientific purposes;
    (ii) To relocate California condors within the experimental 
population area to improve condor survival, and to address conflicts 
with ongoing or proposed activities, or with private landowners, when 
removal is necessary to protect the condor, or is requested by an 
adversely affected landowner or land manager, or other adversely 
affected party. Adverse effects and requests for condor relocation will 
be documented, reported and resolved in as an expedient manner as 
appropriate to the specific situation to protect condors and avoid 
conflicts. Prior to any efforts to relocate condors, the Service will 
obtain permission from the appropriate landowner(s);
    (iii) To relocate California condors that have moved outside the 
experimental population area, by returning the condor to the 
experimental population area or moving it to a captive breeding 
facility. All captures and relocations from outside the experimental 
population area will be coordinated with Service Cooperators, and 
conducted with the permission of the landowner(s) or appropriate land 
management agency(s).
    (iv) To aid a sick, injured, or orphaned California condor;
    (v) To salvage a dead specimen that may be useful for scientific 
study; or
    (vi) To dispose of a dead specimen.
    (5) Any taking pursuant to paragraphs (j)(2), (j)(4)(iv), (j)(4)(v), 
and (j)(4)(vi), of this section must be reported as soon as possible to 
the Field Supervisor, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological 
Services, Arizona Field Office, Phoenix, 2321 W. Royal Palm Road, Suite 
103, Arizona (telephone 602/640-2720) who will determine the disposition 
of any live or dead specimens.
    (6) You must not possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever, any California condor or part 
thereof from the experimental population taken in violation of this 
paragraph (j) or in violation of applicable State or Tribal laws or 
regulations or the Act.
    (7) It is unlawful for you to attempt to commit, solicit another to 
commit, or cause to be committed, any offense defined in paragraphs 
(j)(2) and (j)(6) of this section.
    (8) The designated experimental population area of the California 
condor includes portions of three states--Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. The 
southern boundary is Interstate Highway 40 in Arizona from its junction 
with Highway 191 west across Arizona to Kingman; the western boundary 
starts at Kingman, goes northwest on Highway 93 to Interstate Highway 
15, continues northeasterly on Interstate Highway 15 in Nevada and Utah, 
to Interstate Highway 70 in Utah; where the northern boundary starts and 
goes across Utah to Highway 191; where the eastern boundary starts and 
goes south through Utah until Highway 191 meets Interstate Highway 40 in 
Arizona (See map at end of this paragraph (j)).
    (i) All California condors released into the experimental population 
area, and their offspring, are to be marked and visually identifiable by 
colored and coded patagial wing markers.

[[Page 172]]

    (ii) The Service has designated the experimental population area to 
accommodate the potential future movements of a wild population of 
condors. All released condors and their progeny are expected to remain 
in the experimental area due to the geographic extent of the 
designation.
    (9) The nonessential experimental population area includes the 
entire highway rights-of-way of the highways in paragraph (j)(8) of this 
section that constitute the perimeter boundary. All California condors 
found in the wild within these boundaries will comprise the experimental 
population.
    (i) The experimental population is to be monitored during the 
reintroduction project. All California condors are to be given physical 
examinations before being released.
    (ii) If there is any evidence that the condor is in poor health or 
diseased, it will not be released to the wild.
    (iii) Any condor that displays signs of illness, is injured, or 
otherwise needs special care may be captured by authorized personnel of 
the Service, Bureau of Land Management, or appropriate State wildlife 
agency or their agents, and given the appropriate care. These condors 
are to be re-released into the reintroduction area as soon as possible, 
unless physical or behavioral problems make it necessary to keep them in 
captivity for an extended period of time, or permanently.
    (10) The status of the reintroduction project is to receive an 
informal review on an annual basis and a formal evaluation within the 
first 5 years after the initial release, and every 5 years thereafter. 
This evaluation will include, but not be limited to: a review of 
management issues; compliance with agreements; assessment of available 
carrion; dependence of older condors on supplemental food sources; post 
release behavior; causes and rates of mortality; alternative release 
sites; project costs; public acceptance; and accomplishment of recovery 
tasks prescribed in California Condor Recovery Plan. The number of 
variables that could affect this reintroduction project make it 
difficult to develop criteria for success or failure after 5 years. 
However, if after 5 years the project is experiencing a 40 percent or 
greater mortality rate or released condors are not finding food on their 
own, serious consideration will be given to terminating the project.
    (11) The Service does not intend to pursue a change in the 
nonessential experimental population designation to experimental 
essential, threatened, or endangered, or modify the experimental 
population area boundaries without consulting with and obtaining the 
full cooperation of affected parties located within the experimental 
population area, the reintroduction program cooperators identified in 
the memorandum of understanding (MOU) for this program, and the 
cooperators identified in the agreement for this program.
    (i) The Service does not intend to change the status of this 
nonessential population until the California condor is recovered and 
delisted in accordance with the Act or if the reintroduction is not 
successful and the rule is revoked. No designation of critical habitat 
will be made for nonessential populations (16 U.S.C. Sec.  
1539(j)(2)(C)(ii).
    (ii) Legal actions or other circumstances may compel a change in 
this nonessential experimental population's legal status to essential, 
threatened, or endangered, or compel the Service to designate critical 
habitat for the California condors within the experimental population 
area defined in this rule. If this happens, all California condors will 
be removed from the area and this experimental population rule will be 
revoked, unless the parties to the MOU and agreement existing at that 
time agree that the birds should remain in the wild. Changes in the 
legal status and/or removal of this population of California condors 
will be made in compliance with any applicable Federal rulemaking and 
other procedures.

    (k) Mexican gray wolf (Canis lupus baileyi). (1) The Mexican gray 
wolf (Mexican wolf) populations reestablished in the Blue Range Wolf 
Recovery Area and in the White Sands Wolf Recovery Area, if used, within 
the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area, identified in paragraph 
(k)(9) of

[[Page 174]]

this section, are one nonessential experimental population. This 
nonessential experimental population will be managed according to the 
following provisions.
    (2) Based on the best available information, the Service finds that 
reintroduction of an experimental population of Mexican wolves into the 
subspecies' probable historic range will further the conservation of the 
Mexican wolf subspecies and of the gray wolf species; that the 
experimental population is not ``essential,'' under 50 CFR 17.81(c)(2); 
that the experimental population is wholly separate geographically from 
any other wild gray wolf population or individual wild gray wolves; that 
no wild Mexican wolves are known to exist in the experimental population 
area or anywhere else; and that future migration of wild Mexican wolves 
into the experimental population area is not possible.
    (3) No person, agency, or organization may ``take'' [see definition 
in paragraph (k)(15) of this section] any wolf in the wild within the 
Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area, except as provided in this 
rule. The Service may investigate each take of a Mexican wolf and may 
refer the take of a wolf contrary to this rule to the appropriate 
authorities for prosecution.
    (i) Throughout the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area, you 
will not be in violation of the Act or this rule for ``unavoidable and 
unintentional take'' [see definition in paragraph (k)(15) of this 
section] of a wolf. Such take must be non-negligent and incidental to a 
legal activity, such as military training and testing, trapping, 
driving, or recreational activities. You must report the take within 24 
hours to the Service's Mexican Wolf Recovery Coordinator or to a 
designated representative of the Service.
    (ii) Throughout the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area, you 
may ``harass'' [see definition in paragraph (k)(15) of this section ] 
wolves that are within 500 yards of people, buildings, facilities, pets, 
``livestock'' [see definition in paragraph (k)(15) of this section], or 
other domestic animals in an opportunistic, noninjurious manner [see 
definition of ``opportunistic, noninjurious harassment'' in paragraph 
(k)(15) of this section] at any time--provided that wolves cannot be 
purposely attracted, tracked, searched out, or chased and then harassed. 
You must report harassment of wolves within 7 days to the Service's 
Mexican Wolf Recovery Coordinator or to a designated representative of 
the Service.
    (iii) Throughout the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area, 
excluding areas within the national park system and national wildlife 
refuge system, no Federal agency or their contractors will be in 
violation of the Act or this rule for unavoidable or unintentional take 
of a wolf resulting from any action authorized by that Federal agency or 
by the Service, including, but not limited to, military training and 
testing. This provision does not exempt agencies and their contractors 
from complying with sections 7(a)(1) and 7(a)(4) of the Act, the latter 
of which requires a conference with the Service if they propose an 
action that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the 
Mexican wolf.
    (iv) In areas within the national park system and national wildlife 
refuge system, Federal agencies must treat Mexican wolves as a 
threatened species for purposes of complying with section 7 of the Act.
    (v) On private land anywhere within the Mexican Wolf Experimental 
Population Area, livestock owners or their agents may take (including 
kill or injure) any wolf actually ``engaged in the act of killing, 
wounding, or biting livestock'' [see definition in paragraph (k)(15) of 
this section]; provided that evidence of livestock freshly wounded or 
killed by wolves is present; and further provided that the take is 
reported to the Service's Mexican Wolf Recovery Coordinator or a 
designated representative of the Service within 24 hours.
    (vi) On tribal reservation land anywhere within the Mexican Wolf 
Experimental Population Area, livestock owners or their agents may take 
(including kill or injure) any wolf actually engaged in the act of 
killing, wounding, or biting livestock; provided that evidence of 
livestock freshly wounded or killed by wolves is present; and further 
provided that the take is reported to the Service's Mexican Wolf

[[Page 175]]

Recovery Coordinator or a designated representative of the Service 
within 24 hours.
    (vii) On ``public lands'' [see definition in paragraph (k)(15) of 
this section] allotted for grazing anywhere within the Mexican Wolf 
Experimental Population Area, including within the designated ``wolf 
recovery areas'' [see definition in paragraph (k)(15) of this section], 
livestock owners or their agents may be issued a permit under the Act to 
take wolves actually engaged in the act of killing, wounding, or biting 
``livestock'' [see definition in paragraph (k)(15) of this section]. 
Before such a permit is issued, the following conditions must be met--
livestock must be legally present on the grazing allotment; six or more 
``breeding pairs'' [see definition in paragraph (k)(15) of this section] 
of Mexican wolves must be present in the Blue Range Wolf Recovery Area; 
previous loss or injury of livestock on the grazing allotment, caused by 
wolves, must be documented by the Service or our authorized agent; and 
agency efforts to resolve the problem must be completed. Permits issued 
under this provision will be valid for 45 days or less and will specify 
the maximum number of wolves you are allowed to take. If you take a wolf 
under this provision, evidence of livestock freshly wounded or killed by 
wolves must be present. You must report the take to the Service's 
Mexican Wolf Recovery Coordinator or a designated representative of the 
Service within 24 hours.
    (viii) Throughout the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area, 
take of Mexican wolves by livestock guarding dogs, when used in the 
traditional manner to protect livestock on public, tribal, and private 
lands, is permitted. If you become aware that such take by your guard 
dog has occurred, you must report the take to the Service's Mexican Wolf 
Recovery Coordinator or a designated representative of the Service 
within 24 hours.
    (ix) Personnel authorized by the Service may take any Mexican wolf 
in the nonessential experimental population in a manner consistent with 
a Service-approved management plan, special management measure, or a 
valid permit issued by the Service under Sec.  17.32. This may include, 
but is not limited to, capture and translocation of wolves that--prey on 
livestock; attack pets or domestic animals other than livestock on 
private or tribal land; ``impact game populations in ways which may 
inhibit further wolf recovery'' [see definition in paragraph (k)(15) of 
this section]; prey on members of the desert bighorn sheep herd found on 
the White Sands Missile Range and San Andres National Wildlife Refuge so 
long as the State of New Mexico lists it as a species to be protected; 
are considered ``problem wolves'' [see definition in paragraph (k)(15) 
of this section]; are a nuisance; endanger themselves by their presence 
in a military impact area; need aid or veterinary care; or are necessary 
for authorized scientific, research, or management purposes. Lethal 
methods of take may be used when reasonable attempts to capture wolves 
alive fail and when the Service determines that immediate removal of a 
particular wolf or wolves from the wild is necessary. Authorized 
personnel may use leg-hold traps and any other effective device or 
method for capturing or controlling wolves to carry out any measure that 
is a part of a Service-approved management plan, notwithstanding any 
conflicts in State or local law. The disposition of all wolves (live or 
dead) or their parts taken as part of a Service-authorized management 
activity must follow provisions in Service-approved management plans or 
interagency agreements or procedures approved by the Service on a case-
by-case basis.
    (x) As determined by the Service to be appropriate, the Service or 
any agent so authorized by the Service may capture, kill, subject to 
genetic testing, place in captivity, euthanize, or return to the wild 
(if found to be a pure Mexican wolf) any feral wolf-like animal, feral 
wolf hybrid, or feral dog found within the Mexican Wolf Experimental 
Population Area that shows physical or behavioral evidence of 
hybridization with other canids, such as domestic dogs or coyotes; being 
an animal raised in captivity, other than as part of a Service-approved 
wolf recovery program; or being socialized or habituated to humans.

[[Page 176]]

    (xi) The United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service, Wildlife Services (WS) division will 
discontinue use of M-44's and choking-type snares in ``occupied Mexican 
wolf range'' [see definition in paragraph (k)(15) of this section]. The 
WS division may restrict or modify other predator control activities 
pursuant to a cooperative management agreement or a conference between 
the Service and the WS division.
    (xii) You may harass or take a Mexican wolf in self defense or 
defense of the lives of others, provided that you report the harassment 
or take within 24 hours to the Service's Mexican Wolf Recovery 
Coordinator or a designated representative of the Service. If the 
Service or an authorized agency determines that a wolf presents a threat 
to human life or safety, the Service or the authorized agency may kill 
it, capture and euthanize it, or place it in captivity.
    (xiii) Intentional taking of any wolf in the Mexican Wolf 
Experimental Population Area, except as described above, is prohibited. 
The Service encourages those authorized to take wolves to use nonlethal 
means when practicable and appropriate.
    (4) You must not possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever, any wolf or wolf part from 
the experimental population except as authorized in this rule or by a 
valid permit issued by the Service under Sec.  17.32. If you kill or 
injure a wolf or find a dead or injured wolf or wolf parts, you must not 
disturb them (unless instructed to do so by an authorized agent of the 
Service), you must minimize your disturbance of the area around them, 
and you must report the incident to the Service's Mexican Wolf Recovery 
Coordinator or a designated representative of the Service within 24 
hours.
    (5) You must not attempt to commit, solicit another to commit, or 
cause to be committed, any offense defined in this rule.
    (6) No land use restrictions will be imposed on private lands for 
Mexican wolf recovery without the concurrence of the landowner.
    (7) No land use restrictions will be imposed on tribal reservation 
lands for Mexican wolf recovery without the concurrence of the tribal 
government.
    (8) On public lands, the Service and cooperating agencies may 
temporarily restrict human access and ``disturbance-causing land use 
activities'' [see definition in paragraph (k)(15) of this section] 
within a 1-mile radius around release pens when wolves are in them, 
around active dens between March 1 and June 30, and around active wolf 
``rendezvous sites'' [see definition in paragraph 17.84(k)(15) of this 
section] between June 1 and September 30, as necessary.
    (9) The two designated wolf recovery areas and the experimental 
population area for Mexican wolves classified as a nonessential 
experimental population by this rule are described in the following 
subsections. Both designated wolf recovery areas are within the 
subspecies' probable historic range and are wholly separate 
geographically from the current range of any known Mexican wolves or 
other gray wolves..
    (i) The Blue Range Wolf Recovery Area includes all of the Apache 
National Forest and all of the Gila National Forest in east-central 
Arizona and west-central New Mexico (Figure 1). Initial releases of 
captive-raised Mexican wolves will take place, generally as described in 
our Preferred Alternative in the FEIS on Mexican wolf reintroduction, 
within the Blue Range Wolf Recovery Area ``primary recovery zone'' [see 
definition in paragraph (k)(15) of this section]. This is the area 
within the Apache National Forest bounded on the north by the Apache-
Greenlee County line; on the east by the Arizona-New Mexico state line; 
on the south by the San Francisco River (eastern half) and the southern 
boundary of the Apache National Forest (western half); and on the west 
by the Greenlee-Graham County line (San Carlos Apache Reservation 
boundary). The Service will allow the wolf population to expand into the 
Blue Range Wolf Recovery Area ``secondary recovery zone'' [see 
definition in paragraph (k)(15) of this section], which is the remainder 
of the Blue Range Wolf Recovery Area not in the primary recovery zone.

[[Page 177]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR12JA98.002

    (ii) The White Sands Wolf Recovery Area in south-central New Mexico 
includes all of the White Sands Missile Range; the White Sands National 
Monument; the San Andres National Wildlife Refuge; and the area adjacent 
and to the west of the Missile Range bounded on the south by the 
southerly

[[Page 178]]

boundary of the USDA Jornada Experimental Range and the northern 
boundary of the New Mexico State University Animal Science Ranch, on the 
west by the New Mexico Principal Meridian, on the north by the Pedro 
Armendaris Grant boundary and the Sierra-Socorro County line, and on the 
east by the western boundary of the Missile Range (Figure 2). This is 
the back-up reintroduction area, to be used only if later determined to 
be both necessary and feasible in accordance with the Preferred 
Alternative as set forth in the FEIS on Mexican wolf reintroduction. If 
this area is used, initial releases of captive-raised wolves would take 
place within the White Sands Wolf Recovery Area primary recovery zone. 
This is the area within the White Sands Missile Range bounded on the 
north by the road from the former Cain Ranch Head quarters to Range Road 
16, Range Road 16 to its intersection with Range Road 13, Range Road 13 
to its intersection with Range Road 7; on the east by Range Road 7; on 
the south by Highway 70; and on the west by the Missile Range boundary. 
The Service would allow the wolf population to expand into the White 
Sands Wolf Recovery Area secondary recovery zone, which is the remainder 
of the White Sands Wolf Recovery Area not in the primary recovery zone.

[[Page 179]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR12JA98.003

    (iii) The boundaries of the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population 
Area are the portion of Arizona lying north of Interstate Highway 10 and 
south of Interstate Highway 40; the portion of New Mexico lying north of 
Interstate Highway 10 in the west, north of the New Mexico-Texas 
boundary in the

[[Page 180]]

east, and south of Interstate Highway 40; and the portion of Texas lying 
north of United States Highway 62/180 and south of the Texas-New Mexico 
boundary (Figure 3). The Service is not proposing wolf reestablishment 
throughout this area, but only within the Blue Range Wolf Recovery Area, 
and possibly later in the White Sands Wolf Recovery Area, respectively 
described in paragraphs (k)(9) (i) and (ii) of this section. If a member 
of the nonessential experimental population is captured inside the 
Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area, but outside the designated 
wolf recovery areas, it will be re-released within the recovery area, 
put into the captive population, or otherwise managed according to 
provisions of a Service-approved management plan or action. If a wolf is 
found in the United States outside the boundaries of the Mexican Wolf 
Experimental Population Area (and not within any other wolf experimental 
population area) the Service will presume it to be of wild origin with 
full endangered status (or threatened in Minnesota) under the Act, 
unless evidence, such as a radio collar, identification mark, or 
physical or behavioral traits (see paragraph (k)(3)(x) of this section), 
establishes otherwise. If such evidence exists, the Service or an 
authorized agency will attempt to promptly capture the wolf and re-
release it within the recovery area, put it into the captive population, 
or carry out any other management measure authorized by this rule or a 
Service-approved management plan. Such a wolf is otherwise not subject 
to this rule outside the designated Mexican Wolf Experimental Population 
Area.

[[Page 181]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR12JA98.004

    (10) If Mexican wolves of the experimental population occur on 
public lands outside the designated wolf recovery area(s), but within 
the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area, the Service or an 
authorized agency will attempt to capture any radio-collared lone wolf 
and any lone wolf or

[[Page 182]]

member of an established pack causing livestock ``depredations'' [see 
definition in paragraph (k)(15) of this section]. The agencies will not 
routinely capture and return pack members that make occasional forays 
onto public land outside the designated wolf recovery area(s) and 
uncollared lone wolves on public land. However, the Service will capture 
and return to a recovery area or to captivity packs from the 
nonessential experimental population that establish territories on 
public land wholly outside the designated wolf recovery area(s).
    (11) If any wolves move onto private land outside the designated 
recovery area(s), but within the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population 
Area, the Service or an authorized agency will develop management 
actions in cooperation with the landowner including capture and removal 
of the wolf or wolves if requested by the landowner.
    (12) If any wolves move onto tribal reservation land outside the 
designated recovery area(s), but within the Mexican Wolf Experimental 
Population Area, the Service or an authorized agency will develop 
management actions in cooperation with the tribal government including 
capture and removal of the wolf or wolves if requested by the tribal 
government.
    (13) The Service will evaluate Mexican wolf reintroduction progress 
and prepare periodic progress reports, detailed annual reports, and full 
evaluations after 3 and 5 years that recommend continuation, 
modification, or termination of the reintroduction effort.
    (14) The Service does not intend to change the ``nonessential 
experimental'' designation to ``essential experimental,'' 
``threatened,'' or ``endangered'' and foresees no likely situation which 
would result in such changes. Critical habitat cannot be designated 
under the nonessential experimental classification, 16 U.S.C. 
1539(j)(2)(C)(ii).
    (15) Definitions. Key terms used in this rule have the following 
definitions.
    Breeding pair means an adult male and an adult female wolf that have 
produced at least two pups during the previous breeding season that 
survived until December 31 of the year of their birth.
    Depredation means the confirmed killing or wounding of lawfully 
present domestic livestock by one or more wolves. The Service, WS, or 
other Service-authorized agencies will confirm cases of wolf depredation 
on domestic livestock.
    Disturbance-causing land use activity means any land use activity 
that the Service determines could adversely affect reproductive success, 
natural behavior, or survival of Mexican wolves. These activities may be 
temporarily restricted within a 1-mile radius of release pens, active 
dens, and rendezvous sites. Such activities may include, but are not 
limited to--timber or wood harvesting, management-ignited fire, mining 
or mine development, camping outside designated campgrounds, livestock 
drives, off-road vehicle use, hunting, and any other use or activity 
with the potential to disturb wolves. The following activities are 
specifically excluded from this definition--
    (1) Legally permitted livestock grazing and use of water sources by 
livestock;
    (2) Livestock drives if no reasonable alternative route or timing 
exists;
    (3) Vehicle access over established roads to private property and to 
areas on public land where legally permitted activities are ongoing if 
no reasonable alternative route exists;
    (4) Use of lands within the national park or national wildlife 
refuge systems as safety buffer zones for military activities;
    (5) Prescribed natural fire except in the vicinity of release pens; 
and
    (6) Any authorized, specific land use that was active and ongoing at 
the time wolves chose to locate a den or rendezvous site nearby.
    Engaged in the act of killing, wounding, or biting livestock means 
to be engaged in the pursuit and grasping, biting, attacking, wounding, 
or feeding upon livestock that are alive. If wolves are observed feeding 
on a livestock carcass, you cannot assume that wolves killed the 
livestock because livestock can die from many causes and wolves will 
feed on carrion.
    Harass means ``intentional or negligent act or omission which 
creates the likelihood of injury to the wildlife by annoying it to such 
an extent as to

[[Page 183]]

significantly disrupt normal behavioral patterns which include, but are 
not limited to, breeding, feeding, or sheltering'' (50 CFR 17.3). This 
experimental population rule permits only ``opportunistic, noninjurious 
harassment'' (see definition below).
    Impact on game populations in ways which may inhibit further wolf 
recovery. The Service encourages states and tribes to define 
unacceptable impacts from wolf predation on game populations in Service-
approved management plans. Until such time the term will mean the 
following--2 consecutive years with a cumulative 35 percent decrease in 
population or hunter harvest estimates for a particular species of 
ungulate in a game management unit or distinct herd segment compared to 
the pre-wolf 5-year average (unit or herd must contain average of 
greater than 100 animals). If wolf predation is shown to be a primary 
cause of ungulate population declines (greater than 50 percent of 
documented adult or young mortality), then wolves may be moved to reduce 
ungulate mortality rates and assist in herd recovery, but only in 
conjunction with application of other common, professionally acceptable, 
wildlife management techniques.
    Livestock means cattle, sheep, horses, mules, and burros or other 
domestic animals defined as livestock in State and Tribal wolf 
management plans approved by the Service.
    Occupied Mexican wolf range means an area of confirmed presence of 
resident breeding packs or pairs of wolves or area consistently used by 
at least one resident wolf over a period of at least one month. The 
Service must confirm or corroborate wolf presence. Exact delineation of 
the area will be described by:
    (1) 5-mile (8 km) radius around all locations of wolves and wolf 
sign confirmed as described above (nonradio-monitored);
    (2) 5-mile (8 km) radius around radio locations of resident wolves 
when fewer than 20 radio locations are available (for radio-monitored 
wolves only); or
    (3) 3-mile (4.8 km) radius around the convex polygon developed from 
more than 20 radio locations of a pack, pair, or single wolf acquired 
over a period of at least 6 months (for radio-monitored wolves).
    This definition applies only within the Mexican Wolf Experimental 
Population Area.
    Opportunistic, noninjurious harassment (see ``harass'') means as the 
wolf presents itself (for example, the wolf travels onto and is observed 
on private land or near livestock). This is the only type of harassment 
permitted by this rule. You cannot track, attract, search out, or chase 
a wolf and then harass it. Any harassment must not cause bodily injury 
or death to the wolf. The basic intent of harassment permitted by this 
rule is to scare wolves away from the immediate area. It is limited to 
approaching wolves and discharging firearms or other projectile 
launching devices in proximity to but not in the direction of wolves; 
throwing objects in the general direction of but not at wolves; or 
making any loud noise in proximity to wolves.
    Primary recovery zone means an area where the Service--
    (1) Will release captive-raised Mexican wolves,
    (2) May return and re-release previously released Mexican wolves,
    (3) May release translocated wild-born Mexican wolves, and
    (4) Will actively support recovery of the reintroduced population.
    Problem wolves means wolves that--
    (1) Have depredated lawfully present domestic livestock,
    (2) Are members of a group or pack (including adults, yearlings, and 
young-of-the-year) that were directly involved in livestock 
depredations,
    (3) Were fed by or are dependent upon adults involved with livestock 
depredations (because young animals will likely acquire the pack's 
livestock depredation habits),
    (4) Have depredated domestic animals other than livestock on private 
or tribal lands, two times in an area within one year, or
    (5) Are habituated to humans, human residences, or other facilities.
    Public land means land under administration of Federal agencies 
including, but not limited to the National Park Service, Bureau of Land 
Management,

[[Page 184]]

Fish and Wildlife Service, Forest Service, Department of Energy, and 
Department of Defense; and State-owned lands within the boundary of a 
designated wolf recovery area. All State-owned lands within the boundary 
of the experimental population area, but outside designated wolf 
recovery areas, will be subject to the provisions of this rule that 
apply to private lands.
    Rendezvous site means a gathering and activity area regularly used 
by a litter of young wolf pups after they have emerged from the den. 
Typically, the site is used for a period ranging from about one week to 
one month in the summer. Several sites may be used in succession.
    Secondary recovery zone means an area adjacent to a primary recovery 
zone in which the Service allows released wolves to disperse, where 
wolves captured in the wild for authorized management purposes may be 
translocated and released, and where managers will actively support 
recovery of the reintroduced population.
    Take means``to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, 
capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct'' (16 
U.S.C. 1532(19)). Also, see definitions of ``harass'', ``opportunistic, 
noninjurious harassment'', and ``unavoidable and unintentional take.''
    Unavoidable and unintentional take means accidental, unintentional 
take (see definition of ``Take'') which occurs despite reasonable care, 
is incidental to an otherwise lawful activity, and is not done on 
purpose. Examples would be striking a wolf with an automobile and 
catching a wolf in a trap outside of known occupied wolf range. Taking a 
wolf with a trap, snare, or other type of capture device within occupied 
wolf range (except as authorized in paragraph (k)(3)(ix) and (x) of this 
section) will not be considered unavoidable, accidental, or 
unintentional take, unless due care was exercised to avoid taking a 
wolf. Taking a wolf by shooting will not be considered unavoidable, 
accidental, or unintentional take. Shooters have the responsibility to 
be sure of their targets.
    Wolf recovery area means a designated area where managers will 
actively support reestablishment of Mexican wolf populations.
    (l) Grizzly bear (Ursus arctos).
    (1) Where does this special rule apply? The special rule in this 
paragraph (l) applies to the designated Bitterroot Grizzly Bear 
Experimental Population Area (Experimental Population Area), which is 
found within the species' historic range and is defined as follows:

    The boundaries of the Experimental Population Area are delineated by 
U.S. 93 from its junction with the Bitterroot River near Missoula, 
Montana, to Challis, Idaho; Idaho 75 from Challis to Stanley, Idaho; 
Idaho 21 from Stanley to Lowman, Idaho; State Highway 17 from Lowman to 
Banks, Idaho; Idaho 55 from Banks to New Meadows, Idaho; U.S. 95 from 
New Meadows to Coeur d'Alene, Idaho; Interstate 90 from Coeur d'Alene, 
Idaho, to its junction with the Clark Fork River near St. Regis, 
Montana; the Clark Fork River from its junction with Interstate 90 near 
St. Regis to its confluence with the Bitterroot River near Missoula, 
Montana; and the Bitterroot River from its confluence with the Clark 
Fork River to its junction with U.S. Highway 93, near Missoula, Montana 
(See map at the end of this paragraph (l)).

    (2) What is the legal status of the grizzly bear? (i) The grizzly 
bear is listed as ``threatened'' in Sec.  17.11 (h) and protected under 
this part. However, the grizzly bear population to which this paragraph 
(l) applies is considered a nonessential experimental population in 
accordance with section 10(j) of the Act.
    (ii) We have determined that, as of December 18, 2000, no grizzly 
bear population exists in the Experimental Population Area. We find, in 
accordance with Sec.  17.81 (b), that the reintroduction of grizzly 
bears as a nonessential experimental population, as defined in Sec.  
17.81 (b), will further the conservation of the species and will be 
consistent with provisions of section 10(j) of the Act, which requires 
that an experimental population be geographically separate from other 
nonexperimental populations of the same species. We also find, in 
accordance with Sec.  17.81 (c)(2), that the experimental population of 
grizzly bears in the Experimental Population Area is not essential to 
the survival of the species in the wild.
    (iii) Grizzly bears within the Experimental Population Area and the 
Recovery Area will be accommodated

[[Page 185]]

through management provisions provided for in this paragraph (l) and 
through management plans and policies developed by the Citizen 
Management Committee (Committee; see paragraph (l)(6) of this section). 
After reintroduction, every grizzly bear found within the Experimental 
Population Area will be considered a member of the nonessential 
experimental population.
    (iv) In the conterminous United States, a grizzly bear that is 
outside the Experimental Population Area identified in paragraph (l)(1) 
of this section will be considered as threatened.
    (3) Where will grizzly bears be released, and where will recovery be 
emphasized? The Bitterroot Grizzly Bear Recovery Area identifies the 
area of recovery emphasis within the Experimental Population Area. The 
Recovery Area consists of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness and the Frank 
Church-River of No Return Wilderness (See map at the end of paragraph 
(l) of this section). All reintroductions will take place in the Selway-
Bitterroot Wilderness unless it is later determined that reintroduction 
in the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness is appropriate. If, in 
the future, new wilderness areas are designated adjacent to the Recovery 
Area, the Committee may recommend to the Secretary their addition to the 
Recovery Area. The Secretary would have to amend this paragraph (l) to 
change the definition of the Recovery Area.
    (4) What activities are prohibited in the Experimental Population 
Area? (i) You may not take (see definition in Sec.  10.12 of this 
subchapter) any grizzly bear in the Experimental Population Area, except 
as provided in this paragraph (l). We may refer unauthorized take of 
grizzly bears to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.
    (ii) You may not possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever any grizzly bear or parts 
thereof that are taken from the Experimental Population Area or 
possessed in violation of the regulations in this paragraph (l) or in 
violation of applicable State wildlife conservation laws or regulations 
or the Act.
    (iii) You may not attempt to commit, solicit another to commit, or 
cause to be committed, any offense defined in this paragraph (l).
    (5) What activities are allowed in the Experimental Population Area? 
(i) For purposes of this paragraph (l), except for persons engaged in 
hunting or shooting activities, you will not be in violation of the Act 
for ``unavoidable and unintentional take'' (see definition in paragraph 
(l)(16) of this section) of grizzly bears within the Experimental 
Population Area when such take is incidental to a legal activity and is 
not a result of negligent conduct lacking reasonable due care, and when 
due care was exercised to avoid the taking. Any taking must be reported 
within 24 hours to appropriate authorities as listed in paragraph 
(l)(5)(iii) of this section. Persons lawfully engaged in hunting or 
shooting activities must correctly identify their target before shooting 
in order to avoid illegally shooting a grizzly bear. Shooting a grizzly 
bear as a result of mistaking it for another species is considered a 
lack of reasonable due care. The act of taking a grizzly bear that is 
wrongly identified as another species may be referred to appropriate 
authorities for prosecution.
    (ii) Any person with a valid permit issued by us may take grizzly 
bears in the Experimental Population Area for scientific purposes, the 
enhancement of propagation or survival of the species, zoological 
exhibition, and other conservation purposes. Such permits must be 
consistent with the Act, with management plans adopted for the 
nonessential experimental population, and with applicable State wildlife 
conservation laws and regulations.
    (iii) You may take grizzly bears in the Experimental Population Area 
in self-defense or in defense of the lives of others. Such taking must 
be reported within 24 hours as to date, exact location, and 
circumstances to the Grizzly Bear Recovery Coordinator, University Hall, 
Room 309, University of Montana, Missoula, Montana 59812 (406-243-4903); 
or the Assistant Regional Director for Law Enforcement, Eastside Federal 
Complex, 911 NE 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232-4181 (503-231-6125); 
or the Assistant Regional Director for

[[Page 186]]

Law Enforcement, P.O. Box 25486, DFC, Denver, Colorado 80225 (303-236-
7540); and either the Idaho Department of Fish and Game, P.O. Box 25, 
Boise Idaho 83707 (208-334-3700); or the Montana Department of Fish, 
Wildlife and Parks, 1420 E. Sixth Avenue, Helena, Montana 59620 (406-
444-2535); and Nez Perce Tribal authorities (208-843-2253) (as 
appropriate).
    (iv) Livestock owners may obtain a permit from the Service, and the 
Idaho Department of Fish and Game, the Montana Department of Fish, 
Wildlife and Parks, or appropriate Tribal authorities to harass (see 
definition in Sec.  17.3) grizzly bears found in the Experimental 
Population Area that are actually pursuing or killing livestock (to 
include permitting the use of livestock guard dogs around livestock to 
harass such grizzly bears). Prior to issuance of such a permit, 
authorized State, Federal, or Tribal officials must document pursuit or 
killing of livestock. All such harassment must be accomplished by an 
opportunistic, noninjurious method (see definition of ``opportunistic, 
noninjurious harassment'' in paragraph (l)(16) of this section) to the 
grizzly bear, and such harassment must be reported within 24 hours as to 
date, exact location, and circumstances to the authorities listed under 
paragraph (l)(5)(iii) of this section.
    (v) Livestock owners may obtain a permit from the Service, and the 
Idaho Department of Fish and Game, the Montana Department of Fish, 
Wildlife and Parks or appropriate Tribal authorities to take grizzly 
bears on private lands found in the Experimental Population Area in a 
manner other than harassment as defined in this paragraph (l), in order 
to protect livestock actually pursued or being killed on private 
property. Prior to issuance of such a permit, authorized State, Federal, 
or Tribal officials must document pursuit or killing of livestock. Any 
response protocol established by the Committee must have been satisfied 
and efforts to capture depredating grizzly bears by Service or State or 
Tribal wildlife agency personnel must have proven unsuccessful. All such 
taking must be reported as to date, exact location, and circumstances 
within 24 hours to the authorities listed under paragraph (l)(5)(iii) of 
this section.
    (vi) Any authorized employee or agent of the Service or appropriate 
State wildlife agency or Nez Perce Tribe who is lawfully designated for 
such purposes, when acting in the course of official duties, may take a 
grizzly bear from the wild in the Experimental Population Area if such 
action is necessary to:
    (A) Aid a sick, injured, or orphaned grizzly bear;
    (B) Dispose of a dead grizzly bear, or salvage a dead grizzly bear 
that may be useful for scientific study;
    (C) Take a grizzly bear that constitutes a demonstrable but 
nonimmediate threat to human safety or that is responsible for 
depredations to lawfully present domestic animals or other personal 
property, if otherwise eliminating such depredation or loss of personal 
property has not been possible, and after eliminating such threat by 
live-capturing and releasing the grizzly bear unharmed in the area 
defined in paragraph (l)(2) of this section or other areas approved by 
the Committee has been demonstrated not to be possible;
    (D) Move a grizzly bear for genetic management purposes;
    (E) Relocate grizzly bears within the Experimental Population Area 
to improve grizzly bear survival and recovery prospects; or (F) Relocate 
a grizzly bear to avoid conflict with human activities. However, grizzly 
bears in the Experimental Population Area will not be disturbed unless 
they demonstrate a real and imminent threat to human safety, livestock, 
or bees. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, this rule provides 
that on private lands outside the national forest boundary in the 
Bitterroot Valley, Montana (exclusion area), any human/grizzly conflicts 
will be considered unacceptable. Grizzly bear occupancy will be 
discouraged in the exclusion area, and grizzly bears found there will be 
captured and returned to the Recovery Area, or placed in captivity, or 
destroyed, depending on the history of each bear. If a grizzly bear 
enters the exclusion area, State and Federal wildlife management 
agencies will attempt to capture it immediately and notify the public of 
its presence as soon as possible. The public

[[Page 187]]

will be kept updated until the bear is caught. Further, any grizzly bear 
that occupies inhabited human settlement areas on private land within 
the Experimental Population Area that, in the judgment of the management 
agencies or Committee, presents a clear threat to human safety or whose 
behavior indicates that it may become habituated to humans, will be 
relocated or destroyed by management agencies.
    (6) How will local citizens be involved in the management of the 
Bitterroot nonessential experimental grizzly bear population? (i) The 
Secretary will establish a Citizen Management Committee for the 
Bitterroot grizzly bear experimental population and will authorize 
management implementation responsibility as described in paragraph 
(l)(9) of this section, in consultation with the Governors of Idaho and 
Montana. As soon as possible after the effective date of this rule, the 
Secretary will organize the Committee by requesting nominations of 
citizen members from the Governors of Idaho and Montana and the Nez 
Perce Tribe and nominations of agency members by represented agencies.
    (ii) The Committee will be composed of 15 members serving 6-year 
terms. Appointments may initially be of lesser terms to ensure staggered 
replacement.
    (A) Membership will consist of seven individuals appointed by the 
Secretary based upon the recommendations of the Governor of Idaho, five 
members appointed by the Secretary based upon the recommendations of the 
Governor of Montana, one member representing the Nez Perce Tribe 
appointed by the Secretary based on the recommendation of the Nez Perce 
Tribe, one member representing the Forest Service appointed by the 
Secretary of Agriculture, and one member representing the Fish and 
Wildlife Service appointed by the Secretary. Members recommended by the 
Governors of Idaho and Montana will be based on the recommendations of 
interested parties and will include at least one representative each 
from the appropriate State wildlife agencies. If either Governor or the 
Tribe fails to make recommendations within 60 days, the Secretary (or 
his/her designee) will accept recommendations from interested parties, 
and will make the appointments.
    (B) The Committee will consist of a cross-section of interests 
reflecting a balance of viewpoints, and members are to be selected for 
their diversity of knowledge and experience in natural resource issues, 
and for their commitment to collaborative decision-making. In their 
recommendations to the Secretary, the Governors of Idaho and Montana 
will attach written documentation of the qualifications of those 
nominated relating to their knowledge of, and experience in, natural 
resource issues and their commitment to collaborative decision-making.
    (C) Except for the representatives from Federal agencies, the 
Committee will be selected from communities within and adjacent to the 
Recovery and Experimental Population Areas.
    (D) The Secretary will fill vacancies as they occur with the 
appropriate members based on the recommendation of the appropriate 
Governor, the Nez Perce Tribe, or agency.
    (7) Will independent scientific information be readily available to 
the Committee? The Secretary will appoint two scientific advisors to the 
Committee as nonvoting members to attend all meetings of the Committee 
and to provide scientific expertise to the Committee. These scientific 
advisors will not be employed by Federal agencies involved in grizzly 
bear recovery. The Secretary will contact the Wildlife Society Chapters 
in Idaho and Montana and the Universities of Idaho and Montana for 
nominations and will select one wildlife scientist representing each 
State and appoint them as advisors to the Committee.
    (8) What is the overall mission of the Committee, and how will it 
operate? (i) The mission of the Committee is to facilitate recovery of 
the grizzly bear in the Bitterroot ecosystem by assisting in 
implementing the Bitterroot ecosystem chapter of the recovery plan 
(Bitterroot Ecosystem Recovery Plan Chapter--Supplement to the Grizzly 
Bear Recovery Plan, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Missoula, Montana, 
1996). The Committee will make recommendations to land and wildlife 
management agencies that it believes will lead to recovery of the 
grizzly

[[Page 188]]

bear. Decisions on, and implementation of, these recommendations are the 
responsibility of the land and wildlife management agencies.
    (ii) The Committee will meet a minimum of two times per year. These 
meetings will be open to the public. Additionally, the committee will 
provide reasonable public notice of meetings, produce and provide 
written minutes of meetings to interested persons, and involve the 
public in its decision-making process. This public participation process 
will allow members of the public and/or special interest groups to have 
input to Committee decisions and management actions.
    (9) What authority will the Committee have, and what will be its 
primary tasks? The Committee will have the authority and the 
responsibility to carry out the following functions:
    (i) Developing a process for obtaining the best biological, social, 
and economic data. This process will include an explicit mechanism for 
soliciting peer-reviewed, scientific articles on grizzly bears and their 
management, and holding periodic public meetings not less than every 2 
years, in which qualified scientists may submit comments to and be 
questioned by the Committee. The two scientific advisors will lead this 
process. The Committee will base its decisions upon the best scientific 
and commercial data available. All decisions of the Committee, including 
components of its management plans, must lead toward recovery of the 
grizzly bear in the Bitterroot ecosystem and minimize social and 
economic impacts to the extent practicable within the context of the 
existing recovery goals for the species.
    (ii) Soliciting technical advice and guidance from outside experts. 
The scientific advisors will lead the development of an ongoing process 
to provide the Committee with the best scientific and commercial data 
available. The scientific advisors will provide this information in the 
form of peer-reviewed scientific articles on grizzly bears and their 
management, Committee meetings with presentations by scientific experts, 
and requests to State and Federal management agencies and the private 
sector for scientific expertise and advice.
    (iii) Implementing the Bitterroot Ecosystem Chapter of the Grizzly 
Bear Recovery Plan consistent with this paragraph (l). The Committee 
will develop recommendations on existing management plans and policies 
of land and wildlife management agencies, as necessary, for the 
management of grizzly bears in the Experimental Population Area. The 
Committee will make recommendations to land and wildlife management 
agencies regarding changes to plans and policies, but the final decision 
on implementation of those recommendations will be made by those 
agencies. If Committee recommendations require significant changes to 
existing plans and policy, and the agencies tentatively agree to accept 
those recommendations, then the requirements of the National 
Environmental Policy Act may apply. Such management plans and policies 
will be in accordance with applicable State and Federal laws. The 
Committee will give full consideration to Service comments and opinions 
and those of the Forest Service, Idaho Department of Fish and Game, the 
Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, and the Nez Perce Tribe.
    (iv) Providing means by which the public may participate in, review, 
and comment on the decisions of the Committee. The Committee must 
thoroughly consider and respond to public input prior to making 
decisions.
    (v) Developing its internal processes, where appropriate, such as 
governance, decision-making, quorum, terms of members, officers, meeting 
schedules and location, public notice of meetings, and minutes.
    (vi) Requesting staff support from the Service, the Idaho Department 
of Fish and Game, Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, Forest 
Service, other affected Federal agencies, and the Nez Perce Tribe, when 
necessary to perform administrative functions, and requesting 
reimbursement from us for non-Federal Committee members for costs 
associated with travel, lodging, and incidentals.
    (vii) Reviewing existing grizzly bear standards and guidelines used 
by the Forest Service and other agencies and landowners. The Committee 
will perform an annual review of grizzly bear

[[Page 189]]

mortalities and the number and location of bear/human conflicts. This 
review will be the primary mechanism to assess the adequacy of existing 
management techniques and standards. If the Committee deems such 
standards and guidelines inadequate for recovery of grizzly bears, the 
Committee may recommend changes to the Forest Service and other agencies 
and landowners.
    (viii) Developing grizzly bear guidance for proper camping and 
sanitation within the Experimental Population Area and making 
recommendations to land management agencies for adoption of such 
guidelines. Existing camping and sanitation procedures developed in 
other ecosystems with grizzly bears will serve as a basis for such 
guidelines.
    (ix) Developing a protocol for responding to grizzly/human 
encounters, livestock depredations, damage to lawfully present property, 
and other grizzly/human conflicts within the Experimental Population 
Area. Any response protocol developed by the Committee will have to 
undergo public comment and be revised as appropriate based on comments 
received. Any conflicts or mortalities associated with these activities 
will result in review by the Committee to determine what the Committee 
may do to help prevent future conflicts or mortalities. The Committee 
will recommend, as necessary, policy changes on trail restrictions for 
human safety to appropriate wildlife and land management agencies.
    (x) Recommending to the Service changes to recovery criteria, 
including mortality limits, population determinations, and other 
criteria for recovery as appropriate.
    (xi) Reviewing all human-caused grizzly bear mortalities to 
determine whether new measures for avoiding future occurrences are 
required and make recommendations on such measures to appropriate land 
and wildlife management agencies. If grizzly bear mortalities occur as a 
result of black bear hunting, the Committee will work with the State 
Fish and Game Departments in both Idaho and Montana to develop solutions 
to minimize the effects on grizzly bears of black bear hunting.
    (xii) Developing strategies to emphasize recovery inside the 
Recovery Area and to accommodate grizzly bears inside other areas of the 
Experimental Population Area.
    (A) Grizzly bears may range outside the Recovery Area because 
grizzly bear habitat exists throughout the Experimental Population Area. 
The Committee will not recommend that bears be disturbed or moved unless 
conflicts are both significant and cannot be corrected as determined by 
the Committee. This provision includes conflicts associated with 
livestock, for which the Committee will develop strategies to discourage 
grizzly bear occupancy in portions of the Experimental Population Area 
outside of the Recovery Area.
    (B) Unless the Committee determines otherwise, this rule provides 
that private land outside the national forest boundary in the Bitterroot 
Valley, Montana (exclusion area), is an area where any human/grizzly 
conflicts will be considered unacceptable. Grizzly bear occupancy will 
be discouraged in these areas, and grizzly bears will be captured and 
returned to the Recovery Area. If a grizzly bear enters the exclusion 
area, State and Federal wildlife management agencies will attempt to 
capture it immediately and notify the public of its presence as soon as 
possible. The public will be kept updated until the bear is caught. 
Further, any grizzly bear that occupies the exclusion area or other 
inhabited human settlement areas on private land within the Experimental 
Population Area that, in the judgment of the management agencies or 
Committee, presents a clear threat to human safety or whose behavior 
indicates that it may become habituated to humans, will be relocated or 
destroyed by management agencies.
    (xiii) Establishing standards for determining whether the 
experimental reintroduction has been successful and making 
recommendations on the inclusion of such standards in the Grizzly Bear 
Recovery Plan. These standards will be based on the best scientific and 
commercial information available and will reflect that, absent 
extraordinary circumstances, the success or failure of the program 
cannot be measured in

[[Page 190]]

fewer than 20 years. General guidelines for the standards by which 
failure will be measured include, but are not limited to, one or more of 
the following conditions:
    (A) If, within the number of years established by the Committee 
following initial reintroduction, no relocated grizzly bear remains 
within the Experimental Population Area and the reasons for emigration 
or mortality cannot be identified and/or remedied; or
    (B) If, within the number of years established by the Committee 
following initial reintroduction, no cubs of the year or yearlings exist 
and the relocated bears are not showing signs of successful reproduction 
as evidenced by no cubs of the year or yearlings.
    (xiv) Developing procedures for the expeditious issuance of permits 
described in paragraphs (l)(5)(iv) and (l)(5)(v) of this section, and 
making recommendations on such procedures to appropriate agencies.
    (xv) Developing 2-year work plans for the recovery effort for 
submittal to the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (l)(11)(i) of this 
section.
    (xvi) Establishing, based on the best available science, a refined 
interim recovery goal for the Bitterroot Ecosystem Chapter of the 
Grizzly Bear Recovery Plan and a final recovery goal when sufficient 
information is available and after grizzly bears are reintroduced and 
occupy suitable habitats in the Experimental Population Area. As this 
information becomes available, the Committee may recommend the recovery 
goal to the Secretary along with procedures for determining how this 
goal will be measured. The recovery goal for the Bitterroot grizzly bear 
population will be consistent with the habitat available within the 
Recovery Area. Additional adjacent areas of public land can be 
considered for contribution of suitable habitat when setting the 
recovery goal if additional land is shown to be necessary by the best 
scientific and commercial data available. Any recommendations for 
revised recovery goals developed by the Committee will require public 
review and our approval as appropriate prior to revision of any recovery 
plan. Grizzly bears outside the Recovery Area and within the 
Experimental Population Area can contribute to meeting the recovery goal 
if their long-term occupancy in such habitats outside the Recovery Area 
is reasonably certain.
    (10) What agencies will be responsible for day-to-day management 
activities? The Idaho Department of Fish and Game, the Montana 
Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, the Nez Perce Tribe, and the 
Forest Service, in coordination with us, will exercise day-to-day 
management responsibility within the Experimental Population Area in 
accordance with this paragaraph (l). The Service and these cooperating 
agencies will share management responsibility as per agreements with, 
and in consideration of, recommendations from the Committee.
    (11) How will progress of the Committee be monitored; and what 
process will be followed by the Secretary to resolve disputes over 
whether Committee actions are leading to recovery? (i) The Secretary or 
our representative on the Committee will review the Committee's 2-year 
work plans (see paragraph (l)(9)(xv) of this section). If the Secretary 
determines, through our representative on the Committee, that the 
Committee's decisions, work plans, or the implementation of those plans 
are not leading to the recovery of the grizzly bear within the 
Experimental Population Area or are not in compliance with this 
paragraph (l), our representative will ask the Committee to determine 
whether such a decision, plan, or implementation of a plan is leading to 
recovery and is in compliance with this paragraph (l). The Secretary, 
who retains final responsibility and authority for implementation of the 
Act, will review the Committee's determination, as provided in 
paragraphs (l)(11)(ii) through (iv) of this section, and then make a 
final determination. Should the Secretary find that a decision, work 
plan, or implementation of a plan by the Committee is inadequate for 
recovery of the grizzly bear or is not in compliance with this paragraph 
(l), the Secretary may assume lead management responsibility.
    (ii) The Service representative will consider Committee input before 
making any determination that Committee actions are not leading to 
recovery or

[[Page 191]]

are not in compliance with this paragraph (l). In the event that our 
representative on the Committee determines that the actions of the 
Committee are not leading to recovery of the Bitterroot grizzly bear 
population or are not in compliance with this paragraph (l), he or she 
will recommend to the Committee, based on the best scientific and 
commercial data available, alternative or corrective actions and provide 
6 months for the Committee to accomplish those actions. Should the 
Committee reject these corrective actions, our representative will 
convene a Scientific Review Panel of three and will submit to the panel 
for review those Committee actions or decisions that he or she has 
determined are not leading to recovery or are not in compliance with 
this paragrpah (l). The Service representative will consider the views 
of all Committee members prior to convening a Scientific Review Panel.
    (iii) Members of the Scientific Review Panel will be professional 
scientists who have had no involvement with the Committee and are not 
employed by Federal agencies responsible for grizzly bear recovery 
efforts. The Secretary will select one member of the panel, and the 
Governors of Idaho and Montana in consultation with the Universities of 
Idaho and Montana (respectively), will select one panel member each. The 
Scientific Review Panel will review Committee actions or decisions, 
solicit additional information if necessary and, using the best 
scientific and commercial data available, make timely recommendations to 
the Committee as to whether Committee actions will lead to recovery of 
the grizzly bear in the Bitterroot ecosystem and are in compliance with 
paragraph (l). Examples of Committee actions, decisions, or lack of 
actions that can be submitted to the Scientific Review Panel include, 
but are not limited to, the following: sufficiency of public involvement 
in Committee activities; decisions involving sanitation and outreach 
activities; management of nuisance bears; adequacy of recommendations to 
land and wildlife management agencies; adequacy of Committee actions in 
addressing issues such as excessive human-caused grizzly bear mortality; 
and other actions important to recovery of the grizzly bear in the 
Bitterroot ecosystem. Committee compliance with paragraph (l) provides 
the basis for the recommendations of the Scientific Review Panel.
    (iv) If, after timely review, the Committee rejects the 
recommendations of the Scientific Review Panel, and our representative 
determines that Committee actions are not leading to recovery of the 
Bitterroot population, he or she will notify the Secretary. The 
Secretary will review the Panel's recommendations and determine the 
disposition of the Committee.
    (A) If the Secretary determines that the Committee should maintain 
lead management responsibility, the Committee will continue to operate 
according to the provisions of this paragraph (l) until the recovery 
objectives under paragraph (l)(9)(xvi) of this section or the Bitterroot 
Ecosystem Chapter of the Recovery Plan have been met and the Secretary 
has completed delisting.
    (B) If the Secretary decides to assume lead management 
responsibility, the Secretary will consult with the Governors of Idaho 
and Montana regarding that decision and further attempt to resolve the 
disagreement. If, after such consultation, the Secretary assumes lead 
management responsibility, the Secretary will publish a notice in the 
Federal Register explaining the rationale for the determination and 
notify the Governors of Idaho and Montana. The Committee will disband, 
and all requirements identified in this paragraph (l) regarding the 
Committee will be nullified.
    (12) How will the Bitterroot grizzly bear population be monitored? 
The reintroduced population will be monitored closely by Federal and 
State agencies in cooperation with the Committee for the duration of the 
recovery process, generally by use of radio telemetry as appropriate.
    (13) How will success or failure of the project be evaluated? The 
status of Bitterroot grizzly bear recovery will be reevaluated 
separately by the Committee and by the Secretary at 5-year intervals. 
This review will take into account the reproductive success of the 
grizzly bears released, human-caused

[[Page 192]]

mortality, movement patterns of individual bears, food habits, and 
overall health of the population and will recommend changes and 
improvements in the recovery program. Evaluating these parameters will 
assist in determining success or failure of the restoration.
    (14) What process will be followed if the Secretary determines the 
project has failed? (i) If, based on the criteria established by the 
Committee, the Secretary, after consultation with the Committee, the 
Governors of Idaho and Montana, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game, 
the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, and the Nez Perce 
Tribe, determines that the reintroduction has failed to produce a self-
sustaining population, this paragraph (l) will not be used to 
reintroduce additional bears. Any remaining bears will retain their 
experimental status.
    (ii) Prior to declaring the experimental reintroduction a failure, 
we will investigate the probable causes of the failure. If the causes 
can be determined, and legal and reasonable remedial measures identified 
and implemented, we will consider continuing the recovery effort and 
maintaining the relocated population. If such reasonable measures cannot 
be identified and implemented, we will publish the results of our 
evaluation in the Federal Register in a proposed rulemaking to terminate 
the authority for additional experimental grizzly bear reintroductions 
in the Bitterroot ecosystem.
    (15) Will the legal status of grizzly bears in the Experimental 
Population Area change? We do not intend to change the ``nonessential 
experimental'' designation to ``essential experimental,'' 
``threatened,'' or ``endangered'' and foresee no likely situation that 
would result in such changes. Critical habitat cannot be designated 
under the nonessential experimental classification, 16 U.S.C. 
1539(j)(2)(C)(ii).
    (16) What are the definitions of key terms used in the special rule 
in this paragraph (l)? In addition to terms defined in Sec.  10.12 and 
17.3 of this subchapter, the following terms apply to this paragraph 
(l):
    Accommodate means allowing grizzly bears that move outside the 
Recovery Area onto public land in the Experimental Population Area to 
remain undisturbed unless they demonstrate a real and imminent threat to 
human safety or livestock.
    Citizen Management Committee (Committee) means that Committee 
described in paragraph (l)(6) of this section.
    Current range means the area inside or within 10 miles of the 
recovery zone line of currently occupied grizzly bear recovery zones or 
any area where there is a grizzly bear population, as defined in this 
paragraph (l)(16).
    Exclusion area (Bitterroot Valley) means those private lands in 
Montana lying within the Bitterroot Experimental Population Area in the 
Bitterroot Valley outside the Bitterroot National Forest boundary south 
of U.S. Highway 12 to Lost Trail Pass and west of Highway 93.
    Experimental Population Area (Bitterroot Grizzly Bear Experimental 
Population Area) means that area delineated in paragraph (l)(1) of this 
section within which management plans developed as part of the Committee 
described in paragraph (l)(9) of this section will be in effect. This 
area includes the Recovery Area. The Experimental Population Area is 
within the historic range of the grizzly bear, but geographically 
separate from the current range of the grizzly bear.
    Geographically separate means separated by more than 10 miles. The 
term refers to ``wholly separate geographically'' in section 10(j)(2) of 
the Act. The Experimental Population Area and the recovery zone boundary 
of any existing grizzly bear population must be geographically separate.
    Grizzly bear population is defined by verified evidence within the 
previous 6 years which consists of photos within the area, verified 
tracks, or sightings by reputable scientists or agency personnel of at 
least two different female grizzly bears with young or one female with 
different litters in 2 different years in an area geographically 
separate from other grizzly bear populations. Verifiable evidence of 
females with young, to be geographically separate, would have to occur 
greater than

[[Page 193]]

10 miles from the nearest nonexperimental grizzly bear population 
recovery zone boundary.
    Opportunistic, noninjurious harassment means harassment (see 
definition of ``harass'' in Sec.  17.3) that occurs when the grizzly 
bear presents itself (for example, the bear travels onto and is observed 
on private land or near livestock). This paragraph (l) permits only this 
type of harassment. You cannot track, attract, search out, or chase a 
grizzly bear and then harass it. Any harassment must not cause bodily 
injury or death to the grizzly bear. The intent of harassment permitted 
by this definitioin is to scare bears away from the immediate area.
    Recovery Area (Bitterroot Grizzly Bear Recovery Area) means the area 
of recovery emphasis within the Experimental Population Area, and is 
delineated in paragraph (l)(2) of this section. This area consists of 
the Selway-Bitterroot and Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness 
areas. The Recovery Area is within the historic range of the species.
    Recovery emphasis means grizzly bear management decisions in the 
Recovery Area will favor bear recovery so that this area can serve as 
core habitat for survival, reproduction, and dispersal of the recovering 
population. Reintroduction of grizzly bears is planned to occur within 
the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness portion of the Recovery Area unless it 
is later determined that reintroduction in the Frank Church-River of No 
Return Wilderness is appropriate.
    Unavoidable and unintentional take means accidental, unintentional 
take (see definition of take in Sec.  10.12 of this subchapter) that 
occurs despite reasonable care, is incidental to an otherwise lawful 
activity, and is not done on purpose. An example would be striking a 
grizzly bear with an automobile. Taking a grizzly bear by shooting will 
not be considered unavoidable and unintentional take. Shooters have the 
responsibility to be sure of their targets.

    (m) Spotfin chub (=turquoise shiner) (Cyprinella (=Hybopsis) 
monacha), duskytail darter (Etheostoma percnurum), smoky madtom (Noturus 
baileyi).
    (1) Where are populations of these fishes designated as nonessential 
experimental populations (NEPs)?
    (i) The NEP area for these three fishes is within the species' 
probable historic ranges and is defined as follows: The Tellico River, 
between the backwaters of the Tellico Reservoir (approximately Tellico 
River mile 19 (30.4 kilometers) and Tellico River mile 33 (52.8 
kilometers), near the Tellico

[[Page 195]]

Ranger Station, Monroe County, Tennessee.
    (ii) None of the fishes named in paragraph (m) of this section are 
currently known to exist in the Tellico River or its tributaries. Based 
on the habitat requirements of these fishes, we do not expect them to 
become established outside the NEP area. However, if any individuals of 
any of the species move upstream or downstream or into tributaries 
outside the designated NEP area, we would presume that they came from 
the reintroduced populations. We would then amend paragraph (m)(1)(i) of 
this section and enlarge the boundaries of the NEP area to include the 
entire range of the expanded population.
    (iii) We do not intend to change the NEP designations to ``essential 
experimental,'' ``threatened,'' or ``endangered'' within the NEP area. 
Additionally, we will not designate critical habitat for these NEPs, as 
provided by 16 U.S.C. 1539(j)(2)(C)(ii).
    (2) What activities are not allowed in the NEP area?
    (i) Except as expressly allowed in paragraph (m)(3) of this section, 
all the prohibitions of Sec.  17.31 (a) and (b) apply to the fishes 
identified in paragraph (m)(1) of this section.
    (ii) Any manner of take not described under paragraph (m)(3) of this 
section is prohibited in the NEP area. We may refer unauthorized take of 
these species to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.
    (iii) You may not possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever any of the identified fishes, 
or parts thereof, that are taken or possessed in violation of paragraph 
(m)(2) of this section or in violation of the applicable State fish and 
wildlife laws or regulations or the Act.
    (iv) You may not attempt to commit, solicit another to commit, or 
cause to be committed any offense defined in paragraph (m)(2) of this 
section.
    (3) What take is allowed in the NEP area? Take of this species that 
is incidental to an otherwise legal activity, such as recreation (e.g., 
fishing, boating, wading, trapping, or swimming), forestry, agriculture, 
and other activities that are in accordance with Federal, State, and 
local laws and regulations, is allowed.
    (4) How will the effectiveness of these reintroductions be 
monitored? We will prepare periodic progress reports and fully evaluate 
these reintroduction efforts after 5 and 10 years to determine whether 
to continue or terminate the reintroduction efforts.

shiny pigtoe (Fusconaia cor), Anthony's riversnail (Athearnia anthonyi).
    (1) Where are these mollusks designated as nonessential experimental 
populations (NEPs)? (i) The NEP Area for these 17 mollusks is within the 
species' historic ranges, and is defined as follows: The free-flowing 
reach of the Tennessee River from the base of Wilson Dam downstream to 
the backwaters of Pickwick Reservoir (river mile (RM) 259.4 [414.0 km] 
to RM 246.0 [393.6 km] and includes the lower 5 RM (8 km) of all

[[Page 196]]

tributaries to this reach in Colbert and Lauderdale Counties, Alabama.
    (ii) None of the identified species are known to exist in any of the 
tributaries to the free-flowing reach of the Tennessee River below 
Wilson Dam or from below the backwaters of Pickwick Reservoir, Colbert 
and Lauderdale Counties, Alabama. In the future, if any of the 17 
mollusks are found upstream of the lower 5 RM (8 km) of these 
tributaries or downstream into Pickwick Reservoir, we will presume the 
animals came from the reintroduced NEP, and we will amend this rule and 
enlarge the boundaries of the NEP Area to include the entire range of 
the expanded population.
    (iii) We do not intend to change the NEP designations to ``essential 
experimental,'' ``threatened,'' or ``endangered'' within the NEP Area. 
Additionally, we will not designate critical habitat for these NEPs, as 
provided by 16 U.S.C. 1539(j)(2)(C)(ii).
    (2) What activities are not allowed in the NEP Area? (i) Except as 
expressly allowed in this rule, all the prohibitions of 17.31(a) and (b) 
apply to the mollusks identified in this special rule.
    (ii) Any manner of take not described under paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section will not be allowed in the NEP Area. We may refer the 
unauthorized take of these species to the appropriate authorities for 
prosecution.
    (iii) You may not possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever any of the identified 17 
mollusks, or parts thereof, that are taken or possessed in violation of 
these regulations or in violation of the applicable State fish and 
wildlife laws or regulations or the Act.
    (iv) You may not attempt to commit, solicit another to commit, or 
cause to be committed any offense defined in this paragraph (a).
    (3) What take is allowed in the NEP Area? (i) Take of these species 
that is accidental and incidental to an otherwise lawful activity such 
as fishing, boating, commercial navigation, trapping, wading, or mussel 
harvesting, is allowed.
    (ii) Any individual collecting or harvesting mussels must check 
their collection prior to leaving the immediate area and return any NEP 
mussels to the site where they were obtained.
    (4) How will the effectiveness of these reintroductions be 
monitored? We will prepare periodic progress reports and fully evaluate 
these reintroduction efforts after 5 and 10 years to determine whether 
to continue or terminate the reintroduction efforts.

Sec.  17.94  Critical habitats.

    (a) The areas listed in Sec.  17.95 (fish and wildlife) and Sec.  
17.96 (plants) and referred to in the lists at Sec. Sec.  17.11 and 
17.12 have been determined by the Director to be Critical Habitat. All 
Federal agencies must insure that any action authorized, funded, or 
carried out by them is not likely to result in the destruction or 
adverse modification of the constituent elements essential to the 
conservation of the listed species within these defined Critical 
Habitats. (See part 402 for rules concerning this prohibition; see also 
part 424 for rules concerning the determination of Critical Habitat).
    (b) The map provided by the Director does not, unless otherwise 
indicated, constitute the definition of the boundaries of a Critical 
Habitat. Such maps are provided for reference purposes to guide Federal 
agencies and other interested parties in locating the general boundaries 
of the Critical Habitat. Critical Habitats are described by reference to 
surveyable landmarks found on standard topographic maps of the area and 
to the States and county(ies) within which all or part of the Critical 
Habitat is located. Unless otherwise indicated within the Critical 
Habitat description, the State and county(ies) names are provided for 
informational purposes only.
    (c) Critical Habitat management focuses only on the biological or 
physical constituent elements within the defined area of Critical 
Habitat that are essential to the conservation of the

[[Page 197]]

species. Those major constituent elements that are known to require 
special management considerations or protection will be listed with the 
description of the Critical Habitat.
    (d) The sequence of species within each list of Critical Habitats in 
Sec. Sec.  17.95 and 17.96 will follow the sequences in the lists of 
Endangered and Threatened wildlife (Sec.  17.11) and plants (Sec.  
17.12). Multiple entries for each species will be alphabetic by State.

         San Bernardino Kangaroo Rat (Dipodomys merriami parvus)

    (1) Critical Habitat Units are depicted for San Bernardino and 
Riverside counties, California, on the maps below.
    (2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements for the San 
Bernardino kangaroo rat are those habitat components that are essential 
for the primary biological needs of the species. Based on our current 
knowledge of this species, the primary constituent elements include:
    (i) Soil series consisting predominantly of sand, loamy sand, sandy 
loam, or loam;
    (ii) Alluvial sage scrub and associated vegetation, such as coastal 
sage scrub and chamise chaparral, with a moderately open canopy.
    (iii) River, creek, stream, and wash channels; alluvial fans; 
floodplains; floodplain benches and terraces; and historic braided 
channels that are subject to dynamic geomorphological and hydrological 
processes typical of fluvial systems within the historical range of the 
San Bernardino kangaroo rat. These areas may include a mosaic of 
suitable and unsuitable soils and vegetation that either (A) occur at a 
scale smaller than the home range of the animal, or (B) form a series of 
core areas and linkages between them.
    (iv) Upland areas proximal to floodplains with suitable habitat 
(e.g., floodplains that support the soils, vegetation, or 
geomorphological, hydrological and aeolian processes essential to this 
species). These areas are essential due to their geographic proximity to 
suitable habitat and the functions they serve during flooding events. 
These areas may include marginal habitats such as agricultural lands 
that are disced annually, out-of-production vineyards, margins of 
orchards, areas of active or inactive industrial or resource extraction 
activities, and urban/wildland interfaces.
    (3) Existing features and structures, such as buildings, roads, 
railroads, airports, other paved areas, lawns, and other urban 
landscaped areas, do not contain one or more of the primary constituent 
elements. Federal actions limited to those areas, therefore, would not 
trigger a consultation under section 7 of the Act unless they affect the 
species and/or primary constituent elements in adjacent critical 
habitat.

         Preble's Meadow Jumping Mouse (Zapus hudsonius preblei)

    (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Wyoming and Colorado. 
Maps and descriptions follow.
    (2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements for the 
Preble's include those habitat components essential for the biological 
needs of reproducing, rearing of young, foraging, sheltering, 
hibernation, dispersal, and genetic exchange. The primary constituent 
elements are found in and near riparian areas located within grassland, 
shrubland, forest, and mixed-vegetation types where dense herbaceous or 
woody vegetation occurs near the ground level, where available open 
water exists during their active season, and where there are ample 
upland habitats of sufficient width and quality for foraging, 
hibernation, and refugia from catastrophic flooding events. Primary 
constituent elements associated with the biological needs of dispersal 
and genetic exchange also are found in areas that provide connectivity 
or linkage between or within Preble's populations. The dynamic 
ecological processes that create and maintain Preble's habitat also are 
important primary constituent elements. Primary constituent elements 
include:
    (i) A pattern of dense riparian vegetation consisting of grasses, 
forbs, and shrubs in areas along rivers and streams that provide open 
water through the Preble's active season;
    (ii) Adjacent floodplains and vegetated uplands with limited human 
disturbance (including hayed fields, grazed pasture, other agricultural 
lands that are not plowed or disced regularly, areas that have been 
restored after past aggregate extraction, areas supporting recreational 
trails, and urban/wildland interfaces);
    (iii) Areas that provide connectivity between and within populations 
(These may include river and stream reaches with minimal vegetative 
cover or that are armored for erosion control; travelways beneath 
bridges, through culverts, and along canals and ditches; and other areas 
that have experienced substantial human alteration or disturbance.); and
    (iv) Dynamic geomorphological and hydrological processes typical of 
systems within the range of the Preble's, i.e., those processes that 
create and maintain river and stream channels, floodplains, and 
floodplain benches, and promote patterns of vegetation favorable to the 
Preble's.
    (3) Existing features and structures within the boundaries of the 
mapped units, such as buildings, roads, parking lots, other paved areas, 
lawns, other urban and suburban landscaped areas, regularly plowed or 
disced agricultural areas, and other features not containing any of the 
primary constituent elements are not considered critical habitat.

require special management considerations or protection are mangrove 
swamps containing red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), 
and white (Laguncularia racemosa) mangroves, and buttonwood (Conocarpus 
erectus); salt marshes, swales, and adjacent transitional wetlands 
containing saltwort (Batis maritima), perennial glasswort (Salicornia 
virginica), saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), sea ox-eye (Borrichia 
frutescens), keygrass (Monanthochloe littoralis), and coastal dropseed 
(Sporobolus virginicus); and fresh water marshes containing cattails

    Note: Map follows:

[[Page 235]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01FE01.000

    2. Within these areas, the primary constituent elements for 
Peninsular bighorn sheep are those habitat components that are essential 
for the primary biological needs of feeding, resting, reproduction and 
population recruitment, dispersal, connectivity between ewe groups, and 
isolation from detrimental human disturbance. The principal biological 
and physical constituent elements that are essential to the conservation 
of Peninsular bighorn sheep include: space for the normal

[[Page 236]]

behavior of groups and individuals; protection from disturbance; 
availability of the various native desert plant communities found on 
different topographic slopes, aspects, and landforms, such as steep 
slopes, rolling foothills, alluvial fans, and canyon bottoms; a range of 
habitats that provide forage, especially during periods of drought; 
steep, remote habitat for lambing, rearing of young, and escape from 
disturbance and/or predation; water sources; suitable linkages allowing 
individual bighorn to move freely between ewe groups and maintain 
connections between subpopulations.
    3. Towns and similar developed lands, which do not provide primary 
constituent elements, are not critical habitat. Road and railroad 
rights-of-way, flood control facilities, or other facilities that must 
be traversed by bighorn sheep to maintain connectivity between 
subpopulations, or otherwise may provide food, water, or cover for 
Peninsular bighorn sheep, are considered to support primary constituent 
elements, and therefore are included as critical habitat.

                  Spectacled Eider (Somateria fischeri)

    1. Critical habitat units are depicted for Unit 1 (Central Yukon-
Kuskokwim Delta), Unit 2 (South Y-K Delta Unit), Unit 3 (Norton Sound), 
Unit 4 (Ledyard Bay), and Unit 5 (the Wintering Unit in the Bering Sea 
between St. Lawrence and St. Matthew Islands) for reference only. The 
areas in critical habitat are described below.
    2. Within these areas, the primary constituent elements are those 
habitat components that are essential for the primary biological needs 
of feeding, nesting, brood rearing, roosting, molting, migrating and 
wintering. The primary constituent elements for Units 1 and 2 (the Y-K 
Delta units) include the vegetated intertidal zone and all open water 
inclusions within this zone. Primary constituent elements for the Norton 
Sound Unit (Unit 3) and the Ledyard Bay Unit (Unit 4) include all marine 
waters greater than 5 m (16.4 ft) in depth and less than or equal to 25 
m (82.0 ft) in depth, along with associated marine aquatic flora and 
fauna in the water column, and the underlying marine benthic community. 
Primary constituent elements for the Wintering Unit (Unit 5) include all 
marine waters less than or equal to 75 m (246.1 ft) in depth, along with 
associated marine aquatic flora and fauna in the water column, and the 
underlying marine benthic community. Critical habitat does not include 
those areas within the boundary of any unit that do not fit the 
description of primary constituent elements for that unit.
    3. Critical habitat does not include existing features and 
structures, such as buildings, roads, pipelines, utility corridors, 
airports, other paved areas, and other developed areas.
    4. This final rule designating critical habitat for the spectacled 
eider uses published coordinates of prominent landmarks, when 
appropriate, obtained from the Dictionary of Alaska Place Names.

Delta (Unit 1), Kuskokwim Shoals (Unit 2), Seal Islands

[[Page 255]]

(Unit 3), Nelson Lagoon (Unit 4), and Izembek Lagoon (Unit 5) on the 
maps below. The maps are for reference only; the areas in critical 
habitat are legally described below.
    2. Within these areas, the primary constituent elements are those 
habitat components that are essential for the primary biological needs 
of feeding, roosting, molting, and wintering. The primary constituent 
elements for Unit 1 include the vegetated intertidal zone and all open 
water inclusions within this zone. The primary constituent elements for 
Units 2, 3, 4, and 5 are marine waters up to 9 m (30 feet) deep and the 
underlying substrate, the associated invertebrate fauna in the water 
column, the underlying marine benthic community, and where present, 
eelgrass beds and associated flora and fauna. Critical habitat does not 
include those areas within the boundary of any unit that do not fit the 
description of primary constituent elements for that unit.
    3. Critical habitat does not include existing human structures, such 
as buildings, roads, pipelines, utility corridors, airports, other paved 
areas, docks, wharves, buoys, or other developed areas.
    4. In the following maps and legal descriptions, all geographic 
coordinates are in North American Datum 1927.

             Oahu elepaio (Chasiempis sandwichensis ibidis)

    (1) Critical Habitat Units are depicted for the City and County of 
Honolulu on the maps below.
    (2)(i) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements required 
by the Oahu elepaio are those habitat components that are essential for 
the biological needs of foraging, sheltering, roosting, nesting, and 
rearing of young. These primary constituent elements are undeveloped 
wet, mesic, and dry forest habitats with a generally continuous canopy 
and a dense understory and that are composed of native and/or introduced 
plant species. Such forests are found in valleys and on mountain slopes 
and ridges. The primary constituent elements associated with the 
biological needs of dispersal and genetic exchange are undeveloped wet 
or dry shrub land and wet or dry cliff habitats composed of native and/
or introduced plant species that separate elepaio populations. Elepaio 
may not establish territories in shrub or cliff habitats and may use 
them only transiently, but undeveloped areas containing these habitats 
are important for linking populations by providing dispersal corridors 
and promoting genetic exchange among populations.
    (ii) Within the forests and shrub lands providing the primary 
constituent elements, plant species composition varies with rainfall, 
elevation, and degree of habitat disturbance, and plant species occur in 
a variety of assemblages. Common native and introduced species within 
these plant assemblages include, but are not limited to, ohia 
(Metrosideros polymorpha), koa (Acacia koa), papala kepau (Pisonia 
umbellifera), lama (Diospyros sandwicensis), mamaki (Pipturus albidus), 
kaulu (Sapindus oahuensis), hame (Antidesma platyphyllum), alaa 
(Pouteria sandwicensis), aalii (Dodonaea viscosa), naupaka kuahiwi 
(Scaevola spp.), pukiawe (Styphelia tameiameiae), uluhe (Dicranopteris 
linearis), guava (Psidium guajava), strawberry guava (P. cattleianum), 
mango (Mangifera indica), kukui (Aleurites moluccana), christmasberry 
(Schinus terebinthifolius), ti (Cordyline terminalis), rose apple 
(Syzygium jambos), mountain apple (S. malaccense), and Java plum (S. 
cumini).
    (3) Existing developed features and structures, such as buildings, 
roads, aqueducts, antennas, water tanks, agricultural fields, paved 
areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas, that do not contain one 
or more of the primary constituent elements, are not included as 
critical habitat.
    (4) Map of critical habitat units for the Oahu elepaio follows.

Canyon (T6S, R20W, Section 4) downstream to San Francisco Hot Springs, 
near the confluence with Box Canyon (T12S, R20W, Section 23). 
Approximately 105 km (65 miles). The boundaries include areas within 100 
meters of the edge of areas with surface water during the May to 
September breeding season and within 100 meters of areas where such 
surface water no longer exists owing to habitat degradation but may be 
recovered with habitat rehabilitation where thickets of riparian trees 
and shrubs occur or may become established as a result of natural 
floodplain processes or rehabilitation.
    4. Tularosa River and Apache Creek, Catron County: from the 
confluence of the Tularosa and San Francisco Rivers (T7S, R19W, Section 
23) upstream, to the source of the Tularosa River near the continental 
divide (T4S, R15W, Section 33), and upstream on Apache Creek to the 
confluence with Whiskey Creek (T4S, R18W, Section 25). Approximately 60 
km (37 miles). The boundaries include areas within 100 meters of the 
edge of areas with surface water during the May to September breeding 
season and within 100 meters of areas where such surface water no longer 
exists owing to habitat degradation but may be recovered with habitat 
rehabilitation where thickets of riparian trees and shrubs occur or may 
become established as a result of natural floodplain processes or 
rehabilitation.

    2. Within these areas, the primary constituent elements for the 
gnatcatcher are those habitat components that are essential for the 
primary biological needs of foraging, nesting, rearing of young, intra-
specific communication, roosting, dispersal, genetic exchange, or 
sheltering (Atwood 1990). Primary

[[Page 278]]

constituent elements are provided in undeveloped areas that support 
various types of sage scrub or support chaparral, grassland, and 
riparian habitats where they occur proximal to sage scrub and where they 
may be utilized for biological needs such as breeding and foraging 
(Atwood et al. 1998, Campbell et al. 1998). Primary constituent elements 
associated with the biological needs of dispersal are also found in 
undeveloped areas that provide linkage between or within larger core 
areas, including open space and disturbed areas that may receive only 
periodic use.
    Primary constituent elements include, but are not limited to, the 
following plant communities in their natural state or those that have 
been recently disturbed (e.g., fire or grubbing): Venturan coastal sage 
scrub, Diegan coastal sage scrub, maritime succulent scrub, Riversidean 
sage scrub, Riversidean alluvial fan scrub, southern coastal bluff 
scrub, and coastal sage-chaparral scrub (Holland 1986). Based upon 
dominant species, these communities have been further divided into 
series such as black sage, brittlebush, California buckwheat, California 
buckwheat-white sage, California encelia, California sagebrush, 
California sagebrush-black sage, California sagebrush-California 
buckwheat, coast prickly-pear, mixed sage, purple sage, scalebroom, and 
white sage (Sawyer and Keeler-Wolf 1995). Dominant species within these 
plant communities include California sagebrush (Artemisia californica), 
buckwheats (Eriogonum fasciculatum and E. cinereum), encelias (Encelia 
californica and E. farinosa), and various sages (commonly Salvia 
mellifera, S. apiana, and S. leucophylla). Other commonly occurring 
plants include coast goldenbush (Isocoma menziesii), bush monkeyflower 
(Mimulus aurantiacus), Mexican elderberry (Sambucus mexicana), 
bladderpod (Isomeris arborea), deerweed (Lotus scoparius), chaparral 
mallow (Malacothamnus fasciculatum), and laurel sumac (Malosma laurina), 
and several species of Rhus (R. integrifolia, R. ovata, and R. 
trilobata). Succulent species, such as boxthorn (Lycium spp.), cliff 
spurge (Euphorbia misera), jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis), and various 
species of cacti (Opuntia littoralis, O. prolifera, and Ferocactus 
viridescens), and live-forever (Dudleya spp.), are represented in 
maritime succulent scrub, coast prickly-pear scrub, and southern coastal 
bluff scrubs.
    3. Critical habitat does not include non-Federal lands covered by a 
legally operative incidental take permit for the coastal California 
gnatcatcher issued under section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act on or before 
October 24, 2000.
    4. Critical habitat does not include existing features and 
structures, such as buildings, roads, aqueducts, railroads, airports, 
other paved areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas not 
containing one or more of the primary constituent elements.

         Marbled Murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus marmoratus)

    1. Critical habitat units are depicted for the States of Washington, 
Oregon, and California on the maps below.
    2. The primary constituent elements: individual trees with potential 
nest platforms and forest lands of at least one half site-potential tree 
height regardless of contiguity within 0.8 kilometers (0.5 miles) of 
individual trees with potential nesting platforms and that are used or 
potentially used by the marbled murrelet for nesting or roosting.
    3. A description of the critical habitat units follows. Where a 
critical habitat unit includes Federal lands within the boundaries of a 
Late Successional Reserve established by the Northwest Forest Plan, 
those boundaries include any minor adjustments. Critical habitat units 
do not include non-federal lands covered by a legally operative 
incidental take permit for marbled murrelets issued under section 10(a) 
of the Act.

             Mexican Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis lucida)

    Critical habitat is limited to areas within the mapped boundaries 
that meet the definition of protected habitat as described in the 
Recovery Plan (600 acres around known owl sites and mixed conifer or 
pine-oak forests with slopes greater than 40 percent where timber 
harvest has not occurred in the past 20 years). All restricted habitat 
as described in the Recovery Plan is also designated as critical 
habitat. Private and State lands within mapped boundaries are not 
designated as critical habitat. No Tribal lands other than those 
administered by the National Park Service are designated. Existing man-
made features and structures, such as buildings, roads, railroads, and 
urban development, are not considered critical habitat. Critical habitat 
units for the States of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah are 
depicted on the maps below. Larger maps and digital files for all four 
States and maps of critical habitat units in the State of New Mexico are 
available at the New Mexico Ecological Services Field Office, 2105 Osuna 
N.E., Albuquerque, New Mexico 87113, telephone (505) 346-2525. For the 
States of Arizona, Colorado, and Utah, maps of the critical habitat 
units specific to each State are available at the following U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service offices--Arizona Ecological Services Field Office, 
2321 West Royal Palm Road, Suite 103, Phoenix, Arizona 85021, telephone 
(602) 640-2720; Colorado State Sub-Office, 764 Horizon Drive South, 
Annex A, Grand Junction, Colorado 81506, telephone (970) 243-2778; and 
Utah Ecological Services Field Office, Lincoln Plaza, 145 East 1300 
South, Suite 404, Salt Lake City, Utah 84115, telephone (801) 524-5001.
    1. Critical habitat units are designated in portions of McKinley, 
Rio Arriba, Sandoval, Socorro, and Taos, Counties in New Mexico; Apache, 
Cochise, Coconino, Graham, Mohave, and Pima Counties in Arizona; Carbon, 
Emery, Garfield, Grand, Iron, Kane, San Juan, Washington, and Wayne 
Counties in Utah; and Custer, Douglas, El Paso, Fremont, Huerfano, 
Jefferson, Pueblo, and Teller Counties in Colorado. Precise descriptions 
of each critical habitat unit are on file at the New Mexico Ecological 
Services Field Office.
    2. Within these areas, the primary constituent elements for Mexican 
spotted owl include, but are not limited to, those habitat components 
providing for nesting, roosting, and foraging activities. Primary 
constituent elements in Protected Activity Centers include all 
vegetation and other organic matter contained therein. Primary 
constituent elements on all other areas are provided in canyons and 
mixed conifer, pine-oak, and riparian habitat types that typically 
support nesting and/or roosting. The primary constituent elements that 
occur in mixed conifer, pine-oak, and riparian forest types, as 
described in the Recovery Plan, which currently contain or may attain 
the habitat attributes believed capable of supporting nesting and 
roosting owls include: high basal area of large-diameter trees; moderate 
to high canopy closure; wide range of tree sizes suggestive of uneven-
age stands; multi-layered canopy with large overstory trees of various 
species; high snag basal area; high

[[Page 402]]

volumes of fallen trees and other woody debris; high plant species 
richness, including hardwoods; and adequate levels of residual plant 
cover to maintain fruits, seeds, and regeneration to provide for the 
needs of Mexican spotted owl prey species. For canyon habitats, the 
primary constituent elements include the following attributes: cooler 
and often higher humidity than the surrounding area; clumps or stringers 
of ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, white fir, and/or pi[ntilde]on-juniper 
trees and/or canyon wall containing crevices, ledges, or caves; high 
percent of ground litter and woody debris; and riparian or woody 
vegetation (although not at all sites).

   Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus)--Great Lakes Breeding Population

    1. Critical habitat units are depicted for St. Louis County, 
Minnesota; Douglas, Ashland, Marinette, and Manitowoc Counties, 
Wisconsin; Lake County, Illinois; Porter County, Indiana; Erie and Lake 
Counties, Ohio; Erie County, Pennsylvania; Oswego and Jefferson 
Counties, New York; and Alger, Schoolcraft, Luce, Mackinac, Chippewa, 
Iosco, Presque Isle, Cheboygan, Emmet, Charlevoix, Leelanau, Benzie, 
Mason, and Muskegon Counties, Michigan, on the maps below.
    2. i. The primary constituent elements required to sustain the Great 
Lakes breeding population of the piping plover are found on Great Lakes 
islands and mainland shorelines that support open, sparsely vegetated 
sandy habitats, such as sand spits or sand beaches, that are associated 
with wide, unforested systems of dunes and inter-dune wetlands. In order 
for habitat to be physically and biologically suitable for piping 
plovers, it must have a total shoreline length of at least 0.2 km (0.12 
mi) of gently sloping, sparsely vegetated (less than 50 percent 
herbaceous and low woody cover) sand beach with a total beach area of at 
least 2 hectares (ha) (5 acres (ac)) and a low level of disturbance from 
human activities and from domestic animals. As the nesting season 
progresses, the level of disturbance tolerated by piping plovers 
increases. A lower level of disturbance is required at the beginning of 
the nesting period during nest site selection, egg laying, and 
incubation. Beach activities that may be associated with a high level of 
disturbance include, but are not limited to, walking pets off leash, 
loud noise, driving ATVs, or significantly increased human presence. The 
level of disturbance is relative to the proximity to the nest, 
intensity, and frequency of these and other similar activities.
    ii. Appropriately sized sites must also have areas of at least 50 
meters (m) (164 feet (ft)) in length where the beach width is more than 
7 m (23 ft), there is protective cover for nests and chicks, and the 
distance to the treeline (from the normal high water line to where the 
forest begins) is more than 50 m (164 ft). Beach width is defined as the 
distance from the normal high water line to the foredune (a low barrier 
dune ridge immediately inland from the beach) edge, or to the sand/
vegetation boundary in areas where the foredune is absent. The beach 
width may be narrower than 7 m (23 ft) if appropriate sand and cobble 
areas of at least 7 m (23 ft) exist between the dune and the treeline. 
Protective cover for nests and chicks consists of small patches of 
herbaceous vegetation, cobble (stones larger than 1 cm (0.4 inches (in)) 
diameter), gravel (stones smaller than 1 cm (0.4 in) diameter), or 
debris such as driftwood, wrack, root masses, or dead shrubs.
    iii. The dynamic ecological processes that create and maintain 
piping plover habitat are also important primary constituent elements. 
These geologically dynamic lakeside regions are controlled by processes 
of erosion, accretion, plant succession, and lake-level fluctuations. 
The integrity of the habitat components depends upon regular sediment 
transport processes, as well as episodic,

[[Page 411]]

high-magnitude storm events. By their nature, Great Lakes shorelines are 
in a constant state of change; habitat features may disappear, or be 
created nearby. The critical habitat boundaries reflect these natural 
processes and the dynamic character of Great Lakes shorelines.
    3. Critical habitat does not include existing features and 
structures, such as buildings, marinas, paved areas, boat ramps, piers, 
bridges, lighthouses, and similar structures not containing one or more 
of the primary constituent elements.

          Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) Wintering Habitat

    1. The primary constituent elements essential for the conservation 
of wintering piping plovers are those habitat components that support 
foraging, roosting, and sheltering and the physical features necessary 
for maintaining the natural processes that support these habitat 
components. The primary constituent elements include intertidal beaches 
and flats (between annual low tide and annual high tide) and associated 
dune systems and flats above annual high tide. Important components of 
intertidal flats include sand and/or mud flats with no or very sparse 
emergent vegetation. In some cases, these flats may be covered or 
partially covered by a mat of blue-green algae. Adjacent non-or sparsely 
vegetated sand, mud, or algal flats above high tide are also important, 
especially for roosting piping plovers, and are primary constituent 
elements of piping plover wintering habitat. Such sites may have debris, 
detritus (decaying organic matter), or micro-topographic relief (less 
than 50 cm above substrate surface) offering refuge from high winds and 
cold weather. Important components of the beach/dune ecosystem include 
surf-cast algae, sparsely vegetated backbeach and salterns (beach area 
above mean high tide seaward of the permanent dune line, or in cases 
where no dunes exist, seaward of a delineating feature such as a 
vegetation line, structure, or road), spits, and washover areas. 
Washover areas are broad, unvegetated zones, with little or no 
topographic relief, that are formed and maintained by the action of 
hurricanes, storm surge, or other extreme wave action.
    2. Critical habitat does not include existing developed sites 
consisting of buildings, marinas, paved areas, boat ramps, exposed oil 
and gas pipelines and similar structures. Only those areas containing 
these primary constituent elements within the designated boundaries are 
considered critical habitat.

    This unit extends from the jetties on the southwest end of the 
Bolivar Peninsula to a point on the Gulf beach 1 km (0.6 mi) north of 
Beacon Bayou. It includes 5.0 km (3 mi) of Gulf shoreline. The landward 
boundary is the line indicating the beginning of dense vegetation, and 
the gulfside boundary is MLLW. The area is leased from TGLO by Houston 
Audubon Society and managed for its important avian resources. The 
upland areas are used for roosting by the piping plover. This unit 
includes lands known as wind tidal flats that are infrequently inundated 
by seasonal winds.

       Unit TX-37: Rollover Pass. 6 ha (16 ac) in Galveston County

    This unit consists of Rollover Bay on the bayside of Bolivar 
Peninsula. The landward boundary is the line indicating the beginning of 
dense vegetation, and the bayside boundary is MLLW. It includes flats on 
State-owned land managed by the TGLO. This unit captures the intertidal 
complex of the bay, and is bounded by the towns of Gilchrist to the east 
and the Gulf beach of the Bolivar Peninsula to the south. This unit 
includes lands known as wind tidal flats that are infrequently inundated 
by seasonal winds.

   Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus)--Northern Great Plains Breeding 
                               Population

    1. Critical habitat units are depicted for Minnesota, Montana, 
Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota, on the maps and as described 
below.
    2. The one overriding primary constituent element (biological) 
required to sustain the northern Great Plains breeding population of 
piping plovers that must be present at all sites is the dynamic 
ecological processes that create and maintain piping plover habitat. 
Without this biological process the physical component of the primary 
constituent elements would not be able to develop. These processes 
develop a mosaic of habitats on the landscape that provide the essential 
combination of prey, forage, nesting, brooding and chick-rearing areas. 
The annual, seasonal, daily, and even hourly availability of the habitat 
patches is dependent on local weather, hydrological conditions and 
cycles, and geological processes. The biological primary constituent 
element, i.e., dynamic ecological processes, creates different physical

[[Page 480]]

primary constituent elements on the landscape. These physical primary 
constituent elements exist on different habitat types found in the 
northern Great Plains, including mixosaline to hypersaline wetlands 
(Cowardin et al. 1979), rivers, reservoirs, and inland lakes. These 
habitat types or physical primary constituent elements that sustain the 
northern Great Plains breeding population of piping plovers are 
described as follows:
    i. On prairie alkali lakes and wetlands, the physical primary 
constituent elements include--(1) shallow, seasonally to permanently 
flooded, mixosaline to hypersaline wetlands with sandy to gravelly, 
sparsely vegetated beaches, salt-encrusted mud flats, and/or gravelly 
salt flats; (2) springs and fens along edges of alkali lakes and 
wetlands; and (3) adjacent uplands 200 ft (61 m) above the high water 
mark of the alkali lake or wetland.
    ii. On rivers the physical primary constituent elements include--
sparsely vegetated channel sandbars, sand and gravel beaches on islands, 
temporary pools on sandbars and islands, and the interface with the 
river.
    iii. On reservoirs the physical primary constituent elements 
include--sparsely vegetated shoreline beaches, peninsulas, islands 
composed of sand, gravel, or shale, and their interface with the water 
bodies.
    iv. On inland lakes (Lake of the Woods) the physical primary 
constituent elements include--sparsely vegetated and windswept sandy to 
gravelly islands, beaches, and peninsulas, and their interface with the 
water body.
    3. Critical habitat does not include existing developed areas such 
as mainstem dam structures, buildings, marinas, boat ramps, bank 
stabilization and breakwater structures, row cropped or plowed 
agricultural areas, roads and other lands (e.g., high bank bluffs along 
Missouri River) unlikely to contain primary constituent elements 
essential for northern Great Plains piping plover conservation.

 Western Snowy Plover (Charadrius alexandrinus nivosus)--Pacific coast 
                               population

    1. The primary constituent elements are those habitat components 
that are essential for the primary biological needs of foraging, 
nesting, rearing of young, roosting, and dispersal, or the capacity to 
develop those habitat components. The primary constituent elements are 
found in areas that support or have the potential to support intertidal 
beaches (between mean low water and mean high tide), associated dune 
systems, and river estuaries. Important components of the

[[Page 513]]

beach/dune/estuarine ecosystem include surf-cast kelp, sparsely 
vegetated foredunes, interdunal flats, spits, washover areas, blowouts, 
intertidal flats, salt flats, flat rocky outcrops, and gravel bars. 
Several of these components (sparse vegetation, salt flats) are mimicked 
in artificial habitat types used less commonly by snowy plovers (i.e., 
dredge spoil sites and salt ponds and adjoining levees).

     Cactus Ferruginous Pygmy-Owl (Glaucidium brasilianum cactorum)

    1. Critical habitat units are depicted for Pima, Cochise, Pinal, and 
Maricopa counties, Arizona, on the maps below. The maps are for 
reference only; the areas in critical habitat are legally described 
below.
    2. Within these areas, the primary constituent elements are those 
habitat components that are essential for the primary biological needs 
of foraging, nesting, rearing of young, roosting, sheltering, and 
dispersal or the capacity to develop those habitat components. The 
primary constituent elements are found in areas that support, or have 
the potential to support, riparian forests, riverbottom woodlands, 
xeroriparian forests, and semidesert grassland, and the Arizona upland 
subdivision of Sonoran desertscrub. Within these vegetation communities, 
specific plant associations that are essential for the primary 
biological needs of the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl include, but are 
not limited to, the following vegetation: cottonwood, willow, ash, 
mesquite, palo verde, ironwood, hackberry, saguaro cactus, and/or organ 
pipe cactus.
    3. Critical habitat does not include non-Federal lands covered by a 
legally operative incidental take permit for the cactus ferruginous 
pygmy-owl issued under section 10(a) of the Act, nor Indian Tribal 
grazing allotments.

          Alameda Whipsnake (Masticophis lateralis euryxanthus)

    1. Critical habitat units are depicted for Alameda, Contra Costa, 
San Joaquin, and Santa Clara Counties, California, on the maps below.
    2. Within these areas, the primary constituent elements are those 
habitat components that are essential for the primary biological needs 
of foraging, sheltering, breeding, maturation, and dispersal. The 
primary constituent elements are in areas that support scrub communities 
including mixed chaparral, chamise-redshank chaparral, and coastal scrub 
and annual grassland and various oak woodlands that lie adjacent to 
scrub habitats. In addition, the primary constituent elements for the 
Alameda whipsnake may be found in grasslands and various oak woodlands 
that are linked to scrub habitats by substantial rock outcrops or 
riparian corridors. Other habitat features that provide a source of 
cover for the whipsnake during dispersal or lie in reasonable proximity 
to scrub habitats and contain habitat features (e.g., rock outcrops) 
that support adequate prey populations may also contain primary 
constituent elements for the Alameda whipsnake.
    3. Critical habitat does not include existing features and 
structures, such as buildings, roads, railroads, large water bodies, and 
similar features and structures not containing one or more of the 
primary constituent elements.

                Golden Coqui (Eleutherodactylus jasperi)

    Puerto Rico. Areas of land, water and airspace with the following 
components: (1) Cerro Avispa-elevation above 700 meters on the south and 
southeastern slope of the mountain: from the northern junction of 
Highway 715 and an unnumbered dirt road southeast and southwest along 
Highway 715 to the southern junction with the same unnumbered dirt road 
and Highway 715, north and northeast along the unnumbered dirt road just 
below the southeast facing crest of Cerro Avispa to its junction with 
Highway 715.
    (2) Monte el Gato-entire summit above 700 meters: from the junction 
of Highway 715 to the junction of Highway 715 and the 700 meter contour 
interval west along Highway 715 to the junction of Highway 715 and an 
unnumbered road, north and northeast along this road to where it crosses 
the 700 meter contour interval, and east along the 700 meter contour 
interval to where it crosses Highway 715.
    (3) Sierra de Cayey-elevations above 700 meters: southeast from the 
junction of Highways 738 and 15 along Highway 15 to point .5 kilometer 
south of Benchmark 684.5, northeast from this point in a line to a point 
on Highway 7741 two kilometers south of the junction of Highway 738 and 
7741, north and northwest along Highway 7741 to its junction with 
Highway 738, and northwest from the junction of Highways 7741 and 738 
along Highway 738 to its junction with Highway 15.

           California Red-Legged Frog (Rana aurora draytonii)

    1. Critical habitat units are depicted for Alameda, Butte, Contra 
Costa, El Dorado, Fresno, Kern, Los Angeles, Marin, Mariposa, Merced, 
Monterey, Napa, Plumas, Riverside, San Benito, San Diego, San Joaquin, 
San Luis Obispo, San Mateo, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, 
Solano, Sonoma,

[[Page 585]]

Stanislaus, Tehama, Tuolumne, and Ventura counties, California, on the 
maps below.
    2. Critical habitat includes: Essential aquatic habitat; associated 
uplands; and dispersal habitat connecting essential aquatic habitat.
    3. Within these areas, primary constituent elements of the 
California red-legged frog include the following habitat components. 
Essential aquatic components consists of all still or slow-flowing 
freshwater aquatic features possessing minimum water depths of 0.5 m (20 
in.), with the exception of deep lacustrine water habitat (lakes and 
reservoirs greater than 20 ha (50 ac)) inhabited by nonnative predators, 
that are essential for providing space, food, and cover needed to 
sustain eggs, tadpoles, metamorphosing juveniles, nonbreeding subadults, 
and breeding and nonbreeding adult frogs, and are found in areas with 
two or more suitable breeding locations and a permanent water source 
with no more than 2 km (1.25 mi) separating these locations. Essential 
dispersal habitat consists of upland and aquatic areas, free of barriers 
and at least 90 m (300 ft) wide; this element is essential for providing 
connectivity between aquatic breeding areas identified above. Upland 
habitat components are areas within 90 m (300 ft) from the edge of the 
essential aquatic primary constituent element. In situations where a 
watershed boundary is less than 90 m (300 ft) from suitable habitat, the 
top of the watershed shall be the boundary for this constituent element.
    4. Existing features and structures within the boundaries of the 
mapped units, such as buildings, roads, aqueducts, railroads, other 
paved areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas, and uplands 
removed from essential aquatic and dispersal habitat, will not contain 
one or more of the primary constituent elements and, therefore, would 
not trigger a section 7 consultation, unless they affect the species 
and/or primary constituent elements in adjacent critical habitat.

                     Arroyo Toad (Bufo californicus)

    1. Critical habitat units are depicted for Monterey, Santa Barbara, 
Ventura, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, Orange, and San Diego 
counties, California, on the maps below.
    2. Critical habitat includes stream and river courses, riparian 
habitats, and adjacent terrace and upland habitats.
    3. Within these areas, primary constituent elements for the arroyo 
toad include a hydrologic regime that supplies sufficient flowing water 
of suitable quality at the appropriate times to provide space, food, and 
cover needed to sustain eggs, tadpoles, metamorphosing juveniles, and 
adult breeding toads; low-gradient stream segments (typically less than 
4 percent) with sandy or fine gravel

[[Page 716]]

substrates which support the formation of shallow pools and sparsely 
vegetated sand and gravel bars for breeding and rearing of tadpoles and 
juveniles; a natural flooding regime or one sufficiently corresponding 
to a natural regime that will periodically scour riparian vegetation, 
rework stream channels and terraces, and redistribute sands and 
sediments, such that adequate numbers and sizes of breeding pools and 
sufficient terrace habitats with appropriate vegetation are maintained 
to provide for the needs of all life stages of the toad; upland habitats 
of sufficient width and quality (i.e., with areas of loose, sandy soil 
where toads can burrow underground) to provide foraging and living areas 
for subadult and adult arroyo toads (loose, sandy soils are typically 
most prevalent on alluvial terraces and valley bottomlands and occur 
primarily, but not exclusively, within 1.5 km (0.9 mi) of the 
streamcourse and less than 25 m (80 ft) in elevation above the adjacent 
stream channel); few or no nonnative species that prey upon or compete 
with arroyo toads, or degrade their habitat; stream channels and upland 
habitats where manmade barriers do not completely or substantially 
impede migration to overwintering sites, dispersal between populations, 
or recolonization of temporarily unoccupied areas that contain suitable 
habitat; and habitats free of, or with limited levels of, land use 
activities that substantially reconfigure stream channels, remove or 
impede the deposition of sand and gravel deposits, compact soils, or 
crush individual toads (see maps labeled Index 1 and Index 2 for 
overview of proposed critical habitat).
    4. Critical habitat does not include existing features and 
structures, such as building, aqueducts, airports, and other developed 
areas not containing one or more of the primary constituent elements.

determine the extent of the floodplain. Only areas of floodplain 
containing at least one of the constituent elements are considered 
critical habitat. Critical habitat designated for the Virgin River chub 
is as follows:
    Utah, Washington County; Arizona, Mohave County; Nevada, Clark 
County. The Virgin River and its 100-year floodplain from its confluence 
with La Verkin Creek, Utah in T.41S., R.13W., sec.23 (Salt Lake Base and 
Meridian) to Halfway Wash, Nevada T.15S., R.69E., sec.6 (Salt Lake Base 
and Meridian).
    The primary constituent elements of critical habitat determined 
necessary for the survival and recovery of these Virgin River fishes are 
water, physical habitat, and biological environment. The desired 
conditions for each of these elements are further discussed below.
    Water--A sufficient quantity and quality of water (i.e., 
temperature, dissolved oxygen, contaminants, nutrients, turbidity, etc.) 
that is delivered to a specific location in accordance with a hydrologic 
regime that is identified for the particular life stage for each 
species. This includes the following:
    1. Water quality characterized by natural seasonally variable 
temperature, turbidity, and conductivity;
    2. hydrologic regime characterized by the duration, magnitude, and 
frequency of flow events capable of forming and maintaining

[[Page 753]]

channel and instream habitat necessary for particular life stages at 
certain times of the year; and
    3. flood events inundating the floodplain necessary to provide the 
organic matter that provides or supports the nutrient and food sources 
for the listed fishes.
    Physical Habitat--Areas of the Virgin River that are inhabited or 
potentially habitable by a particular life stage for each species, for 
use in spawning, nursing, feeding, and rearing, or corridors between 
such areas:
    1. River channels, side channels, secondary channels, backwaters, 
and springs, and other areas which provide access to these habitats; and
    2. areas with slow to moderate velocities, within deep runs or 
pools, with predominately sand substrates, particularly habitats which 
contain boulders or other instream cover.
    Biological Environment--Food supply, predation, and competition are 
important elements of the biological environment and are considered 
components of this constituent element. Food supply is a function of 
nutrient supply, productivity, and availability to each life stage of 
the species. Predation and competition, although considered normal 
components of this environment, are out of balance due to nonnative fish 
species in many areas. Fourteen introduced species, including red shiner 
(Cyprinella lutrensis), black bullhead (Ameiurus melas), channel catfish 
(Ictalurus punctatus), and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), 
compete with or prey upon the listed fishes. Of these, the red shiner is 
the most numerous and has been the most problematic for the listed 
fishes. Red shiners compete for food and available habitats and are 
known to prey on the eggs and early life stages of the listed fishes. 
Components of this constituent element include the following:
    1. Seasonally flooded areas that contribute to the biological 
productivity of the river system by producing allochthonous (humus, 
silt, organic detritus, colloidal matter, and plants and animals 
produced outside the river and brought into the river) organic matter 
which provides and supports much of the food base of the listed fishes; 
and
    2. few or no predatory or competitive nonnative species in occupied 
Virgin River fishes' habitats or potential reestablishment sites.

                Tidewater goby (Eucyclogobius newberrii)

    1. Critical habitat units are depicted for Orange and San Diego 
Counties, California, on the maps below and as described below.
    2. Critical habitat includes the sections of streams indicated on 
the maps below and areas within these reaches potentially inundated by 
high flow events. Where delineated, this is the 50-year flood plain of 
the designated waterways. In areas where the 50-year flood plain is not 
delineated the presence of alluvial soils (soils deposited by streams), 
obligate and facultative wetland vegetation, abandoned river channels, 
or evidence of high water marks can be used to determine the extent of 
the floodplain. Critical habitat does not include existing man-made 
features and structures within this area, such as buildings, roads, 
railroads, and other features, which do not contain, and do not have the 
potential to develop the primary constituent elements for the tidewater 
goby.
    3. Within these areas, the primary constituent elements include, but 
are not limited to, those habitat components that are essential for the 
primary biological needs of foraging, sheltering, and reproduction. 
These elements include coastal lagoons and estuary systems supported by 
a natural hydrological regime, which results in sufficient streamflow, 
areas of shallow water as well as deep pockets of permanent water, sand 
and silt substrate, a variety of aquatic and emergent vegetation, and a 
diversity of prey species; and an environment free from exotic fishes.

              Loach Minnow (Tiaroga (=Rhinichthys) cobitis)

    1. Critical habitat units are depicted for Apache, Cochise, Gila, 
Graham, Greenlee, Pima, Pinal, and Yavapai Counties, Arizona; and Catron 
and Grant Counties, New Mexico on the maps and as described below.
    2. Critical habitat includes the stream channels within the 
identified stream reaches described below and areas within these reaches 
potentially inundated by high flow events. Where delineated, this is the 
100-year floodplain of the designated waterways as defined by the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers. In areas where the 100-year floodplain has not 
been delineated or it is in dispute, the presence of alluvial soils 
(soils deposited by streams), obligate and facultative riparian 
vegetation (requiring and usually occurring in wetlands respectively), 
abandoned river channels, or known high water marks can be used to 
determine the extent of the floodplain. Within these areas, only lands 
which provide the primary constituent elements or which will be capable, 
with restoration, of providing them, are considered critical habitat. 
Existing human-constructed features and structures such as buildings, 
roads, etc., are not considered critical habitat.
    3. Within these areas, the primary constituent elements include, but 
are not limited to, those habitat components that are essential for the 
primary biological needs of foraging, sheltering, dispersal, and 
reproduction. These elements include the following: (1) Permanent 
flowing, unpolluted water; (2) living areas for adult loach minnow with 
moderate to swift flow velocities in shallow water with gravel, cobble, 
and rubble substrates; (3) living areas for juvenile loach minnow with 
moderate to swift flow velocities in shallow water with sand, gravel, 
cobble, and rubble substrates; (4) living areas for larval loach minnow 
with slow to moderate velocities in shallow water with sand, gravel, and 
cobble substrates and abundant instream cover; (5) spawning areas with 
slow to swift flow velocities in shallow water with uncemented cobble 
and rubble substrate; (6) low amounts of fine sediment and substrate 
embeddedness; (7) riffle, run, and backwater components present in the 
aquatic habitat; (8) low to moderate stream gradient; (9) water 
temperatures in the approximate range of 1-30 [deg]C (35-85 [deg]F) with 
natural diurnal and seasonal variation; (10) abundant aquatic insect 
food base; (11) periodic natural flooding; (12) a natural, unregulated 
hydrograph, or if flows are modified or regulated, then a hydrograph 
that demonstrates a retained ability to support a native fish community; 
and (13) habitat devoid of nonnative aquatic species detrimental to 
loach minnow, or habitat in which detrimental nonnative species are at 
levels which allow persistence of loach minnow.
    4. Arizona (Gila and Salt River Meridian (GSRM)) and New Mexico (New 
Mexico Principal Meridian (NMPM)): Areas of land and water as follows 
(physical features were identified using USGS 7.5[min] quadrangle maps; 
river reach distances were derived from digital data obtained from

             Rio Grande Silvery Minnow (Hybognathus amarus)

    (1) Designated critical habitat is depicted for Socorro, Valencia, 
Bernalillo, and Sandoval Counties, New Mexico, on the map and as 
described below.
    (2) For each river reach, the upstream and downstream boundaries are 
described below. Critical habitat includes the stream channels within 
the identified river reaches and areas within these reaches included 
within the existing levees, or if no levees are present, then within a 
lateral distance of 300 ft (91.4 m) on each side of the river width at 
bankfull stage. Bankfull stage is the flow at which water begins to 
leave the channel and move into the floodplain. The bankfull stage is 
not defined by water, and can be determined by visual or physical 
indicators, including: The top of the highest depositional features 
(e.g., point bars), staining of rocks, exposed root hairs, and other 
features.
    (3) Within these areas the primary constituent elements include, but 
are not limited to, those habitat components that are essential for the 
primary biological needs of foraging, sheltering, and reproduction. 
These elements include the following:
    (i) A hydrologic regime that provides sufficient flowing water with 
low to moderate currents capable of forming and maintaining a diversity 
of aquatic habitats, such as, but not limited to the following: 
Backwaters (a body of water connected to the main channel, but with no 
appreciable flow), shallow side channels, pools (that portion of the 
river that is deep with relatively little velocity compared to the rest 
of the channel), eddies (a pool with water moving opposite to that in 
the river channel), and runs (flowing water in the river channel without 
obstructions) of varying depth and velocity--all of which are necessary 
for each of the particular silvery minnow life-history stages in 
appropriate seasons (e.g., the silvery minnow requires habitat with 
sufficient flows from early spring (March) to early summer (June) to 
trigger spawning, flows in the summer (June) and fall (October) that do 
not increase prolonged periods of low or no flow, and a relatively 
constant winter flow (November through February));
    (ii) The presence of eddies created by debris piles, pools, or 
backwaters, or other refuge habitat (e.g., connected oxbows or braided 
channels) within unimpounded stretches of flowing water of sufficient 
length (i.e., river miles) that provide a variation of habitats with a 
wide range of depth and velocities;
    (iii) Substrates of predominantly sand or silt; and
    (iv) Water of sufficient quality to maintain natural, daily, and 
seasonally variable water temperatures in the approximate range of 
greater than 1 [deg]C (35 [deg]F) and less than 30 [deg]C (85 [deg]F) 
and reduce degraded conditions (e.g., decreased dissolved oxygen, 
increased pH).
    (4) The Pueblo lands of Santo Domingo, Santa Ana, Sandia, and Isleta 
are not designated.
    (5) Designated critical habitat is depicted on the following map for 
the middle Rio Grande, which includes the area from Cochiti Reservoir 
downstream to the utility line crossing the Rio Grande just east of the 
Bosque Well as demarcated on USGS Paraje Well 7.5 minute quadrangle 
(1980), with the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates of UTM 
Zone 13: 311474 E, 3719722 N (as referenced with the 1927 North American 
Datum (NAD27)), Sandoval, Bernalillo, Valencia, and Socorro Counties, 
New Mexico. The designation also includes the upper section of the 
tributary Jemez River from Jemez Canyon Dam to the upstream boundary of 
Santa Ana Pueblo, Sandoval County. The river reaches in the middle Rio 
Grande include:
    (i) Jemez Canyon Reach--1 mi (1.6 km) of the Jemez River immediately 
downstream of Jemez Canyon Dam to the upstream boundary Santa Ana 
Pueblo;
    (ii) Cochiti Diversion Dam to Angostura Diversion Dam (Cochiti 
Reach)--21 mi (34 km) of river immediately downstream of Cochiti 
Reservoir to the Angostura Diversion Dam;
    (iii) Angostura Diversion Dam to Isleta Diversion Dam (Angostura 
Reach)--38 mi (61 km) of river immediately downstream of the Angostura 
Diversion Dam to the Isleta Diversion Dam;
    (iv) Isleta Diversion Dam to San Acacia Diversion Dam (Isleta 
Reach)--56 mi (90 km) of river immediately downstream of the Isleta 
Diversion Dam to the San Acacia Diversion Dam; and

[[Page 776]]

    (v) San Acacia Diversion Dam to the Elephant Butte Dam (San Acacia 
Reach)--92 mi (147 km) of river immediately downstream of the San Acacia 
Diversion Dam to the utility line crossing the Rio Grande just east of 
the Bosque Well demarcated on USGS Paraje Well 7.5 minute quadrangle 
(1980) with UTM coordinates of UTM Zone 13: 311474 E, 3719722 N.

    (6) This designation does not include the ephemeral or perennial 
irrigation canals and ditches outside of natural stream channels, 
including the low flow conveyance channel that is adjacent to a portion 
of the river reach within the middle Rio Grande (i.e., downstream of the 
southern boundary of Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge to the 
Elephant Butte Dam).
    (7) Lands located within the exterior boundaries of the critical 
habitat designation (i.e., within the existing levees, or if no levees 
are present, then within a lateral distance of 300 ft (91.4 m) on each 
side of the stream width at bankfull discharge) that are not considered 
critical habitat and are therefore excluded by definition, include: 
Developed flood control facilities; existing paved roads; bridges; 
parking lots; dikes; levees; diversion structures; railroad tracks; 
railroad trestles; water diversion and irrigation canals outside of 
natural stream channels; the low flow conveyance channel; active gravel 
pits; cultivated agricultural land; and residential, commercial, and 
industrial developments.

    2. Critical habitat includes the stream channels within the 
identified stream reaches indicated on the maps below, and includes a 
lateral distance of 91.4 m (300 ft) on each side of the stream width at 
bankfull discharge. Bankfull discharge is the flow at which water begins 
to leave the channel and move into the floodplain (Rosgen 1996) and 
generally occurs with a frequency of every 1 to 2 years (Leopold et al. 
1992).
    3. Within these areas, the primary constituent elements include, but 
are not limited to, those habitat components that are essential for the 
primary biological needs of foraging, sheltering, and reproduction. 
These elements include the following--(1) a natural, unregulated 
hydrologic regime complete with episodes of flood and drought or, if 
flows are modified or regulated, a hydrologic regime characterized by 
the duration,

[[Page 779]]

magnitude, and frequency of flow events capable of forming and 
maintaining channel and instream habitat necessary for particular 
Arkansas River shiner life-stages in appropriate seasons; (2) a complex, 
braided channel with pool, riffle, run, and backwater components that 
provide a suitable variety of depths and current velocities in 
appropriate seasons; (3) a suitable unimpounded stretch of flowing water 
of sufficient length to allow hatching and development of the larvae; 
(4) substrates of predominantly sand, with some patches of gravel and 
cobble; (5) water quality characterized by low concentrations of 
contaminants and natural, daily and seasonally variable temperature, 
turbidity, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and pH; (6) abundant 
terrestrial, semiaquatic, and aquatic invertebrate food base; and (7)

    4. Existing human-constructed features and structures within the 
critical habitat boundary, such as buildings, powerlines, roads, 
railroads, urban development, and other features not containing any 
primary constituent elements, are not considered critical habitat and 
are not included in the designation. Tribal lands located within the 
critical habitat boundary of Unit 1b are not considered critical 
habitat.

    Primary Constituent Elements--physical habitat, water, river flow, 
and salinity concentrations required to maintain delta smelt habitat for 
spawning, larval and juvenile transport, rearing, and adult migration.

                        Spikedace (Meda fulgida)

    1. Critical habitat units are depicted for Cochise, Gila, Graham, 
Greenlee, Pima, Pinal, and Yavapai Counties, Arizona; and Catron, Grant, 
and Hidalgo Counties, New Mexico, on the maps and as described below.
    2. Critical habitat includes the stream channels within the 
identified stream

[[Page 785]]

reaches described below and areas within these reaches potentially 
inundated by high flow events. Where delineated, this is the 100-year 
floodplain of the designated waterways as defined by the U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers. In areas where the 100-year floodplain has not been 
delineated or it is in dispute, the presence of alluvial soils (soils 
deposited by streams), obligate and facultative riparian vegetation 
(requiring and usually occurring in wetlands respectively), abandoned 
river channels, or known high water marks can be used to determine the 
extent of the floodplain. Within these areas, only lands which provide 
the primary constituent elements or which will be capable, with 
restoration, of providing them, are considered critical habitat. 
Existing human-constructed features and structures such as buildings, 
roads, etc., are not considered critical habitat.
    3. Within these areas, the primary constituent elements include, but 
are not limited to, those habitat components that are essential for the 
primary biological needs of foraging, sheltering, dispersal, and 
reproduction. These elements include the following: (1) Permanent, 
flowing, unpolluted water; (2) living areas for adult spikedace with 
slow to swift flow velocities in shallow water with shear zones where 
rapid flow borders slower flow, areas of sheet flow at the upper ends of 
mid-channel sand/gravel bars, and eddies at downstream riffle edges; (3) 
living areas for juveniles with slow to moderate water velocities in 
shallow water with moderate amounts of instream cover; (4) living areas 
for the larval stage with slow to moderate flow velocities in shallow 
water with abundant instream cover; (5) sand, gravel, and cobble 
substrates with low to moderate amounts of fine sediment and substrate 
embeddedness; (6) pool, riffle, run, and backwater components of the 
streams; (7) low stream gradient; (8) water temperatures in the 
approximate range of 1-30 [deg]C (35-85 [deg]F) with natural diurnal and 
seasonal variation; (9) abundant aquatic insect food base; (10) periodic 
natural flooding; (11) a natural, unregulated hydrograph, or if flows 
are modified or regulated, then a hydrograph that demonstrates an 
ability to support a native fish community; and (12) habitat devoid of 
nonnative aquatic species detrimental to spikedace, or habitat in which 
detrimental nonnative species are at levels which allow persistence of 
spikedace.

Mexico Principal Meridian (NMPM)): Areas of land and water as follows

              Gulf Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi)

    (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Louisiana, Mississippi, 
Alabama, and Florida on the maps below.
    (2) The primary constituent elements essential for the conservation 
of Gulf sturgeon are those habitat components that support feeding, 
resting, and sheltering, reproduction, migration, and physical features 
necessary for maintaining the natural processes that support these 
habitat components. The primary constituent elements include:
    (i) Abundant prey items within riverine habitats for larval and 
juvenile life stages, and within estuarine and marine habitats and 
substrates for juvenile, subadult, and adult life stages;
    (ii) Riverine spawning sites with substrates suitable for egg 
deposition and development, such as limestone outcrops and cut limestone 
banks, bedrock, large gravel or cobble beds, marl, soapstone or hard 
clay;
    (iii) Riverine aggregation areas, also referred to as resting, 
holding, and staging areas, used by adult, subadult, and/or juveniles, 
generally, but not always, located in holes below normal riverbed 
depths, believed necessary for minimizing energy expenditures during 
fresh water residency and possibly for osmoregulatory functions;
    (iv) A flow regime (i.e,. the magnitude, frequency, duration, 
seasonality, and rate-of-change of fresh water discharge over time) 
necessary for normal behavior, growth, and survival of all life stages 
in the riverine environment, including migration, breeding site 
selection, courtship, egg fertilization, resting, and staging; and 
necessary for maintaining spawning sites in suitable condition for egg 
attachment, egg sheltering, resting, and larvae staging;
    (v) Water quality, including temperature, salinity, pH, hardness, 
turbidity, oxygen content, and other chemical characteristics, necessary 
for normal behavior, growth, and viability of all life stages;
    (vi) Sediment quality, including texture and other chemical 
characteristics, necessary for normal behavior, growth, and viability of 
all life stages; and
    (vii) Safe and unobstructed migratory pathways necessary for passage 
within and between riverine, estuarine, and marine habitats (e.g. a 
river unobstructed by any permanent structure, or a dammed river that 
still allows for passage).
    (3) Gulf sturgeon is under the joint jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service (FWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). 
The FWS will maintain primary responsibility for recovery actions and 
NMFS will assist in and continue to fund recovery actions pertaining to 
estuarine and marine habitats. In riverine units, the FWS will be 
responsible for all consultations regarding Gulf sturgeon and critical 
habitat. In estuarine units, we will divide responsibility based on the 
action agency involved. The FWS will consult with the Department of 
Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Coast 
Guard, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. NMFS will consult 
with the Department of Defense, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Minerals 
Management Service and any other Federal agencies not mentioned here 
explicitly. In marine units, NMFS will be responsible for all 
consultations regarding Gulf sturgeon and critical habitat. Any Federal 
projects that extend into the jurisdiction of both the Services will be 
consulted on by the FWS with internal coordination with NMFS. Each 
agency will conduct its own intra-agency consultations as necessary.

    (12) Unit 8: Lake Pontchartrain, Lake St. Catherine, The Rigolets, 
Little Lake, Lake Borgne, and Mississippi Sound in Jefferson, Orleans, 
St. Tammany, and St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, Hancock, Jackson, and 
Harrison Counties in Mississippi, and in Mobile County, Alabama.
    (i) Unit 8 encompasses Lake Pontchartrain east of the Lake 
Pontchartrain Causeway, all of Little Lake, The Rigolets, Lake St. 
Catherine, Lake Borgne, including Heron Bay, and the Mississippi Sound. 
Critical habitat follows the shorelines around the perimeters of each 
included lake. The Mississippi Sound includes adjacent open bays 
including Pascagoula Bay, Point aux Chenes Bay, Grand Bay, Sandy Bay, 
and barrier island passes, including Ship Island Pass, Dog Keys Pass, 
Horn Island Pass, and Petit Bois Pass. The northern boundary of the 
Mississippi Sound is the shorelines of the mainland between Heron Bay 
Point, Mississippi and Point aux Pins, Alabama. Critical habitat 
excludes St. Louis Bay, north of the railroad bridge across its mouth; 
Biloxi Bay, north of the U.S. Highway 90 bridge; and Back Bay of Biloxi. 
The southern boundary follows along the broken shoreline of Lake Borgne 
created by low swampy islands from Malheureux Point to Isle au Pitre. 
From the northeast point of Isle au Pitre, the boundary continues in a 
straight north-northeast line to the point 1 nautical mile (nm) (1.9 
kilometers (km)) seaward of the western most extremity of Cat Island 
(30[deg]13[min]N, 89[deg]10[min]W). The southern boundary continues 1 nm 
(1.9 km) offshore of the barrier islands and offshore of the 72 COLREGS 
lines at barrier island passes (defined at 33 CFR 80.815 (c), (d) and 
(e)) to the eastern boundary. Between Cat Island and Ship Island there 
is no 72 COLREGS line. We therefore, have defined that section of the 
southern boundary as 1 nm (1.9 km) offshore of a straight line drawn 
from the southern tip of Cat Island to the western tip of Ship Island. 
The eastern boundary is the line of longitude 88[deg]18.8[min]W from its 
intersection with the shore (Point

    (18) Unit 14: Suwannee Sound in Dixie and Levy Counties, Florida.
    (i) Unit 14 includes Suwannee Sound and a portion of adjacent Gulf 
of Mexico waters extending 9 nm from shore (16.7 km) out to the State 
territorial water boundary. Its northern boundary is formed by a 
straight line from the northern tip of Big Pine Island (at

[[Page 835]]

approximately 29[deg]23[min]N, 83[deg]12[min]W) to the Federal-State 
boundary at 29[deg]17[min]N, 83[deg]21[min]W. The southern boundary is 
formed by a straight line from the southern tip of Richards Island (at 
approximately 83[deg]04[min]W, 29[deg]11[min]N) to the Federal-State 
boundary at 83[deg]15[min]W, 29[deg]04[min]N. The lateral extent of Unit 
14 is the MHW line along the shorelines and the mouths of the Suwannee

[[Page 836]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19MR03.036

    (19)(i) The river reaches within Units 1 to 7 as critical habitat 
lie within the ordinary high water line. As defined in 33 CFR 32.911, 
the ordinary high water line on non-tidal rivers is the line on the 
shore established by the fluctuations of water and indicated by physical 
characteristics such as a clear, natural line impressed on the bank; 
shelving;

[[Page 837]]

changes in the character of soil; destruction of terrestrial vegetation; 
the presence of litter and debris; or other appropriate means that 
consider the characteristics of the surrounding areas.
    (ii) The downstream limit of the riverine units is the mouth of each 
river. The mouth is defined as rkm 0 (rmi 0). Although the interface of 
fresh and saltwater, referred to as the saltwater wedge, occurs within 
the lower-most reach of a river, for ease in delineating critical 
habitat units, we are defining the boundary between the riverine and 
estuarine units as rkm 0 (rmi 0).
    (iii) Regulatory jurisdiction in coastal areas extends to the line 
on the shore reached by the plane of the mean (average) high water (MHW) 
(33 CFR 329.12(a)(2)). All bays and estuaries within Units 8 to 14 
therefore, lie below the MHW lines. Where precise determination of the 
actual location becomes necessary, it must be established by survey with 
reference to the available tidal datum, preferably averaged over a 
period of 18.6 years. Less precise methods, such as observation of the 
``apparent shoreline'' which is determined by reference to physical 
markings, lines of vegetation, may be used only where an estimate is 
needed of the line reached by the mean high water.
    (iv) The term 72 COLREGS is defined as demarcation lines which 
delineate those waters upon which mariners shall comply with the 
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 and 
those waters upon which mariners shall comply with the Inland Navigation 
Rules (33 CFR 80.01). The waters inside of these lines are Inland Rules 
waters and the waters outside the lines are COLREGS waters. These lines 
are defined in 33 CFR 80, and have been used for identification purposes 
to delineate boundary lines of the estuarine and marine habitat Units 8, 
9, 11, and 12.
    (20) Critical habitat does not include existing developed sites such 
as dams, piers, marinas, bridges, boat ramps, exposed oil and gas 
pipelines, oil rigs, and similar structures or designated public 
swimming areas.

  Kootenai River population of white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)

    1. Idaho, Boundary County: Kootenai River from river kilometer 228 
(river mile 141.4) to river kilometer 246 (river mile 152.6), as 
indicated on the map below, from ordinary high-water line to opposite 
bank ordinary high-water line as defined in 33 CFR 329.11.
    2. Primary constituent elements include those that are essential for 
the primary biological needs of normal behavior, water requirements, 
cover, shelter, breeding, and rearing of offspring. These elements 
include the following: (1) A flow and hydrologic regime characterized by 
water magnitude, timing, depth, velocity, and quality (including 
temperatures) necessary for normal behavior involving breeding site 
selection, breeding and fertilization, and cover for egg incubation and 
yolk sac fry development; (2) a flow and hydrologic regime characterized 
by water of sufficient duration and magnitude to restore or maintain 
riverbed substrate necessary for cover and shelter for both incubating 
eggs and yolk sac larvae; (3) a flow and hydrologic regime characterized 
by flow magnitude, time, velocity, depth, and duration necessary for the 
normal behavior of adult and juvenile sturgeon; and (4) water and 
sediment quality necessary for normal behavior, including breeding 
behavior, and the viability of all life stages, including incubating 
eggs and yolk sac larvae.
    3. Within this area, existing structures, such as highway and 
railroad bridges, are not included in the critical habitat designation.

                  Woundfin (Plagopterus argentissimus)

    Legal descriptions for St. George (Utah-Arizona) and Littlefield 
(Arizona) were obtained from the 1987 BLM maps (Surface Management 
Status 30x60 Minute Quadrangles). Legal descriptions for Overton 
(Nevada-Arizona) were obtained from the 1989 BLM maps (Surface 
Management Status 30x60 Minute Quadrangles). The 100-year floodplain for 
many areas is detailed in Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) published by 
and available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). In 
areas where a FIRM is not available, the presence of alluvium soils or 
known high water marks can be used to determine the extent of the 
floodplain. Only areas of floodplain containing at least one of the 
constituent elements are considered critical habitat. Critical habitat 
designated for the woundfin is as follows:
    Utah, Washington County; Arizona, Mohave County; Nevada, Clark 
County. The Virgin River and its 100-year floodplain from its confluence 
with La Verkin Creek, Utah in T.41S., R.13W., sec.23 (Salt Lake Base and 
Meridian) to Halfway Wash, Nevada T.15S., R.69E., sec.6 (Salt Lake Base 
and Meridian).
    The primary constituent elements of critical habitat determined 
necessary for the survival and recovery of these Virgin River fishes are 
water, physical habitat, and biological environment. The desired 
conditions for each of these elements are further discussed below.
    Water--A sufficient quantity and quality of water (i.e., 
temperature, dissolved oxygen, contaminants, nutrients, turbidity, etc.) 
that is delivered to a specific location in accordance with a hydrologic 
regime that is identified for the particular life stage for each 
species. This includes the following:

[[Page 843]]

    1. Water quality characterized by natural seasonally variable 
temperature, turbidity, and conductivity;
    2. hydrologic regime characterized by the duration, magnitude, and 
frequency of flow events capable of forming and maintaining channel and 
instream habitat necessary for particular life stages at certain times 
of the year; and
    3. flood events inundating the floodplain necessary to provide the 
organic matter that provides or supports the nutrient and food sources 
for the listed fishes.
    Physical Habitat--Areas of the Virgin River that are inhabited or 
potentially habitable by a particular life stage for each species, for 
use in spawning, nursing, feeding, and rearing, or corridors between 
such areas:
    1. River channels, side channels, secondary channels, backwaters, 
and springs, and other areas which provide access to these habitats;
    2. areas inhabited by adult and juvenile woundfin include runs and 
pools adjacent to riffles that have sand and sand/gravel substrates;
    3. areas inhabited by juvenile woundfin are generally deeper and 
slower. When turbidity is low, adults also tend to occupy deeper and 
slower habitats;
    4. areas inhabited by woundfin larvae include shoreline margins and 
backwater habitats associated with growths of filamentous algae.
    Biological Environment--Food supply, predation, and competition are 
important elements of the biological environment and are considered 
components of this constituent element. Food supply is a function of 
nutrient supply, productivity, and availability to each life stage of 
the species. Predation and competition, although considered normal 
components of this environment, are out of balance due to nonnative fish 
species in many areas. Fourteen introduced species, including red shiner 
(Cyprinella lutrensis), black bullhead (Ameiurus melas), channel catfish 
(Ictalurus punctatus), and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), 
compete with or prey upon the listed fishes. Of these, the red shiner is 
the most numerous and has been the most problematic for the listed 
fishes. Red shiners compete for food and available habitats and are 
known to prey on the eggs and early life stages of the listed fishes. 
Components of this constituent element include the following:
    1. Seasonally flooded areas that contribute to the biological 
productivity of the river system by producing allochthonous (humus, 
silt, organic detritus, colloidal matter, and plants and animals 
produced outside the river and brought into the river) organic matter 
which provides and supports much of the food base of the listed fishes; 
and
    2. few or no predatory or competitive nonnative species in occupied 
Virgin River fishes' habitats or potential reestablishment sites.

riparian areas and hydrogeologic features that capture and direct water 
flow to these spring and stream systems; a perennial flow of water 
throughout even the most severe drought conditions; and stream channel 
morphology that provides protection from channel scour by having 
overhanging waterfalls, protected tributaries, or similar refugia.
    (3) Existing human-made features and structures within the 
boundaries of the mapped units, such as dams, ditches, tunnels, flumes, 
and other human-made features that do not contain the primary 
constituent elements, are not included as critical habitat.

          Cokendolpher cave harvestman (Texella cokendolpheri)

    (1) Critical habitat for the Cokendolpher cave harvestman occurs in 
Unit 20 as described below and depicted on Map 1 (index map) and Map 2 
below. All coordinates are geographic longitude and latitude, decimal 
degree coordinate pairs, referenced to North American Horizontal Datum 
1983. Coordinates were derived from 2001 digital orthophotographs.

invertebrate species in Bexar County, Texas--follows:

[[Page 863]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR08AP03.000

    (3) The primary constituent elements include:
    (i) The physical features of karst-forming rock containing 
subterranean spaces with stable temperatures, high humidities (near 
saturation), and suitable substrates (for example, spaces between and 
underneath rocks suitable for foraging and sheltering); and
    (ii) The biological features of a healthy surface community of 
native plants (for example, juniper-oak woodland) and animals (for 
example, cave crickets) surrounding the karst feature that provide 
nutrient input and buffer the karst ecosystem from adverse effects 
(from, for example, nonnative species invasions, contaminants, and 
fluctuations in temperature and humidity).
    (4) Existing human-constructed, above-ground, impervious structures 
do not contain the primary constituent elements and are not considered 
to be critical habitat. Such features and structures include, but are 
not limited to, buildings and paved roads. However, subsurface areas 
under these structures are considered to be critical habitat since 
subterranean spaces containing these species and/or transmitting 
moisture and nutrients through the karst ecosystem extend, in some 
cases, underneath these existing human-constructed structures. 
Landscaped areas associated with existing human-constructed structures 
also are not considered critical habitat.

                Kauai cave wolf spider (Adelocosa anops).

    (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for the island of Kauai, 
Hawaii, on the maps below.
    (2) The primary constituent elements for the Kauai cave wolf spider 
are:
    (i) The presence of subterranean spaces from 5 mm to 25 cm (0.2 in 
to 10 in) at their narrowest point (collectively termed ``mesocaverns'') 
and/or cave passages greater than 25 cm (<ls-thn-eq>10 in);

[[Page 867]]

    (ii) Dark and/or stagnant air zones that maintain relative humidity 
at saturation levels (<ls-thn-eq>=100 percent); and
    (iii) The presence in these types of mesocaverns or caves of roots 
from living, nontoxic plants such as, but not limited to, ohia 
(Metrosideros polymorpha), maiapilo (Capparis sandwichiana), and aalii 
(Dodonea viscosa).
    (3) All critical habitat areas contain one or more of the primary 
constituent elements for the Kauai cave wolf spider.
    (4)(i) Existing human-constructed features and structures within the 
boundaries of mapped units that involved trenching, filling, or 
excavation resulting in below-surface modification or alteration would 
not contain either of the primary constituent elements and are excluded 
from critical habitat designation. Such features and structures include 
but are not limited to: Homes and buildings for which the underlying 
bedrock has been altered for their construction or through incorporation 
of or connection to buried structural foundations, septic tanks, city 
sewage and drainage systems, or water or underground electrical supply 
corridors; paved roads; and areas previously or currently used as a 
quarry.
    (ii) Areas that have been modified on the surface but without 
trenching, filling, or excavation resulting in below-surface 
modification or alteration are included in the critical habitat 
designation, even if they are adjacent to areas that have undergone 
below-surface modification.
    (5) Critical habitat units are described below. Coordinates in UTM 
Zone 4 with units in meters using North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83).

of the primary constituent elements are not considered critical habitat.

    (h) Crustaceans.

              Kauai cave amphipod (Spelaeorchestia koloana)

    (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for the island of Kauai, 
Hawaii, on the maps below.
    (2) The primary constituent elements for the Kauai cave amphipod 
are:
    (i) The presence of subterranean spaces from 5 mm to 25 cm (0.2 in 
to 10 in) at their narrowest point (collectively termed ``mesocaverns'') 
and/or cave passages greater than 25 cm (<ls-thn-eq>10 in);
    (ii) Dark and/or stagnant air zones that maintain relative humidity 
at saturation levels (<ls-thn-eq>=100 percent); and
    (iii) The presence in these types of mesocaverns or caves of roots 
from living, nontoxic plants such as, but not limited to, ohia 
(Metrosideros polymorpha), maiapilo (Capparis sandwichiana), and aalii 
(Dodonea viscosa).
    (3) All critical habitat areas contain one or more of the primary 
constituent elements for the Kauai cave amphipod.
    (4)(i) Existing human-constructed features and structures within the 
boundaries of mapped units that involved trenching, filling, or 
excavation resulting in below-surface modification or alteration would 
not contain either of the primary constituent elements and are excluded 
from critical habitat designation. Such features and structures include 
but are not limited to: Homes and buildings for which the underlying 
bedrock has been altered for their construction or through incorporation 
of or connection to buried structural foundations, septic tanks, city 
sewage and drainage systems, or water or underground electrical supply 
corridors; paved roads; and areas previously or currently used as a 
quarry.
    (ii) Areas that have been modified on the surface but without 
trenching, filling, or excavation resulting in below-surface 
modification or alteration are included in the critical habitat 
designation, even if they are adjacent to areas that have undergone 
below-surface modification.
    (5) Critical habitat units are described below. Coordinates in UTM 
Zone 4 with units in meters using North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). 
The following map shows the general locations of the 14 critical habitat 
units designated on the island of Kauai.

           Conservancy fairy shrimp (Branchinecta conservatio)

    (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Tehama, Glenn, Colusa, 
Stanislaus, Mariposa and Ventura Counties, California, on the map below.
    (2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for 
Conservancy fairy shrimp are the habitat components that provide:

[[Page 896]]

    (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and 
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths that typically become 
inundated during winter rains and hold water for sufficient lengths of 
time necessary for Conservancy fairy shrimp incubation, reproduction, 
dispersal, feeding, and sheltering, including but not limited to large, 
playa vernal pools often on basin rim landforms and alkaline soils, but 
which are dry during the summer and do not necessarily fill with water 
every year; and
    (ii) The geographic, topographic, and edaphic features that support 
aggregations or systems of hydrologically interconnected pools, swales, 
and other ephemeral wetlands and depressions within a matrix of 
surrounding uplands that together form hydrologically and ecologically 
functional units called vernal pool complexes. These features contribute 
to the filling and drying of the vernal pool, and maintain suitable 
periods of pool inundation, water quality, and soil moisture for vernal 
pool crustacean hatching, growth and reproduction, and dispersal, but 
not necessarily every year.
    (3) Existing manmade features and structures, such as buildings, 
roads, railroads, airports, runways, other paved areas, lawns, and other 
urban landscaped areas do not contain one or more of the primary 
constituent elements. Federal actions limited to those areas, therefore, 
would not trigger a consultation under section 7 of the Act unless they 
may affect the species and/or primary constituent elements in adjacent 
critical habitat.
    (4) Critical habitat does not include the following lands although 
they may fall within the legal descriptions below:
    (i) Lands within the following California counties: Butte, Madera, 
Merced, Sacramento, and Solano;
    (ii) Federally-owned lands within the boundaries of the Kern, 
Sacramento, San Francisco Bay, and San Luis National Wildlife Refuges 
and National Wildlife Refuge Complexes, and the Coleman National Fish 
Hatchery;
    (iii) State-owned lands within the boundaries of the Allensworth, 
Boggs Lake, Butte Creek Canyon, Calhoun Cut, Carrizo Plains, Dales Lake, 
Fagan Marsh, Phoenix Field, San Joaquin River, Stone Corral, and Thomes 
Creek Ecological Reserves;
    (iv) State-owned lands within the boundaries of the Battle Creek, 
Big Sandy, Grizzly Island, Hill Slough, North Grasslands, and Oroville 
Wildlife Areas.
    (5) Unit 1: Butte and Tehama Counties, California. From USGS 
1:24,000 quadrangle maps Acorn Hollow, Campbell Mound, Foster Island,

            Longhorn Fairy Shrimp (Branchinecta longiantenna)

    (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Alameda, Contra Costa, 
and San Luis Obispo Counties, California, on the map below.
    (2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for 
longhorn fairy shrimp are the habitat components that provide:
    (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and 
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths that typically become 
inundated during winter rains and hold water for sufficient lengths of 
time necessary for longhorn fairy shrimp incubation, reproduction, 
dispersal, feeding, and sheltering, including but not limited to, large, 
playa vernal pools often on basin rim landforms and alkaline soils, but 
which are dry during the summer and do not necessarily fill with water 
every year; and
    (ii) The geographic, topographic, and edaphic features that support 
aggregations or systems of hydrologically interconnected pools, swales, 
and other ephemeral wetlands and depressions within a matrix of 
surrounding uplands that together form hydrologically and ecologically 
functional units called vernal pool complexes. These features contribute 
to the filling and drying of the vernal pool, and maintain suitable 
periods of pool inundation, water quality, and soil moisture for vernal 
pool crustacean hatching, growth and reproduction, and dispersal, but 
not necessarily every year.
    (3) Existing manmade features and structures, such as buildings, 
roads, railroads, airports, runways, other paved areas, lawns, and other 
urban landscaped areas do not contain one or more of the primary 
constituent elements. Federal actions limited to those areas, therefore, 
would not trigger a consultation under section 7 of the Act unless they 
may affect the species and/or primary constituent elements in adjacent 
critical habitat.
    (4) Critical habitat does not include the following lands although 
they may fall within the legal descriptions below:
    (i) Lands within the following California counties: Butte, Madera, 
Merced, Sacramento, and Solano;
    (ii) Federally-owned lands within the boundaries of the Kern, 
Sacramento, San Francisco Bay, and San Luis National Wildlife Refuges 
and National Wildlife Refuge Complexes, and the Coleman National Fish 
Hatchery;
    (iii) State-owned lands within the boundaries of the Allensworth, 
Boggs Lake, Butte Creek Canyon, Calhoun Cut, Carrizo Plains, Dales Lake, 
Fagan Marsh, Phoenix Field, San Joaquin River, Stone Corral, and Thomes 
Creek Ecological Reserves;
    (iv) State-owned lands within the boundaries of the Battle Creek, 
Big Sandy, Grizzly Island, Hill Slough, North Grasslands, and Oroville 
Wildlife Areas.

            Riverside Fairy Shrimp (Streptocephalus woottoni)

    1. Critical habitat units are depicted for Los Angeles, Orange, 
Riverside, San Diego, and Ventura counties, California, on the maps 
below.
    2. Critical habitat includes vernal pools, vernal pool complexes, 
and ephemeral ponds

[[Page 905]]

and depressions and their associated watersheds and hydrologic regime 
indicated on the maps below and in the legal descriptions.
    3. Within these areas, the primary constituent elements for the 
Riverside fairy shrimp are those habitat components that are essential 
for the primary biological needs of foraging, sheltering, reproduction, 
and dispersal. The primary constituent elements are found in those areas 
that support vernal pools or other ephemeral ponds and depressions, and 
their associated watersheds. The primary constituent elements are: small 
to large pools with moderate to deep depths that hold water for 
sufficient lengths of time necessary for incubation and reproduction, 
but not necessarily every year; entire watershed(s) and other hydrologic 
features that support pool basins and their related pool complexes; flat 
or gently sloping topography; and any soil type with a clay component 
and/or an impermeable surface or subsurface layer known to support 
vernal pool habitat. All designated critical habitat areas contain one 
or more of the primary constituent elements for Riverside fairy shrimp.
    4. Existing features and structures, such as buildings, roads, 
railroads, urban development, and other such developed features not 
containing primary constituent elements, are not considered critical 
habitat. Federal actions limited to these areas would not trigger a 
section 7 consultation, unless they affect the species and/or the 
primary constituent elements in adjacent critical habitat.

             Vernal Pool Fairy Shrimp (Branchinecta lynchi)

    (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Jackson County, Oregon; 
Shasta, Tehama, Glenn, Colusa, Placer, Napa, Contra Costa, Alameda, 
Amador, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Mariposa, Fresno, Tulare, Kings, San 
Benito, Monterey, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura Counties, 
California on the map below:

[[Page 927]]

    (2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for vernal 
pool fairy shrimp are the habitat components that provide:
    (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and 
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths that typically become 
inundated during winter rains and hold water for sufficient lengths of 
time necessary for vernal pool fairy shrimp incubation, reproduction, 
dispersal, feeding, and sheltering, including but not limited to, 
Northern Hardpan, Northern Claypan, Northern Volcanic Mud Flow, and 
Northern Basalt Flow vernal pools formed on a variety of geologic 
formations and soil types, but which are dry during the summer and do 
not necessarily fill with water every year; and
    (ii) The geographic, topographic, and edaphic features that support 
aggregations or systems of hydrologically interconnected pools, swales, 
and other ephemeral wetlands and depressions within a matrix of 
surrounding uplands that together form hydrologically and ecologically 
functional units called vernal pool complexes. These features contribute 
to the filling and drying of the vernal pool, and maintain suitable 
periods of pool inundation, water quality, and soil moisture for vernal 
pool crustacean hatching, growth and reproduction, and dispersal, but 
not necessarily every year.
    (3) Existing manmade features and structures, such as buildings, 
roads, railroads, airports, runways, other paved areas, lawns, and other 
urban landscaped areas do not contain one or more of the primary 
constituent elements. Federal actions limited to those areas, therefore, 
would not trigger a consultation under section 7 of the Act unless they 
may affect the species and/or primary constituent elements in adjacent 
critical habitat.
    (4) Critical habitat does not include the following lands although 
they may fall within the legal descriptions below:
    (i) Lands within the following California counties: Butte, Madera, 
Merced, Sacramento, and Solano;
    (ii) Federally-owned lands within the boundaries of the Kern, 
Sacramento, San Francisco Bay, and San Luis National Wildlife Refuges 
and National Wildlife Refuge Complexes, and the Coleman National Fish 
Hatchery;
    (iii) State-owned lands within the boundaries of the Allensworth, 
Boggs Lake, Butte Creek Canyon, Calhoun Cut, Carrizo Plains, Dales Lake, 
Fagan Marsh, Phoenix Field, San Joaquin River, Stone Corral, and Thomes 
Creek Ecological Reserves;
    (iv) State-owned lands within the boundaries of the Battle Creek, 
Big Sandy, Grizzly Island, Hill Slough, North Grasslands, and Oroville 
Wildlife Areas.

passage with abundant organic material and sediments consisting of 
coarse silt and very coarse to very fine sand.

             Vernal Pool Tadpole Shrimp (Lepidurus packardi)

    (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Shasta, Tehama, Glenn, 
Colusa, Alameda, Amador, Stanislaus, Mariposa, Fresno, Tulare and Kings 
Counties, California on the map below.
    (2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for vernal 
pool tadpole shrimp are the habitat components that provide:
    (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and 
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths that typically become 
inundated during winter rains and hold water for sufficient lengths of 
time necessary for vernal pool tadpole shrimp incubation, reproduction, 
dispersal, feeding, and sheltering, but which are dry during the summer 
and do not necessarily fill with water every year, including but not 
limited to, vernal pools on Redding and Corning soils on high terrace 
landforms, and
    (ii) The geographic, topographic, and edaphic features that support 
aggregations or systems of hydrologically interconnected pools, swales, 
and other ephemeral wetlands and depressions within a matrix of 
surrounding uplands that together form hydrologically and ecologically 
functional units called vernal pool complexes. These features contribute 
to the filling and drying of the vernal pool, and maintain suitable 
periods of pool inundation, water quality, and soil moisture for vernal 
pool crustacean hatching, growth and reproduction, and dispersal, but 
not necessarily every year.
    (3) Existing manmade features and structures, such as buildings, 
roads, railroads, airports, runways, other paved areas, lawns, and other 
urban landscaped areas do not contain one or more of the primary 
constituent elements. Federal actions limited to those areas, therefore, 
would not trigger a consultation under section 7 of the Act unless they 
may affect the species and/or primary constituent elements in adjacent 
critical habitat.
    (4) Critical habitat does not include the following lands although 
they may fall within the legal descriptions below:
    (i) Lands within the following California counties: Butte, Madera, 
Merced, Sacramento, and Solano;
    (ii) Federally-owned lands within the boundaries of the Kern, 
Sacramento, San Francisco Bay, and San Luis National Wildlife Refuges 
and National Wildlife Refuge Complexes, and the Coleman National Fish 
Hatchery;
    (iii) State-owned lands within the boundaries of the Allensworth, 
Boggs Lake, Butte Creek Canyon, Calhoun Cut, Carrizo Plains, Dales Lake, 
Fagan Marsh, Phoenix Field, San Joaquin River, Stone Corral, and Thomes 
Creek Ecological Reserves;
    (iv) State-owned lands within the boundaries of the Battle Creek, 
Big Sandy, Grizzly Island, Hill Slough, North Grasslands, and Oroville 
Wildlife Areas.

                Helotes mold beetle (Batrisodes venyivi)

    (1) Critical habitat for the Helotes mold beetle occurs in Units 
1e1, 3, and 5 as described below and depicted on Map 1 (index map) and 
Maps 2 through 4 below. All coordinates are geographic longitude and 
latitude, decimal degree coordinate pairs, referenced to North American 
Horizontal Datum 1983. Coordinates were derived from 2001 digital 
orthophotographs.
    (2) Map 1--Index map of critical habitat units for karst 
invertebrate species in Bexar County, Texas--follows:

[[Page 973]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR08AP03.007

    (3) The primary constituent elements include:
    (i) The physical features of karst-forming rock containing 
subterranean spaces with stable temperatures, high humidities (near 
saturation), and suitable substrates (for example, spaces between and 
underneath rocks suitable for foraging and sheltering); and
    (ii) The biological features of a healthy surface community of 
native plants (for example, juniper-oak woodland) and animals (for 
example, cave crickets) surrounding the karst feature that provide 
nutrient input and buffer the karst ecosystem from adverse effects 
(from, for example, nonnative species invasions, contaminants, and 
fluctuations in temperature and humidity).
    (4) Existing human-constructed, above ground, impervious structures 
do not contain the primary constituent elements and are not considered 
to be critical habitat. Such features and structures include, but are 
not limited to, buildings and paved roads. However, subsurface areas 
under these structures are considered to be critical habitat since 
subterranean spaces containing these species and/or transmitting 
moisture and nutrients through the karst ecosystem extend, in some 
cases, underneath these existing human-constructed structures. 
Landscaped areas associated with existing human-constructed structures 
are also not considered critical habitat.
    (5) Two caves, Helotes Blowhole and Helotes Hilltop caves, and their 
associated approximately 10 ha (25 ac) karst management area established 
under the La Cantera section 10 permit, are within the boundaries of 
Unit 3 but are not designated as critical habitat.
    (6) Unit 1e1 (15 ha (38 ac)) is an area bounded by points with the 
following coordinates: -98.7273522, 29.5853221; -98.7276682, 29.5844887;

         Bay Checkerspot Butterfly (Euphydryas editha bayensis)

    1. Critical habitat units are depicted for San Mateo and Santa Clara 
Counties, California, on the maps below.
    2. Within these areas, the primary constituent elements are those 
habitat components that are essential for the primary biological needs 
of foraging, sheltering, breeding, maturation, and dispersal. The 
primary constituent elements are one or more of the following: stands of 
Plantago erecta, Castilleja exserta, or Castilleja densiflora; spring 
flowers providing nectar; pollinators of the bay checkerspot's food and 
nectar plants; soils derived from serpentinic rock; and space for 
dispersal between habitable areas. In addition, the following are each 
primary constituent elements to be conserved when present in combination 
with one or more of the primary constituent elements above: areas of 
open grassland, topography with varied slopes and aspects providing 
surface conditions with warm and moderate to cool temperatures during 
sunny spring days, stable holes or cracks in the soil and surface rocks 
or rock outcrops, wetlands providing moisture during times of spring 
drought.
    3. Within these areas, existing human-constructed features and 
structures, such as buildings, roads, railroads, urban development, and 
other human-constructed features not containing any primary constituent 
elements, are not considered critical habitat and are not included in 
the designation.

    Unit 3 (San Bruno Mountain Unit): San Mateo County, California. All 
area on San Bruno Mountain above the 152 m (500 ft) elevation contour 
and east of the western Pacific Gas and Electric transmission corridor 
(this transmission corridor runs south to southwesterly from the west 
end of Guadalupe Valley to the South San Francisco/

[[Page 997]]

Colma City border) as shown on the USGS San Francisco South 7.5 minute 
quadrangle, 1956).
    Unit 4 (Bear Ranch Unit): Santa Clara County, California. Those 
portions of section 32, T.9 S., R.4 E. and section 5, T.10 S., R.4 E., 
westerly of Coyote Reservoir Road--a light-duty road shown but not named 
on the USGS Gilroy 7.5 minute quadrangle (1955, photorevised 1968 and 
1973).
    Unit 5 (San Martin Unit): Santa Clara County, California. Bounded on 
the north by a line running due east-west through a point 305 m (1000 
ft) due north of a hilltop marked 239 m (785 ft) in elevation on the 
USGS Mt. Madonna 7.5 minute quadrangle (1955, photorevised 1968). This 
hilltop is near latitude 37 degrees 4 minutes 42 seconds north, 
longitude 121 degrees 38 minutes 19 seconds west (Hayes Lane, not shown 
on the Mt. Madonna quadrangle, also runs in the vicinity of this 
hilltop). The north boundary runs as far east as its intersection with 
the 97 m (320 ft) elevation contour west of Coolidge Avenue as shown on 
the Mt. Madonna quadrangle. From this point the boundary runs 
southeasterly, southerly, and westerly following this contour, 
continuing onto the USGS Gilroy 7.5 minute quadrangle (1955, 
photorevised 1968 and 1973) and back to its intersection with longitude 
121 degrees 37 minutes 30 seconds west (the junction between the two 
quadrangles). The unit is bounded on the south-southwest by a straight 
line running from this latter point for a distance of about 2,228 m 
(7,310 ft) slightly south of west-northwest (bearing 291.5 degrees) to a 
hilltop labeled 151 m (495 ft) in elevation on the Mt. Madonna 
quadrangle. The west boundary of the unit runs from this hilltop due 
north-northeast (bearing 22.5 degrees) to the north boundary.

    Unit 8 (Kirby Unit): Santa Clara County, California. Beginning at 
the intersection of the intermittent creek draining Metcalf Canyon 
(Metcalf Canyon on the USGS Morgan Hill 7.5 minute quadrangle, 1955, 
photorevised 1980) with Highway 101 (current alignment, not shown on 
Morgan Hill quadrangle), the unit is bounded on the east, southeast, and 
south by Highway 101 (east edge of pavement, current alignment, not 
shown on the Morgan Hill quadrangle), south to where it crosses Coyote 
Creek. From there the boundary runs southeasterly up along Coyote Creek 
to the Anderson Lake dam; then east-northeasterly up the face of the dam 
to Anderson Lake (Anderson Reservoir). The unit is bounded on the 
southeast by Anderson Lake. From the northernmost tip of Anderson Lake 
(at latitude 37 degrees 12 minutes 15 seconds north) the boundary runs 
slightly north of west for a distance of about 1,097 m (3,600 ft) to a 
hilltop marked 379 m (1,243 ft) in elevation on the Morgan Hill 
quadrangle; then slightly west of northwest for a distance of about 
1,707 m (5,600 ft) to a hilltop marked 411 m (1,347 ft) in elevation on 
the Morgan Hill quadrangle; then nearly due west for a distance of about 
500 m (1,640 ft) to a hilltop marked 430 m (1,412 ft) in elevation on 
the Morgan Hill quadrangle; then north of northwest (bearing 325 
degrees) for a distance of about 2,551 m (8,370 ft) to a hilltop marked 
444 m (1,457 ft) in elevation on the Morgan Hill quadrangle; then on a 
line running from this hilltop south of west-southwest (bearing 237 
degrees) to the intersection of the Metcalf Canyon drainage with the 354 
m (1,160 ft) elevation contour as shown on the Morgan Hill quadrangle. 
The north boundary of the unit then continues westerly down the Metcalf 
Canyon drainage to the starting point.

    Unit 11 (San Felipe Unit): Santa Clara County, California. The east 
boundary of the San Felipe critical habitat unit begins at the 440 m 
(1,445 ft) hilltop identified in the northeast boundary of the Metcalf 
unit (this peak is labeled on the USGS Morgan Hill 7.5 minute quadrangle 
(1955, photorevised 1980), near latitude 37 degrees 15 minutes north, 
longitude 121 degrees 43 minutes west); and proceeds from that hilltop 
due north to San Felipe Road at an elevation of about 296 m (970 ft) 
(USGS Lick Observatory 7.5 minute quadrangle, 1955, photorevised 1968); 
then west-northwesterly along San Felipe Road (southwest edge of 
pavement) for a distance of about 2.7 km (1.7 mi) to Silver Creek Road 
(sic). The north boundary is formed by Silver Creek Road (south edge of 
pavement) from San Felipe Road to Silver Creek (the creek crossing is on 
the USGS San Jose East 7.5 minute quadrangle, 1961, photorevised 1980). 
The west boundary, which abuts the Metcalf unit, runs from Silver Creek 
Road southeasterly along Silver Creek (mostly on Lick Observatory 
quadrangle). The south boundary also abuts the Metcalf unit, and runs 
from Silver Creek (Morgan Hill quadrangle) due east to the starting 
point.

running due north from the southern Calero County Park boundary through 
a hilltop elevation labeled 307 m (1,009 ft) on the USGS Santa Teresa 
Hills 7.5 minute quadrangle (1953, photorevised 1980) to Calero 
Reservoir. This hilltop is near latitude 37 degrees 10 minutes 15 
seconds north, longitude 121 degrees 46 minutes 15 seconds west.
    Unit 14 (Santa Teresa Hills Unit): Santa Clara County, California. 
The east and southeast boundary runs as follows, beginning at the 
westernmost corner of the Tulare Hill Corridor unit: due southeast and 
then northeast along the Tulare Hill Corridor unit boundary, to the 85 m 
(280 ft) elevation contour (USGS Santa Teresa Hills 7.5 minute 
quadrangle, 1953, photorevised 1980); then southeasterly, south, and 
southwesterly along this elevation contour (continues onto USGS Morgan 
Hill 7.5 minute quadrangle, 1955, photorevised 1980, and back) to its 
intersection with Bailey Avenue. The south, southwest, and western 
border of the unit then continues from this point, along a line running 
west-southwesterly (bearing 248 degrees) for a distance of about 325 m

the 1980 photorevised Santa Teresa Hills quadrangle at an elevation of 
about 152 m (500 ft); then north-northwesterly along this land grant 
line to the intersection with Fortini Road; then generally west-
southwest and west along Fortini Road to the intersection with San 
Vicente Avenue (these road names do not appear on the Santa Teresa 
quadrangle); then westerly along San Vicente Avenue to where it turns 
south south-west; then continuing westerly and northwesterly from this 
point along a land grant boundary shown on the Santa Teresa Hills 
quadrangle to its intersection with both Henwood Drive (road name does 
not appear on the Santa Teresa quadrangle) and an unnamed intermittent 
drainage (tributary to Arroyo Calero); then northeasterly and northerly 
up this drainage as marked on the Santa Teresa Hills quadrangle to the 
183 m (600 ft) elevation contour; then due north-northeast for a 
distance of about 424 m (1,390 ft) to the first intersection with the 
280 m (920 ft) elevation contour; then west-northwest for a distance of 
about 265 m (870 ft) to a hilltop over 280 m (920 ft) in elevation, then 
slightly north of west (bearing 276 degrees) for a distance of about 543 
m (1,780 ft) to the end of a dirt road as marked on the 1980 
photorevised Santa Teresa Hills quadrangle; then slightly south of west-
northwest (bearing 290 degrees) for a distance of about 2,551 m (8,370 
ft) to a hilltop marked 173 m (568 ft) in elevation on the Santa Teresa 
Hills quadrangle; then due northeast to the 73 m (240 ft) elevation 
contour as shown on the Santa Teresa Hills quadrangle. The northern 
boundary of the unit is formed by the 73 m (240 ft) elevation contour as 
shown on the Santa Teresa Hills quadrangle.
    Unit 15 (Tulare Hill Corridor Unit): Santa Clara County, California. 
Bounded on the northeast by the most northeasterly edge of pavement of 
Highway 101 (i.e., the highway itself is included, and the unit abuts 
the Kirby and Metcalf units). Bounded on the northwest, west, and 
southwest by a line extending due southwest from the northeast boundary 
to the corner of Cheltenham Way and Coburn Court, then southwesterly 
along Cheltenham Way from Coburn Court to the intersection with Santa 
Teresa Boulevard, then southeasterly along Santa Teresa Boulevard to the 
73 m (240 ft) elevation contour as shown on the USGS Santa Teresa Hills 
7.5 minute quadrangle (1953, photorevised 1980), then southwesterly 
along this contour to the border of Santa Teresa County Park, then along 
a line due southeast to the southeast border of the unit. Bounded on the 
southeast by a line running due northeast-southwest through the 
southeastern-most point of the 85 m (280 ft) contour of Tulare Hill, as 
shown on the Morgan Hill quadrangle.

         Oregon Silverspot Butterfly (Speyeria zerene hippolyta)

    Oregon. Lane County T. 16 S., R. 12 W. Those portions of section 15 
and of the south half of section 10 which are west of a line parallel 
to, and 1500 feet west of, the eastern section boundaries of sections 10 
and 15.
    Note: Map follows:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN91.150
    
    Constituent biological elements essential to the continued existence 
of the Oregon silverspot butterfly within the Critical Habitat include 
the larval foodplant (Viola adunca), grasses and forbs in which the 
larvae find shelter, the composite plants from which the adults obtain 
nectar, and the spruce woods in which the adults find shelter.

  Palos Verdes Blue Butterfly (Glaucopsyche lygdamus palosverdesensis)

    California. Los Angeles County.
    1. Agua Amarga Canyon Zone. Palos Verdes Estates. A square area of 
land 0.4x0.4 kilometers located at the southeast corner of the 
southernmost corporate boundary of Palos Verdes Estates.
    2. Frank Hesse Park Zone. Rancho Palos Verdes. An area enclosed by 
Hawthorne Boulevard, Locklenna Lane, and Verde Drive.
    Note: Map follows:

    Within these Critical Habitat areas, the known biological 
constituent elements essential to the conservation of this species are 
colonies of the larval foodplant, Astragalus trichopodus leucopsis.

         Quino Checkerspot Butterfly (Euphydryas editha quino).

    (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Riverside and San Diego 
Counties, California, on the maps below.

[[Page 1009]]

    (2) Primary constituent elements occur in undeveloped areas that 
support various types of open-canopy woody and herbaceous plant 
communities. They include, but are not limited to, plant communities 
that provide populations of host plant and nectar sources for the Quino 
checkerspot butterfly. The primary constituent elements for the Quino 
checkerspot butterfly consist of:
    (i) Grassland and open-canopy woody plant communities, such as 
coastal sage scrub, open red shank chaparral, and open juniper woodland, 
with host plants or nectar plants;
    (ii) Undeveloped areas containing grassland or open-canopy woody 
plant communities, within and between habitat patches, utilized for 
Quino checkerspot butterfly mating, basking, and movement; or
    (iii) Prominent topographic features, such as hills and/or ridges, 
with an open woody or herbaceous canopy at the top. Prominence should be 
determined relative to other local topographic features.
    (3) Critical habitat does not include non-Federal lands covered by a 
legally operative incidental take permit for which the Quino checkerspot 
butterfly is a covered species and has take authorization, issued under 
section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act on or before April 15, 2002.
    (4) Existing features and structures within the boundaries of mapped 
critical habitat units, such as buildings, paved or improved roads, 
aqueducts, railroads, airports, other paved areas, lawns, large areas of 
closed canopy woody vegetation such as chaparral and cypress, active 
agricultural fields, and other urban landscaped areas are not and do not 
contain constituent elements. Federal actions limited to those areas, 
therefore, would not trigger a section 7 consultation, unless they 
affect the species and/or primary constituent elements in adjacent 
critical habitat.

    2. Within this area, the primary constituent elements for the 
Zayante band-winged grasshopper are those physical and biological 
elements that provide conditions that are essential for the primary 
biological needs of thermoregulation, foraging, sheltering, 
reproduction, and dispersal. The primary constituent elements are--(a) 
the presence of Zayante soils, (b) the occurrence of

[[Page 1028]]

Zayante sand hills habitat and the associated plant species, and (c) 
certain microhabitat conditions, including areas that receive large 
amounts of sunlight, widely scattered tree and shrub cover, bare or

    Santa Cruz County, California. Boundaries are based upon the Public 
Land Survey System. Within the historical boundaries of the Land Grants 
of Zayanta, San Augustin, La Carbonera, and Canada Del Rincon En El Rio 
San Lorenzo De Santa Cruz, boundaries are based upon section lines that 
are extensions to the Public Land Survey System developed by the 
California Department of Forestry and obtained by the Service from the 
State of California's Stephen P. Teale Data Center. Township and Range 
numbering is derived from the Mount Diablo Base and Meridian. The 
following lands located within Santa Cruz County are being proposed for 
critical habitat: T.9 S., R.1 W., SE\1/4\ sec. 31; T.9 S., R.2 W., SE\1/
4\ sec. 33, E\1/2\ sec. 34, SW\1/4\ sec. 35, S\1/2\ sec. 3; T.10 S., R1

              Blackburn's Sphinx Moth (Manduca blackburni)

    (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for the Hawaiian islands of 
Maui, Kahoolawe, Hawaii, and Molokai on the maps below.
    (2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for 
Blackburn's sphinx moth include specific habitat components identified 
as essential for the primary biological needs of foraging, sheltering, 
maturation, dispersal, breeding, and egg-laying.
    (i) Based on our current knowledge of the species, the primary 
constituent elements required by Blackburn's sphinx moth larvae for 
foraging and maturation are two larval host plant species in the endemic 
genus Nothocestrum (N. breviflorum and N. latifolium) and the habitats 
that support these plants, i.e., dry and mesic habitats between the 
elevations of sea level and 1,525 m (5,000 ft) that receive between 25 
and 250 cm (10 and 100 in) of annual precipitation.
    (ii) Based on our current knowledge of the species, the primary 
constituent elements required by Blackburn's sphinx moth adults for 
foraging, sheltering, dispersal, breeding, and egg production are native 
nectar-supplying plants, including, but not limited to, Ipomoea spp., 
Capparis sandwichiana, and Plumbago zeylanica, and the habitats that 
support these plants, i.e., dry and mesic habitats between the 
elevations of sea level and 1,525 m (5,000 ft) that receive between 25 
and 250 cm (10 and 100 in) of annual precipitation.
    (3) Existing manmade features and structures within the boundaries 
of the mapped areas do not contain one or more of the primary 
constituent elements described for the species in paragraph (2) of this 
section, and therefore, are not included in the critical habitat 
designations. These features include, but are not limited to: buildings; 
roads; aqueducts and other water system features such as pumping 
stations, irrigation ditches, pipelines, siphons, tunnels, water tanks, 
gauging stations (section in a stream channel equipped with facilities 
for obtaining streamflow data), intakes, and wells; telecommunications 
towers and associated structures and equipment; electrical power 
transmission lines and associated rights-of-way; radars; telemetry 
antennas; missile launch sites; arboreta and gardens; heiau (indigenous 
places of worship or shrines); airports; other paved areas; lawns; and 
other rural residential landscaped areas.
    (4) Critical habitat units are described below. Coordinates are in 
UTM Zone 4 with units in meters using North American Datum of 1983 
(NAD83). The following index map shows the general locations of the 9 
critical habitat units designated on the islands of Hawaii, Kahoolawe, 
Maui, and Molokai.
