                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 2007), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of textual material 
appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

<R05>
Sec.  17.1  Purpose of regulations.

    (a) The regulations in this part implement the Endangered Species 
Act of 1973, 87 Stat. 884, 16 U.S.C. 1531-1543, except for those 
provisions in the Act concerning the Convention on International Trade 
in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, for which regulations are 
provided in part 23 of this subchapter.
    (b) The regulations identify those species of wildlife and plants 
determined by the Director to be endangered or threatened with 
extinction under section 4(a) of the Act and also carry over the species 
and subspecies of wildlife designated as endangered under the Endangered 
Species Conservation Act of 1969 (83 Stat. 275, 16 U.S.C. 668cc-1 to

[[Page 6]]

6) which are deemed endangered species under section 4(c)(3) of the Act.

[40 FR 44415, Sept. 26, 1975, as amended at 42 FR 10465, Feb. 22, 1977]


<R05>
Sec.  17.2  Scope of regulations.

    (a) The regulations of this part apply only to endangered and 
threatened wildlife and plants.
    (b) By agreement between the Service and the National Marine 
Fisheries Service, the jurisdiction of the Department of Commerce has 
been specifically defined to include certain species, while jurisdiction 
is shared in regard to certain other species. Such species are footnoted 
in subpart B of this part, and reference is given to special rules of 
the National Marine Fisheries Service for those species.
    (c) The provisions in this part are in addition to, and are not in 
lieu of, other regulations of this subchapter B which may require a 
permit or prescribe additional restrictions or conditions for the 
importation, exportation, and interstate transportation of wildlife.
    (d) The examples used in this part are provided solely for the 
convenience of the public, and to explain the intent and meaning of the 
regulation to which they refer. They have no legal significance.
    (e) Certain of the wildlife and plants listed in Sec. Sec.  17.11 
and 17.12 as endangered or threatened are included in Appendix I, II or 
III to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of 
Wild Fauna and Flora. The importation, exportation and reexportation of 
such species are subject to additional regulations provided in part 23 
of this subchapter.

[40 FR 44415, Sept. 26, 1975, as amended at 42 FR 10465, Feb. 22, 1977]


<R05>
Sec.  17.3  Definitions.

    In addition to the definitions contained in part 10 of this 
subchapter, and unless the context otherwise requires, in this part 17:
    Act means the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543; 
87 Stat. 884);
    Adequately covered means, with respect to species listed pursuant to 
section 4 of the ESA, that a proposed conservation plan has satisfied 
the permit issuance criteria under section 10(a)(2)(B) of the ESA for 
the species covered by the plan, and, with respect to unlisted species, 
that a proposed conservation plan has satisfied the permit issuance 
criteria under section 10(a)(2)(B) of the ESA that would otherwise apply 
if the unlisted species covered by the plan were actually listed. For 
the Services to cover a species under a conservation plan, it must be 
listed on the section 10(a)(1)(B) permit.
    Alaskan Native means a person defined in the Alaska Native Claims 
Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1603(b) (85 Stat. 588)) as a citizen of the 
United States who is of one-fourth degree or more Alaska Indian 
(including Tsimshian Indians enrolled or not enrolled in the Metlaktla 
Indian Community), Eskimo, or Aleut blood, or combination thereof. The 
term includes any Native, as so defined, either or both of whose 
adoptive parents are not Natives. It also includes, in the absence of 
proof of a minimum blood quantum, any citizen of the United States who 
is regarded as an Alaska Native by the Native village or town of which 
he claims to be a member and whose father or mother is (or, if deceased, 
was) regarded as Native by any Native village or Native town. Any 
citizen enrolled by the Secretary pursuant to section 5 of the Alaska 
Native Claims Settlement Act shall be conclusively presumed to be an 
Alaskan Native for purposes of this part;
    Authentic native articles of handicrafts and clothing means items 
made by an Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo that are composed wholly or in some 
significant respect of natural materials and are significantly altered 
from their natural form and are produced, decorated, or fashioned in the 
exercise of traditional native handicrafts without the use of 
pantographs, multiple carvers, or similar mass-copying devices. Improved 
methods of production utilizing modern implements such as sewing 
machines or modern techniques at a tannery registered pursuant to Sec.  
18.23(c) of this subchapter (in the case of marine mammals) may be used 
as long as no large-scale mass production industry results. Traditional 
native handicrafts

[[Page 7]]

include, but are not limited to, weaving, carving, stitching, sewing, 
lacing, beading, drawing, and painting. The formation of traditional 
native groups, such as cooperatives, is permitted as long as no large-
scale mass production results;
    Bred in captivity or captive-bred refers to wildlife, including 
eggs, born or otherwise produced in captivity from parents that mated or 
otherwise transferred gametes in captivity, if reproduction is sexual, 
or from parents that were in captivity when development of the progeny 
began, if development is asexual.
    Captivity means that living wildlife is held in a controlled 
environment that is intensively manipulated by man for the purpose of 
producing wildlife of the selected species, and that has boundaries 
designed to prevent animal, eggs or gametes of the selected species from 
entering or leaving the controlled environment. General characteristics 
of captivity may include but are not limited to artificial housing, 
waste removal, health care, protection from predators, and artificially 
supplied food.
    Changed circumstances means changes in circumstances affecting a 
species or geographic area covered by a conservation plan or agreement 
that can reasonably be anticipated by plan or agreement developers and 
the Service and that can be planned for (e.g., the listing of new 
species, or a fire or other natural catastrophic event in areas prone to 
such events).
    Conservation plan means the plan required by section 10(a)(2)(A) of 
the ESA that an applicant must submit when applying for an incidental 
take permit. Conservation plans also are known as ``habitat conservation 
plans'' or ``HCPs.''
    Conserved habitat areas means areas explicitly designated for 
habitat restoration, acquisition, protection, or other conservation 
purposes under a conservation plan.
    Convention means the Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, TIAS 8249.
    Enhance the propagation or survival, when used in reference to 
wildlife in captivity, includes but is not limited to the following 
activities when it can be shown that such activities would not be 
detrimental to the survival of wild or captive populations of the 
affected species:
    (a) Provision of health care, management of populations by culling, 
contraception, euthanasia, grouping or handling of wildlife to control 
survivorship and reproduction, and similar normal practices of animal 
husbandry needed to maintain captive populations that are self-
sustaining and that possess as much genetic vitality as possible;
    (b) Accumulation and holding of living wildlife that is not 
immediately needed or suitable for propagative or scientific purposes, 
and the transfer of such wildlife between persons in order to relieve 
crowding or other problems hindering the propagation or survival of the 
captive population at the location from which the wildlife would be 
removed; and
    (c) Exhibition of living wildlife in a manner designed to educate

    Endangered means a species of wildlife listed in Sec.  17.11 or a 
species of plant listed in Sec.  17.12 and designated as endangered.
    Harass in the definition of ``take'' in the Act means an intentional 
or negligent act or omission which creates the likelihood of injury to 
wildlife by annoying it to such an extent as to significantly disrupt 
normal behavioral patterns which include, but are not limited to,

captive wildlife, does not include generally accepted:
    (1) Animal husbandry practices that meet or exceed the minimum 
standards for facilities and care under the Animal Welfare Act,
    (2) Breeding procedures, or
    (3) Provisions of veterinary care for confining, tranquilizing, or 
anesthetizing, when such practices, procedures, or provisions are not 
likely to result in injury to the wildlife.
    Harm in the definition of ``take'' in the Act means an act which 
actually kills or injures wildlife. Such act may include significant 
habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures 
wildlife by significantly

[[Page 8]]

impairing essential behavioral patterns, including breeding, feeding or 
sheltering.

circumstances.
    Population means a group of fish or wildlife in the same taxon below 
the subspecific level, in common spatial arrangement that interbreed 
when mature;
    Properly implemented conservation plan means any conservation plan, 
Implementing Agreement and permit whose commitments and provisions have 
been or are being fully implemented by the permittee.
    Property owner with respect to agreements outlined under Sec. Sec.  
17.22(c), 17.22(d), 17.32(c), and 17.32(d) means a person with a fee 
simple, leasehold, or other property interest (including owners of water 
or other natural resources), or any other entity that may have a 
property interest, sufficient to carry out the proposed management 
activities, subject to applicable State law, on non-Federal land.
    Specimen means any animal or plant, or any part, product, egg, seed 
or root of any animal or plant;
    Subsistence means the use of endangered or threatened wildlife for 
food, clothing, shelter, heating, transportation and other uses 
necessary to maintain the life of the taker of the wildlife, or those 
who depend upon the taker to provide them with such subsistence, and 
includes selling any edible portions of such wildlife in native villages 
and towns in Alaska for native consumption within native villages and

that could not reasonably have been anticipated by plan or agreement 
developers and the Service at the time of the conservation plan's or 
agreement's negotiation and development, and that result in a 
substantial and adverse change in the status of the covered species.
    Wasteful manner means any taking or method of taking which is likely 
to result in the killing or injury of endangered or threatened wildlife 
beyond those needed for subsistence purposes, or which results in the 
waste of a substantial portion of the wildlife, and includes without 
limitation the employment of a method of taking which is not likely to 
assure the capture or killing of the wildlife, or which is not 
immediately followed by a reasonable effort to retrieve the wildlife.

Sec.  17.4  Pre-Act wildlife.

    (a) The prohibitions defined in subparts C and D of this part 17 
shall not apply to any activity involving endangered or threatened 
wildlife which was held in captivity or in a controlled environment on 
December 28, 1973: Provided,
    (1) That the purposes of such holding were not contrary to the 
purposes of the Act; and
    (2) That the wildlife was not held in the course of a commercial 
activity.

    Example 1. On January 25, 1974, a tourist buys a stuffed hawksbill 
turtle (an endangered species listed since June, 1970), in a foreign 
country. On December 28, 1973, the stuffed turtle had been on display 
for sale.

[[Page 9]]

The tourist imports the stuffed turtle into the United States on January 
26, 1974. This is a violation of the Act since the stuffed turtle was 
held for commercial purposes on December 28, 1973.
    Example 2. On December 27, 1973 (or earlier), a tourist buys a 
leopard skin coat (the leopard has been listed as endangered since March 
1972) for his wife in a foreign country. On January 5, he imports it 
into the United States. He has not committed a violation since on 
December 28, 1973, he was the owner of the coat, for personal purposes, 
and the chain of commerce had ended with the sale on the 27th. Even if 
he did not finish paying for the coat for another year, as long as he 
had possession of it, and he was not going to resell it, but was using 
it for personal purposes, the Act does not apply to that coat.
    Example 3. On or before December 28, 1973, a hunter kills a leopard 
legally in Africa. He has the leopard mounted and imports it into the 
United States in March 1974. The importation is not subject to the Act. 
The hunter has not engaged in a commercial activity, even though he 
bought the services of a guide, outfitters, and a taxidermist to help 
him take, preserve, and import the leopard. This applies even if the 
trophy was in the possession of the taxidermist on December 28, 1973.
    Example 4. On January 15, 1974, a hunter kills a leopard legally in 
Africa. He has the leopard mounted and imports it into the United States 
in June 1974. This importation is a violation of the Act since the 
leopard was not in captivity or a controlled environment on December 28, 
1973.

    (b) Service officers or Customs officers may refuse to clear 
endangered or threatened wildlife for importation into or exportation 
from the United States, pursuant to Sec.  14.53 of this subchapter, 
until the importer or exporter can demonstrate that the exemption 
referred to in this section applies. Exempt status may be established by 
any sufficient evidence, including an affidavit containing the 
following:
    (1) The affiant's name and address;
    (2) Identification of the affiant;
    (3) Identification of the endangered or threatened wildlife which is 
the subject of the affidavit;
    (4) A statement by the affiant that to the best of his knowledge and 
belief, the endangered or threatened wildlife which is the subject of 
the affidavit was in captivity or in a controlled environment on 
December 28, 1973, and was not being held for purposes contrary to the 
Act or in the course of a commercial activity;
    (5) A statement by the affiant in the following language:

    The foregoing is principally based on the attached exhibits which, 
to the best of my knowledge and belief, are complete, true and correct. 
I understand that this affidavit is being submitted for the purpose of 
inducing the Federal Government to recognize an exempt status regarding 
(insert description of wildlife), under the Endangered Species Act of 
1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543), and regulations promulgated thereunder, and 
that any false statements may subject me to the criminal penalties of 18 
U.S.C. 1001.

    (6) As an attachment, records or other available evidence to show:
    (i) That the wildlife in question was being held in captivity or in 
a controlled environment on December 28, 1973;
    (ii) The purpose for which the wildlife was being held; and
    (iii) The nature of such holding (to establish that no commercial 
activity was involved).
    (c) This section applies only to wildlife born on or prior to 
December 28, 1973. It does not apply to the progeny of any such wildlife 
born after December 28, 1973.


<R05>
Sec.  17.5  Alaska natives.

    (a) The provisions of subpart C of this part relating to the 
importation or the taking of endangered wildlife, and any provision of 
subpart D of this part relating to the importation or the taking of 
threatened wildlife, shall not apply to:
    (1) Any Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo who is an Alaskan native and who 
resides in Alaska; or
    (2) Any non-native permanent resident of an Alaskan native village 
who is primarily dependent upon the taking of wildlife for consumption 
or for the creation and sale of authentic native articles of handicrafts 
and clothing:

If the taking is primarily for subsistence purposes, and is not 
accomplished in a wasteful manner.
    (b) Edible portions of endangered or threatened wildlife taken or 
imported pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section may be sold in native 
villages or towns in Alaska for native consumption within native 
villages and towns in Alaska.

[[Page 10]]

    (c) Non-edible by-products of endangered or threatened wildlife 
taken or imported pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section may be sold 
in interstate commerce when made into authentic native articles of 
handicrafts and clothing.

Sec.  17.6  State cooperative agreements. [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec.  17.7  Raptor exemption.

    (a) The prohibitions found in Sec. Sec.  17.21 and 17.31 do not 
apply to any raptor [a live migratory bird of the Order Falconiformes or 
the Order Strigiformes, other than a bald eagle (Haliaeetus 
leucocephalus) or a golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos)] legally held in 
captivity or in a controlled environment on November 10, 1978, or to any 
of its progeny, which is:
    (1) Possessed and banded in compliance with the terms of a valid 
permit issued under part 21 of this chapter; and
    (2) Identified in the earliest applicable annual report required to 
be filed by a permittee under part 21 of this chapter as in a 
permittee's possession on November 10, 1978, or as the progeny of such a 
raptor.
    (b) This section does not apply to any raptor intentionally returned 
to the wild.

Sec.  17.8  Import exemption for threatened, CITES Appendix-II wildlife.

    (a) Except as provided in a special rule in Sec. Sec.  17.40 through 
17.48 or in paragraph (b) of this section, all provisions of Sec. Sec.  
17.31 and 17.32 apply to any specimen of a threatened species of 
wildlife that is listed in Appendix II of the Convention.
    (b) Import. Except as provided in a special rule in Sec. Sec.  17.40 
through 17.48, any live or dead specimen of a fish and wildlife species 
listed as threatened under this part may be imported without a 
threatened species permit under Sec.  17.32 provided all of the 
following conditions are met:
    (1) The specimen was not acquired in foreign commerce or imported in 
the course of a commercial activity;
    (2) The species is listed in Appendix II of the Convention.
    (3) The specimen is imported and subsequently used in accordance 
with the requirements of part 23 of this subchapter, except as provided 
in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (4) Personal and household effects (see Sec.  23.5) must be 
accompanied by a CITES document.
    (5) At the time of import, the importer must provide to the FWS 
documentation that shows the specimen was not acquired in foreign 
commerce in the course of a commercial activity.
    (6) All applicable requirements of part 14 of this subchapter are 
satisfied.

Sec.  17.9  Permit applications and information collection requirements.

    (a) Address permit applications for activities affecting species 
listed under the Endangered Species Act, as amended, as follows:
    (1) Address activities affecting endangered and threatened species 
that are native to the United States to the Regional Director for the 
Region in which the activity is to take place. You can find addresses 
for the Regional Directors in 50 CFR 2.2. Send applications for 
interstate commerce in native endangered and threatened species to the 
Regional Director with lead responsibility for the species. To determine 
the appropriate region, call the nearest Regional Office:

Region 1 (Portland, OR): 503-231-6241
Region 2 (Albuquerque, NM): 505-248-6920
Region 3 (Twin Cities, MN): 612-713-5343
Region 4 (Atlanta, GA): 404-679-7313

    (2) Submit permit applications for activities affecting native 
endangered and threatened species in international movement or commerce, 
and all activities affecting nonnative endangered and threatened species 
to the Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, (Attention Office of 
Management Authority), 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, Room 700, Arlington, VA 
22203.
    (b) The Office of Management and Budget approved the information 
collection requirements contained in this part 17 under 44 U.S.C. 3507 
and assigned OMB Control Numbers 1018-0093

[[Page 11]]

and 1018-0094. The Service may not conduct or sponsor, and you are not 
required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number. We are collecting this information 
to provide information necessary to evaluate permit applications. We 
will use this information to review permit applications and make 
decisions, according to criteria established in various Federal wildlife 
conservation statutes and regulations, on the issuance, suspension, 
revocation, or denial of permits. You must respond to obtain or retain a 
permit. We estimate the public reporting burden for these reporting 
requirements to vary from 2 to 2\1/2\ hours per response, including time 
for reviewing instructions, gathering and maintaining data, and 
completing and reviewing the forms. Direct comments regarding the burden 
estimate or any other aspect of these reporting requirements to the 
Service Information Collection Control Officer, MS-222 ARLSQ, U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service, Washington, DC 20240, or the Office of Management 
and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (1018-0093/0094), Washington, DC

                             Subpart B_Lists


<R05>
Sec.  17.11  Endangered and threatened wildlife.

    (a) The list in this section contains the names of all species of 
wildlife which have been determined by the Services to be Endangered or 
Threatened. It also contains the names of species of wildlife treated as 
Endangered or Threatened because they are sufficiently similar in 
appearance to Endangered or Threatened species (see Sec.  17.50 et 
seq.).
    (b) The columns entitled ``Common Name,'' ``Scientific Name,'' and 
``Vertebrate Population Where Endangered or Threatened'' define the 
species of wildlife within the meaning of the Act. Thus, differently 
classified geographic populations of the same vertebrate subspecies or 
species shall be identified by their differing geographic boundaries, 
even though the other two columns are identical. The term ``Entire'' 
means that all populations throughout the present range of a vertebrate 
species are listed. Although common names are included, they cannot be 
relied upon for identification of any specimen, since they may vary 
greatly in local usage. The Services shall use the most recently 
accepted scientific name. In cases in which confusion might arise, a 
synonym(s) will be provided in parentheses. The Services shall rely to 
the extent practicable on the International Code of Zoological 
Nomenclature.
    (c) In the ``Status'' column the following symbols are used: ``E'' 
for Endangered, ``T'' for Threatened, and ``E [or T] (S/A)'' for 
similarity of appearance species.
    (d) The other data in the list are nonregulatory in nature and are 
provided for the information of the reader. In the annual revision and 
compilation of this title, the following information may be amended 
without public notice: the spelling of species' names, historical range, 
footnotes, references to certain other applicable portions of this 
title, synonyms, and more current names. In any of these revised 
entries, neither the species, as defined in paragraph (b) of this 
section, nor its status may be changed without following the procedures 
of part 424 of this title.
    (e) The ``historic range'' indicates the known general distribution 
of the species or subspecies as reported in the current scientific 
literature. The present distribution may be greatly reduced from this 
historic range. This column does not imply any limitation on the 
application of the prohibitions in the Act or implementing rules. Such 
prohibitions apply to all individuals of the species, wherever found.
    (f)(1) A footnote to the Federal Register publication(s) listing or 
reclassifying a species is indicated under the column ``When listed.'' 
Footnote numbers to Sec. Sec.  17.11 and 17.12 are in the same numerical 
sequence, since plants and animals may be listed in the same Federal 
Register document. That document, at least since 1973, includes a 
statement indicating the basis for the listing, as well as the effective 
date(s) of said listing.

[[Page 12]]

    (2) The ``Special rules'' and ``Critical habitat'' columns provide a 
cross reference to other sections in parts 17, 222, 226, or 227. The 
``Special rules'' column will also be used to cite the special rules 
that describe experimental populations and determine if they are 
essential or nonessential. Separate listing will be made for 
experimental populations, and the status column will include the 
following symbols: ``XE'' for an essential experimental population and 
``XN'' for a nonessential experimental population. The term ``NA'' (not 
applicable) appearing in either of these two columns indicates that 
there are no special rules and/or critical habitat for that particular 
species. However, all other appropriate rules in parts 17, 217 through 
227, and 402 still apply to that species. In addition, there may be 
other rules in this title that relate to such wildlife, e.g., port-of-
entry requirements. It is not intended that the references in the 
``Special rules'' column list all the regulations of the two Services 
which might apply to the species or to the regulations of other Federal 
agencies or State or local governments.
    (g) The listing of a particular taxon includes all lower taxonomic 
units. For example, the genus Hylobates (gibbons) is listed as 
Endangered throughout its entire range (China, India, and SE Asia); 
consequently, all species, subspecies, and populations of that genus are 
considered listed as Endangered for the purposes of the Act. In 1978 (43 
FR 6230-6233) the species Haliaeetus leucocephalus (bald eagle) was 
listed as Threatened in ``USA (WA, OR, MN, WI, MI)'' rather than its 
entire population; thus, all individuals of the bald eagle found in 
those five States are considered listed as Threatened for the purposes 
of the Act.

<R05>
Sec.  17.12  Endangered and threatened plants.

    (a) The list in this section contains the names of all species of 
plants which have been determined by the Services to be Endangered or 
Threatened. It also contains the names of species of plants treated as 
Endangered or Threatened because they are sufficiently similar in 
appearance to Endangered or Threatened species (see Sec.  17.50 et 
seq.).
    (b) The columns entitled ``Scientific name'' and ``Common name'' 
define the species of plant within the meaning of the Act. Although 
common names are included, they cannot be relied upon for identification 
of any specimen, since they may vary greatly in local usage. The 
Services shall use the most recently accepted scientific name. In cases 
in which confusion might arise, a synonym(s) will be provided in 
parentheses. The Services shall rely to the extent practicable on the 
International Code of Botanical Nomenclature.
    (c) In the ``Status'' column the following symbols are used: ``E'' 
for Endangered, ``T'' for Threatened, and ``E [or T] (S/A)'' for 
similarity of appearance species.
    (d) The other data in the list are nonregulatory in nature and are 
provided for the information of the reader. In the annual revision and 
compilation of this title, the following information may be amended 
without public notice: the spelling of species' names, historical range, 
footnotes, references to certain other applicable portions of this 
title, synonyms, and more current names. In any of these revised 
entries, neither the species, as defined in paragraph (b) of this 
section, nor its status may be changed without following the procedures 
of part 424 of this title.
    (e) The ``Historic range'' indicates the known general distribution 
of the species or subspecies as reported in the

[[Page 67]]

current scientific literature. The present distribution may be greatly 
reduced from this historic range. This column does not imply any 
limitation on the application of the prohibitions in the Act or 
implementing rules. Such prohibitions apply to all individuals of the 
plant species, wherever found.
    (f)(1) A footnote to the Federal Register publication(s) listing or 
reclassifying a species is indicated under the column ``When listed.'' 
Footnote numbers to Sec. Sec.  17.11 and 17.12 are in the same numerical 
sequence, since plants and animals may be listed in the same Federal 
Register document. That document, at least since 1973, includes a 
statement indicating the basis for the listing, as well as the effective 
date(s) of said listing.
    (2) The ``Special rules'' and ``Critical habitat'' columns provide a 
cross reference to other sections in parts 17, 222, 226, or 227. The 
``Special rules'' column will also be used to cite the special rules 
which describe experimental populations and determine if they are 
essential or nonessential. Separate listings will be made for 
experimental populations, and the status column will include the 
following symbols: ``XE'' for an essential experimental population and 
``XN'' for a nonessential experimental population. The term ``NA'' (not 
applicable) appearing in either of these two columns indicates that 
there are no special rules and/or critical habitat for that particular 
species. However, all other appropriate rules in parts 17, 217 through 
227, and 402 still apply to that species. In addition, there may be 
other rules in this title that relate to such plants, e.g., port-of-
entry requirements. It is not intended that the references in the 
``Special rules'' column list all the regulations of the two Services 
which might apply to the species or to the regulations of other Federal 
agencies or State or local governments.
    (g) The listing of a particular taxon includes all lower taxonomic 
units (see Sec.  17.11(g) for examples).
    (h) The ``List of Endangered and Threatened Plants'' is provided 
below:

                      Subpart C_Endangered Wildlife


<R05>
Sec.  17.21  Prohibitions.

    (a) Except as provided in subpart A of this part, or under permits 
issued pursuant to Sec.  17.22 or Sec.  17.23, it is unlawful for any 
person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to commit, to 
attempt to commit, to solicit another to commit or to cause to be 
committed, any of the acts described in paragraphs (b) through (f) of 
this section in regard to any endangered wildlife.
    (b) Import or export. It is unlawful to import or to export any 
endangered wildlife. Any shipment in transit through the United States 
is an importation and an exportation, whether or not it has entered the 
country for customs purposes.
    (c) Take. (1) It is unlawful to take endangered wildlife within the 
United States, within the territorial sea of the United States, or upon 
the high seas. The high seas shall be all waters seaward of the 
territorial sea of the United States, except waters officially 
recognized by the United States as the territorial sea of another 
country, under international law.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, any person may 
take endangered wildlife in defense of his own life or the lives of 
others.
    (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, any employee 
or agent of the Service, any other Federal land management agency, the 
National Marine Fisheries Service, or a State conservation agency, who 
is designated by his agency for such purposes, may, when acting in the 
course of his official duties, take endangered wildlife without a permit 
if such action is necessary to:
    (i) Aid a sick, injured or orphaned specimen; or
    (ii) Dispose of a dead specimen; or
    (iii) Salvage a dead specimen which may be useful for scientific 
study; or
    (iv) Remove specimens which constitute a demonstrable but 
nonimmediate threat to human safety, provided that the taking is done in 
a humane manner; the taking may involve killing or injuring only if it 
has not been reasonably possible to eliminate such threat by live-
capturing and releasing the specimen unharmed, in a remote area.
    (4) Any taking under paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section must 
be reported in writing to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Office of 
Law Enforcement, 4401 North Fairfax Drive, LE-3000, Arlington, VA 22203, 
within five days. The specimen may only be retained, disposed of, or 
salvaged under directions from the Office of Law Enforcement.
    (5) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, any qualified 
employee or agent of a State Conservation Agency which is a party to a 
Cooperative Agreement with the Service in accordance with section 6(c) 
of the Act, who is designated by his agency for such purposes, may, when 
acting in the course of his official duties take those endangered 
species which are covered by an approved cooperative agreement for 
conservation programs in accordance with the Cooperative Agreement, 
provided that such taking is not reasonably anticipated to result in:
    (i) The death or permanent disabling of the specimen;
    (ii) The removal of the specimen from the State where the taking 
occurred;
    (iii) The introduction of the specimen so taken, or of any progeny 
derived from such a specimen, into an area beyond the historical range 
of the species; or
    (iv) The holding of the specimen in captivity for a period of more 
than 45 consecutive days.
    (6) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, any person 
acting under a valid migratory bird rehabilitation permit issued 
pursuant to Sec.  21.31 of this subchapter may take endangered migratory 
birds without an endangered species permit if such action is necessary 
to aid a sick, injured, or orphaned endangered migratory bird, provided 
the permittee:
    (i) Notifies the issuing Migratory Bird Permit Office immediately 
upon receipt of such bird (contact information for your issuing office 
is listed on your permit and on the Internet at http://offices.fws.gov); 
and

[[Page 93]]

    (ii) Disposes of or transfers such birds, or their parts or 
feathers, as directed by the Migratory Bird Permit Office.
    (7) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, persons exempt 
from the permit requirements of Sec.  21.12(c) and (d) of this 
subchapter may take sick and injured endangered migratory birds without 
an endangered species permit in performing the activities authorized 
under Sec.  21.12(c) and (d).
    (d) Possession and other acts with unlawfully taken wildlife. (1) It 
is unlawful to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship, by any 
means whatsoever, any endangered wildlife which was taken in violation 
of paragraph (c) of this section.

    Example. A person captures a whooping crane in Texas and gives it to 
a second person, who puts it in a closed van and drives thirty miles, to 
another location in Texas. The second person then gives the whooping 
crane to a third person, who is apprehended with the bird in his 
possession. All three have violated the law--the first by illegally 
taking the whooping crane; the second by transporting an illegally taken 
whooping crane; and the third by possessing an illegally taken whooping 
crane.

    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, Federal and 
State law enforcement officers may possess, deliver, carry, transport or 
ship any endangered wildlife taken in violation of the Act as necessary 
in performing their official duties.
    (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, any person 
acting under a valid migratory bird rehabilitation permit issued 
pursuant to Sec.  21.31 of this subchapter may possess and transport 
endangered migratory birds without an endangered species permit when 
such action is necessary to aid a sick, injured, or orphaned endangered 
migratory bird, provided the permittee:
    (i) Notifies the issuing Migratory Bird Permit Office immediately 
upon receipt of such bird (contact information for your issuing office 
is listed on your permit and on the Internet at http://offices.fws.gov); 
and
    (ii) Disposes of or transfers such birds, or their parts or 
feathers, as directed by the Migratory Bird Permit Office.
    (4) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, persons exempt 
from the permit requirements of Sec.  21.12(c) and (d) of this 
subchapter may possess and transport sick and injured endangered 
migratory bird species without an endangered species permit in 
performing the activities authorized under Sec.  21.12(c) and (d).
    (e) Interstate or foreign commerce. It is unlawful to deliver, 
receive, carry transport, or ship in interstate or foreign commerce, by 
any means whatsoever, and in the course of a commercial activity, any 
endangered wildlife.
    (f) Sale or offer for sale. (1) It is unlawful to sell or to offer 
for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any endangered wildlife.
    (2) An advertisement for the sale of endangered wildlife which 
carries a warning to the effect that no sale may be consummated until a 
permit has been obtained from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service shall 
not be considered an offer for sale within the meaning of this section.
    (g) Captive-bred wildlife. (1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b), (c), 
(e) and (f) of this section, any person may take; export or re-import; 
deliver, receive, carry, transport or ship in interstate or foreign 
commerce, in the course of a commercial activity; or sell or offer for 
sale in interstate or foreign commerce any endangered wildlife that is 
bred in captivity in the United States provided either that the wildlife 
is of a taxon listed in paragraph (g)(6) of this section, or that the 
following conditions are met:
    (i) The wildlife is of a species having a natural geographic 
distribution not including any part of the United States, or the 
wildlife is of a species that the Director has determined to be eligible 
in accordance with paragraph (g)(5) of this section;
    (ii) The purpose of such activity is to enhance the propagation or 
survival of the affected species;
    (iii) Such activity does not involve interstate or foreign commerce, 
in the course of a commercial activity, with respect to non-living 
wildlife;
    (iv) Each specimen of wildlife to be re-imported is uniquely 
identified by a band, tattoo or other means that was reported in writing 
to an official of the Service at a port of export prior to export from 
the United States; and

[[Page 94]]

    (v) Any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States who 
engages in any of the activities authorized by this paragraph does so in 
accordance with paragraphs (g) (2), (3) and (4) of this section, and 
with all other applicable regulations in this Subchapter B.
    (2) Any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States 
seeking to engage in any of the activities authorized by this paragraph 
must first register with the Service (Office of Management Authority, 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, 
Virginia 22203). Requests for registration must be submitted on an 
official application form (Form 3-200-41) provided by the Service, and 
must include the following information:
    (i) The types of wildlife sought to be covered by the registration, 
identified by common and scientific name to the taxonomic level of 
family, genus or species;
    (ii) A description of the applicant's experience in maintaining and 
propagating the types of wildlife sought to be covered by the 
registration, and when appropriate, in conducting research directly 
related to maintaining and propagating such wildlife;
    (iii) Photograph(s) or other evidence clearly depicting the 
facilities where such wildlife will be maintained; and
    (iv) a copy of the applicant's license or registration, if any, 
under the animal welfare regulations of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture (9 CFR part 2).
    (3) Upon receiving a complete application, the Director will decide 
whether or not the registration will be approved. In making this 
decision, the Director will consider, in addition to the general 
criteria in Sec.  13.21(b) of this subchapter, whether the expertise, 
facilities or other resources available to the applicant appear adequate 
to enhance the propagation or survival of the affected wildlife. Public 
education activities may not be the sole basis to justify issuance of a 
registration or to otherwise establish eligibility for the exception 
granted in paragraph (g)(1) of this section. Each person so registered 
must maintain accurate written records of activities conducted under the 
registration, and allow reasonable access to Service agents for 
inspection purposes as set forth in Sec. Sec.  13.46 and 13.47. Each 
person registered must submit to the Director an individual written 
annual report of activities, including all births, deaths and transfers 
of any type.
    (4) Any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States 
seeking to export or conduct foreign commerce in captive-bred endangered 
wildlife that will not remain under the care of that person must first 
obtain approval by providing written evidence to satisfy the Director 
that the proposed recipient of the wildlife has expertise, facilities or 
other resources adequate to enhance the propagation or survival of such 
wildlife and that the proposed recipient will use such wildlife for 
purposes of enhancing the propagation or survival of the affected 
species.
    (5)(i) The Director will use the following criteria to determine if 
wildlife of any species having a natural geographic distribution that 
includes any part of the United States is eligible for the provisions of 
this paragraph:
    (A) Whether there is a low demand for taking of the species from 
wild populations, either because of the success of captive breeding or 
because of other reasons, and
    (B) Whether the wild populations of the species are effectively 
protected from unauthorized taking as a result of the inaccessibility of 
their habitat to humans or as a result of the effectiveness of law 
enforcement.
    (ii) The Director will follow the procedures set forth in the Act 
and in the regulations thereunder with respect to petitions and 
notification of the public and governors of affected States when 
determining the eligibility of species for purposes of this paragraph.
    (iii) In accordance with the criteria in paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this 
section, the Director has determined the following species to be 
eligible for the provisions of this paragraph:

Laysan duck (Anas laysanensis).

    (6) Any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States 
seeking to engage in any of the activities authorized by paragraph 
(g)(1) of this section may do so without first registering with the 
Service with respect to the bar-tailed pheasant (Syrmaticus humiae), 
Elliot's

[[Page 95]]

parakeets of the species Neophema pulchella and N. splendida; the Laysan 
duck (Anas laysanensis); the white-winged wood duck (Cairina scutulata); 
and the inter-subspecific crossed or ``generic'' tiger (Panthera tigris) 
(i e., specimens not identified or identifiable as members of the 
Bengal, Sumatran, Siberian or Indochinese subspecies (Panthera tigris 
tigris, P.t. sumatrae, P.t. altaica and P.t. corbetti, respectively) 
provided:
    (i) The purpose of such activity is to enhance the propagation or 
survival of the affected exempted species;
    (ii) Such activity does not involve interstate or foreign commerce, 
in the course of a commercial activity, with respect to non-living 
wildlife;
    (iii) Each specimen to be re-imported is uniquely identified by a 
band, tattoo or other means that was reported in writing to an official 
of the Service at a port of export prior to export of the specimen from 
the United States;
    (iv) No specimens of the taxa in this paragraph (g)(6) of this 
section that were taken from the wild may be imported for breeding 
purposes absent a definitive showing that the need for new bloodlines 
can only be met by wild specimens, that suitable foreign-bred, captive 
individuals are unavailable, and that wild populations can sustain 
limited taking, and an import permit is issued under Sec.  17.22;
    (v) Any permanent exports of such specimens meet the requirements of 
paragraph (g)(4) of this section; and
    (vi) Each person claiming the benefit of the exception in paragraph 
(g)(1) of this section must maintain accurate written records of 
activities, including births, deaths and transfers of specimens, and 
make those records accessible to Service agents for inspection at 
reasonable hours as set forth in Sec. Sec.  13.46 and 13.47.
    (h) U.S. captive-bred scimitar-horned oryx, addax, and dama gazelle. 
Notwithstanding paragraphs (b), (c), (e), and (f) of this section, any 
person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States may take; export 
or re-import; deliver, receive, carry, transport or ship in interstate 
or foreign commerce, in the course of a commercial activity; or sell or 
offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce live wildlife, 
including embryos and gametes, and sport-hunted trophies of scimitar-
horned oryx (Oryx dammah), addax (Addax nasomaculatus), and dama gazelle 
(Gazella dama) provided:
    (1) The purpose of such activity is associated with the management 
or transfer of live wildlife, including embryos and gametes, or sport 
hunting in a manner that contributes to increasing or sustaining captive 
numbers or to potential reintroduction to range countries;
    (2) The specimen was captive-bred, in accordance with Sec.  17.3, 
within the United States;
    (3) All live specimens of that species held by the captive-breeding 
operation are managed in a manner that prevents hybridization of the 
species or subspecies.
    (4) All live specimens of that species held by the captive-breeding 
operation are managed in a manner that maintains genetic diversity.
    (5) Any export of or foreign commerce in a specimen meets the 
requirements of paragraph (g)(4) of this section, as well as parts 13, 
14, and 23 of this chapter;
    (6) Each specimen to be re-imported is uniquely identified by a 
tattoo or other means that is reported on the documentation required 
under paragraph (h)(5) of this section; and
    (7) Each person claiming the benefit of the exception of this 
paragraph (h) must maintain accurate written records of activities, 
including births, deaths, and transfers of specimens, and make those 
records accessible to Service officials for inspection at reasonable 
hours set forth in Sec. Sec.  13.46 and 13.47 of this chapter.
    (8) The sport-hunted trophy consists of raw or tanned parts, such as 
bones, hair, head, hide, hooves, horns, meat, skull, rug, taxidermied 
head, shoulder, or full body mount, of a specimen that was taken by the

Sec.  17.22  Permits for scientific purposes, enhancement of propagation or 

survival, or for incidental taking.

    Upon receipt of a complete application, the Director may issue a 
permit authorizing any activity otherwise prohibited by Sec.  17.21, in 
accordance with the issuance criteria of this section, for scientific 
purposes, for enhancing the propagation or survival, or for the 
incidental taking of endangered wildlife. Such permits may authorize a 
single transaction, a series of transactions, or a number of activities 
over a specific period of time. (See Sec.  17.32 for permits for 
threatened species.) The Director shall publish notice in the Federal 
Register of each application for a permit that is made under this 
section. Each notice shall invite the submission from interested 
parties, within 30 days after the date of the notice, of written data, 
views, or arguments with respect to the application. The 30-day period 
may be waived by the Director in an emergency situation where the life 
or health of an endangered animal is threatened and no reasonable 
alternative is available to the applicant. Notice of any such waiver 
shall be published in the Federal Register within 10 days following 
issuance of the permit.
    (a)(1) Application requirements for permits for scientific purposes 
or for the enhancement of propagation or survival. A person wishing to 
get a permit for an activity prohibited by Sec.  17.21 submits an 
application for activities under this paragraph. The Service provides 
Form 3-200 for the application to which all of the following must be 
attained:
    (i) The common and scientific names of the species sought to the 
covered by the permit, as well as the number, age, and sex of such 
species, and the activity sought to be authorized (such as taking, 
exporting, selling in interstate commerce);
    (ii) A statement as to whether, at the time of application, the 
wildlife sought to be covered by the permit (A) is still in the wild, 
(B) has already been removed from the wild, or (C) was born in 
captivity;
    (iii) A resume of the applicant's attempts to obtain the wildlife 
sought to be covered by the permit in a manner which would not cause the 
death or removal from the wild of such wildlife;
    (iv) If the wildlife sought to be covered by the permit has already 
been removed from the wild, the country and place where such removal 
occurred; if the wildlife sought to be covered by the permit was born in 
captivity, the country and place where such wildlife was born;
    (v) A complete description and address of the institution or other 
facility where the wildlife sought to be covered by the permit will be 
used, displayed, or maintained;
    (vi) If the applicant seeks to have live wildlife covered by the 
permit, a complete description, including photographs or diagrams, of 
the facilities to house and/or care for the wildlife and a resume of the 
experience of those person who will be caring for the wildlife;
    (vii) A full statement of the reasons why the applicant is justified 
in obtaining a permit including the details of the activities sought to 
be authorized by the permit;
    (viii) If the application is for the purpose of enhancement of 
propagation, a statement of the applicant's willingness to participate 
in a cooperative breeding program and to maintain or contribute data to 
a studbook;
    (2) Issuance criteria. Upon receiving an application completed in 
accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Director will 
decide whether or not a permit should be issued. In making this 
decision, the Director shall consider, in addition to the general 
criteria in Sec.  13.21(b) of this subchapter, the following factors:

[[Page 97]]

    (i) Whether the purpose for which the permit is required is adequate 
to justify removing from the wild or otherwise changing the status of 
the wildlife sought to be covered by the permit;
    (ii) The probable direct and indirect effect which issuing the 
permit would have on the wild populations of the wildlife sought to be 
covered by the permit;
    (iii) Whether the permit, if issued, would in any way, directly or 
indirectly, conflict with any known program intended to enhance the 
survival probabilities of the population from which the wildlife sought 
to be covered by the permit was or would be removed;
    (iv) Whether the purpose for which the permit is required would be 
likely to reduce the threat of extinction facing the species of wildlife 
sought to be covered by the permit;
    (v) The opinions or views of scientists or other persons or 
organizations having expertise concerning the wildlife or other matters 
germane to the application; and
    (vi) Whether the expertise, facilities, or other resources available 
to the applicant appear adequate to successfully accomplish the 
objectives stated in the application.
    (3) Permit conditions. In addition to the general conditions set 
forth in part 13 of this subchapter, every permit issued under this 
paragraph shall be subject to the special condition that the escape of 
living wildlife covered by the permit shall be immediately reported to 
the Service office designated in the permit.
    (4) Duration of permits. The duration of permits issued under this 
paragraph shall be designated on the face of the permit.
    (b)(1) Application requirements for permits for incidental taking. A 
person wishing to get a permit for an activity prohibited by Sec.  
17.21(c) submits an application for activities under this paragraph. The 
Service provides Form 3-200 for the application to which all of the 
following must be attached:
    (i) A complete description of the activity sought to be authorized;
    (ii) The common and scientific names of the species sought to be 
covered by the permit, as well as the number, age, and sex of such 
species, if known;
    (iii) A conservation plan that specifies:
    (A) The impact that will likely result from such taking;
    (B) What steps the applicant will take to monitor, minimize, and 
mitigate such impacts, the funding that will be available to implement 
such steps, and the procedures to be used to deal with unforeseen 
circumstances;
    (C) What alternative actions to such taking the applicant considered 
and the reasons why such alternatives are not proposed to be utilized; 
and
    (D) Such other measures that the Director may require as being 
necessary or appropriate for purposes of the plan;
    (2) Issuance criteria. (i) Upon receiving an application completed 
in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Director will 
decide whether or not a permit should be issued. The Director shall 
consider the general issuance criteria in Sec.  13.21(b) of this 
subchapter, except for Sec.  13.21(b)(4), and shall issue the permit if 
he or she finds that:
    (A) The taking will be incidental;
    (B) The applicant will, to the maximum extent practicable, minimize 
and mitigate the impacts of such takings;
    (C) The applicant will ensure that adequate funding for the 
conservation plan and procedures to deal with unforeseen circumstances 
will be provided;
    (D) The taking will not appreciably reduce the likelihood of the 
survival and recovery of the species in the wild;
    (E) The measures, if any, required under paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(D) of 
this section will be met; and
    (F) He or she has received such other assurances as he or she may 
require that the plan will be implemented.
    (ii) In making his or her decision, the Director shall also consider 
the anticipated duration and geographic scope of the applicant's planned 
activities, including the amount of listed species habitat that is 
involved and the degree to which listed species and their habitats are 
affected.
    (3) Permit conditions. In addition to the general conditions set 
forth in part 13 of this subchapter, every permit issued under this 
paragraph shall contain such terms and conditions as the

[[Page 98]]

Director deems necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the 
permit and the conservation plan including, but not limited to, 
monitoring and reporting requirements deemed necessary for determining 
whether such terms and conditions are being complied with. The Director 
shall rely upon existing reporting requirements to the maximum extent 
practicable.
    (4) Duration of permits. The duration of permits issued under this 
paragraph shall be sufficient to provide adequate assurances to the 
permittee to commit funding necessary for the activities authorized by 
the permit, including conservation activities and land use restrictions. 
In determining the duration of a permit, the Director shall consider the 
duration of the planned activities, as well as the possible positive and 
negative effects associated with permits of the proposed duration on 
listed species, including the extent to which the conservation plan will 
enhance the habitat of listed species and increase the long-term 
survivability of such species.
    (5) Assurances provided to permittee in case of changed or 
unforeseen circumstances. The assurances in this paragraph (b)(5) apply 
only to incidental take permits issued in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section where the conservation plan is being properly 
implemented, and apply only with respect to species adequately covered 
by the conservation plan. These assurances cannot be provided to Federal 
agencies. This rule does not apply to incidental take permits issued 
prior to March 25, 1998. The assurances provided in incidental take 
permits issued prior to March 25, 1998 remain in effect, and those 
permits will not be revised as a result of this rulemaking.
    (i) Changed circumstances provided for in the plan. If additional 
conservation and mitigation measures are deemed necessary to respond to 
changed circumstances and were provided for in the plan's operating 
conservation program, the permittee will implement the measures 
specified in the plan.
    (ii) Changed circumstances not provided for in the plan. If 
additional conservation and mitigation measures are deemed necessary to 
respond to changed circumstances and such measures were not provided for 
in the plan's operating conservation program, the Director will not 
require any conservation and mitigation measures in addition to those 
provided for in the plan without the consent of the permittee, provided 
the plan is being properly implemented.
    (iii) Unforeseen circumstances. (A) In negotiating unforeseen 
circumstances, the Director will not require the commitment of 
additional land, water, or financial compensation or additional 
restrictions on the use of land, water, or other natural resources 
beyond the level otherwise agreed upon for the species covered by the 
conservation plan without the consent of the permittee.
    (B) If additional conservation and mitigation measures are deemed 
necessary to respond to unforeseen circumstances, the Director may 
require additional measures of the permittee where the conservation plan 
is being properly implemented, but only if such measures are limited to 
modifications within conserved habitat areas, if any, or to the 
conservation plan's operating conservation program for the affected 
species, and maintain the original terms of the conservation plan to the 
maximum extent possible. Additional conservation and mitigation measures 
will not involve the commitment of additional land, water or financial 
compensation or additional restrictions on the use of land, water, or 
other natural resources otherwise available for development or use under 
the original terms of the conservation plan without the consent of the 
permittee.
    (C) The Director will have the burden of demonstrating that 
unforeseen circumstances exist, using the best scientific and commercial 
data available. These findings must be clearly documented and based upon 
reliable technical information regarding the status and habitat 
requirements of the affected species. The Director will consider, but 
not be limited to, the following factors:
    (1) Size of the current range of the affected species;
    (2) Percentage of range adversely affected by the conservation plan;
    (3) Percentage of range conserved by the conservation plan;

[[Page 99]]

    (4) Ecological significance of that portion of the range affected by 
the conservation plan;
    (5) Level of knowledge about the affected species and the degree of 
specificity of the species' conservation program under the conservation 
plan; and
    (6) Whether failure to adopt additional conservation measures would 
appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery of the 
affected species in the wild.
    (6) Nothing in this rule will be construed to limit or constrain the 
Director, any Federal, State, local, or Tribal government agency, or a 
private entity, from taking additional actions at its own expense to 
protect or conserve a species included in a conservation plan.
    (7) Discontinuance of permit activity. Notwithstanding the 
provisions of Sec.  13.26 of this subchapter, a permittee under this 
paragraph (b) remains responsible for any outstanding minimization and 
mitigation measures required under the terms of the permit for take that 
occurs prior to surrender of the permit and such minimization and 
mitigation measures as may be required pursuant to the termination 
provisions of an implementing agreement, habitat conservation plan, or 
permit even after surrendering the permit to the Service pursuant to 
Sec.  13.26 of this subchapter. The permit shall be deemed canceled only 
upon a determination by the Service that such minimization and 
mitigation measures have been implemented. Upon surrender of the permit, 
no further take shall be authorized under the terms of the surrendered 
permit.
    (8) Criteria for revocation. A permit issued under paragraph (b) of 
this section may not be revoked for any reason except those set forth in 
Sec.  13.28(a)(1) through (4) of this subchapter or unless continuation 
of the permitted activity would be inconsistent with the criterion set 
forth in 16 U.S.C. 1539(a)(2)(B)(iv) and the inconsistency has not been 
remedied.
    (c)(1) Application requirements for permits for the enhancement of 
survival through Safe Harbor Agreements. The applicant must submit an 
application for a permit under this paragraph (c) to the appropriate 
Regional Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, for the Region where 
the applicant resides or where the proposed activity is to occur (for 
appropriate addresses, see 50 CFR 10.22), if the applicant wishes to 
engage in any activity prohibited by Sec.  17.21. The applicant must 
submit an official Service application form (3-200.54) that includes the 
following information:
    (i) The common and scientific names of the listed species for which 
the applicant requests incidental take authorization;
    (ii) A description of how incidental take of the listed species 
pursuant to the Safe Harbor Agreement is likely to occur, both as a 
result of management activities and as a result of the return to 
baseline; and
    (iii) A Safe Harbor Agreement that complies with the requirements of 
the Safe Harbor policy available from the Service.
    (2) Issuance criteria. Upon receiving an application completed in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Director will 
decide whether or not to issue a permit. The Director shall consider the 
general issuance criteria in Sec.  13.21(b) of this subchapter, except 
for Sec.  13.21(b)(4), and may issue the permit if he or she finds:
    (i) The take will be incidental to an otherwise lawful activity and 
will be in accordance with the terms of the Safe Harbor Agreement;
    (ii) The implementation of the terms of the Safe Harbor Agreement is 
reasonably expected to provide a net conservation benefit to the 
affected listed species by contributing to the recovery of listed 
species included in the permit, and the Safe Harbor Agreement otherwise 
complies with the Safe Harbor policy available from the Service;
    (iii) The probable direct and indirect effects of any authorized 
take will not appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery 
in the wild of any listed species;
    (iv) Implementation of the terms of the Safe Harbor Agreement is 
consistent with applicable Federal, State, and Tribal laws and 
regulations;
    (v) Implementation of the terms of the Safe Harbor Agreement will 
not be in conflict with any ongoing conservation or recovery programs 
for listed species covered by the permit; and

[[Page 100]]

    (vi) The applicant has shown capability for and commitment to 
implementing all of the terms of the Safe Harbor Agreement.
    (3) Permit conditions. In addition to any applicable general permit 
conditions set forth in part 13 of this subchapter, every permit issued 
under this paragraph (c) is subject to the following special conditions:
    (i) A requirement for the participating property owner to notify the 
Service of any transfer of lands subject to a Safe Harbor Agreement;
    (ii) When appropriate, a requirement for the permittee to give the 
Service reasonable advance notice (generally at least 30 days) of when 
he or she expects to incidentally take any listed species covered under 
the permit. Such notification will provide the Service with an 
opportunity to relocate affected individuals of the species, if possible 
and appropriate; and
    (iii) Any additional requirements or conditions the Director deems 
necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the permit and the 
Safe Harbor Agreement.
    (4) Permit effective date. Permits issued under this paragraph (c) 
become effective the day of issuance for species covered by the Safe 
Harbor Agreement.
    (5) Assurances provided to permittee. (i) The assurances in 
paragraph (c)(5) (ii) of this section (c)(5) apply only to Safe Harbor 
permits issued in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section where 
the Safe Harbor Agreement is being properly implemented, and apply only 
with respect to species covered by the Agreement and permit. These 
assurances cannot be provided to Federal agencies. The assurances 
provided in this section apply only to Safe Harbor permits issued after 
July 19, 1999.
    (ii) The Director and the permittee may agree to revise or modify 
the management measures set forth in a Safe Harbor Agreement if the 
Director determines that such revisions or modifications do not change 
the Director's prior determination that the Safe Harbor Agreement is 
reasonably expected to provide a net conservation benefit to the listed 
species. However, the Director may not require additional or different 
management activities to be undertaken by a permittee without the 
consent of the permittee.
    (6) Additional actions. Nothing in this rule will be construed to 
limit or constrain the Director, any Federal, State, local or Tribal 
government agency, or a private entity, from taking additional actions 
at its own expense to protect or conserve a species included in a Safe 
Harbor Agreement.
    (7) Criteria for revocation. The Director may not revoke a permit 
issued under paragraph (c) of this section except as provided in this 
paragraph. The Director may revoke a permit for any reason set forth in 
Sec.  13.28(a)(1) through (4) of this subchapter. The Director may 
revoke a permit if continuation of the permitted activity would either 
appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery in the wild 
of any listed species or directly or indirectly alter designated 
critical habitat such that it appreciably diminishes the value of that 
critical habitat for both the survival and recovery of a listed species. 
Before revoking a permit for either of the latter two reasons, the 
Director, with the consent of the permittee, will pursue all appropriate 
options to avoid permit revocation. These options may include, but are 
not limited to: extending or modifying the existing permit, capturing 
and relocating the species, compensating the landowner to forgo the 
activity, purchasing an easement or fee simple interest in the property, 
or arranging for a third-party acquisition of an interest in the 
property.
    (8) Duration of permits. The duration of permits issued under this 
paragraph (c) must be sufficient to provide a net conservation benefit 
to species covered in the enhancement of survival permit. In determining 
the duration of a permit, the Director will consider the duration of the 
planned activities, as well as the positive and negative effects 
associated with permits of the proposed duration on covered species, 
including the extent to which the conservation activities included in 
the Safe Harbor Agreement will enhance the survival and contribute to 
the recovery of listed species included in the permit.
    (d)(1) Application requirements for permits for the enhancement of 
survival

[[Page 101]]

through Candidate Conservation Agreements with Assurances. The applicant 
must submit an application for a permit under this paragraph (d) to the 
appropriate Regional Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, for the 
Region where the applicant resides or where the proposed activity is to 
occur (for appropriate addresses, see 50 CFR 10.22). When a species 
covered by a Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances is listed 
as endangered and the applicant wishes to engage in activities 
identified in the Agreement and otherwise prohibited by Sec.  17.31, the 
applicant must apply for an enhancement of survival permit for species 
covered by the Agreement. The permit will become valid if and when 
covered proposed, candidate or other unlisted species is listed as an 
endangered species. The applicant must submit an official Service 
application form (3-200.54) that includes the following information:
    (i) The common and scientific names of the species for which the 
applicant requests incidental take authorization;
    (ii) A description of the land use or water management activity for 
which the applicant requests incidental take authorization; and
    (iii) A Candidate Conservation Agreement that complies with the 
requirements of the Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances 
policy available from the Service.
    (2) Issuance criteria. Upon receiving an application completed in 
accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Director will 
decide whether or not to issue a permit. The Director shall consider the 
general issuance criteria in Sec.  13.21(b) of this subchapter, except 
for Sec.  13.21(b)(4), and may issue the permit if he or she finds:
    (i) The take will be incidental to an otherwise lawful activity and 
will be in accordance with the terms of the Candidate Conservation 
Agreement;
    (ii) The Candidate Conservation Agreement complies with the 
requirements of the Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances 
policy available from the Service;
    (iii) The probable direct and indirect effects of any authorized 
take will not appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery 
in the wild of any species;
    (iv) Implementation of the terms of the Candidate Conservation 
Agreement is consistent with applicable Federal, State, and Tribal laws 
and regulations;
    (v) Implementation of the terms of the Candidate Conservation 
Agreement will not be in conflict with any ongoing conservation programs 
for species covered by the permit; and
    (vi) The applicant has shown capability for and commitment to 
implementing all of the terms of the Candidate Conservation Agreement.
    (3) Permit conditions. In addition to any applicable general permit 
conditions set forth in part 13 of this subchapter, every permit issued 
under this paragraph (d) is subject to the following special conditions:
    (i) A requirement for the property owner to notify the Service of 
any transfer of lands subject to a Candidate Conservation Agreement;
    (ii) When appropriate, a requirement for the permittee to give the 
Service reasonable advance notice (generally at least 30 days) of when 
he or she expects to incidentally take any listed species covered under 
the permit. Such notification will provide the Service with an 
opportunity to relocate affected individuals of the species, if possible 
and appropriate; and
    (iii) Any additional requirements or conditions the Director deems 
necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the permit and the 
Candidate Conservation Agreement.
    (4) Permit effective date. Permits issued under this paragraph (d) 
become effective for a species covered by a Candidate Conservation 
Agreement on the effective date of a final rule that lists a covered 
species as endangered.
    (5) Assurances provided to permittee in case of changed or 
unforeseen circumstances. The assurances in this paragraph (d)(5) apply 
only to permits issued in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) where the 
Candidate Conservation with Assurances Agreement is being properly 
implemented, and apply only with respect to species adequately covered 
by the Candidate Conservation with Assurances Agreement. These 
assurances cannot be provided to Federal agencies.

[[Page 102]]

    (i) Changed circumstances provided for in the Agreement. If the 
Director determines that additional conservation measures are necessary 
to respond to changed circumstances and these measures were set forth in 
the Agreement, the permittee will implement the measures specified in 
the Agreement.
    (ii) Changed circumstances not provided for in the Agreement. If the 
Director determines that additional conservation measures not provided 
for in the Agreement are necessary to respond to changed circumstances, 
the Director will not require any conservation measures in addition to 
those provided for in the Agreement without the consent of the 
permittee, provided the Agreement is being properly implemented.
    (iii) Unforeseen circumstances. (A) In negotiating unforeseen 
circumstances, the Director will not require the commitment of 
additional land, water, or financial compensation or additional 
restrictions on the use of land, water, or other natural resources 
beyond the level otherwise agreed upon for the species covered by the 
Agreement without the consent of the permittee.
    (B) If the Director determines additional conservation measures are 
necessary to respond to unforeseen circumstances, the Director may 
require additional measures of the permittee where the Agreement is 
being properly implemented, but only if such measures maintain the 
original terms of the Agreement to the maximum extent possible. 
Additional conservation measures will not involve the commitment of 
additional land, water, or financial compensation or additional 
restrictions on the use of land, water, or other natural resources 
otherwise available for development or use under the original terms of 
the Agreement without the consent of the permittee.
    (C) The Director will have the burden of demonstrating that 
unforeseen circumstances exist, using the best scientific and commercial 
data available. These findings must be clearly documented and based upon 
reliable technical information regarding the status and habitat 
requirements of the affected species. The Director will consider, but 
not be limited to, the following factors:
    (1) Size of the current range of the affected species;
    (2) Percentage of range adversely affected by the Agreement;
    (3) Percentage of range conserved by the Agreement;
    (4) Ecological significance of that portion of the range affected by 
the Agreement;
    (5) Level of knowledge about the affected species and the degree of 
specificity of the species' conservation program under the Agreement; 
and
    (6) Whether failure to adopt additional conservation measures would 
appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery of the 
affected species in the wild.
    (6) Additional actions. Nothing in this rule will be construed to 
limit or constrain the Director, any Federal, State, local or Tribal 
government agency, or a private entity, from taking additional actions 
at its own expense to protect or conserve a species included in a 
Candidate Conservation with Assurances Agreement.
    (7) Criteria for revocation. The Director may not revoke a permit 
issued under paragraph (d) of this section except as provided in this 
paragraph. The Director may revoke a permit for any reason set forth in 
Sec.  13.28(a)(1) through (4) of this subchapter. The Director may 
revoke a permit if continuation of the permitted activity would either 
appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery in the wild 
of any listed species or directly or indirectly alter designated 
critical habitat such that it appreciably diminishes the value of that 
critical habitat for both the survival and recovery of a listed species. 
Before revoking a permit for either of the latter two reasons, the 
Director, with the consent of the permittee, will pursue all appropriate 
options to avoid permit revocation. These options may include, but are 
not limited to: extending or modifying the existing permit, capturing 
and relocating the species, compensating the landowner to forgo the 
activity, purchasing an easement or fee simple interest in the property, 
or arranging for a third-party acquisition of an interest in the 
property.

[[Page 103]]

    (8) Duration of the Candidate Conservation Agreement. The duration 
of a Candidate Conservation Agreement covered by a permit issued under 
this paragraph (d) must be sufficient to enable the Director to 
determine that the benefits of the conservation measures in the 
Agreement, when combined with those benefits that would be achieved if 
it is assumed that the conservation measures would also be implemented 
on other necessary properties, would preclude or remove any need to list 
the species covered by the Agreement.
    (e) Objection to permit issuance. (1) In regard to any notice of a 
permit application published in the Federal Register, any interested 
party that objects to the issuance of a permit, in whole or in part, 
may, during the comment period specified in the notice, request 
notification of the final action to be taken on the application. A 
separate written request shall be made for each permit application. Such 
a request shall specify the Service's permit application number and 
state the reasons why that party believes the applicant does not meet 
the issuance criteria contained in Sec. Sec.  13.21 and 17.22 of this 
subchapter or other reasons why the permit should not be issued.
    (2) If the Service decides to issue a permit contrary to objections 
received pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, then the Service 
shall, at least ten days prior to issuance of the permit, make 
reasonable efforts to contact by telephone or other expedient means, any 
party who has made a request pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section and inform that party of the issuance of the permit. However, 
the Service may reduce the time period or dispense with such notice if 
it determines that time is of the essence and that delay in issuance of 
the permit would: (i) Harm the specimen or population involved; or (ii) 
unduly hinder the actions authorized under the permit.
    (3) The Service will notify any party filing an objection and 
request for notice under paragraph (c)(1) of this section of the final 
action taken on the application, in writing. If the Service has reduced 
or dispensed with the notice period referred to in paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section, it will include its reasons therefore in such written 
notice.

Sec.  17.23  Economic hardship permits.

    Upon receipt of a complete application, the Director may issue a 
permit authorizing any activity otherwise prohibited by Sec.  17.21, in 
accordance with the issuance criteria of this section in order to 
prevent undue economic hardship. The Director shall publish notice in 
the Federal Register of each application for a permit that is made under 
this section. Each notice shall invite the submission from interested 
parties, within 30 days after the date of the notice, of written data, 
views, or arguments with respect to the application. The 30-day period 
may be waived by the Director in an emergency situation where the life 
or health of an endangered animal is threatened and no reasonable 
alternative is available to the applicant. Notice of any such waiver 
shall be published in the Federal Register within 10 days following 
issuance of the permit.
    (a) Application requirements. Applications for permits under this 
section must be submitted to the Director by the person allegedly 
suffering undue economic hardship because his desired activity is 
prohibited by Sec.  17.21. Each application must be submitted on an 
official application form (Form 3-200) provided by the Service, and must 
include, as an attachment, all of the information required in Sec.  
17.22 plus the following additional information:
    (1) The possible legal, economic or subsistence alternatives to the 
activity sought to be authorized by the permit;
    (2) A full statement, accompanied by copies of all relevant 
contracts and correspondence, showing the appli- cant's involvement with 
the wildlife sought to be covered by the permit (as well as his 
involvement with similar wildlife), including, where applicable, that 
portion of applicant's income derived from the taking of such wildlife, 
or the subsistence use of such wildlife, during the calendar year 
immediately

[[Page 104]]

preceding either the notice in the Federal Register of review of the 
status of the species or of the proposal to list such wildlife as 
endangered, whichever is earliest;
    (3) Where applicable, proof of a contract or other binding legal 
obligation which:
    (i) Deals specifically with the wildlife sought to be covered by the 
permit;
    (ii) Became binding prior to the date when the notice of a review of 
the status of the species or the notice of proposed rulemaking proposing 
to list such wildlife as endangered was published in the Federal 
Register, whichever is earlier; and
    (iii) Will cause monetary loss of a given dollar amount if the 
permit sought under this section is not granted.
    (b) Issuance criteria. Upon receiving an application completed in 
accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the Director will decide 
whether or not a permit should be issued under any of the three 
categories of economic hardship, as defined in section 10(b)(2) of the 
Act. In making his decisions, the Director shall consider, in addition 
to the general criteria in Sec.  13.21(b) of this subchapter, the 
following factors:
    (1) Whether the purpose for which the permit is being requested is 
adequate to justify removing from the wild or otherwise changing the 
status of the wildlife sought to be covered by the permit;
    (2) The probable direct and indirect effect which issuing the permit 
would have on the wild populations of the wildlife sought to be covered 
by the permit;
    (3) The economic, legal, subsistence, or other alternatives or 
relief available to the applicant;
    (4) The amount of evidence that the applicant was in fact party to a 
contract or other binding legal obligation which;
    (i) Deals specifically with the wildlife sought to be covered by the 
permit; and
    (ii) Became binding prior to the date when the notice of a review of 
the status of the species or the notice of proposed rulemaking proposing 
to list such wildlife as endangered was published in the Federal 
Register, whichever is earlier.
    (5) The severity of economic hardship which the contract or other 
binding legal obligation referred to in paragraph (b)(4) of this section 
would cause if the permit were denied;
    (6) Where applicable, the portion of the applicant's income which 
would be lost if the permit were denied, and the relationship of that 
portion to the balance of his income;
    (7) Where applicable, the nature and extent of subsistence taking 
generally by the applicant; and
    (8) The likelihood that applicant can reasonably carry out his 
desired activity within one year from the date a notice is published in 
the Federal Register to review status of such wildlife, or to list such 
wildlife as endangered, whichever is earlier.
    (c) Permit conditions. In addition to the general conditions set 
forth in part 13 of this subchapter, every permit issued under this 
section shall be subject to the following special conditions:
    (1) In addition to any reporting requirements contained in the 
permit itself, the permittee shall also submit to the Director a written 
report of his activities pursuant to the permit. Such report must be 
postmarked or actually delivered no later than 10 days after completion 
of the activity.
    (2) The death or escape of all living wildlife covered by the permit 
shall be immediately reported to the Service's office designated in the 
permit.
    (d) Duration of permits issued under this section shall be 
designated on the face of the permit. No permit issued under this 
section, however, shall be valid for more than one year from the date a 
notice is published in the Federal Register to review status of such 
wildlife, or to list such wildlife as endangered, whichever is earlier.

Sec.  17.32  Permits--general.

    Upon receipt of a complete application the Director may issue a 
permit for any activity otherwise prohibited with regard to threatened 
wildlife. Such permit shall be governed by the provisions of this 
section unless a special rule applicable to the wildlife, appearing in 
Sec. Sec.  17.40 to 17.48, of this part provides otherwise. Permits 
issued under this section must be for one of the following purposes: 
Scientific purposes, or the enhancement of propagation or survival, or 
economic hardship, or zoological exhibition, or educational purposes, or 
incidental taking, or special purposes consistent with the purposes of 
the Act. Such permits may authorize a single transaction, a series of 
transactions, or a number of activities over a specific period of time.
    (a)(1) Application requirements for permits for scientific purposes, 
or the enhancement of propagation or survival, or economic hardship, or 
zoological exhibition, or educational purposes, or special purposes 
consistent with the purposes of the Act. A person wishing to get a 
permit for an activity prohibited by Sec.  17.31 submits an application 
for activities under this paragraph. The Service provides Form 3-200 for 
the application to which as much of the following information relating 
to the purpose of the permit must be attached:
    (i) The Common and scientific names of the species sought to be 
covered by the permit, as well as the number, age, and sex of such 
species, and the activity sought to be authorized (such as taking, 
exporting, selling in interstate commerce);
    (ii) A statement as to whether, at the time of application, the 
wildlife sought to be covered by the permit (A) is still in the wild, 
(B) has already been removed from the wild, or (C) was born in 
captivity;
    (iii) A resume of the applicant's attempts to obtain the wildlife 
sought to be covered by the permit in a manner which would not cause the 
death or removal from the wild of such wildlife;
    (iv) If the wildlife sought to be covered by the permit has already 
been removed from the wild, the country and place where such removal 
occurred; if the wildlife sought to be covered by permit was born in 
captivity, the country and place where such wildlife was born;
    (v) A complete description and address of the institution or other 
facility where the wildlife sought to be covered by the permit will be 
used, displayed, or maintained;
    (vi) If the applicant seeks to have live wildlife covered by the 
permit, a complete description, including photographs or diagrams, of 
the facilities to house and/or care for the wildlife and a resume of the 
experience of those persons who will be caring for the wildlife;
    (vii) A full statement of the reasons why the applicant is justified 
in obtaining a permit including the details of the activities sought to 
be authorized by the permit;
    (viii) If the application is for the purpose of enhancement of 
propagation, a statement of the applicant's willingness to participate 
in a cooperative breeding program and to maintain or contribute data to 
a studbook;
    (2) Issuance criteria. Upon receiving an application completed in 
accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Director will 
decide whether or not a permit should be issued. In making

[[Page 106]]

this decision, the Director shall consider, in addition to the general 
criteria in Sec.  13.21(b) of this subchapter, the following factors:
    (i) Whether the purpose for which the permit is required is adequate 
to justify removing from the wild or otherwise changing the status of 
the wildlife sought to be covered by the permit;
    (ii) The probable direct and indirect effect which issuing the 
permit would have on the wild populations of the wildlife sought to be 
covered by the permit;
    (iii) Whether the permit, if issued, would in any way, directly or 
indirectly, conflict with any known program intended to enhance the 
survival probabilities of the population from which the wildlife sought 
to be covered by the permit was or would be removed;
    (iv) Whether the purpose for which the permit is required would be 
likely to reduce the threat of extinction facing the species of wildlife 
sought to be covered by the permit;
    (v) The opinions or views of scientists or other persons or 
organizations having expertise concerning the wildlife or other matters 
germane to the application; and
    (vi) Whether the expertise, facilities, or other resources available 
to the applicant appear adequate to successfully accomplish the 
objectives stated in the application.
    (3) Permit conditions. In addition to the general conditions set 
forth in part 13 of this subchapter, every permit issued under this 
paragraph shall be subject to the special condition that the escape of 
living wildlife covered by the permit shall be immediately reported to 
the Service office designated in the permit.
    (4) Duration of permits. The duration of permits issued under this 
paragraph shall be designated on the face of the permit.
    (b)(1) Application requirements for permits for incidental taking. 
(i) A person wishing to get a permit for an activity prohibited by Sec.  
17.31 submits an application for activities under this paragraph.
    (ii) The director shall publish notice in the Federal Register of 
each application for a permit that is made under this section. Each 
notice shall invite the submission from interested parties, within 30 
days after the date of the notice, of written data, views, or arguments 
with respect to the application.
    (iii) Each application must be submitted on an official application 
(Form 3-200) provided by the Service, and must include as an attachment, 
all of the following information:
    (A) A complete description of the activity sought to be authorized;
    (B) The common and scientific names of the species sought to be 
covered by the permit, as well as the number, age, and sex of such 
species, if known;
    (C) A conservation plan that specifies:
    (1) The impact that will likely result from such taking;
    (2) What steps the applicant will take to monitor, minimize, and 
mitigate such impacts, the funding that will be available to implement 
such steps, and the procedures to be used to deal with unforeseen 
circumstances;
    (3) What alternative actions to such taking the applicant considered 
and the reasons why such alternatives are not proposed to be utilized; 
and
    (4) Such other measures that the Director may require as being 
necessary or appropriate for purposes of the plan.
    (2) Issuance criteria. (i) Upon receiving an application completed 
in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Director will 
decide whether or not a permit should be issued. The Director shall 
consider the general issuance criteria in 13.21(b) of this subchapter, 
except for 13.21(b)(4), and shall issue the permit if he or she finds 
that:
    (A) The taking will be incidental;
    (B) The applicant will, to the maximum extent practicable, minimize 
and mitigate the impacts of such takings;
    (C) The applicant will ensure that adequate funding for the 
conservation plan and procedures to deal with unforeseen circumstances 
will be provided;
    (D) The taking will not appreciably reduce the likelihood of the 
survival and recovery of the species in the wild;
    (E) The measures, if any, required under paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(D) of 
this section will be met; and

[[Page 107]]

    (F) He or she has received such other assurances as he or she may 
require that the plan will be implemented.
    (ii) In making his or her decision, the Director shall also consider 
the anticipated duration and geographic scope of the applicant's planned 
activities, including the amount of listed species habitat that is 
involved and the degree to which listed species and their habitats are 
affected.
    (3) Permit conditions. In addition to the general conditions set 
forth in part 13 of this subchapter, every permit issued under this 
paragraph shall contain such terms and conditions as the Director deems 
necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the permit and the 
conservation plan including, but not limited to, monitoring and 
reporting requirements deemed necessary for determining whether such 
terms and conditions are being complied with. The Director shall rely 
upon existing reporting requirements to the maximum extent practicable.
    (4) Duration of permits. The duration of permits issued under this 
paragraph shall be sufficient to provide adequate assurances to the 
permittee to commit funding necessary for the activities authorized by 
the permit, including conservation activities and land use restrictions. 
In determining the duration of a permit, the Director shall consider the 
duration of the planned activities, as well as the possible positive and 
negative effects associated with permits of the proposed duration on 
listed species, including the extent to which the conservation plan will 
enhance the habitat of listed species and increase the long-term 
survivability of such species.
    (5) Assurances provided to permittee in case of changed or 
unforeseen circumstances. The assurances in this paragraph (b)(5) apply 
only to incidental take permits issued in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section where the conservation plan is being properly 
implemented, and apply only with respect to species adequately covered 
by the conservation plan. These assurances cannot be provided to Federal 
agencies. This rule does not apply to incidental take permits issued 
prior to March 25, 1998. The assurances provided in incidental take 
permits issued prior to March 25, 1998 remain in effect, and those 
permits will not be revised as a result of this rulemaking.
    (i) Changed circumstances provided for in the plan. If additional 
conservation and mitigation measures are deemed necessary to respond to 
changed circumstances and were provided for in the plan's operating 
conservation program, the permittee will implement the measures 
specified in the plan.
    (ii) Changed circumstances not provided for in the plan. If 
additional conservation and mitigation measures are deemed necessary to 
respond to changed circumstances and such measures were not provided for 
in the plan's operating conservation program, the Director will not 
require any conservation and mitigation measures in addition to those 
provided for in the plan without the consent of the permittee, provided 
the plan is being properly implemented.
    (iii) Unforeseen circumstances. (A) In negotiating unforeseen 
circumstances, the Director will not require the commitment of 
additional land, water, or financial compensation or additional 
restrictions on the use of land, water, or other natural resources 
beyond the level otherwise agreed upon for the species covered by the 
conservation plan without the consent of the permittee.
    (B) If additional conservation and mitigation measures are deemed 
necessary to respond to unforeseen circumstances, the Director may 
require additional measures of the permittee where the conservation plan 
is being properly implemented, but only if such measures are limited to 
modifications within conserved habitat areas, if any, or to the 
conservation plan's operating conservation program for the affected 
species, and maintain the original terms of the conservation plan to the 
maximum extent possible. Additional conservation and mitigation measures 
will not involve the commitment of additional land, water or financial 
compensation or additional restrictions on the use of land, water, or 
other natural resources otherwise available for development or use under 
the original terms of the conservation plan without the consent of the 
permittee.
    (C) The Director will have the burden of demonstrating that such 
unforeseen

[[Page 108]]

circumstances exist, using the best scientific and commercial data 
available. These findings must be clearly documented and based upon 
reliable technical information regarding the status and habitat 
requirements of the affected species. The Director will consider, but 
not be limited to, the following factors:
    (1) Size of the current range of the affected species;
    (2) Percentage of range adversely affected by the conservation plan;
    (3) Percentage of range conserved by the conservation plan;
    (4) Ecological significance of that portion of the range affected by 
the conservation plan;
    (5) Level of knowledge about the affected species and the degree of 
specificity of the species' conservation program under the conservation 
plan; and
    (6) Whether failure to adopt additional conservation measures would 
appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery of the 
affected species in the wild.
    (6) Nothing in this rule will be construed to limit or constrain the 
Director, any Federal, State, local, or Tribal government agency, or a 
private entity, from taking additional actions at its own expense to 
protect or conserve a species included in a conservation plan.
    (7) Discontinuance of permit activity. Notwithstanding the 
provisions of Sec.  13.26 of this subchapter, a permittee under this 
paragraph (b) remains responsible for any outstanding minimization and 
mitigation measures required under the terms of the permit for take that 
occurs prior to surrender of the permit and such minimization and 
mitigation measures as may be required pursuant to the termination 
provisions of an implementing agreement, habitat conservation plan, or 
permit even after surrendering the permit to the Service pursuant to 
Sec.  13.26 of this subchapter. The permit shall be deemed canceled only 
upon a determination by the Service that such minimization and 
mitigation measures have been implemented. Upon surrender of the permit, 
no further take shall be authorized under the terms of the surrendered 
permit.
    (8) Criteria for revocation. A permit issued under paragraph (b) of 
this section may not be revoked for any reason except those set forth in 
Sec.  13.28(a)(1) through (4) of this subchapter or unless continuation 
of the permitted activity would be inconsistent with the criterion set 
forth in 16 U.S.C. 1539(a)(2)(B)(iv) and the inconsistency has not been 
remedied.
    (c)(1) Application requirements for permits for the enhancement of 
survival through Safe Harbor Agreements. The applicant must submit an 
application for a permit under this paragraph (c) to the appropriate 
Regional Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, for the Region where 
the applicant resides or where the proposed action is to occur (for 
appropriate addresses, see 50 CFR 10.22), if the applicant wishes to 
engage in any activity prohibited by Sec.  17.31. The applicant must 
submit an official Service application form (3-200.54) that includes the 
following information:
    (i) The common and scientific names of the listed species for which 
the applicant requests incidental take authorization;
    (ii) A description of how incidental take of the covered species 
pursuant to the Safe Harbor Agreement is likely to occur, both as a 
result of management activities and as a result of the return to 
baseline;
    (iii) A Safe Harbor Agreement that complies with the requirements of 
the Safe Harbor policy available from the Service; and
    (iv) The Director must publish notice in the Federal Register of 
each application for a permit that is made under this paragraph (c). 
Each notice must invite the submission from interested parties within 30 
days after the date of the notice of written data, views, or arguments 
with respect to the application. The procedures included in Sec.  
17.22(e) for permit objection apply to any notice published by the 
Director under this paragraph (c).
    (2) Issuance criteria. Upon receiving an application completed in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Director will 
decide whether or not to issue a permit. The Director shall consider the 
general issuance criteria in Sec.  13.21(b) of this subchapter, except

[[Page 109]]

for Sec.  13.21(b)(4), and may issue the permit if he or she finds:
    (i) The take will be incidental to an otherwise lawful activity and 
will be in accordance with the terms of the Safe Harbor Agreement;
    (ii) The implementation of the terms of the Safe Harbor Agreement is 
reasonably expected to provide a net conservation benefit to the 
affected listed species by contributing to the recovery of listed 
species included in the permit, and the Safe Harbor Agreement otherwise 
complies with the Safe Harbor policy available from the Service;
    (iii) The probable direct and indirect effects of any authorized 
take will not appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery 
in the wild of any listed species;
    (iv) Implementation of the terms of the Safe Harbor Agreement is 
consistent with applicable Federal, State, and Tribal laws and 
regulations;
    (v) Implementation of the terms of the Safe Harbor Agreement will 
not be in conflict with any ongoing conservation or recovery programs 
for listed species covered by the permit; and
    (vi) The applicant has shown capability for and commitment to 
implementing all of the terms of the Safe Harbor Agreement.
    (3) Permit conditions. In addition to any applicable general permit 
conditions set forth in part 13 of this subchapter, every permit issued 
under this paragraph (c) is subject to the following special conditions:
    (i) A requirement for the participating property owner to notify the 
Service of any transfer of lands subject to a Safe Harbor Agreement;
    (ii) When appropriate, a requirement for the permittee to give the 
Service reasonable advance notice (generally at least 30 days) of when 
he or she expects to incidentally take any listed species covered under 
the permit. Such notification will provide the Service with an 
opportunity to relocate affected individuals of the species, if possible 
and appropriate; and
    (iii) Any additional requirements or conditions the Director deems 
necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the permit and the 
Safe Harbor Agreement.
    (4) Permit effective date. Permits issued under this paragraph (c) 
become effective the day of issuance for species covered by the Safe 
Harbor Agreement.
    (5) Assurances provided to permittee. (i) The assurances in 
subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph (c)(5) apply only to Safe Harbor 
permits issued in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section where 
the Safe Harbor Agreement is being properly implemented, and apply only 
with respect to species covered by the Agreement and permit. These 
assurances cannot be provided to Federal agencies. The assurances 
provided in this section apply only to Safe Harbor permits issued after 
July 19, 1999.
    (ii) The Director and the permittee may agree to revise or modify 
the management measures set forth in a Safe Harbor Agreement if the 
Director determines that such revisions or modifications do not change 
the Director's prior determination that the Safe Harbor Agreement is 
reasonably expected to provide a net conservation benefit to the listed 
species. However, the Director may not require additional or different 
management activities to be undertaken by a permittee without the 
consent of the permittee.
    (6) Additional actions. Nothing in this rule will be construed to 
limit or constrain the Director, any Federal, State, local or Tribal 
government agency, or a private entity, from taking additional actions 
at its own expense to protect or conserve a species included in a Safe 
Harbor Agreement.
    (7) Criteria for revocation. The Director may not revoke a permit 
issued under paragraph (c) of this section except as provided in this 
paragraph. The Director may revoke a permit for any reason set forth in 
Sec.  13.28(a)(1) through (4) of this subchapter. The Director may 
revoke a permit if continuation of the permitted activity would either 
appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery in the wild 
of any listed species or directly or indirectly alter designated 
critical habitat such that it appreciably diminishes the value of that 
critical habitat for both the survival and recovery of a listed species. 
Before revoking a permit for

[[Page 110]]

either of the latter two reasons, the Director, with the consent of the 
permittee, will pursue all appropriate options to avoid permit 
revocation. These options may include, but are not limited to: extending 
or modifying the existing permit, capturing and relocating the species, 
compensating the landowner to forgo the activity, purchasing an easement 
or fee simple interest in the property, or arranging for a third-party 
acquisition of an interest in the property.
    (8) Duration of permits. The duration of permits issued under this 
paragraph (c) must be sufficient to provide a net conservation benefit 
to species covered in the enhancement of survival permit. In determining 
the duration of a permit, the Director will consider the duration of the 
planned activities, as well as the positive and negative effects 
associated with permits of the proposed duration on covered species, 
including the extent to which the conservation activities included in 
the Safe Harbor Agreement will enhance the survival and contribute to 
the recovery of listed species included in the permit.
    (d)(1) Application requirements for permits for the enhancement of 
survival through Candidate Conservation Agreements with Assurances. The 
applicant must submit an application for a permit under this paragraph 
(d) to the appropriate Regional Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, for the Region where the applicant resides or where the 
proposed activity is to occur (for appropriate addresses, see 50 CFR 
10.22). When a species covered by a Candidate Conservation Agreement 
with Assurances is listed as threatened and the applicant wishes to 
engage in activities identified in the Agreement and otherwise 
prohibited by Sec.  17.31, the applicant must apply for an enhancement 
of survival permit for species covered by the Agreement. The permit will 
become valid if and when covered proposed, candidate or other unlisted 
species is listed as a threatened species. The applicant must submit an 
official Service application form (3-200.54) that includes the following 
information:
    (i) The common and scientific names of the species for which the 
applicant requests incidental take authorization;
    (ii) A description of the land use or water management activity for 
which the applicant requests incidental take authorization; and
    (iii) A Candidate Conservation Agreement that complies with the 
requirements of the Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances 
policy available from the Service.
    (iv) The Director must publish notice in the Federal Register of 
each application for a permit that is made under this paragraph (d). 
Each notice must invite the submission from interested parties within 30 
days after the date of the notice of written data, views, or arguments 
with respect to the application. The procedures included in Sec.  
17.22(e) for permit objection apply to any notice published by the 
Director under this paragraph (d).
    (2) Issuance criteria. Upon receiving an application completed in 
accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Director will 
decide whether or not to issue a permit. The Director shall consider the 
general issuance criteria in Sec.  13.21(b) of this subchapter, except 
for Sec.  13.21(b)(4), and may issue the permit if he or she finds:
    (i) The take will be incidental to an otherwise lawful activity and 
will be in accordance with the terms of the Candidate Conservation 
Agreement;
    (ii) The Candidate Conservation Agreement complies with the 
requirements of the Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances 
policy available from the Service;
    (iii) The probable direct and indirect effects of any authorized 
take will not appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery 
in the wild of any species;
    (iv) Implementation of the terms of the Candidate Conservation 
Agreement is consistent with applicable Federal, State, and Tribal laws 
and regulations;
    (v) Implementation of the terms of the Candidate Conservation 
Agreement will not be in conflict with any ongoing conservation programs 
for species covered by the permit; and
    (vi) The applicant has shown capability for and commitment to 
implementing all of the terms of the Candidate Conservation Agreement.

[[Page 111]]

    (3) Permit conditions. In addition to any applicable general permit 
conditions set forth in part 13 of this subchapter, every permit issued 
under this paragraph (d) is subject to the following special conditions:
    (i) A requirement for the property owner to notify the Service of 
any transfer of lands subject to a Candidate Conservation Agreement;
    (ii) When appropriate, a requirement for the permittee to give the 
Service reasonable advance notice (generally at least 30 days) of when 
he or she expects to incidentally take any listed species covered under 
the permit. Such notification will provide the Service with an 
opportunity to relocate affected individuals of the species, if possible 
and appropriate; and
    (iii) Any additional requirements or conditions the Director deems 
necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the permit and the 
Candidate Conservation Agreement.
    (4) Permit effective date. Permits issued under this paragraph (d) 
become effective for a species covered by a Candidate Conservation 
Agreement on the effective date of a final rule that lists a covered 
species as threatened.
    (5) Assurances provided to permittee in case of changed or 
unforeseen circumstances. The assurances in this paragraph (d)(5) apply 
only to permits issued in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) where the 
Candidate Conservation with Assurances Agreement is being properly 
implemented, and apply only with respect to species adequately covered 
by the Candidate Conservation with Assurances Agreement. These 
assurances cannot be provided to Federal agencies.
    (i) Changed circumstances provided for in the Agreement. If the 
Director determines that additional conservation measures are necessary 
to respond to changed circumstances and these measures were set forth in 
the Agreement, the permittee will implement the measures specified in 
the Agreement.
    (ii) Changed circumstances not provided for in the Agreement. If the 
Director determines that additional conservation measures not provided 
for in the Agreement are necessary to respond to changed circumstances, 
the Director will not require any conservation measures in addition to 
those provided for in the Agreement without the consent of the 
permittee, provided the Agreement is being properly implemented.
    (iii) Unforeseen circumstances. (A) In negotiating unforeseen 
circumstances, the Director will not require the commitment of 
additional land, water, or financial compensation or additional 
restrictions on the use of land, water, or other natural resources 
beyond the level otherwise agreed upon for the species covered by the 
Agreement without the consent of the permittee.
    (B) If the Director determines additional conservation measures are 
necessary to respond to unforeseen circumstances, the Director may 
require additional measures of the permittee where the Agreement is 
being properly implemented, but only if such measures maintain the 
original terms of the Agreement to the maximum extent possible. 
Additional conservation measures will not involve the commitment of 
additional land, water, or financial compensation or additional 
restrictions on the use of land, water, or other natural resources 
otherwise available for development or use under the original terms of 
the Agreement without the consent of the permittee.
    (C) The Director will have the burden of demonstrating that 
unforeseen circumstances exist, using the best scientific and commercial 
data available. These findings must be clearly documented and based upon 
reliable technical information regarding the status and habitat 
requirements of the affected species. The Director will consider, but 
not be limited to, the following factors:
    (1) Size of the current range of the affected species;
    (2) Percentage of range adversely affected by the Agreement;
    (3) Percentage of range conserved by the Agreement;
    (4) Ecological significance of that portion of the range affected by 
the Agreement;
    (5) Level of knowledge about the affected species and the degree of 
specificity of the species' conservation program under the Agreement; 
and

[[Page 112]]

    (6) Whether failure to adopt additional conservation measures would 
appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery of the 
affected species in the wild.
    (6) Additional actions. Nothing in this rule will be construed to 
limit or constrain the Director, any Federal, State, local or Tribal 
government agency, or a private entity, from taking additional actions 
at its own expense to protect or conserve a species included in a 
Candidate Conservation with Assurances Agreement.
    (7) Criteria for revocation. The Director may not revoke a permit 
issued under paragraph (d) of this section except as provided in this 
paragraph. The Director may revoke a permit for any reason set forth in 
Sec.  13.28(a)(1) through (4) of this subchapter. The Director may 
revoke a permit if continuation of the permitted activity would either 
appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery in the wild 
of any listed species or directly or indirectly alter designated 
critical habitat such that it appreciably diminishes the value of that 
critical habitat for both the survival and recovery of a listed species. 
Before revoking a permit for either of the latter two reasons, the 
Director, with the consent of the permittee, will pursue all appropriate 
options to avoid permit revocation. These options may include, but are 
not limited to: extending or modifying the existing permit, capturing 
and relocating the species, compensating the landowner to forgo the 
activity, purchasing an easement or fee simple interest in the property, 
or arranging for a third-party acquisition of an interest in the 
property.
    (8) Duration of the Candidate Conservation Agreement. The duration 
of a Candidate Conservation Agreement covered by a permit issued under 
this paragraph (d) must be sufficient to enable the Director to 
determine that the benefits of the conservation measures in the 
Agreement, when combined with those benefits that would be achieved if 
it is assumed that the conservation measures would also be implemented 
on other necessary properties, would preclude or remove any need to list 
the species covered by the Agreement.

Sec.  17.40  Special rules--mammals.

    (a) [Reserved]
    (b) Grizzly bear (Ursus arctos)--(1) Prohibitions. The following 
prohibitions apply to the grizzly bear:
    (i) Taking. (A) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(B) 
through (F) of this section, no person shall take any grizzly bear in 
the 48 conterminous states of the United States.
    (B) Grizzly bears may be taken in self-defense or in defense of 
others, but such taking shall be reported, within 5 days of occurrence, 
to the Assistant Regional Director, Division of Law Enforcement, U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O. Box 25486, Denver Federal Center, 
Denver, Colorado 80225 (303/236-7540 or FTS 776-7540), if occurring in 
Montana or Wyoming, or to the Assistant Regional Director, Division of 
Law Enforcement, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Lloyd 500 Building, 
Suite 1490, 500 Northeast Multnomah Street, Portland, Oregon 97232 (503/
231-6125 or FTS 429-6125), if occurring in Idaho or Washington, and to 
appropriate State and Indian Reservation Tribal authorities. Grizzly 
bears or their parts taken in self-defense or in defense of others shall 
not be possessed, delivered, carried, transported, shipped, exported, 
received, or sold, except by Federal, State, or Tribal authorities.
    (C) Removal of nuisance bears. A grizzly bear consituting a 
demonstrable but non immediate threat to human safety or committing

example, if accessing the ditch for maintenance or repair activities 
from an area containing no shrubs is possible, then damage to adjacent 
shrub vegetation shall be avoided.
    (2) Persons engaged in placement or sidecasting of silt and debris 
removed during ditch cleaning, vegetation or mulch from mowing or 
cutting, and other material from ditch maintenance shall, to the maximum 
extent practicable, avoid shrub habitat and at no time disturb more than 
\1/4\ mile of riparian shrub habitat per linear mile of ditch within any 
calendar year.

    (ii) The logo adopted by countries signatory to the ``Convenio para 
la Conservaci[oacute]n y Manejo de la Vicu[ntilde]a'' and the words 
``VICU[Ntilde]A--(Country of Origin),'' where country of origin is the 
name of the original exporting country where the vicu[ntilde]a fiber in 
the products originated, either Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, or Peru.
    (B) The shipment must be accompanied by a CITES permit or 
certificate that contains the following information:
    (1) The country of origin, its export permit number, and date of 
issuance.
    (2) If re-export, the country of re-export, its certificate number, 
and date of issuance.
    (3) If applicable, the country of last re-export, its certificate 
number, and date of issuance.
    (C) At the time of import, for each shipment covered by this 
exception, the country of origin and each country of re-export involved 
in the trade of a particular shipment must have designated both a CITES 
Management Authority and Scientific Authority, and have not been 
identified by the CITES Conference of the Parties, the CITES Standing 
Committee, or in a Notification from the CITES Secretariat as a country 
from which Parties should not accept permits. A listing of all countries 
that have not designated both a Management Authority and Scientific 
Authority, or that have been identified as a country from which Parties 
should not accept permits is available by writing: The Division of 
Management Authority, ARLSQ Room 700, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service, Arlington, VA 22203. The list is also on our 
website (http://international.fws.gov).
    (ii) Noncommercial accompanying baggage. The conditions described in 
paragraph (m)(2)(i) of this section also apply to noncommercial personal 
effects in accompanying baggage or household effects from Appendix II 
populations. Such items are treated the same as Appendix II commercial 
shipments, and must comply with the same documentary requirements. All 
other noncommercial personal effects in accompanying baggage or 
household effects require both a CITES Appendix I permit and a permit as 
described in Sec.  17.32.
    (iii) Embryos, gametes, blood, other tissue samples, and live 
animals. This special rule does not apply to embryos, gametes, blood, or 
other tissue samples of vicu[ntilde]a, or to live vicu[ntilde]a. Import 
of such specimens requires an import permit as described in Sec.  17.32 
in addition to CITES Appendix I import and export permits, and will be 
issued only for bona fide scientific research contributing to 
conservation of the species in the wild.
    (3) When and how will the Service inform the public of additional 
restrictions in trade of vicu[ntilde]a? Except in rare cases involving 
extenuating circumstances that do not adversely affect the conservation 
of the species, we will issue an information notice that identifies a 
restriction on trade in specimens of vicu[ntilde]a addressed in this 
paragraph (m) if any of the following criteria are met:
    (i) The country is listed in a Notification to the Parties by the 
CITES Secretariat as lacking a designated Management or Scientific 
Authority that issues CITES documents or their equivalent.
    (ii) The country is identified in any action adopted by the 
Conference of the Parties to the Convention, the Convention's Standing 
Committee, or in a

[[Page 121]]

Notification issued by the CITES Secretariat, whereby Parties are asked 
not to accept shipments of specimens of any CITES-listed species from 
the country in question.
    (iii) The Service's Division of Scientific Authority 
administratively determines that the conservation or management status 
of threatened vicu[ntilde]a populations in a range country has changed, 
such that continued recovery of the vicu[ntilde]a population in that 
country may be compromised, as a result of one or more of the following 
factors:
    (A) A change in range country laws or regulations that lessens 
protection for vicu[ntilde]a;
    (B) A change in range country management programs that lessens 
protection for vicu[ntilde]a;
    (C) A documented decline in wild vicu[ntilde]a population numbers;
    (D) A documented increase in poaching of vicu[ntilde]a;
    (E) A documented decline in vicu[ntilde]a habitat quality or 
quantity; or
    (F) Other natural or man-made factors affecting the species' 
recovery.
    (iv) A listing of all countries that have not designated both a 
Management Authority and Scientific Authority, or that have been 
identified as a country from which Parties should not accept permits is 
available by writing: The Division of Management Authority, ARLSQ Room 
700, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Arlington, 
VA 22203. The list is also on our website (http://
international.fws.gov).
    (4) What must vicu[ntilde]a range countries do in order to be 
authorized under the special rule to export to the United States?--(i) 
Annual Report. Range country governments (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and 
Peru) wishing to export specimens of vicu[ntilde]a to the United States 
will need to provide an annual report containing the most recent 
information available on the status of the species, following the 
information guidelines specified below. The first submission of a status 
report will be required as of July 1, 2003, and every year thereafter on 
the anniversary of that date. For each range country, the following 
information should be provided in the annual report:
    (A) A description of any revisions to the management program, 
especially any changes in management approaches or emphasis;
    (B) New information obtained in the last year on vicu[ntilde]a 
distribution, population status, or population trends, for the country 
as a whole or for specific protected areas, and a detailed description 
of the methodology used to obtain such information;
    (C) Results of any research projects concluded in the last year on 
the biology of vicu[ntilde]a in the wild, particularly its population 
biology, habitat use, and genetics, and a description of any new 
research projects undertaken on the biology of vicu[ntilde]a in the 
wild, particularly its population biology, habitat use, and genetics;
    (D) A description of any changes to national and/or provincial laws 
and programs relating to vicu[ntilde]a conservation, in particular those 
laws and regulations related to harvest and use of the vicu[ntilde]a, 
and export of vicu[ntilde]a parts and products;
    (E) A description of any changes in the number or size of natural 
reserves or national parks that provide protected habitat for the 
vicu[ntilde]a;
    (F) A summary of law enforcement activities undertaken in the last 
year, and a description of any changes in programs to prevent poaching, 
smuggling, and illegal commercialization of the vicu[ntilde]a;
    (G) A description of the current management and harvest (or 
``sustainable use'') programs for wild populations of the vicu[ntilde]a, 
including: any changes in the location and population size of wild 
populations being managed for sustainable use; any changes in the 
harvest management practices being used for each population; any changes 
in current harvest quotas for wild populations, if any; any changes in 
protocols for translocations undertaken as part of the use program; a 
summary of the specific financial costs of and revenues generated by the 
sustainable use program over the last year; and a summary of documented 
conservation benefits resulting from the sustainable use program over 
the last year;
    (H) A description of current management and harvest (or 
``sustainable use'') programs for captive and so-

[[Page 122]]

called ``semi-captive'' populations of the vicu[ntilde]a, including: any 
changes in the number and location of all captive and ``semi-captive'' 
populations; any changes in the size (ha) of each captive enclosure and 
the number of vicu[ntilde]a maintained therein; any changes in protocols 
for translocations undertaken as part of the use program; a summary of 
the financial costs of and revenues generated by the sustainable use 
program over the last year; and documented conservation benefits 
resulting from the sustainable use program over the last year 
(information on captive and ``semi-captive'' populations must be 
separate from that provided for wild populations); and
    (I) Export data for the last year.
    (ii) The Service's Division of Scientific Authority will conduct a 
review every 2 years, using information in the annual reports, to 
determine whether range country management programs are effectively 
achieving conservation benefits for the vicu[ntilde]a. Failure to submit 
an annual report could result in a restriction on trade in specimens of 
vicu[ntilde]a as addressed in paragraph (m)(3) of this section. Based on 
information contained in the annual reports and any other pertinent 
information it has available, the Service may restrict trade from a 
range country, as addressed in paragraph (m)(3) of this section, if it 
determines that the conservation or management status of threatened 
vicu[ntilde]a populations in a range country has changed, such that 
continued recovery of the vicu[ntilde]a population in that country may 
be compromised. Trade restrictions may result from one or more of the 
following factors:
    (A) A change in range country laws or regulations that lessens 
protection for vicu[ntilde]a;
    (B) A change in range country management programs that lessens 
protection for vicu[ntilde]a;
    (C) A documented decline in wild vicu[ntilde]a population numbers;
    (D) A documented increase in poaching of vicu[ntilde]a;
    (E) A documented decline in vicu[ntilde]a habitat quality or 
quantity; or
    (F) Other natural or man-made factors affecting the species' 
recovery.

    (b) Coastal California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica 
californica). (1) Except as noted in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this 
section, all prohibitions of Sec.  17.31(a) and (b) shall apply to the 
coastal California gnatcatcher.
    (2) Incidental take of the coastal California gnatcatcher will not 
be considered a violation of section 9 of the Endangered Species Act of 
1973, as amended (Act), if it results from activities conducted pursuant 
to the State of California's Natural Community Conservation Planning Act 
of 1991 (NCCP), and in accordance with a NCCP plan for the protection of 
coastal sage scrub habitat, prepared consistent with the State's NCCP 
Conservation and Process Guidelines, provided that:
    (i) The NCCP plan has been prepared, approved, and implemented 
pursuant to California Fish and Game Code sections 2800-2840; and
    (ii) The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) has issued written 
concurrence that the NCCP plan meets the standards set forth in 50 CFR 
17.32(b)(2). The Service shall issue its concurrence pursuant to the 
provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), dated December 4, 
1991, between the California Department of Fish and Game and the Service 
regarding coastal sage scrub natural community conservation planning in 
southern California. (Copies of the State's NCCP Conservation and 
Process Guidelines and the MOU are available from the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, Carlsbad Field Office, 2730 Loker Avenue West, 
Carlsbad, CA 92008.) The Service shall monitor the implementation of the 
NCCP plan and may revoke its concurrence under this paragraph (b)(2)(ii) 
if the NCCP plan, as implemented, fails to adhere to the standards set 
forth in 50 CFR 17.32(b)(2).
    (3) During the period that a NCCP plan referred to in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section is being prepared, incidental take of the coastal 
California gnatcatcher will not be a violation of section 9 of the Act 
if such take occurs within an area under the jurisdiction of a local 
government agency that is enrolled and actively engaged in the 
preparation of such a plan and such take results from activities 
conducted in accordance with the NCCP Conservation Guidelines and 
Process Guidelines.
    (4) The Service will monitor the implementation of the NCCP 
Conservation and Process Guidelines as a whole, and will conduct a 
review every 6 months to determine whether the guidelines, as 
implemented, are effective in progressing toward or meeting regional and 
subregional conservation objectives during the interim planning period. 
If the Service determines that the guidelines are not effecting adequate 
progress toward or meeting regional and subregional conservation 
objectives, the Service will consult with the California Department of 
Fish and Game pursuant to the MOU to seek appropriate modification of 
the guidelines or their application as defined therein. If appropriate 
modification of the guidelines or their application as defined therein 
does not occur, the Service may revoke the interim take provisions of 
this special rule on a subregional or subarea basis. The Service will 
publish the findings for revocation in the Federal Register and provide 
for a 30-day public comment period prior to the effective date for 
revoking the provisions of the special rule in a particular area. 
Revocation would result in the reinstatement of the take prohibitions 
set forth under 50 CFR 17.31(a) and (b) in the affected NCCP area.

involving extenuating circumstances that do not adversely affect the 
conservation of the species, the Service will issue an information 
bulletin (posted on our websites, http://www.fws.gov/le and http://
www.fws.gov/international) announcing additional restrictions on trade 
of specimens of threatened crocodilians if any of the following criteria 
are met:

[[Page 126]]

    (i) The country is listed in a Notification to the Parties by the 
CITES Secretariat as not having designated Management and Scientific 
Authorities.
    (ii) The country is identified in any action adopted by the 
Conference of the Parties to the Convention, the Standing Committee, or 
in a Notification issued by the CITES Secretariat, whereby Parties are 
asked not to accept shipments of specimens of any CITES species from the 
country in question or of any crocodilian species listed in the CITES 
Appendices.
    (iii) We determine, based on information from the CITES Secretariat 
or other reliable sources, that the country is not effectively 
implementing the provisions of the Convention.
    (5) Reporting requirements for yacare caiman range countries.
    (i) Biennial reports. Range countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, 
and Paraguay) wishing to export specimens of yacare caiman to the United 
States for commercial purposes must provide a biennial report containing 
the most recent information available on the status of the species. The 
first submission of a status report will be required as of December 31, 
2001, and every 2 years thereafter on the anniversary of that date. For 
each range country, all of the following information must be included in 
the report.
    (A) Recent distribution and population data, and a description of 
the methodology used to obtain such estimates.
    (B) Description of research projects currently being conducted 
related to the biology of the species in the wild, particularly 
reproductive biology (for example, age or size when animals become 
sexually mature, number of clutches per season, number of eggs per 
clutch, survival of eggs, survival of hatchlings).
    (C) Description of laws and programs regulating harvest, including 
approximate acreage of land set aside as natural reserves or national 
parks that provide protected habitat for yacare caiman.
    (D) Description of current sustainable harvest programs, including 
ranching (captive rearing of specimens collected from the wild as eggs 
or juveniles) and farming (captive-breeding) programs.
    (E) Current harvest quotas for wild populations.
    (F) Export data for the last 2 years. Information should be 
organized according to the source of specimens such as wild-caught, 
captive-reared, or captive-bred.
    (ii) Review and restrictions. The U.S. Scientific Authority will 
conduct a review every 2 years, using information in the biennial 
reports and other available information, to determine whether range 
country management programs are effectively achieving conservation 
benefits for the yacare caiman. Based on the best available information, 
we may restrict trade from a range country if we determine that the 
conservation or management status of threatened yacare caiman 
populations has changed, such that continued recovery of the population 
in that country may be compromised. Trade restrictions, as addressed in 
paragraph (c)(4) of this section, may be implemented based on one or 
more of the following factors:
    (A) Failure to submit the reports described above, or failure to 
respond to requests for additional information.
    (B) A change in range country laws or regulations that lessens 
protection for yacare caiman.
    (C) A change in range country management programs that lessens 
protection for the species.
    (D) A documented decline in wild population numbers.
    (E) A documented increase in poaching.
    (F) A documented decline in habitat quality or quantity.
    (G) Other natural or manmade factors affecting the species' 
recovery.
    (d) Blue-tailed mole skink (Eumeces egregius lividus) and sand skink 
(Neoseps reynoldsi). (1) No person shall take these species, except in 
accordance with applicable State fish and wildlife conservation laws and 
regulations for educational purposes, scientific purposes, the 
enhancement or survival of the species, zoological exhibition, and other 
conservation purposes consistent with the Act.
    (2) Any violation of applicable State fish and wildlife conservation 
laws or regulations with respect to taking of

[[Page 127]]

these species is also a violation of the Endangered Species Act.
    (3) No person shall possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export, by any means whatever, any such species taken in 
violation of applicable State fish and wildlife conservation laws or 
regulations.
    (4) It is unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, solicit 
another to commit, or cause to be committed, any offense defined in 
paragraph (c) (1) through (3) of this section.
    (5) Taking of these species for purposes other than those described 
in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, including taking incidental to 
carrying out otherwise lawful activities, is prohibited except when

the natural marine environment of the littoral states.
    Live or living beluga sturgeon. Any living specimen of Huso huso, 
including viable unfertilized or fertilized eggs, larvae, fingerlings, 
juveniles, and adults.
    Littoral states. Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Islamic Republic of 
Iran, Kazakhstan, Romania, Russian Federation, Serbia and Montenegro, 
Turkey, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine.
    Re-export. Export of beluga sturgeon specimens that were previously 
imported.
    Wild beluga sturgeon. Specimens of Huso huso born and reared in the 
natural marine environment within the current or former geographic range 
of the species.
    (2) What activities involving beluga sturgeon are affected by this 
rule? (i) International trade in beluga sturgeon. Except as provided in 
paragraphs (y)(3) and (y)(5) of this section, all prohibitions and 
provisions of Sec. Sec.  17.31(a) and 17.32 apply to the international 
trade in beluga sturgeon, including its parts and derivatives. Live 
beluga sturgeon remain subject to all the prohibitions and provisions of 
Sec. Sec.  17.31(a) and 17.32.
    (ii) Trade without CITES documents. Except as provided in paragraph 
(y)(3) of this section, you may not import, export, or re-export, or 
present for export or re-export, beluga sturgeon or beluga sturgeon 
products without valid CITES permits and other permits and licenses 
issued under parts 13, 17, and 23 of this chapter.
    (iii) Commercial activity. Except as provided in paragraphs (y)(3) 
and (5) of this section and Sec.  17.32, you may not sell or offer for 
sale, deliver, receive, carry, transport, or ship in interstate or 
foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity any beluga 
sturgeon or beluga sturgeon products.
    (iv) It is unlawful for any person subject to the jurisdiction of 
the United States to commit, attempt to commit, solicit to commit, or 
cause to be committed any acts described in paragraphs (y)(2)(ii) and 
(iii) of this section.
    (3) What activities are exempted from threatened species permits by 
this rule? (i) Import, export or re-export, and interstate and foreign 
commerce involving certain caviar and meat obtained from beluga 
sturgeon. You may import, export or re-export, or conduct interstate or 
foreign commerce in beluga sturgeon caviar and meat without a threatened 
species permit issued according to Sec.  17.32 only if the caviar and 
meat are derived from wild or hatchery-origin beluga sturgeon that were 
caught and processed in the littoral states, or the caviar and meat are 
exempt from permits because they originate from qualifying aquaculture 
facilities outside of littoral states (see paragraph (y)(5) of this 
section). Also, the provisions in parts 13, 14, and 23 of this chapter 
and the following requirements must be met:
    (A) Except for caviar contained in cosmetics, any beluga caviar must 
comply with all CITES labeling requirements, as defined in relevant 
Resolutions or Decisions of the Conference of the Parties, including 
beluga caviar in interstate commerce in the United States. All 
individuals or businesses in the United States wishing to engage in 
domestic interstate commerce of beluga sturgeon caviar must follow the 
CITES caviar-labeling requirements.
    (B) The shipment must be accompanied by a valid CITES permit or 
certificate upon import, export, or re-export.
    (C) For each shipment covered by this exemption, the country of 
origin and each country of re-export, and the country of import involved 
in the trade of a particular shipment, must have designated both a CITES 
Management Authority and Scientific Authority, and have not been 
identified by the CITES Conference of the Parties, the CITES Standing 
Committee, or in a Notification from the CITES Secretariat as a country 
from which Parties should not accept permits for beluga sturgeon or all 
CITES-listed species in general.
    (D) The littoral state from which the beluga sturgeon caviar or meat 
originated has complied with all of the requirements shown in paragraph 
(y)(4) of this section, and none of the exporting, importing, or re-
exporting countries involved in the commercial activity has been subject 
to an administrative trade restriction or suspension as outlined in 
paragraphs (y)(6) and (7) of this section.

[[Page 135]]

    (E) Any relevant aquaculture facility located outside of a littoral 
state has complied with all of the requirements shown in paragraph 
(y)(5) of this section.
    (ii) Import and re-export of non-commercial personal or household 
effects. You may import, export or re-export, or conduct interstate or 
foreign commerce in beluga sturgeon personal or household effects 
without a threatened species permit issued according to Sec.  17.32. 
Also, for CITES permits, Article VII.3. of CITES recognizes a limited 
exemption for the international movement of personal and household 
effects, including specimens of beluga sturgeon.
    (A) Stricter national measures. The exemption for personal and 
household effects does not apply if a country prohibits or restricts the 
import, export, or re-export of the item.
    (1) You or your shipment must be accompanied by any document 
required by a country under its stricter national measures.
    (2) In the United States, you must obtain any permission needed 
under other regulations in this subchapter.
    (B) Required CITES documents. You must obtain a CITES document for 
personal or household effects and meet the requirements of this part if 
one of the following applies:
    (1) The Management Authority of the importing, exporting, or re-
exporting country requires a CITES document.
    (2) You or your shipment does not meet all of the conditions for an 
exemption as provided in paragraphs (y)(3)(ii)(C) and (D) of this 
section.
    (3) The personal or household effect exceeds 250 grams of beluga 
caviar. To import, export, or re-export more than 250 grams, you must 
have a valid CITES document for the entire quantity.
    (C) Personal effects. You do not need a CITES document to import, 
export, or re-export any part, product, derivative, or manufactured 
article of a legally acquired beluga sturgeon specimen to or from the 
United States if all of the following conditions are met:
    (1) No living beluga sturgeon is included.
    (2) You personally own and possess the item for non-commercial 
purposes, including any item intended as a personal gift.
    (3) The item and quantity of items are reasonably necessary or 
appropriate for the nature of your trip or stay.
    (4) You are either wearing the item as clothing or an accessory or 
taking it as part of your personal baggage, which is being carried by 
you or checked as baggage on the same plane, boat, car, or train as you.
    (5) The item was not mailed or shipped separately.
    (D) Household effects. You do not need a CITES document to import, 
export, or re-export any part, product, derivative, or manufactured 
article of a legally acquired beluga sturgeon specimen that is part of a 
shipment of your household effects when moving your residence to or from 
the United States, if all of the following conditions are met:
    (1) No living beluga sturgeon is included.
    (2) You personally own the item and are moving it for non-commercial 
purposes.
    (3) The item and quantity of items are reasonably necessary or 
appropriate for household use.
    (4) You import, export, or re-export your household effects within 1 
year of changing your residence from one country to another.
    (5) The shipment, or shipments if you cannot move all of your 
household effects at one time, contains only items purchased, inherited, 
or otherwise acquired before you moved your residence.
    (E) Trade restrictions. Regardless of the provisions above for 
personal and household effects, any trade suspension or trade 
restriction administratively imposed by the Service under paragraphs 
(y)(6) or (7) of this section could also apply to personal and household 
effects of beluga caviar.
    (4) What must beluga sturgeon littoral states do to be authorized 
under the special rule to export to the United States? The following 
requirements apply to the littoral states wishing to export beluga 
caviar or beluga meat to the United States without the need for a 
threatened species permit issued under Sec.  17.32. These requirements 
apply to all

[[Page 136]]

shipments of beluga caviar and beluga meat that originate in the 
littoral states, even if the shipments are re-exported to the United 
States via an intermediary country. (See paragraph (y)(7) of this 
section for more information on the Service's biennial reviews under the 
special rule.)
    (i) Basin-wide beluga sturgeon management plans. By September 6, 
2005, each littoral state wishing to export beluga caviar or beluga meat 
to the United States without the need for a threatened species permit 
issued under Sec.  17.32 must submit to the Service's Division of 
Scientific Authority a copy of a cooperative management plan for its 
respective basin (i.e., Black Sea or Caspian Sea) that addresses Huso 
huso conservation. Each of these two basin-wide management plans must be 
agreed to by all of the littoral states (not just exporting nations) in 
the Black Sea or the Caspian Sea, as appropriate. Upon receipt, the 
Division of Scientific Authority will review these basin-wide management 
plans within 90 days for completeness and clarity. If any elements of 
the management plans are missing or unclear, we will ask the appropriate 
littoral states to provide additional information within 60 days of the 
date we contact them. If the littoral states fail to respond or fail to 
submit basin-wide management plans by the specified deadline, or if we 
are unable to confirm that all littoral states are signatories to those 
plans, we will immediately suspend trade with all littoral states in the 
given basin (Caspian Sea or Black Sea) until we are satisfied that such 
management plans exist. Submission of documents in English may help 
expedite the Service's review. These cooperative management plans must 
contain the following elements:
    (A) A clear statement of the recovery and management objectives of 
the plan, including a specification of the stock(s) concerned, a 
definition of what constitutes over-fishing for that stock, and a 
rebuilding objective and schedule for that stock;
    (B) A statement of standard regulations and habitat improvement 
strategies (e.g., size limits, target harvest rates, quotas, seasons, 
fishing gear, effort caps, fish passage improvement, water quality 
controls) to be utilized by the nations involved;
    (C) A complete statement of the specific regulatory, monitoring, and 
research requirements that each cooperating nation must implement to be 
in compliance with the management plan;
    (D) A complete description of how stock survey data and fisheries 
data are used to establish annual catch and export quotas, including a 
full explanation of any models used and the assumptions underlying those 
models;
    (E) Procedures under which the nations may implement and enforce 
alternative management measures that achieve the same conservation 
benefits for beluga sturgeon as the standards mentioned in paragraph 
(y)(4)(i)(B) of this section; and
    (F) A complete schedule by which nations must take particular 
actions to be in compliance with the plan.
    (ii) National regulations. By September 6, 2005, each littoral state 
wishing to export beluga caviar or beluga meat to the United States 
under this special rule must provide the Service's Division of 
Scientific Authority with copies of national legislation and regulations 
that implement the basin-wide cooperative management plan described in 
paragraph (y)(4)(i) of this section, including regulations pertaining to 
the harvest, trade, aquaculture, restocking, and processing of beluga 
sturgeon. Upon receipt, the Division of Scientific Authority will review 
these national laws and regulations within 90 days for completeness and 
clarity. If any elements of the national legislation or national fishery 
regulations are missing or unclear, we will ask the appropriate littoral 
states to provide additional information within 60 days of the date we 
contact them. If the littoral states fail to respond or fail to submit 
copies of national laws and regulations by the specified deadline, we 
will immediately suspend trade with the given littoral states until we 
are satisfied that such laws and regulations are in effect. Submission 
of documents in English may help expedite the Service's review.
    (iii) Caviar labeling. All caviar shipments imported into the United 
States must follow the CITES caviar-labeling

[[Page 137]]

requirements as agreed to in the relevant Resolutions and Decisions of 
the CITES Parties. Current labeling requirements can be obtained by 
contacting the Division of Management Authority, Branch of Permits--
International, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 4401 North Fairfax Drive, 
Room 700, Arlington, VA 22203.
    (iv) CITES compliance. Except as provided in paragraph (y)(3)(ii) of 
this section, all shipments of beluga sturgeon specimens, including 
those exempted from threatened species permits under this special rule, 
will require accompanying valid CITES permits and certificates upon 
import, export, or re-export.
    (v) Initial reporting period. Until September 6, 2005, no threatened 
species permits will be required for the import, export, re-export, or 
interstate or foreign commerce of beluga sturgeon caviar and meat that 
originated in the littoral states, in order to provide the littoral 
states time to submit the required documentation. After this 6-month 
period, the exemption from threatened species permits will continue only 
while the Service reviews littoral state compliance with paragraphs 
(y)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section. If this review demonstrates that 
the provisions of this special rule are not met, the Service will 
announce and institute trade restrictions or suspensions in beluga 
sturgeon caviar or meat with one or more littoral states as per 
paragraph (y)(7) of this section.
    (vi) Biennial reports. Littoral state governments wishing to export 
specimens of beluga sturgeon caviar or meat to the United States under 
this special rule must provide to the Service's Division of Scientific 
Authority reports containing the most recent information available on 
the status of the species, following the information guidelines 
specified below. The Service must receive the first report no later than 
December 1, 2005, and every 2 years thereafter on the anniversary of 
that date. Starting in December 2005, and thereafter on a biennial 
basis, the Service will review the national reports within 90 days of 
receiving them and any other pertinent information on wild beluga 
sturgeon conservation. If any elements of the biennial reports are 
missing or unclear, the Service will ask the appropriate littoral states 
to provide additional information within 60 days of the date we contact 
them. If the littoral states fail to respond or fail to submit biennial 
reports by the specified deadline, we will immediately suspend trade 
with the given littoral states (see paragraph (y)(7) of this section for 
details on how such a suspension would be instituted and announced). 
Submission of documents in English may help expedite the Service's 
review. We propose to use these reviews to determine whether littoral 
state management programs are leading to recovery of wild beluga 
sturgeon stocks. For each littoral state, the following information must 
be provided in the biennial reports:
    (A) A description of the specific fishery regulations that affect 
the harvest of Huso huso in the respective littoral state, with any 
changes from the previous report highlighted;
    (B) A description of any revisions to the cooperative management 
program mentioned in paragraph (y)(4)(i) of this section, including any 
new models, assumptions, or equations used to set harvest and export 
quotas;
    (C) New information obtained in the last 2 years on beluga sturgeon 
distribution, stock size, models used for quota-setting, spawning 
activity, habitat use, hatchery programs and results, or other relevant 
subjects;
    (D) A summary of law enforcement activities undertaken in the last 2 
years, and a description of any changes in programs to prevent poaching 
and smuggling, including indicators of their effectiveness;
    (E) A summary of the revenues generated by the commercial 
exploitation of beluga sturgeon in the respective littoral state, and a 
summary of any documented conservation benefits resulting from the 
commercial harvest program in that country (e.g., revenues allocated to 
hatchery and restocking programs or research programs); and
    (F) Export data for the previous two calendar years.
    (5) Can aquacultured beluga sturgeon products be exempt from 
threatened species permits if the products originate outside the 
littoral states? We will consider exemptions from threatened species

[[Page 138]]

permits for beluga caviar and meat obtained from aquaculture facilities 
outside the littoral states. These exemptions will be for individual 
facilities, and would allow aquacultured beluga caviar and meat 
originating from these facilities to be imported, exported, re-exported, 
or traded in interstate and foreign commerce without threatened species 
permits issued under Section 10 of the Act. Aquaculture facilities 
within the United States could also be exempt from prohibitions against 
take for purposes of harvesting caviar or meat (i.e., killing of beluga 
sturgeon), or for conducting activities involving research to enhance 
the survival or propagation of the species. Facilities outside the 
littoral states wishing to obtain such exemptions must submit a written 
request to the Division of Management Authority, Branch of Permits--
International, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, 
Room 700, Arlington, VA 22203, and provide to the Service's Division of 
Scientific Authority, in Room 750 at the same address, information that 
shows, at a minimum, all of the following:
    (i) The facility in question is using best management practices to 
prevent the escape of beluga sturgeon and disease pathogens into local 
ecosystems, as certified by the relevant regulatory agency. In the case 
of the United States, the relevant regulatory authority will be the 
state agency with jurisdiction over aquaculture. In the case of foreign 
aquaculture facilities outside the littoral states, the relevant 
regulatory agency will be the designated CITES Management Authority with 
jurisdiction over sturgeon. Best management practices that affect the 
applicant's facility must be part of the application and available for 
Service review.
    (ii) The facility in question has entered into a formal agreement 
with one or more littoral states to study, protect, or otherwise enhance 
the survival of wild beluga sturgeon. Copies of such agreements must be 
provided.
    (iii) The facility in question does not rely on wild beluga sturgeon 
for broodstock. Proof of broodstock origin, including relevant CITES 
permits that accompanied broodstock specimens upon import into the 
United States, must be part of the application.
    (iv) Exemptions granted under paragraph (y)(5) of this section shall 
not apply to trade (import, export, re-export, or interstate and foreign 
commerce) in live beluga sturgeon, and may be revoked at any time if the 
Service determines that any of the criteria shown in paragraphs 
(y)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section are not met by the facility. 
Applicants will be required to submit biennial reports on their 
compliance with paragraphs (y)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section, 
starting on the second anniversary of any programmatic exemption granted 
to the applicants. These biennial reports must show that exempted 
facilities have actively cooperated with one or more littoral states in 
a meaningful way to support beluga sturgeon conservation. Any beluga 
caviar originating from aquaculture facilities outside the littoral 
states must comply with CITES caviar-labeling requirements, even in 
interstate commerce within the United States. We will publish an 
information notice if the Service grants a programmatic exemption to any 
aquaculture facility outside the littoral states, and announce such 
actions through our website and posting notices at our wildlife ports of 
entry. We will follow the provisions of paragraph (y)(7) of this section 
to announce restrictions or revocations of such programmatic exemptions, 
based on our review of facilities' biennial reports.
    (6) How will the Service inform the public of CITES restrictions on 
trade in beluga sturgeon? We will issue an information bulletin that 
identifies a restriction or suspension of trade in specimens of beluga 
sturgeon and post it on our websites (http://le.fws.gov and http://
international.fws.gov) and at our staffed wildlife ports of entry if any 
criterion in paragraphs (y)(6)(i) or (ii) of this section is met:
    (i) The country is lacking a designated Management Authority or 
Scientific Authority for the issuance of valid CITES documents or their 
equivalent for beluga sturgeon.
    (ii) The country is identified in any action adopted by the CITES 
Conference of the Parties, the CITES

[[Page 139]]

Standing Committee, or in a Notification to the Parties issued by the 
CITES Secretariat as a country from which Parties are asked not to 
accept shipments of specimens of beluga sturgeon or all CITES-listed 
species.
    Note to paragraph (y)(6): A listing of all countries that have not 
designated either a Management Authority or Scientific Authority, or 
that have been identified as countries from which Parties should not 
accept permits, is available by writing to: Division of Management 
Authority, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, Room 
700, Arlington, Virginia 22203.
    (7) How will the Service set trade restrictions or prohibitions 
under the special rule? The Service's Division of Scientific Authority 
will conduct a biennial review of beluga sturgeon conservation based on 
information in the cooperative basin-wide management plans, national 
regulations and laws, and biennial reports (submitted as per paragraph 
(y)(4) of this section, and, for aquaculture facilities, as per 
paragraph (y)(5)(iv) of this section). We will combine that review with 
a review of other relevant information (e.g., scientific literature, law 
enforcement data, government-to-government consultations) to determine 
whether littoral state management programs and aquaculture operations 
are effectively achieving conservation benefits for beluga sturgeon. 
Based on this information, or the failure to obtain it, the Service may 
restrict or prohibit trade from a littoral state, a re-exporting 
intermediary country, or an entire basin (i.e., the Caspian Sea or Black 
Sea) or a specific aquaculture facility outside the littoral states if 
we determine that the conservation or management status of beluga 
sturgeon has been adversely affected and the continued recovery of 
beluga sturgeon may be compromised. The decision to restrict or prohibit 
trade in beluga sturgeon products on a national, basin, or region-wide 
scale will depend on the scope of the problem observed, the magnitude of 
the threat to wild beluga sturgeon, and whether remedial action is 
necessary at a national, basin, or region-wide scale.
    (i) Trade restrictions or suspensions will result basin-wide, for 
specific littoral states, or for non-littoral state aquaculture 
facilities under one or more of the following scenarios:
    (A) Failure to submit any of the reports, legislation, and 
management plans described in paragraph (y)(4) of this section, or 
failure to respond to requests for additional information;
    (B) A change in regional cooperative management that threatens the 
recovery of wild beluga sturgeon;
    (C) A change in littoral state laws or regulations that compromises 
beluga sturgeon recovery or survival in the wild;
    (D) Adoption of scientifically unsound hatchery practices or 
restocking programs for beluga sturgeon;
    (E) A decline in wild Huso huso populations, as documented in 
national reports outlined above or the scientific literature, that goes 
unaddressed by regional or national management programs;
    (F) Failure to address poaching or smuggling in beluga sturgeon, 
their parts, or products in the littoral states or re-exporting 
countries, as documented in national reports described above or other 
law enforcement sources;
    (G) Failure of the littoral states to address the loss of beluga 
sturgeon habitat quality or quantity;
    (H) Failure of the littoral states or re-exporting countries to 
follow the caviar-labeling recommendations of the CITES Parties 
(currently embodied in Resolution Conf. 12.7);
    (I) Recommendations from the CITES Standing Committee to suspend 
trade in beluga sturgeon from one or more countries; or
    (J) An aquaculture facility outside the littoral states has been 
issued a programmatic exemption from threatened species permits under 
paragraph (y)(5) of this section, but is not abiding by the provisions 
of paragraphs (y)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section, or, based on the 
biennial reports required under paragraph (y)(5) of this section, has 
not actively cooperated with one or more littoral states in a meaningful 
way to support beluga sturgeon conservation.
    (K) Any other natural or human-induced phenomenon that threatens the 
survival or recovery of beluga sturgeon.

[[Page 140]]

    (ii) We will publish an information notice in the Federal Register, 
as well as on our Web site and at our wildlife ports of entry, if the 
Service's Division of Scientific Authority administratively suspends or 
restricts trade in beluga sturgeon products after determining that wild 
beluga sturgeon stock status worsens or threats to the species increase. 
This information notice will provide:
    (A) The problem(s) identified in the biennial reports or other 
salient documents.
    (B) The scope of the problem and the number of nations involved.
    (C) The scope of the trade restriction or suspension we are 
imposing, including products covered, duration of the restriction or 
suspension, and criteria for lifting it and reinstating any exemption to 
threatened species permits.
    (D) How the public can provide input, make comments, and recommend 
remedial action to withdraw the trade measures imposed.
    (z) Gila trout (Oncorhynchus gilae).
    (1) Except as noted in paragraph (z)(2) of this section, all 
prohibitions of 50 CFR 17.31 and exemptions of 50 CFR 17.32 apply to the 
Gila trout.
    (i) No person may possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export, by any means whatsoever, any such species taken in 
violation of this section or in violation of applicable fish and 
conservation laws and regulations promulgated by the States of New 
Mexico or Arizona.
    (ii) It is unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, solicit 
another to commit, or cause to be committed any offense listed in 
paragraph (z)(1)(i) of this section.
    (2) In the following instances you may take Gila trout in accordance 
with applicable State fish and wildlife conservation laws and 
regulations to protect this species in the States of New Mexico or 
Arizona:
    (i) Fishing activities authorized under New Mexico or Arizona laws 
and regulations; and
    (ii) Educational purposes, scientific purposes, the enhancement of 
propagation or survival of the species, zoological exhibition, and other 
conservation purposes consistent with the Endangered Species Act.
    (3) The four relict populations of Gila trout (Main Diamond Creek, 
South Diamond Creek, Spruce Creek, and Whiskey Creek) will not be opened 
to fishing.
    (4) Any changes to State recreational fishing regulations will be 
made by the States in collaboration with the Service.
    (5) Any violation of State applicable fish and wildlife conservation 
laws or regulations with respect to the taking of this species is also a 
violation of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended.

Sec.  17.50  General.

    (a) Whenever a species which is not Endangered or Threatened closely 
resembles an Endangered or Threatened species, such species may be 
treated as either Endangered or Threatened if the director makes such 
determination in accordance with section 4(e) of the Act and the 
criteria of paragraph (b) of this

[[Page 141]]

section. After the Director has made such determination in accordance 
with the notification procedures specified in the Act, such species 
shall appear in the list in Sec.  17.11 (Wildlife) or Sec.  17.12 
(Plants) with the notation ``(S/A)'' (similarity of appearance) in the 
``Status'' column, following either a letter ``E'' or a letter ``T'' to 
indicate whether the species is being treated as Endangered or 
Threatened.
    (b) In determining whether to treat a species as Endangered or 
Threatened due to similarity of appearance, the Director shall consider 
the criteria in section 4(e) of the Act, as indicated below:
    (1) The degree of difficulty enforcement personnel would have in 
distinguishing the species, at the point in question, from an Endangered 
or Threatened species (including those cases where the criteria for 
recognition of a species are based on geographical boundaries);
    (2) The additional threat posed to the Endangered or Threatened 
species by the loss of control occasioned because of the similarity of 
appearance; and
    (3) The probability that so designating a similar species will 
substantially facilitate enforcement and further the purposes and policy 
of the Act.

    Example 1. The ABC sparrow is Endangered wildlife. The ABD sparrow 
is a subspecies that is so similar to the ABC sparrow that when found 
outside their normal habitat, the two cannot readily be distinguished by 
law enforcement personnel. The ABD sparrow is listed in Sec.  17.11, 
after following the proper procedures as follows:

    Example 3. The XY cactus has been determined to be an Endangered 
species. The XZ cactus so closely resembles the XY cactus that 
enforcement personnel cannot distinguish between the two. The Endangered 
XY cactus could be illegally sold as the non-endangered XZ species, thus 
posing an additional threat to the Endangered species. After following 
the proper procedures, the XZ cactus would be placed on the list and

would cause if the permit were denied;
    (5) Where applicable, the portion of the applicant's income which 
would be lost if the permit were denied, and the relationship of that 
portion to the balance of his income.
    (c) Permit conditions. In addition to the general conditions set 
forth in part 13 of this subchapter, every permit issued under this 
section may be subject to any of the following special conditions:
    (1) If requested, the permittee shall submit to the Director a 
written report

[[Page 147]]

of the activities authorized by the permit. Such report must be 
postmarked by the date specified in the permit or otherwise requested by

section will apply. The special rule will contain all the applicable 
prohibitions and exceptions. If indicated by special rule, the exception 
for seeds in paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to the 
threatened species.

Sec.  17.72  Permits--general.

    Upon receipt of a complete application, the Director may issue a 
permit authorizing any activity otherwise prohibited with regard to 
threatened plants. The permit shall be governed by the provisions of 
this section unless a special rule applicable to the plant is provided 
in Sec. Sec.  17.73 to 17.78. A permit issued under this section must be 
for one of the following: scientific purposes, the enhancement of the 
propagation or survival of threatened species, economic hardship, 
botanical or horticultural exhibition, educational purposes, or other 
activities consistent with the purposes and policy of the Act. Such a 
permit may authorize a single transaction, a series of transactions, or 
a number of activities over a specified period of time.
    (a) Application requirements. A person wishing to get a permit for 
an activity prohibited by Sec.  17.71 submits an application to conduct 
activities under this paragraph. For interstate commerce activities the 
seller gets the permit for plants coming from cultivated stock and the 
buyer gets the permit if the plants are taken from the wild. The Service 
provides Form 3-200 for the application or you may submit the general 
information and certification required by Sec.  13.12(a) of this 
subchapter. Application requirements differ for permits issued for 
plants taken from the wild (excluding seeds), seeds and cultivated 
plants, or herbarium specimens. You must attach the following 
information and any other information requested by the Director.
    (1) For activities involving plants obtained from the wild 
(excluding seeds), provide the following information:
    (i) The scientific names of the plants sought to be covered by the 
permit;
    (ii) The estimated number of specimens sought to be covered by the 
permit;

[[Page 148]]

    (iii) The year, country, and approximate place where taking occurred 
or will occur;
    (iv) If the activities would involve removal and reduction to 
possession of a plant from an area under Federal jurisdiction, the year, 
State, county or any other description such as place name, township, and 
range designation that will precisely place the location where the 
proposed removal and reduction to possession will occur, the name of the 
Federal entity having jurisdiction over the area and the name, title, 
address, and phone number of the person in charge of the area.
    (v) A brief description of the applicant's expertise and facilities 
as related to the proposed activity;
    (vi) A justification of the activities sought to be authorized by 
the permit and the relationship of such activities to scientific 
purposes, enhancing the propagation or survival of the species, or other 
objectives consistent with the purposes and policy of the Act; and
    (vii) A statement of the applicant's willingness to participate in a 
cooperative propagation program, and to maintain or contribute data 
relating to such efforts.
    (2) For activities involving seeds obtained from the wild and 
cultivated plants, provide the following information:
    (i) The scientific names of the plants sought to be covered by the 
permit;
    (ii) A statement of the applicant's willingness to participate in a 
cooperative propagation program, and to maintain or contribute data 
relating to the success of such efforts; and
    (iii) A justification of the activities sought to be authorized by 
the permit and the relationship of such activities to scientific 
purposes, enhancing the propagation or survival of the species, or other 
objectives consistent with the purposes and policy of the Act.
    (iv) If the activities would involve removal and reduction to 
possession of seeds from an area under Federal jurisdiction, the year, 
State, county, or any other description such as place name, township, 
and range designation that will precisely place the location where the 
proposed removal and reduction to possession will occur, the name of the 
Federal entity having jurisdiction over the area and the name, title, 
address, and phone number of the person in charge of the area.
    (3) For importation or exportation involving the non-commercial 
loan, exchange or donation of herbarium or other preserved, dried or 
embedded museum specimens of all threatened species between scientists 
or scientific institutions, provide the following information:
    (i) The name and address of the institution or other facility where 
the plants sought to be covered by the permit will be used or 
maintained; and
    (ii) A justification of the activities sought to be authorized by 
the permit and the relationship of such activities to scientific 
purposes, enhancing the propagation or survival of the species, or other 
objectives consistent with the purposes and policy of the Act.
    (4) When the activity applied for involves a species also regulated 
by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild 
Fauna and Flora, additional requirements of Sec.  23.15(c) of this 
subchapter must be met. For your convenience, Sec.  23.15(c) is repeated 
here.

    Application requirements for permits or certificates to import, 
export or re-export wildlife or plants listed in Appendix I, II or III 
that are not subject to the regulations in part 17 or part 18 of this 
subchapter. Any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States 
who wishes to get such a permit or certificate submits an application 
under this section to the Director, Fish and Wildlife Service 
(Attention: Office of Management Authority), 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, Room 
700, Arlington, VA 22203. The Service provides Form 3-200 for the 
application to which as much of the following information relating to 
the purpose of the permit or certificate must be attached:
    (1) The scientific and common names of the species (or taxa to the 
rank listed in Appendix I, II, or III) sought to be covered by the 
permit, the number of wildlife or plants, and the activity sought to be 
authorized (such as importing, exporting, re-exporting, etc.);
    (2) A statement as to whether the wildlife or plant, at the time of 
application, (i) is living in the wild, (ii) is living, but not in the 
wild, or (iii) is dead;
    (3) A description of the wildlife or plant, including (i) size, (ii) 
sex (if known), and (iii) type of goods, if it is a part or derivative;

live plant material to be imported, exported, or re-exported as a 
noncommercial loan, donation, or exchange between scientists or 
scientific institutions.

    (b) Issuance criteria. Upon receiving an application completed in 
accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the Director will decide 
whether or not a permit should be issued. In making his decision, the 
Director shall consider, in addition to the general criteria in Sec.  
13.21(b) of this subchapter, the following factors:
    (1) Whether the purpose for which the permit is requested will 
enhance the survival of the species in the wild;
    (2) Whether the purpose for which the permit is requested will 
enhance the propagation of the species;
    (3) The opinions or views of scientists or other persons or 
organizations having expertise concerning the plant or other matters 
germane to the application; and
    (4) Whether the expertise, facilities, or other resources available 
to the applicant appear adequate to successfully accomplish the 
objectives stated in the application.

forth in part 13 of this subchapter, every permit issued under this 
section shall be subject to the following special conditions:
    (1) If requested, the permittee shall submit to the Director a 
written report of the activities authorized by the permit. Such report 
must be postmarked by the date specified in the permit or otherwise 
requested by the Director.
    (2) A copy of the permit or an identification label, which includes 
the scientific name, the permit number, and a statement that the plant 
is of ``wild orgin'' or ``cultivated origin'' must accompany the plant 
or its container during the course of any activity subject to these 
regulations, unless the specimens meet the special conditions referred 
to in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

                   Subpart H_Experimental Populations

    Source: 49 FR 33893, Aug. 27, 1984, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec.  17.80  Definitions.

    (a) The term experimental population means an introduced and/or 
designated population (including any off-spring arising solely 
therefrom) that has been so designated in accordance with the procedures 
of this subpart but only when, and at such times as the population is 
wholly separate geographically from nonexperimental populations of the 
same species. Where part of an experimental population overlaps with 
natural populations of the same species on a particular occasion, but is 
wholly separate at other times, specimens of the experimental population 
will not be recognized as such while in the area of overlap. That is, 
experimental status will only be recognized outside the areas of 
overlap. Thus, such a population shall be treated as experimental only 
when the times of geographic separation are reasonably predictable; 
e.g., fixed migration patterns, natural or man-made barriers. A 
population is not treated as experimental if total separation will occur 
solely as a result of random and unpredictable events.
    (b) The term essential experimental population means an experimental 
population whose loss would be likely to appreciably reduce the 
likelihood of the survival of the species in the wild. All other 
experimental populations are to be classified as nonessential.


<R05>
Sec.  17.81  Listing.

    (a) The Secretary may designate as an experimental population a 
population of endangered or threatened species that has been or will be 
released into suitable natural habitat outside the species' current 
natural range (but within its probable historic range, absent a finding 
by the Director in the extreme case that the primary habitat of the 
species has been unsuitably and irreversibly altered or destroyed), 
subject to the further conditions specified in this section; provided, 
that all designations of experimental populations must proceed by 
regulation adopted in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553 and the requirements 
of this subpart.
    (b) Before authorizing the release as an experimental population of 
any population (including eggs, propagules, or individuals) of an 
endangered or threatened species, and before authorizing any necessary 
transportation to conduct the release, the Secretary must find by 
regulation that such release will further the conservation of the 
species. In making such a finding the Secretary shall utilize the best 
scientific and commercial data available to consider:
    (1) Any possible adverse effects on extant populations of a species 
as a result of removal of individuals, eggs, or propagules for 
introduction elsewhere;
    (2) The likelihood that any such experimental population will become 
established and survive in the foreseeable future;
    (3) The relative effects that establishment of an experimental 
population will have on the recovery of the species; and
    (4) The extent to which the introduced population may be affected by 
existing or anticipated Federal or State actions or private activities 
within or adjacent to the experimental population area.

The Secretary may issue a permit under section 10(a)(1)(A) of the Act, 
if appropriate under the standards set out in subsections 10(d) and (j) 
of the Act, to allow acts necessary for the establishment and 
maintenance of an experimental population.
    (c) Any regulation promulgated under paragraph (a) of this section 
shall provide:
    (1) Appropriate means to identify the experimental population, 
including, but not limited to, its actual or proposed location, actual 
or anticipated migration, number of specimens released or to be 
released, and other criteria appropriate to identify the experimental 
population(s);
    (2) A finding, based solely on the best scientific and commercial 
data available, and the supporting factual basis,

[[Page 151]]

on whether the experimental population is, or is not, essential to the 
continued existence of the species in the wild;
    (3) Management restrictions, protective measures, or other special 
management concerns of that population, which may include but are not 
limited to, measures to isolate and/or contain the experimental 
population designated in the regulation from natural populations; and
    (4) A process for periodic review and evaluation of the success or 
failure of the release and the effect of the release on the conservation 
and recovery of the species.
    (d) The Fish and Wildlife Service shall consult with appropriate 
State fish and wildlife agencies, local governmental entities, affected 
Federal agencies, and affected private landowners in developing and 
implementing experimental population rules. When appropriate, a public 
meeting will be conducted with interested members of the public. Any 
regulation promulgated pursuant to this section shall, to the maximum 
extent practicable, represent an agreement between the Fish and Wildlife 
Service, the affected State and Federal agencies and persons holding any 
interest in land which may be affected by the establishment of an 
experimental population.
    (e) Any population of an endangered species or a threatened species 
determined by the Secretary to be an experimental population in 
accordance with this subpart shall be identified by special rule in 
Sec. Sec.  17.84-17.86 as appropriate and separately listed in Sec.  
17.11(h) (wildlife) or Sec.  17.12(h) (plants) as appropriate.
    (f) The Secretary may designate critical habitat as defined in 
section (3)(5)(A) of the Act for an essential experimental population as 
determined pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Any designation 
of critical habitat for an essential experimental population will be 
made in accordance with section 4 of the Act. No designation of critical 
habitat will be made for nonessential populations. In those situations 
where a portion or all of an essential experimental population overlaps 
with a natural population of the species during certain periods of the 
year, no critical habitat shall be designated for the area of overlap 
unless implemented as a revision to critical habitat of the natural 
population for reasons unrelated to the overlap itself.


<R05>
Sec.  17.82  Prohibitions.

    Any population determined by the Secretary to be an experimental 
population shall be treated as if it were listed as a threatened species 
for purposes of establishing protective regulations under section 4(d) 
of the Act with respect to such population. The Special rules 
(protective regulations) adopted for an experimental population under 
Sec.  17.81 will contain applicable prohibitions, as appropriate, and 
exceptions for that population.


<R05>
Sec.  17.83  Interagency cooperation.

    (a) Any experimental population designated for a listed species (1) 
determined pursuant to Sec.  17.81(c)(2) of this subpart not to be 
essential to the survival of that species and (2) not occurring within 
the National Park System or the National Wildlife Refuge System, shall 
be treated for purposes of section 7 (other than subsection (a)(1) 
thereof) as a species proposed to be listed under the Act as a 
threatened species.
    (b) Any experimental population designated for a listed species that 
either (1) has been determined pursuant to Sec.  17.81(c)(2) of this 
subpart to be essential to the survival of that species, of (2) occurs 
within the National Park System or the National Wildlife Refuge System 
as now or hereafter constituted, shall be treated for purposes of 
section 7 of the Act as a threatened species. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, any biological opinion prepared pursuant to section 7(b) of 
the Act and any agency determination made pursuant to section 7(a) of 
the Act shall consider any experimental and nonexperimental populations 
to constitute a single listed species for the purposes of conducting the 
analyses under such sections.


<R05>
Sec.  17.84  Special rules--vertebrates.

    (a) Delmarva Peninsula fox squirrel (Sciurus niger cinereus). (1) 
The Delmarva Peninsula fox squirrel population identified in paragraph 
(a)(6) of

[[Page 152]]

this section is a nonessential experimental population.
    (2) No person shall take this species, except:
    (i) For educational purposes, scientific purposes, the enhancement 
of propagation or survival of the species, zoological exhibition, and 
other conservation purposes consistent with the Act and in accordance 
with applicable State fish and wildlife conservation laws and 
regulations; or
    (ii) Incidental to recreational activities.
    (3) Any violation of applicable State fish and wildlife conservation 
laws or regulations with respect to the taking of this species (other 
than incidental taking as described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this 
section) will also be a violation of the Endangered Species Act.
    (4) No person shall possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever, any such species taken in 
violation of these regulations or in violation of applicable State fish 
and wildlife laws or regulations or the Endangered Species Act.
    (5) It is unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, solicit 
another to commit, or cause to be committed, any offense defined in 
paragraph (a)(2) or (4) of this section.
    (6) The site for reintroduction of Delmarva Peninsula fox squirrel 
is totally isolated from existing populations of this species. The 
nearest extant population is in the Chincoteague National Wildlife 
Refuge approximately 50 miles from the reintroduction site. The 
reintroduction site is within the historic range of this species and is 
located at the Assawoman Wildlife Area, Sussex County, Delaware. 
Observation of previous releases have shown that fox squirrels have not 
traveled more than 2 or 3 miles from release sites, therefore, the 
possibility of this population contacting extant wild populations is 
unlikely.
    (7) The reintroduced population will be checked periodically to 
determine its condition and the success of the reintroduction. Of 
special concern will be the establishment of breeding pairs and the 
reproductive success of the population. The movement patterns of the 
released individuals and the overall health of the population will also 
be observed.
    (b) Colorado squawfish (Ptychocheilus lucius) and woundfin 
(Plagopterus argentissimus). (1) The Colorado squawfish and woundfin 
populations identified in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, are 
experimental, nonessential populations.
    (2) No person shall take the species, except in accordance with 
applicable State or Tribal fish and wildlife conservation laws and 
regulations in the following instances:
    (i) For educational purposes, scientific purposes, the enhancement 
of propagation or survival of the species, zoological exhibition, and 
other conservation purposes consistent with the Act; or
    (ii) Incidental to otherwise lawful activities, provided that the 
individual fish taken, if still alive, is immediately returned to its 
habitat.
    (3) Any violation of applicable State or Tribal fish and wildlife 
conservation laws or regulations with respect to the taking of this 
species (other than incidental taking as described in paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii) of this section) will also be a violation of the Endangered 
Species Act.
    (4) No person shall possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export, by any means whatsoever, any such species taken in 
violation of these regulations or in violation of applicable State or 
Tribal fish and wildlife laws or regulations.
    (5) It is unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, solicit 
another to commit, or cause to be committed, any offense defined in 
paragraphs (b) (2) through (4) of this section.
    (6) All of the sites for reintroduction of Colorado squawfish and 
woundfin are totally isolated from existing populations of these 
species. The nearest population of Colorado squawfish is above Lake 
Powell in the Green and Colorado Rivers, an upstream distance of at 
least 800 miles including 6 mainstream dams, and 200 miles of dry 
riverbed. Woundfin are similarly isolated (450 miles distant, 200 miles 
of dry streambed and 5 mainstream dams). All reintroduction sites are 
within the probable historic range of these species and are as follows:


[[Page 153]]



                           Colorado Squawfish

    (i) Arizona: Gila County. Salt River from Roosevelt Dam upstream to 
U.S Highway 60 bridge.
    (ii) Arizona: Gila and Yavapai Counties. Verde River from Horseshoe 
Dam upstream to Perkinsville.
    The lower segments of large streams which flow into these two 
sections of river may, from time to time, be inhabited by Colorado 
squawfish. Downstream movement of squawfish in these areas will be 
restricted by dams and upstream movement is limited by lack of suitable 
habitat.

                                Woundfin

    (i) Arizona: Gila and Yavapai Counties. Verde River from backwaters 
of Horseshoe Reservoir upstream to Perkinsville.
    (ii) Arizona: Graham and Greenlee Counties. Gila River from 
backwaters of San Carlos Reservoir upstream to Arizona/New Mexico State 
line.
    (iii) Arizona: Greenlee County. San Francisco River from its 
junction with the Gila River upstream to the Arizona/New Mexico State 
line.
    (iv) Arizona: Gila County. Tonto Creek, from Punkin Center upstream 
to Gisela.
    (v) Arizona: Yavapai County. Hassayampa River, from Red Cliff 
upstream to Wagoner.
    The movement of woundfin beyond these areas will be limited to the 
lower portion of larger tributaries where suitable habitat exists. 
Downstream movement is limited by dams, reservoirs, and dry streambed. 
Upstream movement from these areas is restricted due to the absence of 
habitat. Upstream areas are too cold and the gradient is too steep to 
support populations of woundfin.

    (7) The reintroduced populations will be checked annually to 
determine their condition. A seining survey will be used to determine 
population expansion or contraction, reproduction success, and general 
health condition of the fish.
    (c) Red wolf (Canis rufus). (1) The red wolf populations identified 
in paragraphs (c)(9)(i) and (c)(9)(ii) of this section are nonessential 
experimental populations.
    (2) No person may take this species, except as provided in 
paragraphs (c)(3) through (5) and (10) of this section.
    (3) Any person with a valid permit issued by the Service under Sec.  
17.32 may take red wolves for educational purposes, scientific purposes, 
the enhancement of propagation or survival of the species, zoological 
exhibition, and other conservation purposes consistent with the Act and 
in accordance with applicable State fish and wildlife conservation laws 
and regulations;
    (4)(i) Any person may take red wolves found on private land in the 
areas defined in paragraphs (c)(9) (i) and (ii) of this section, 
Provided that such taking is not intentional or willful, or is in 
defense of that person's own life or the lives of others; and that such 
taking is reported within 24 hours to the refuge manager (for the red 
wolf population defined in paragraph (c)(9)(i) of this section), the 
Park superintendent (for the red wolf population defined in paragraph 
(c)(9)(ii) of this section), or the State wildlife enforcement officer 
for investigation.
    (ii) Any person may take red wolves found on lands owned or managed 
by Federal, State, or local government agencies in the areas defined in 
paragraphs (c)(9) (i) and (ii) of this section, Provided that such 
taking is incidental to lawful activities, is unavoidable, 
unintentional, and not exhibiting a lack of reasonable due care, or is 
in defense of that person's own life or the lives of others, and that 
such taking is reported within 24 hours to the refuge manager (for the 
red wolf population defined in paragraph (c)(9)(i) of this section), the 
Park superintendent (for the red wolf population defined in paragraph 
(c)(9)(ii) of this section), or the State wildlife enforcement officer 
for investigation.
    (iii) Any private landowner, or any other individual having his or 
her permission, may take red wolves found on his or her property in the 
areas defined in paragraphs (c)(9) (i) and (ii) of this section when the 
wolves are in the act of killing livestock or pets, Provided that 
freshly wounded or killed livestock or pets are evident and that all 
such taking shall be reported within 24 hours to the refuge manager (for 
the red wolf population defined in paragraph (c)(9)(i) of this section), 
the Park superintendent (for the red wolf population defined in 
paragraph (c)(9)(ii) of this section), or the State wildlife enforcement 
officer for investigation.
    (iv) Any private landowner, or any other individual having his or 
her permission, may harass red wolves found on his or her property in 
the areas defined in paragraphs (c)(9) (i) and (ii) of

[[Page 154]]

this section, Provided that all such harassment is by methods that are 
not lethal or physically injurious to the red wolf and is reported 
within 24 hours to the refuge manager (for the red wolf population 
defined in paragraph (c)(9)(i) of this section), the Park superintendent 
(for the red wolf population defined in paragraph (c)(9)(ii) of this 
section), or the State wildlife enforcement officer, as noted in 
paragraph (c)(6) of this section for investigation.
    (v) Any private landowner may take red wolves found on his or her 
property in the areas defined in paragraphs (c)(9) (i) and (ii) of this 
section after efforts by project personnel to capture such animals have 
been abandoned, Provided that the Service project leader or biologist 
has approved such actions in writing and all such taking shall be 
reported within 24 hours to the Service project leader or biologist, the 
refuge manager (for the red wolf population defined in paragraph 
(c)(9)(i) of this section), the Park superintendent (for the red wolf 
population defined in paragraph (c)(9)(ii) of this section), or the 
State wildlife enforcement officer for investigation.
    (vi) The provisions of paragraphs (4) (i) through (v) of this 
section apply to red wolves found in areas outside the areas defined in 
paragraphs (c)(9) (i) and (ii) of this section, with the exception that 
reporting of taking or harassment to the refuge manager, Park 
superintendent, or State wildlife enforcement officer, while encouraged, 
is not required.
    (5) Any employee or agent of the Service or State conservation 
agency who is designated for such purposes, when acting in the course of 
official duties, may take a red wolf if such action is necessary to:
    (i) Aid a sick, injured, or orphaned specimen;
    (ii) Dispose of a dead specimen, or salvage a dead specimen which 
may be useful for scientific study;
    (iii) Take an animal that constitutes a demonstrable but non-
immediate threat to human safety or that is responsible for depredations 
to lawfully present domestic animals or other personal property, if it 
has not been possible to otherwise eliminate such depredation or loss of 
personal property, Provided That such taking must be done in a humane 
manner, and may involve killing or injuring the animal only if it has 
not been possible to eliminate such threat by live capturing and 
releasing the specimen unharmed on the refuge or Park;
    (iv) Move an animal for genetic purposes.
    (6) Any taking pursuant to paragraphs (c) (3) through (5) of this 
section must be immediately reported to either the Refuge Manager, 
Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge, Manteo, North Carolina, 
telephone 919/473-1131, or the Superintendent, Great Smoky Mountains 
National Park, Gatlinburg, Tennessee, telephone 615/436-1294. Either of 
these persons will determine disposition of any live or dead specimens.
    (7) No person shall possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever, any such species taken in 
violation of these regulations or in violation of applicable State fish 
and wildlife laws or regulations or the Endangered Species Act.
    (8) It is unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, solicit 
another to commit, or cause to be committed, any offense defined in 
paragraphs (c) (2) through (7) of this section.
    (9)(i) The Alligator River reintroduction site is within the 
historic range of the species in North Carolina, in Dare, Hyde, Tyrrell, 
and Washington Counties; because of its proximity and potential 
conservation value, Beaufort County is also included in the experimental 
population designation.
    (ii) The red wolf also historically occurred on lands that now 
comprise the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The Park encompasses 
properties within Haywood and Swain Counties in North Carolina, and 
Blount, Cocke, and Sevier Counties in Tennessee. Graham, Jackson, and 
Madison Counties in North Carolina, and Monroe County in Tennessee, are 
also included in the experimental designation because of the close 
proximity of these counties to the Park boundary.
    (iii) Except for the three island propagation projects and these 
small reintroduced populations, the red wolf is extirpated from the 
wild. Therefore,

[[Page 155]]

there are no other extant populations with which the refuge or Park 
experimental populations could come into contact.
    (10) The reintroduced populations will be monitored closely for the 
duration of the project, generally using radio telemetry as appropriate. 
All animals released or captured will be vaccinated against diseases 
prevalent in canids prior to release. Any animal that is determined to 
be in need of special care or that moves onto lands where the landowner 
requests their removal will be recaptured, if possible, by Service and/
or Park Service and/or designated State wildlife agency personnel and 
will be given appropriate care. Such animals will be released back into 
the wild as soon as possible, unless physical or behavioral problems 
make it necessary to return the animals to a captive-breeding facility.
    (11) The status of the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge 
project will be reevaluated by October 1, 1992, to determine future 
management status and needs. This review will take into account the 
reproductive success of the mated pairs, movement patterns of individual 
animals, food habits, and overall health of the population. The duration 
of the first phase of the Park project is estimated to be 10 to 12 
months. After that period, an assessment of the reintroduction potential 
of the Park for red wolves will be made. If a second phase of 
reintroduction is attempted, the duration of that phase will be better 
defined during the assessment. However, it is presently thought that a 
second phase would last for 3 years, after which time the red wolf would 
be treated as a resident species within the Park. Throughout these 
periods, the experimental and nonessential designation of the animals 
will remain in effect.
    (d) Southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis). (1) Definitions. The 
definitions set out in Sec.  17.3 apply to this paragraph (d). For 
purposes of this paragraph--
    (i) The term defense-related agency action means an agency action 
proposed to be carried out directly by a military department, which does 
not have as its intended purpose the taking of southern sea otters. For 
purposes of this definition, the United States Coast Guard is not a 
military department.
    (ii) The term management zone means that area delineated in 
paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section which surrounds the translocation 
zone and separates the translocation zone from the existing range of the 
parent population and adjacent range where expansion of the parent 
population is necessary for the recovery of southern sea otters.
    (iii) The term member of the experimental population of southern sea 
otters includes any southern sea otter, alive or dead, found within the 
translocation zone or the management zone, and any part or product of 
any such southern sea otter.
    (iv) The term parent population means the population of southern sea 
otters existing along the central California coast north of the 
management zone.
    (v) The term translocation zone means the area delineated in 
paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section within which an experimental 
population of southern sea otters is released and contained.
    (vi) The term established experimental population of southern sea 
otters means a translocated population that meets the following 
criteria: An estimated combined minimum of 150 healthy male and female 
sea otters residing within the translocation zone, little or no 
emigration into the management zone occurring, and a minimum annual 
recruitment to the experimental population in the translocation zone of 
20 sea otters for at least 3 years of the latest 5-year period, or 
replacement yield sufficient to maintain the experimental population at 
or near carrying capacity during the post-establishment and growth phase 
or carrying capacity phase of the experimental population.
    (vii) The term stabilized population is a population of sea otters 
within the translocation zone at the conclusion of the movement of 
animals from the parent population, except for purposes of genetic 
enhancement, which (A) is equal to or greater than the number of otters 
that were released from the holding pens alive and healthy, or 70 
otters, whichever is less, and (B) is exhibiting growth. A stabilized 
population would represent the point at which the experimental 
population shifts from the transplant stage to the

[[Page 156]]

initial growth and reestablishment stage.
    (viii) The term carrying capacity means the ecological state in 
which the numbers of sea otters within the translocation zone remain 
relatively constant and in balance with the available food supply.
    (2) Description of experimental population. The experimental 
population of southern sea otters shall include all southern sea otters 
found within the translocation zone or the management zone. The Service 
will translocate no more than 70 southern sea otters during the first 
year, supplemented as necessary with up to 70 otters per year in 
subsequent years from the parent population to the translocation zone. 
Although a maximum of 250 southern sea otters may be moved from the 
parent population in order to establish the experimental population in 
the translocation zone, it is not likely that supplemental translocation 
after the initial 70 will involve more than small numbers of southern 
sea otters, although under this plan a maximum of 70 could be moved if 
needed in each year up to a total of 250. The majority of animals 
translocated each year will be weaned, immature sea otters with a sex 
ratio of about 4 to 1, females to males. Of the adult sea otters 
selected for translocation, approximately 3 out of every 4 animals will 
be female.
    (3) Translocation process--(i) Capture. Capture locations will be 
selected primarily from the southern third of the range of the parent 
population. Sea otters will be captured using diver-held devices, dip 
nets, surface entangling nets, or other methods which may be proven to 
be safe and effective in the future. All captured otters will be tagged 
and examined by a veterinarian experienced in treating marine mammals.
    (ii) Transport. All animals to be translocated will be transported 
directly to the translocation zone or held in specially constructed 
holding facilities prior to their movement to the translocation zone. 
Access to and care of animals will be restricted to Federal and State 
personnel and designated agents directly involved with the 
translocation. Each captured animal will be placed in a carrying cage 
and transported by truck to the local airport, from which point they 
will be flown to the translocation zone. From there they will be trucked 
to the release site.
    (iii) Release. The animals will be released directly into the wild 
from their transport cages, or held for up to 5 days in secured floating 
pens at the release site. No more than 10 individuals will be held in 
any pen, and adult males will be held separately. When held in floating 
pens the animals will be released passively by opening the floating pens 
and allowing animals to leave at will.
    (iv) Monitoring. Monitoring will be conducted on both the parent 
population and the experimental population by State and Federal 
biologists and their designated agents. Monitoring the parent population 
will be done to determine the effects of removal of otters on the growth 
and range expansion or recession of the parent population. Monitoring of 
the parent population will continue at least through the translocation 
period and into the foreseeable future. Monitoring of the experimental 
population will begin with the first release of translocated otters and 
will continue at least until either the new population reaches the 
carrying capacity of the habitat and establishes an equilibrium density 
or the translocation is determined to have failed. Monitoring will 
include intensive studies of changes in key components of the nearshore 
ecosystem of the translocation zone including benthic organisms, kelp 
and finfish. Monitoring, using ground and aerial observations, will also 
include intensive observation and documentation of the movements, 
distribution, foraging and reproductive behavior, dispersal tendencies, 
growth and reproductive rates, prey selection, and social interactions 
of sea otters in the experimental population. Results of monitoring the 
experimental population and the parent population will also be compared 
and evaluated.
    (v) Protection. At least two law enforcement officers will be 
specifically assigned, at least for the initial three- to five-year 
period after the actual translocation of animals, to conduct patrols and 
prevent illegal taking of

[[Page 157]]

southern sea otters in the translocation zone. Cooperative enforcement 
arrangements will be developed with other agencies having law 
enforcement activities in the area such as the U.S. Coast Guard, 
National Marine Fisheries Service, California Department of Fish and 
Game, U.S. Navy, and National Park Service to assist with protecting the 
experimental population.
    (4) Translocation zone. (i) There is established a translocation 
zone for southern sea otters comprised of San Nicolas Island, Begg Rock, 
and the surrounding waters within the following coordinates:

                        N. Latitude/W. Longitude

33[deg]27.8[min]/119[deg]34.3[min]
33[deg]20.5[min]/119[deg]15.5[min]
33[deg]13.5[min]/119[deg]11.8[min]
33[deg]06.5[min]/119[deg]15.3[min]
33[deg]02.8[min]/119[deg]26.8[min]
33[deg]08.8[min]/119[deg]46.3[min]
33[deg]17.2[min]/119[deg]56.9[min]

    (ii) A map depicting the translocation zone is set forth below:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN91.002
    
    (iii) Prohibitions. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4)(iv), all 
of the provisions in Sec.  17.21 (a) through (f) shall

[[Page 158]]

apply to any member of the experimental population of southern sea 
otters within the translocation zone.
    (iv) Exceptions. The prohibitions of paragraph (d)(4)(iii) shall not 
apply to:
    (A) Any act by the Service, the California Department of Fish and 
Game, or an authorized agent of the Service or the California Department 
of Fish and Game that is necessary to effect the relocation or 
management of any southern sea otter under the provisions of this 
paragraph;
    (B) Any taking of a member of the experimental population of 
southern sea otters that is incidental to, and not the purpose of, the 
carrying out of a defense-related agency action as defined in paragraph 
(d)(1)(i) of this section; or
    (C) Any act authorized by a permit issued under Sec.  17.32.
    (5) Management zone. (i) There is established a management zone for 
southern sea otters comprised of all waters, islands, islets, and land 
areas seaward of mean high tide subject to the jurisdiction of the 
United States located south of Point Conception, California 
(34[deg]26.9[min] N. Latitude), except for any area within the 
translocation zone delineated in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section.
    (ii) A map depicting the management zone is set forth in paragraph 
(d)(4)(ii) of this section.
    (iii) Prohibitions. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(5)(iv), all 
of the provisions in Sec.  17.21 (a) through (f) shall apply to any 
member of the experimental population of southern sea otters within the 
management zone.
    (iv) Exceptions. The prohibitions of paragraph (d)(5)(iii) shall not 
apply to:
    (A) Any act by the Service, the California Department of Fish and 
Game, or an authorized agent of the Service or the California Department 
of Fish and Game that is necessary to effect the relocation or 
management of any southern sea otter under the provisions of this 
paragraph;
    (B) Any taking of a member of the experimental population of 
southern sea otters that is incidental to, and not the purpose of, the 
carrying out of an otherwise lawful activity within the management zone 
delineated in paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section; or
    (C) Any act authorized by a permit issued under Sec.  17.32.
    (6) Containment. The following containment measures, listed in order 
of preference, will be employed to prevent significant emigration of 
southern sea otters from San Nicolas Island and occupation of habitat 
within the management zone:
    (i) Capture of animals within the management zone for return to the 
experimental population or to the range of the parent population using 
non-lethal means. If verified sightings of one or more sea otters are 
made at any location within the management zone, field crews will be 
mobilized as soon as weather and sea conditions permit, to capture and 
remove the otter(s) from the zone. Capture will be done by experienced 
State and/or Federal personnel or other designated agents, using one or 
more of the same techniques used in the translocation effort, such as 
diver-held devices; surface entangling nets; dip nets; or other 
effective methods which may be developed for capturing sea otters in the 
future. Animals either will be flown or moved by air-conditioned van to 
the release site.
    (ii) Artificial reduction of fecundity for some sea otters within 
the experimental population. [Reserved]
    (iii) Selective or random, non-lethal removal of members of the 
experimental population within the translocation zone. [Reserved]

Containment measures will be administered by the Fish and Wildlife 
Service's Office of Sea Otter Management and Coordination (OSOMC), in 
consultation and cooperation with the California Department of Fish and 
Game. The OSOMC will work closely with State biologists to remove otters 
from the management zone. Federal funding received through the normal 
appropriations process will be used for research, protection, and 
containment of the experimental population. Grants to the State of 
California under 16 U.S.C. 1535, may be employed to facilitate the 
measures outlined above. Public donations for management and containment 
of the experimental population will be accepted with assistance from the 
National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.

    (7) Effects of translocation on recovery and interagency 
cooperation--(i) Background. The Recovery Plan specifically describes 
the importance of translocation to the delisting of the southern sea 
otter under the Endangered Species Act. The Plan states:

    Sea otter translocation, if properly designed and implemented, 
should provide the necessary foundation for ultimately obtaining the 
Recovery Plan's objective and restoring the southern sea otter to a non-
threatened status and maintaining OSP by: (i) Establishing a second 
colony (or colonies) sufficiently distant from the present population 
such that a smaller portion of southern sea otters will be jeopardized 
in the event of a large-scale oil spill, and (ii) establishing a data 
base for identifying the optimal sustainable population level for the 
sea otter.

Thus the translocation, and establishment of a population of sea otters 
has been identified by the Recovery Plan as a critical action necessary 
for the recovery and delisting of the species. With regard to the 
relationship of a successful translocation to the initiation of a 
delisting action under the Endangered Species Act. The Plan states:

    Delisting should be considered when the southern sea otter 
population is stable or increasing at sustainable rates in a large 
enough area of their original habitat that only a small proportion of 
the population would be decimated by any single natural or man-caused 
catastrophe. To reach this point: (1) At least one additional population 
of sea otters must be established outside the current population range, 
(2) the existing population of sea otters and its habitat must be 
protected, and (3) the threat from oil spills or other major 
environmental changes must be minimized.

The successful establishment of the experimental population to be 
carried out pursuant to this rule should fully satisfy the first 
criterion specified above from the Recovery Plan, provided that the 
parent population is showing sustained growth and expanding its range 
from its present size and distribution. However, if such growth and 
expansion is not occurring, the establishment of a single new population 
may not be sufficient to satisfy the broader criterion that the 
population must be increasing at a sustainable rate in a large enough 
area of their original habitat that only a small proportion of the 
population would be decimated by any single natural or man-caused 
catastrophe.
    (ii) Effect on recovery. The translocation will not influence the 
legal status of the species until such time as the Service determines 
that the experimental population is established. Once established, other 
factors such as the status of the parent population and completion of 
other recovery tasks will be considered. If the experimental population 
becomes established and the other recovery tasks identified in the 
recovery plan for the southern sea otter are attained, the southern sea 
otter will be eligible for consideration for delisting in accordance 
with the requirements of 50 CFR 424.11(d). If a catastrophic event were 
to significantly diminish the parent population, the size of the 
experimental population would be a factor in determining whether or not 
the southern sea otter should remain listed as ``threatened'' or 
reclassified as ``endangered,'' or if relisting should be considered if 
a delisting action had been completed.
    (iii) Effect on interagency cooperation. In determining the 
likelihood of jeopardy or non-jeopardy opinions for proposed Federal 
actions that ``may affect'' southern sea otters, the probability of 
jeopardy determinations will decrease proportionally for comparable 
projects with comparable types of impacts as the experimental population 
grows from the point of being established toward the maximum number that 
its habitat can support, i.e., carrying capacity. Thus, there is an 
inverse relationship between the size of the experimental population 
(after being determined to be established) and the probability of 
jeopardy determinations associated with section 7 consultations under 
the Endangered Species Act for projects affecting either the parent or 
the experimental population. However, the status of the experimental 
population is not the only factor to be considered in section 7 
evaluations. The status of the parent population, as well as the 
cumulative impacts, baseline level of threats, and effects of the action 
on either population, will also be taken into account. In addition to 
considering the size of

[[Page 160]]

the experimental population, the contribution that such population could 
make toward helping restore a damaged parent population will also be a 
factor that will be considered during section 7 evaluations. For section 
7 purposes, once the translocated otters become stabilized and enter 
into the initial growth and reestablishment stage, but before meeting 
the criteria for an established population, the experimental population 
will have an existence value that will be taken into consideration both 
quantitatively and qualitatively. Its numbers will be added to those of 
the parent population for purposes of analyzing the impacts of a Federal 
action on the southern sea otter population. Moreover, during the 
initial growth and reestablishment stage, as part of the analysis of the 
impacts on the population as a whole, the impacts of proposed Federal 
actions will be analyzed to clearly determine the relative risk to each 
of the two populations (parent population and the experimental 
population).
    (8) Determination of a failed translocation. The translocation would 
generally be considered to have failed if one or more of the following 
conditions exists:
    (i) If, after the first year following initiation of translocation 
or any subsequent year, no translocated otters remain within the 
translocation zone and the reasons for emigration or mortality cannot be 
identified and/or remedied;
    (ii) If, within three years from the initial transplant, fewer than 
25 otters remain in the translocation zone and the reason for emigration 
or mortality cannot be identified and/or remedied;
    (iii) If, after two years following the completion of the transplant 
phase, the experimental population is declining at a significant rate 
and the translocated otters are not showing signs of successful 
reproduction (i.e., no pupping is observed); however, termination of the 
project under this and the previous criterion may be delayed if 
reproduction is occurring and the degree of dispersal into the 
management zone is small enough that the efforts to continue to remove 
otters from the management zone are acceptable to the Service and 
California Department of Fish and Game;
    (iv) If the Service determines, in consultation with the affected 
State and Marine Mammal Commission, that otters are dispersing from the 
translocation zone and becoming established within the management zone 
in sufficient numbers to demonstrate that containment cannot be 
successfully accomplished. This standard is not intended to apply to 
situations in which individuals or small numbers of otters are sighted 
within the management zone or temporarily manage to elude capture. 
Instead, it is meant to be applied when it becomes apparent that, over 
time, otters are relocating from the translocation zone to the 
management zone in such numbers that: (A) An independent breeding colony 
is likely to become established within the management zone, or (B) they 
could cause economic damage to fishery resources within the management 
zone. It is expected that the Service could make this determination 
within a year provided sufficient information is available;
    (v) If the health and well-being of the experimental population 
should become threatened to the point that the colony's continued 
survival is unlikely, despite the protections given to it by the 
Service, State, and applicable laws and regulations. An example would be 
if an overriding military action for national security was proposed that 
would threaten to devastate the colony and removal of the otters was 
determined to be the only viable way of preventing the loss of the 
individuals.
    (vi) If, based on any one of these criteria, the Service concludes, 
after consultation with the affected State and Marine Mammal Commission, 
that the translocation has failed to produce a viable, contained 
experimental population, this rulemaking will be amended to terminate 
the experimental population, and all otters remaining within the 
translocation zone will be captured and all healthy otters will be 
placed back into the range of the parent population. Efforts to maintain 
the management zone free of otters will be curtailed after all 
reasonable efforts have been made to remove all otters that are still 
within the management zone

[[Page 161]]

at the time of the decision to terminate the translocated population. A 
joint State-Service consultation will determine when all reasonable 
efforts have been made and additional efforts would be futile.
    (vii) Prior to declaring the translocation a failure, a full 
evaluation will be conducted into the probable causes of the failure. If 
the causes could be determined, and legal and reasonable remedial 
measures identified and implemented, consideration will be given to 
continuing to maintain the translocated population. If such reasonable 
measures cannot be identified and implemented, the results of the 
evaluation will be published in the Federal Register with a proposed 
rulemaking to terminate the experimental population.
    (e) Yellowfin madtom (Noturus flavipinnis). (1) Where is the 
yellowfin madtom designated as a nonessential experimental population 
(NEP)? We have designated two populations of this species as NEPs: the 
North Fork Holston River Watershed NEP and the Tellico River NEP.
    (i) The North Fork Holston River Watershed NEP area is within the 
species' historic range and is defined as follows: The North Fork 
Holston River watershed, Washington, Smyth, and Scott Counties, 
Virginia; South Fork Holston River watershed upstream to Ft. Patrick 
Henry Dam, Sullivan County, Tennessee; and the Holston River from the 
confluence of the North and South Forks downstream to the John Sevier 
Detention Lake Dam, Hawkins County, Tennessee. This site is totally 
isolated from existing populations of this species by large Tennessee 
River tributaries and reservoirs. As the species is not known to inhabit 
reservoirs and because individuals of the species are not likely to move 
100 river miles through these large reservoirs, the possibility that 
this population could come in contact with extant wild populations is 
unlikely.
    (ii) The Tellico River NEP area is within the species' historic 
range and is defined as follows: The Tellico River, between the 
backwaters of the Tellico Reservoir (approximately Tellico River mile 19 
(30.4 kilometers) and Tellico River mile 33 (52.8 kilometers), near the 
Tellico Ranger Station, Monroe County, Tennessee. This species is not 
currently known to exist in the Tellico River or its tributaries. Based 
on its habitat requirements, we do not expect this species to become 
established outside this NEP area. However, if individuals of this 
population move upstream or downstream or into tributaries outside the 
designated NEP area, we would presume that they came from the 
reintroduced population. We would then amend this rule and enlarge the 
boundaries of the NEP area to include the entire range of the expanded 
population.
    (2) We do not intend to change the NEP designations to ``essential 
experimental,'' ``threatened,'' or ``endangered'' within the NEP areas. 
Additionally, we will not designate critical habitat for these NEPs, as 
provided by 16 U.S.C. 1539(j)(2)(C)(ii).
    (3) What activities are not allowed in the NEP areas?
    (i) Except as expressly allowed in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, 
all the prohibitions of Sec.  17.31 (a) and (b) apply to the fishes 
identified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (ii) Any manner of take not described under paragraph (e)(4) of this 
section is prohibited in the NEP area. We may refer unauthorized take of 
these fishes to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.
    (iii) You may not possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever any of the identified fishes, 
or parts thereof, that are taken or possessed in violation of paragraph 
(e)(3) of this section or in violation of the applicable State fish and 
wildlife laws or regulations or the Act.
    (iv) You may not attempt to commit, solicit another to commit, or 
cause to be committed any offense defined in paragraph (e)(3) of this 
section.
    (4) What take is allowed in the NEP area? Take of this species that 
is incidental to an otherwise legal activity, such as recreation (e.g., 
fishing, boating, wading, trapping, or swimming), forestry, agriculture, 
and other activities that are in accordance with Federal, State, and 
local laws and regulations, is allowed.
    (5) How will the effectiveness of these reintroductions be 
monitored? We will

[[Page 162]]

prepare periodic progress reports and fully evaluate these 
reintroduction efforts after 5 and 10 years to determine whether to 
continue or terminate the reintroduction efforts.
    (6) Note: Map of the NEP area for the yellowfin madtom in the 
Tellico River, Tennessee, appears immediately following paragraph (m)(5) 
of this section.
    (f) Guam Rail (Rallus owstoni). (1) The Guam rail population 
identified in paragraph (f)(7) of this section is a nonessential 
experimental population.
    (2) No person shall take this species, except:
    (i) In accordance with a valid permit issued by the Service under 
Sec.  17.32 for educational purposes, scientific purposes, the 
enhancement of propagation or survival of the species, zoological 
exhibition, and other conservation purposes consistent with the Act; or
    (ii) As authorized by the laws and regulations of the Commonwealth 
of the Northern Mariana Islands, after the Service has made the 
determination that the experimental population has become well 
established and occupies all suitable habitat island-wide.
    (3) Any employee of the Service, the Commonwealth of the Northern 
Mariana Islands Division of Fish and Wildlife, or the Guam Division of 
Aquatic and Wildlife Resources who is designated for such purposes, may, 
when acting in the course of official duties, take a Guam rail without a 
permit if such action is necessary to:
    (i) Aid a sick, injured, or orphaned specimen;
    (ii) Dispose of a dead specimen;
    (iii) Salvage a dead specimen that may be useful for scientific 
study; or
    (iv) Take an animal that is responsible for depredations to personal 
property if it has not been possible to otherwise eliminate such 
depredations and/or loss of personal property, provided that such taking 
must be done in a humane manner and may involve injuring or killing the 
bird only if it has not been possible to eliminate depredations by live 
capturing and releasing the specimen unharmed in other suitable 
habitats.
    (4) Any violation of applicable commonwealth of the Northern Mariana 
Islands fish and wildlife conservation laws or regulations with respect 
to the taking of this species (other than taking as described in 
paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section) will also be a violation of the 
Endangered Species Act.
    (5) No person shall possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever, any such species taken in 
violation of these regulations or in violation of applicable 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands fish and wildlife laws or 
regulations or the Endangered Species Act.
    (6) It is unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, solicit 
another to commit, or cause to be committed, any offense defined in 
paragraphs (f) (2) through (5) of this section.
    (7) The sites for introduction of Guam rails on Rota, Commonwealth 
of the Northern Mariana Islands, are on an island separated from Guam by 
50 kilometers of ocean. The last known observation of an individual of 
this species occurred near the northern tip of Guam, which is closest to 
the island of Rota. No intermingling of these populations will occur 
since this species has been extirpated in the wild on Guam. The Rota 
release sites are of necessity outside the historic range of the Guam 
rail, as described in this regulation, because its primary range has 
been unsuitably and irreversibly destroyed by the brown tree snake.
    (8) The nonessential experimental population on Rota will be checked 
periodically by staff of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana 
Islands Division of Fish and Wildlife and cooperating staff from the 
University of Tennessee to determine dispersal patterns, mortality, and 
reproductive success. The overall success of the releases and general 
health of the population will also be assessed.
    (g) Black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes). (1) The black-footed 
ferret populations identified in paragraph (g)(9)(i) through (vii) of 
this section are nonessential experimental populations. We will manage 
each of these populations in accordance with their respective management 
plans.
    (2) No person may take this species in the wild in the experimental 
population area, except as provided in paragraphs (g)(3), (4), (5), and 
(10) of this section.

[[Page 163]]

    (3) Any person with a valid permit issued by the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service (Service) under section 17.32 may take black-footed 
ferrets in the wild in the experimental population areas.
    (4) Any employee or agent of the Service or appropriate State 
wildlife agency designated for such purposes, acting in the course of 
official duties, may take a black-footed ferret in the wild in the 
experimental population areas if such action is necessary:
    (i) For scientific purposes;
    (ii) To relocate a ferret to avoid conflict with human activities;
    (iii) To relocate a ferret that has moved outside the Little Snake 
Black-footed Ferret Management Area/Coyote Basin Primary Management Zone 
or the Rosebud Sioux Reservation Experimental Population Area when that 
relocation is necessary to protect the ferret or is requested by an 
affected landowner or land manager, or whose removal is requested 
pursuant to paragraph (g)(12) of this section.
    (iv) To relocate ferrets within the experimental population area to 
improve ferret survival and recovery prospects;
    (v) To relocate ferrets from the experimental population areas into 
other ferret reintroduction areas or captivity;
    (vi) To aid a sick, injured, or orphaned animal; or
    (vii) To salvage a dead specimen for scientific purposes.
    (5) A person may take a ferret in the wild within the experimental 
population areas, provided such take is incidental to and not the 
purpose of, the carrying out of an otherwise lawful activity and if such 
ferret injury or mortality was unavoidable, unintentional, and did not 
result from negligent conduct. Such conduct is not considered 
intentional or ``knowing take'' for the purposes of this regulation, and 
the Service will not take legal action for such conduct. However, we 
will refer cases of knowing take to the appropriate authorities for 
prosecution.
    (6) You must report any taking pursuant to paragraphs (g)(3), 
(4)(vi) and (vii), and (5) of this section to the appropriate Service 
Field Supervisor, who will determine the disposition of any live or dead 
specimens.
    (i) Report such taking in the Shirley Basin/Medicine Bow 
experimental population area to the Field Supervisor, Ecological 
Services, Fish and Wildlife Service, Cheyenne, Wyoming (telephone: 307/
772-2374).
    (ii) Report such taking in the Conata Basin/Badlands experimental 
population area to the Field Supervisor, Ecological Services, Fish and 
Wildlife Service, Pierre, South Dakota (telephone: 605/224-8693).
    (iii) Report such taking in the northcentral Montana experimental 
population area to the Field Supervisor, Ecological Services, Fish and 
Wildlife Service, Helena, Montana (telephone: 406/449-5225).

    (9) The sites for reintroduction of black-footed ferrets are within 
the historical range of the species.
    (i) We consider the Shirley Basin/Medicine Bow Management Area on 
the attached map of Wyoming to be the core recovery area for this 
species in southeastern Wyoming. The boundaries of the nonessential 
experimental population are that part of Wyoming south and east of the 
North Platte River within Natrona, Carbon, and Albany Counties (see 
Wyoming map). All marked ferrets found in the wild within these 
boundaries prior to the first breeding season following the first year 
of releases constituted the nonessential experimental population during 
this period. All ferrets found in the wild within these boundaries 
during and after the first breeding season following the first year of 
releases comprise the nonessential experimental population, thereafter.
    (ii) We consider the Conata Basin/Badlands Reintroduction Area on 
the attached map for South Dakota to be the core recovery area for this 
species in southwestern South Dakota. The boundaries of the nonessential 
experimental population area occur north of State Highway 44 and BIA 
Highway 2 east of the Cheyenne River and BIA Highway 41, south of I-90, 
and west of State Highway 73 within Pennington, Shannon, and Jackson 
Counties, South Dakota. Any black-footed ferret found in the wild within 
these boundaries is part of the nonessential experimental population 
after the first breeding season following the first year of releases of 
black-footed ferret in the Reintroduction Area. A black-footed ferret 
occurring outside the experimental population area in South Dakota is 
considered as endangered but may be captured for genetic testing. We 
will dispose of the captured animal in one of the following ways if 
necessary:
    (A) We may return an animal genetically related to the experimental 
population to the Reintroduction Area or to a captive facility.
    (B) Under an existing contingency plan, we will use up to nine 
black-footed ferrets genetically unrelated to the experimental 
population in the captive-breeding program. If a landowner outside the 
experimental population area wishes to retain black-footed ferrets on 
his property, we will develop a conservation agreement or easement with 
the landowner.
    (iii) We consider the Northcentral Montana Reintroduction Area shown 
on the attached map for Montana to be the core recovery area for this 
species in northcentral Montana. The boundaries of the nonessential 
experimental population are those parts of Phillips and Blaine Counties, 
Montana, described as the area bounded on the north beginning at the 
northwest corner of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation on the Milk 
River; east following the Milk River to the east Phillips County line; 
then south along said line to the Missouri River; then west along the 
Missouri River to the west boundary of Phillips County; then north along 
said county line to the west boundary of Fort Belknap Indian 
Reservation; then further north along said boundary to the point of 
origin at the Milk River. All marked ferrets found in the wild within 
these boundaries prior to the first breeding season following the first 
year of releases constituted the nonessential experimental population 
during this period. All ferrets found in the wild within these 
boundaries during and after the first breeding season following the 
first year of releases comprise the nonessential experimental population 
thereafter. A black-footed ferret occurring outside the experimental 
area in Montana is initially considered as endangered but may be 
captured for genetic testing. We will dispose of the captured animal in 
one of the following ways if necessary:
    (A) We may return an animal genetically related to the experimental 
population to the reintroduction area or to a captive facility.
    (B) Under an existing contingency plan, we will use up to nine 
black-footed ferrets genetically unrelated to the experimental 
population in the captive-breeding program. If a landowner outside the 
experimental population area wishes to retain black-footed ferrets on 
his property, we will develop a conservation agreement or easement with 
the landowner.
    (iv) We consider the Aubrey Valley Experimental Population Area 
shown

[[Page 165]]

on the attached map for Arizona to be the core recovery area for this 
species in northwestern Arizona. The boundary of the nonessential 
experimental population area is those parts of Coconino, Mohave, and 
Yavapai Counties that include the Aubrey Valley west of the Aubrey 
Cliffs, starting from Chino Point, north along the crest of the Aubrey 
cliffs to the Supai Road (State Route 18), southwest along the Supai 
Road to Township 26 North, then west to Range 11 West, then south to the 
Hualapai Indian Reservation boundary, then east and northeast along the 
Hualapai Indian Reservation boundary to U.S. Highway Route 66; then 
southeast along Route 66 for approximately 6 km (2.3 miles) to a point 
intercepting the east boundary of section 27, Township 25 North, Range 9 
West; then south along a line to where the Atchison-Topeka Railroad 
enters Yampa Divide Canyon; then southeast along the Atchison-Topeka 
Railroad alignment to the intersection of the Range 9 West/Range 8 West 
boundary; then south to the SE corner of section 12, Township 24 North, 
Range 9 West; then southeast to SE corner section 20, Township 24 West, 
Range 8 West; then south to the SE corner section 29, Township 24 North, 
Range 8 West; then southeast to the half section point on the east 
boundary line of section 33, Township 24 North, Range 8 West; then 
northeast to the SE corner of section 27, Township 24 North, Range 8 
West; then southeast to the SE corner Section 35, Township 24 North, 
Range 8 West; then southeast to the half section point on the east 
boundary line of section 12, Township 23 North, Range 8 West; then 
southeast to the SE corner of section 8, Township 23 North, Range 7 
West; then southeast to the SE corner of section 16, Township 23 North, 
Range 7 West; then east to the half section point of the north boundary 
line of section 14, Township 23 North, Range 7 West; then south to the 
half section point on the north boundary line of section 26, Township 23 
North, Range 7 West; then east along section line to route 66; then 
southeast along route 66 to the point of origin at Chino Point. Any 
black-footed ferrets found in the wild within these boundaries is part 
of the nonessential experimental population after the first breeding 
season following the first year of releases of ferrets into the 
reintroduction area. A black-footed ferret occurring outside the 
experimental area in Arizona is initially considered as endangered but 
may be captured for genetic testing. We will dispose of the captured 
animal in one of the following ways if necessary:
    (A) We may return an animal genetically related to the experimental 
population to the reintroduction area or to a captive facility. If a 
landowner outside the experimental population area wishes to retain 
black-footed ferrets on his property, we will develop a conservation 
agreement or easement with the landowner.
    (B) Under an existing contingency plan, we will use up to nine 
black-footed ferrets genetically unrelated to the experimental 
population in the captive-breeding program. If a landowner outside the 
experimental population area wishes to retain black-footed ferrets on 
his property, we will develop a conservation agreement or easement with 
the landowner.
    (v) We consider the Little Snake Black-footed Ferret Management Area 
in Colorado and the Coyote Basin Black-footed Ferret Primary Management 
Zone in Utah as the initial recovery sites for this species within the 
Northwestern Colorado/Northeastern Utah Experimental Population Area 
(see Colorado/Utah map). The boundaries of the nonessential Experimental 
Population Area will be all of Moffat and Rio Blanco Counties in 
Colorado west of Colorado State Highway 13; all of Uintah and Duchesne 
Counties in Utah; and in Sweetwater County, Wyoming, the line between 
Range 96 and 97 West (eastern edge), Range 102 and 103 West (western 
edge), and Township 14 and 15 North (northern edge). All marked ferrets 
found in the wild within these boundaries prior to the first breeding 
season following the first year of release will constitute the 
nonessential experimental population during this period. All ferrets 
found in the wild within these boundaries during and after the first 
breeding season following the first year of releases of ferrets into the 
reintroduction area will comprise the nonessential experimental 
population thereafter. A black-

[[Page 166]]

footed ferret occurring outside the Experimental Population Area is 
initially considered as endangered but may be captured for genetic 
testing. We will dispose of the captured animal in one of the following 
ways if necessary:
    (A) We may return an animal genetically related to the experimental 
population to the Reintroduction Area or to a captive facility.
    (B) Under an existing contingency plan, we will use up to nine 
black-footed ferrets genetically unrelated to the experimental 
population in the captive-breeding program. If a landowner outside the 
experimental population area wishes to retain black-footed ferrets on 
his property, we will develop a conservation agreement or easement with 
the landowner.
    (vi) The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Reintroduction Area is shown on 
the map of north-central South Dakota at the end of paragraph (g) of 
this section. The boundaries of the nonessential experimental population 
area are the exterior boundaries of the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation 
which includes all of Dewey and Ziebach Counties, South Dakota. Any 
black-footed ferret found in the wild within these counties will be 
considered part of the nonessential experimental population after the 
first breeding season following the first year of black-footed ferret 
release. A black-footed ferret occurring outside the Experimental 
Population Area in north-central South Dakota would initially be 
considered as endangered but may be captured for genetic testing. When a 
ferret is found outside the Experimental Population Area, the following 
may occur:
    (A) If an animal is genetically determined to have originated from 
the experimental population, we may return it to the reintroduction area 
or to a captive-breeding facility.
    (B) If an animal is determined to be genetically unrelated to the 
experimental population, we will place it in captivity under an existing 
contingency plan. Up to nine black-footed ferrets may be taken for use 
in the captive-breeding program.
    (vii) The Rosebud Sioux Reservation Experimental Population Area is 
shown on the map of south-central South Dakota at the end of paragraph 
(g) of this section. The boundaries of the nonessential experimental 
population area include all of Gregory, Mellette, Todd, and Tripp 
Counties in South Dakota. Any black-footed ferret found within these 
four counties will be considered part of the nonessential experimental 
population after the first breeding season following the first year of 
black-footed ferret release. A black-footed ferret occurring outside the 
nonessential experimental population area in south-central South Dakota 
will initially be considered as endangered but may be captured for 
genetic testing. If necessary, disposition of the captured animal may 
occur in the following ways:
    (A) If an animal is genetically determined to have originated from 
the experimental population, we may return it to the reintroduction area 
or to a captive-breeding facility.
    (B) If an animal is determined to be genetically unrelated to the 
experimental population, we will place it in captivity under an existing 
contingency plan. Up to nine black-footed ferrets may be taken for use 
in the captive-breeding program.
    (10) Monitoring the reintroduced populations will occur continually 
during the life of the project, including the use of radio telemetry and 
other remote sensing devices, as appropriate. Vaccination of all 
released animals will occur prior to release, as appropriate, to prevent 
diseases prevalent in mustelids. Any animal that is sick, injured, or 
otherwise in need of special care may be captured by authorized 
personnel of the Service or appropriate State wildlife agency or their 
agents and given appropriate care. Such an animal may be released back 
to its appropriate reintroduction area or another authorized site as 
soon as possible, unless physical or behavioral problems make it 
necessary to return the animal to captivity.
    (11) We will reevaluate the status of the experimental population 
within the first five years after the first year of release of black-
footed ferrets to determine future management needs. This review will 
take into account the reproductive success and movement patterns of the 
individuals released into the area, as well as the overall health

[[Page 167]]

of the experimental population and the prairie dog ecosystem in the 
above described areas. We will propose reclassification of the black-
footed ferret when we meet the appropriate recovery objectives for the 
species.
    (12) We will not include a reevaluation of the ``nonessential 
experimental'' designation for these populations during our review of 
the initial five year reintroduction program. We do not foresee any 
likely situation justifying alteration of the nonessential experimental 
status of these populations. Should any such alteration prove necessary 
and it results in a substantial modification to black-footed ferret 
management on non-Federal lands, any private landowner who consented to 
the introduction of black-footed ferrets on their lands may rescind 
their consent, and at their request, we will relocate the ferrets 
pursuant to paragraph (g)(4)(iii) of this section.

    (h) Whooping crane (Grus americana). (1) The whooping crane 
populations identified in paragraphs (h)(9)(i) through (iii) of this 
section are nonessential experimental populations.

[[Page 174]]

    (2) No person may take this species in the wild in the experimental 
population areas except when such take is accidental and incidental to 
an otherwise lawful activity, or as provided in paragraphs (h)(3) and 
(4) of this section. Examples of otherwise lawful activities include, 
but are not limited to, agricultural practices, pesticide application, 
water management, construction, recreation, trapping, or hunting, when 
such activities are in full compliance with all applicable laws and 
regulations.
    (3) Any person with a valid permit issued by the Fish and Wildlife 
Service (Service) under Sec.  17.32 may take whooping cranes in the wild 
in the experimental population area for educational purposes, scientific 
purposes, the enhancement of propagation or survival of the species, and 
other conservation purposes consistent with the Act and in accordance 
with applicable State fish and wildlife conservation laws and 
regulations.
    (4) Any employee or agent of the Service or State wildlife agency 
who is designated for such purposes, when acting in the course of 
official duties, may take a whooping crane in the wild in the 
experimental population area if such action is necessary to:
    (i) Relocate a whooping crane to avoid conflict with human 
activities;
    (ii) Relocate a whooping crane that has moved outside the eastern 
U.S. population area identified in paragraph (h)(9)(iii) of this 
section, or the Kissimmee Prairie or Rocky Mountain range of the 
experimental populations, when removal is necessary or requested and is 
authorized by a valid permit under Sec.  17.22;
    (iii) Relocate whooping cranes within the experimental population 
areas to improve survival and recovery prospects;
    (iv) Relocate whooping cranes from the experimental population areas 
into captivity;
    (v) Aid a sick, injured, or orphaned specimen; or
    (vi) Dispose of a dead specimen, or salvage a dead specimen which 
may be useful for scientific study.
    (5) Any taking pursuant to paragraphs (h)(3) and (4) of this section 
must be immediately reported to the National Whooping Crane Coordinator, 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O. Box 100, Austwell, Texas 77950 
(Phone: 361-286-3559), who, in conjunction with his counterpart in the 
Canadian Wildlife Service, will determine the disposition of any live or 
dead specimens.
    (6) No person shall possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever, any such species from the 
experimental populations taken in violation of these regulations or in 
violation of applicable State fish and wildlife laws or regulations or 
the Endangered Species Act.
    (7) It is unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, solicit 
another to commit, or cause to be committed, any offense defined in 
paragraphs (h) (2) through (6) of this section.
    (8) The Service will not mandate any closure of areas, including 
National Wildlife Refuges, during hunting or conservation order seasons 
or closure or modification of hunting or conservation order seasons in 
the following situations:
    (i) For the purpose of avoiding take of the nonessential 
experimental population identified in paragraph (h)(9)(iii) of this 
section;
    (ii) If a clearly marked whooping crane from the nonessential 
experimental population identified in (h)(9)(iii) wanders outside the 
designated NEP area. In these situations, the Service will attempt to 
capture the stray bird and return it to the appropriate area if removal 
is requested by the State.
    (9) All whooping cranes found in the wild within the boundaries 
listed in paragraphs (h)(9)(i) through (iii) of this section will be 
considered nonessential experimental animals. Geographic areas the 
nonessential experimental populations may inhabit include the 
following--
    (i) The entire State of Florida. The reintroduction site is the 
Kissimmee Prairie portions of Polk, Osceola, Highlands, and Okeechobee 
Counties. Current information indicates that the Kissimmee Prairie is 
within the historic range of the whooping crane in Florida.
    (A) No other natural populations of whooping cranes are likely to 
come into contact with the experimental

[[Page 175]]

population at Kissimmee Prairie. The only natural extant population, 
known as the Aransas/Wood Buffalo National Park population occurs well 
west of the Mississippi River. This population nests in the Northwest 
Territories and adjacent areas of Alberta, Canada, primarily within the 
boundaries of the Wood Buffalo National Park, and winters along the 
Central Texas Gulf of Mexico coast at Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. 
The only other extant eastern U.S. population is the nonessential 
experimental population described in paragraph (h)(9)(iii) of this 
section. Remnant individuals of the Rocky Mountain nonessential 
experimental population occur in the western United States as described 
in paragraph (h)(9)(ii) of this section.
    (B) Whooping cranes adhere to ancestral breeding grounds, leaving 
little possibility that individuals from the extant Aransas/Wood Buffalo 
National Park population will stray into Florida or the Rocky Mountain 
Population. Studies of whooping cranes have shown that migration is a 
learned rather than an innate behavior. The experimental population 
released at Kissimmee Prairie is expected to remain mostly within the 
prairie region of central Florida.
    (ii) The States of Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Utah, and the 
western half of Wyoming. Wooping cranes in this area do not come in 
contact with whooping cranes of the Aransas/Wood Buffalo Population; and
    (iii) That portion of the eastern contiguous United States which 
includes the States of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, 
Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, 
Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, 
West Virginia, and Wisconsin. (See map following paragraph (h)(11) of 
this section). Whooping cranes within this population are expected to 
occur mostly within the States of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, 
Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and Florida, which is within the historic 
range of the whooping crane in the United States. The additional States 
included within the experimental population area are those expected to 
receive occasional use by the cranes, or which may be used as breeding 
or wintering areas in the event of future population expansion. Whooping 
cranes in this population are not expected to come in contact with 
whooping cranes of the Aransas/Wood Buffalo National Park Population.
    (10) The reintroduced populations will be monitored during the 
duration of the projects by the use of radio telemetry and other 
appropriate measures. Any animal that is determined to be sick, injured, 
or otherwise in need of special care will be recaptured to the extent 
possible by Service and/or State wildlife personnel or their designated 
agent and given appropriate care. Such animals will be released back to 
the wild as soon as possible, unless physical or behavioral problems 
make it necessary to return them to a captive breeding facility.
    (11) The status of the experimental populations will be reevaluated 
periodically to determine future management needs. This review will take 
into account the reproductive success and movement patterns of the 
individuals released within the experimental population areas.

    (i) Gray wolf (Canis lupus). (1) The gray wolves (wolf) identified 
in paragraph (i)(7) of this section are nonessential experimental. These 
wolves will be managed in accordance with the respective provisions of 
this section.
    (2) The Service finds that reintroduction of nonessential 
experimental gray wolves, as defined in (i)(7) of this section, will 
further the conservation of the species.
    (3) No person may take this species in the wild in an experimental 
population area except as provided in paragraphs (i)(3), (7), and (8) of 
this section.
    (i) Landowners on their private land and livestock producers (i.e., 
producers of cattle, sheep, horses, and mules or as defined in State and 
tribal wolf management plans as approved by the Service) that are 
legally using public land (Federal land and any other public lands 
designated in State and tribal wolf management plans as approved by the 
Service) may harass any wolf in an opportunistic (the wolf cannot be 
purposely attracted, tracked, waited for, or searched out, then 
harassed) and noninjurious (no temporary or permanent physical damage 
may result) manner at any time, Provided that such harassment is non-
lethal or is not physically injurious to the gray wolf and is reported 
within 7 days to the Service project leader for wolf reintroduction or 
agency representative designated by the Service.
    (ii) Any livestock producers on their private land may take 
(including to kill or injure) a wolf in the act of killing, wounding, or 
biting livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules or as defined in 
State and tribal wolf management plans as approved by the Service), 
Provided that such incidents are to be immediately reported within 24 
hours to the Service project leader for wolf reintroduction or agency 
representative designated by the Service, and livestock freshly (less 
than 24 hours) wounded (torn flesh and bleeding) or killed by wolves 
must be evident. Service or other Service authorized agencies will 
confirm if livestock were wounded or killed by wolves. The taking of any 
wolf without such evidence may be referred to the appropriate 
authorities for prosecution.

[[Page 177]]

    (iii) Any livestock producer or permittee with livestock grazing 
allotments on public land may receive a written permit, valid for up to 
45 days, from the Service or other agencies designated by the Service, 
to take (including to kill or injure) a wolf that is in the act of 
killing, wounding, or biting livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules 
or as defined in State and tribal wolf management plans as approved by 
the Service), Provided that six or more breeding pairs of wolves have 
been documented in the experimental population area and the Service or 
other agencies authorized by the Service has confirmed that the 
livestock losses were caused by wolves and have completed agency efforts 
to resolve the problem. Such take must be reported immediately within 24 
hours to the Service project leader for wolf reintroduction or agency 
representative designated by the Service. There must be evidence of 
freshly wounded or killed livestock by wolves. Service or other Service 
authorized agencies will investigate and determine if the livestock were 
wounded or killed by wolves. The taking of any wolf without such 
evidence may be referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.
    (iv) Potentially affected States and tribes may capture and 
translocate wolves to other areas within an experimental population area 
as described in paragraph (i)(7), Provided the level of wolf predation 
is negatively impacting localized ungulate populations at an 
unacceptable level. Such translocations cannot inhibit wolf population 
recovery. The States and tribes will define such unacceptable impacts, 
how they would be measured, and identify other possible mitigation in 
their State or tribal wolf management plans. These plans must be 
approved by the Service before such movement of wolves may be conducted.
    (v) The Service, or agencies authorized by the Service, may promptly 
remove (place in captivity or kill) any wolf the Service or agency 
authorized by the Service determines to present a threat to human life 
or safety.
    (vi) Any person may harass or take (kill or injure) a wolf in self 
defense or in defense of others, Provided that such take is reported 
immediately (within 24 hours) to the Service reintroduction project 
leader or Service designated agent. The taking of a wolf without an 
immediate and direct threat to human life may be referred to the 
appropriate authorities for prosecution.
    (vii) The Service or agencies designated by the Service may take 
wolves that are determined to be ``problem'' wolves. Problem wolves are 
defined as wolves that in a calendar year attack livestock (cattle, 
sheep, horses, and mules) or as defined by State and tribal wolf 
management plans approved by the Service or wolves that twice in a 
calendar year attack domestic animals (all domestic animals other than 
livestock). Authorized take includes, but is not limited to non-lethal 
measures such as: aversive conditioning, nonlethal control, and/or 
translocating wolves. Such taking may be done when five or fewer 
breeding pairs are established in an experimental population area. If 
the take results in a wolf mortality, then evidence that the mortality 
was nondeliberate, accidental, nonnegligent, and unavoidable must be 
provided. When six or more breeding pairs are established in the 
experimental population area, lethal control of problem wolves or 
permanent placement in captivity will be authorized but only after other 
methods to resolve livestock depredations have been exhausted. 
Depredations occurring on Federal lands or other public lands identified 
in State or tribal wolf management plans and prior to six breeding pairs 
becoming established in an experimental population area may result in 
capture and release of the female wolf with pups, and her pups at or 
near the site of capture prior to October 1. All wolves on private land, 
including female wolves with pups, may be relocated or moved to other 
areas within the experimental population area if continued depredation 
occurs. Wolves attacking domestic animals other than livestock, 
including pets on private land, two or more times in a calendar year 
will be relocated. All chronic problem wolves (wolves that depredate on 
domestic animals after being moved once for previous domestic animal 
depredations) will be removed from the wild (killed or placed

[[Page 178]]

in captivity). The following three criteria will be used in determining 
the status of problem wolves within the nonessential experimental 
population area:
    (A) There must be evidence of wounded livestock or partial remains 
of a livestock carcass that clearly shows that the injury or death was 
caused by wolves. Such evidence is essential since wolves may feed on 
carrion which they found and did not kill. There must be reason to 
believe that additional livestock losses would occur if no control 
action is taken.
    (B) There must be no evidence of artificial or intentional feeding 
of wolves. Improperly disposed of livestock carcasses in the area of 
depredation will be considered attractants. Livestock carrion or 
carcasses on public land, not being used as bait under an agency 
authorized control action, must be removed or otherwise disposed so that 
it will not attract wolves.
    (C) On public lands, animal husbandry practices previously 
identified in existing approved allotment plans and annual operating 
plans for allotments must have been followed.
    (viii) Any person may take a gray wolf found in an area defined in 
paragraph (i)(7), Provided that the take is incidental to an otherwise 
lawful activity, accidental, unavoidable, unintentional, not resulting 
from negligent conduct lacking reasonable due care, and due care was 
exercised to avoid taking a gray wolf. Such taking is to be reported 
within 24 hours to a Service or Service-designated authority. Take that 
does not conform with such provisions may be referred to the appropriate 
authorities for prosecution.
    (ix) Service or other Federal, State, or tribal personnel may 
receive written authorization from the Service to take animals under 
special circumstances. Wolves may be live captured and translocated to 
resolve demonstrated conflicts with ungulate populations or with other 
species listed under the Act, or when they are found outside of the 
designated experimental population area. Take procedures in such 
instances would involve live capture and release to a remote area or 
placement in a captive facility, if the animal is clearly unfit to 
remain in the wild. Killing of wolves will be a last resort and is only 
authorized when live capture attempts have failed or there is clear 
endangerment to human life.
    (x) Any person with a valid permit issued by the Service under Sec.  
17.32 may take wolves in the wild in the experimental population area, 
pursuant to terms of the permit.
    (xi) Any employee or agent of the Service or appropriate Federal, 
State, or tribal agency, who is designated in writing for such purposes 
by the Service, when acting in the course of official duties, may take a 
wolf from the wild within the experimental population area, if such 
action is for:
    (A) Scientific purposes;
    (B) To relocate wolves to avoid conflict with human activities;
    (C) To relocate wolves within the experimental population areas to 
improve wolf survival and recovery prospects;
    (D) To relocate wolves that have moved outside the experimental 
population area back into the experimental population area;
    (E) To aid or euthanize sick, injured, or orphaned wolves;
    (F) To salvage a dead specimen which may be used for scientific 
study; or
    (G) To aid in law enforcement investigations involving wolves.
    (xii) Any taking pursuant to this section must be reported 
immediately (within 24 hours) to the appropriate Service or Service-
designated agency, which will determine the disposition of any live or 
dead specimens.
    (4) Human access to areas with facilities where wolves are confined 
may be restricted at the discretion of Federal, State, and tribal land 
management agencies. When five or fewer breeding pairs are in an 
experimental population area, land-use restrictions may also be employed 
on an as-needed basis, at the discretion of Federal land management and 
natural resources agencies to control intrusive human disturbance around 
active wolf den sites. Such temporary restrictions on human access, when 
five or fewer breeding pairs are established in an experimental 
population area, may be required between April 1 and June 30, within 1 
mile of active wolf den or rendezvous sites and would only apply to 
public lands or

[[Page 179]]

other such lands designated in State and tribal wolf management plans. 
When six or more breeding pairs are established in an experimental 
population area, no land-use restrictions may be employed outside of 
national parks or national wildlife refuges, unless wolf populations 
fail to maintain positive growth rates toward population recovery levels 
for 2 consecutive years. If such a situation arose, State and tribal 
agencies would identify, recommend, and implement corrective management 
actions within 1 year, possibly including appropriate land-use 
restrictions to promote growth of the wolf population.
    (5) No person shall possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever, any wolf or part thereof from 
the experimental populations taken in violation of the regulations in 
paragraph (i) of this section or in violation of applicable State or 
tribal fish and wildlife laws or regulations or the Endangered Species 
Act.
    (6) It is unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, solicit 
another to commit, or cause to be committed any offense defined in this 
section.
    (7) The site for reintroduction is within the historic range of the 
species:
    (i) The central Idaho area is shown on the following map. The 
boundaries of the nonessential experimental population area will be 
those portions of Idaho that are south of Interstate Highway 90 and west 
of Interstate 15, and those portions of Montana south of Interstate 90, 
Highway 93 and 12 from Missoula, Montana west of Interstate 15.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN91.007

    (ii) The Yellowstone Management Area is shown on the following map. 
The boundaries of the nonessential experimental population area will be 
that portion of Idaho that is east of Interstate Highway 15; that 
portion of Montana that is east of Interstate Highway 15 and south of 
the Missouri River from Great Falls, Montana, to the eastern Montana 
border; and all of Wyoming.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN91.008

    (iii) All wolves found in the wild within the boundaries of this 
paragraph (i)(7) after the first releases will be considered 
nonessential experimental animals. In the conterminous United States, a 
wolf that is outside an

[[Page 180]]

experimental area (as defined in paragraph (i)(7) of this section) would 
be considered as endangered (or threatened if in Minnesota) unless it is 
marked or otherwise known to be an experimental animal; such a wolf may 
be captured for examination and genetic testing by the Service or 
Service-designated agency. Disposition of the captured animal may take 
any of the following courses:
    (A) If the animal was not involved in conflicts with humans and is 
determined likely to be an experimental wolf, it will be returned to the 
reintroduction area.
    (B) If the animal is determined likely to be an experimental wolf 
and was involved in conflicts with humans as identified in the 
management plan for the closest experimental area, it may be relocated, 
placed in captivity, or killed.
    (C) If the animal is determined not likely to be an experimental 
animal, it will be managed according to any Service approved plans for 
that area or will be marked and released near its point of capture.
    (D) If the animal is determined not to be a wild gray wolf or if the 
Service or agencies designated by the Service determine the animal shows 
physical or behavioral evidence of hybridization with other canids, such 
as domestic dogs or coyotes, or of being an animal raised in captivity, 
it will be returned to captivity or killed.
    (8) The reintroduced wolves will be monitored during the life of the 
project, including by the use of radio telemetry and other remote 
sensing devices as appropriate. All released animals will be vaccinated 
against diseases and parasites prevalent in canids, as appropriate, 
prior to release and during subsequent handling. Any animal that is 
sick, injured, or otherwise in need of special care may be captured by 
authorized personnel of the Service or Service-designated agencies and 
given appropriate care. Such an animal will be released back into its 
respective reintroduction area as soon as possible, unless physical or 
behavioral problems make it necessary to return the animal to captivity 
or euthanize it.
    (9) The status of the experimental population will be reevaluated 
within the first 3 years, after the first year of releases of wolves, to 
determine future management needs and if further reintroductions are 
required. This review will take into account the reproductive success 
and movement patterns of the individuals released in the area, as well 
as the overall health and fate of the experimental wolves. Once recovery 
goals are met for downlisting or delisting the species, a rule will be 
proposed to address downlisting or delisting.
    (10) The Service does not intend to reevaluate the ``nonessential 
experimental'' designation. The Service does not foresee any likely 
situation which would result in changing the nonessential experimental 
status until the gray wolf is recovered and delisted in the northern 
Rocky Mountains according to provisions outlined in the Act. However, if 
the wolf population does not demonstrate positive growth toward recovery 
goals for 2 consecutive years, the affected States and tribes, in 
cooperation with the Service, would, within 1 year, identify and 
initiate wolf management strategies, including appropriate public review 
and comment, to ensure continued wolf population growth toward recovery 
levels. All reintroduced wolves designated as nonessential experimental 
will be removed from the wild and the experimental population status and 
regulations revoked when (i) legal actions or lawsuits change the wolves 
status to endangered under the Act or (ii) within 90 days of the initial 
release date, naturally occurring wolves, consisting of two breeding 
pairs that for 2 consecutive years have each successfully raised two 
offspring, are discovered in the experimental population area. The 
naturally occurring wolves would be managed and protected as endangered 
species under the Act.
    (j) California condor (Gymnogyps californianus). (1) The California 
condor (Gymnogyps californianus) population identified in paragraph 
(j)(8) of this section is a nonessential experimental population, and 
the release of such population will further the conservation of the 
species.
    (2) You must not take any California condor in the wild in the 
experimental population area except as provided by this rule:

[[Page 181]]

    (i) Throughout the entire California condor experimental population 
area, you will not be in violation of the Endangered Species Act (Act) 
if you unavoidably and unintentionally take (including killing or 
injuring) a California condor, provided such take is non-negligent and 
incidental to a lawful activity, such as hunting, driving, or 
recreational activities, and you report the take as soon as possible as 
provided under paragraph 5 below.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (3) If you have a valid permit issued by the Service under Sec.  
17.32, you may take California condors in the wild in the experimental 
population area, pursuant to the terms of the permit.
    (4) Any employee or agent of the Fish and Wildlife Service 
(Service), Bureau of Land Management or appropriate State wildlife 
agency, who is designated for such purposes, when acting in the course 
of official duties, may take a California condor from the wild in the 
experimental population area and vicinity if such action is necessary:
    (i) For scientific purposes;
    (ii) To relocate California condors within the experimental 
population area to improve condor survival, and to address conflicts 
with ongoing or proposed activities, or with private landowners, when 
removal is necessary to protect the condor, or is requested by an 
adversely affected landowner or land manager, or other adversely 
affected party. Adverse effects and requests for condor relocation will 
be documented, reported and resolved in as an expedient manner as 
appropriate to the specific situation to protect condors and avoid 
conflicts. Prior to any efforts to relocate condors, the Service will 
obtain permission from the appropriate landowner(s);
    (iii) To relocate California condors that have moved outside the 
experimental population area, by returning the condor to the 
experimental population area or moving it to a captive breeding 
facility. All captures and relocations from outside the experimental 
population area will be coordinated with Service Cooperators, and 
conducted with the permission of the landowner(s) or appropriate land 
management agency(s).
    (iv) To aid a sick, injured, or orphaned California condor;
    (v) To salvage a dead specimen that may be useful for scientific 
study; or
    (vi) To dispose of a dead specimen.
    (5) Any taking pursuant to paragraphs (j)(2), (j)(4)(iv), (j)(4)(v), 
and (j)(4)(vi), of this section must be reported as soon as possible to 
the Field Supervisor, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological 
Services, Arizona Field Office, Phoenix, 2321 W. Royal Palm Road, Suite 
103, Arizona (telephone 602/640-2720) who will determine the disposition 
of any live or dead specimens.
    (6) You must not possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever, any California condor or part 
thereof from the experimental population taken in violation of this 
paragraph (j) or in violation of applicable State or Tribal laws or 
regulations or the Act.
    (7) It is unlawful for you to attempt to commit, solicit another to 
commit, or cause to be committed, any offense defined in paragraphs 
(j)(2) and (j)(6) of this section.
    (8) The designated experimental population area of the California 
condor includes portions of three states--Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. The 
southern boundary is Interstate Highway 40 in Arizona from its junction 
with Highway 191 west across Arizona to Kingman; the western boundary 
starts at Kingman, goes northwest on Highway 93 to Interstate Highway 
15, continues northeasterly on Interstate Highway 15 in Nevada and Utah, 
to Interstate Highway 70 in Utah; where the northern boundary starts and 
goes across Utah to Highway 191; where the eastern boundary starts and 
goes south through Utah until Highway 191 meets Interstate Highway 40 in 
Arizona (See map at end of this paragraph (j)).
    (i) All California condors released into the experimental population 
area, and their offspring, are to be marked and visually identifiable by 
colored and coded patagial wing markers.
    (ii) The Service has designated the experimental population area to 
accommodate the potential future movements of a wild population of 
condors. All released condors and their progeny

[[Page 182]]

are expected to remain in the experimental area due to the geographic 
extent of the designation.
    (9) The nonessential experimental population area includes the 
entire highway rights-of-way of the highways in paragraph (j)(8) of this 
section that constitute the perimeter boundary. All California condors 
found in the wild within these boundaries will comprise the experimental 
population.
    (i) The experimental population is to be monitored during the 
reintroduction project. All California condors are to be given physical 
examinations before being released.
    (ii) If there is any evidence that the condor is in poor health or 
diseased, it will not be released to the wild.
    (iii) Any condor that displays signs of illness, is injured, or 
otherwise needs special care may be captured by authorized personnel of 
the Service, Bureau of Land Management, or appropriate State wildlife 
agency or their agents, and given the appropriate care. These condors 
are to be re-released into the reintroduction area as soon as possible, 
unless physical or behavioral problems make it necessary to keep them in 
captivity for an extended period of time, or permanently.
    (10) The status of the reintroduction project is to receive an 
informal review on an annual basis and a formal evaluation within the 
first 5 years after the initial release, and every 5 years thereafter. 
This evaluation will include, but not be limited to: a review of 
management issues; compliance with agreements; assessment of available 
carrion; dependence of older condors on supplemental food sources; post 
release behavior; causes and rates of mortality; alternative release 
sites; project costs; public acceptance; and accomplishment of recovery 
tasks prescribed in California Condor Recovery Plan. The number of 
variables that could affect this reintroduction project make it 
difficult to develop criteria for success or failure after 5 years. 
However, if after 5 years the project is experiencing a 40 percent or 
greater mortality rate or released condors are not finding food on their 
own, serious consideration will be given to terminating the project.
    (11) The Service does not intend to pursue a change in the 
nonessential experimental population designation to experimental 
essential, threatened, or endangered, or modify the experimental 
population area boundaries without consulting with and obtaining the 
full cooperation of affected parties located within the experimental 
population area, the reintroduction program cooperators identified in 
the memorandum of understanding (MOU) for this program, and the 
cooperators identified in the agreement for this program.
    (i) The Service does not intend to change the status of this 
nonessential population until the California condor is recovered and 
delisted in accordance with the Act or if the reintroduction is not 
successful and the rule is revoked. No designation of critical habitat 
will be made for nonessential populations (16 U.S.C. Sec.  
1539(j)(2)(C)(ii).
    (ii) Legal actions or other circumstances may compel a change in 
this nonessential experimental population's legal status to essential, 
threatened, or endangered, or compel the Service to designate critical 
habitat for the California condors within the experimental population 
area defined in this rule. If this happens, all California condors will 
be removed from the area and this experimental population rule will be 
revoked, unless the parties to the MOU and agreement existing at that 
time agree that the birds should remain in the wild. Changes in the 
legal status and/or removal of this population of California condors 
will be made in compliance with any applicable Federal rulemaking and 
other procedures.

    (k) Mexican gray wolf (Canis lupus baileyi). (1) The Mexican gray 
wolf (Mexican wolf) populations reestablished in the Blue Range Wolf 
Recovery Area and in the White Sands Wolf Recovery Area, if used, within 
the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area, identified in paragraph 
(k)(9) of

[[Page 184]]

this section, are one nonessential experimental population. This 
nonessential experimental population will be managed according to the 
following provisions.
    (2) Based on the best available information, the Service finds that 
reintroduction of an experimental population of Mexican wolves into the 
subspecies' probable historic range will further the conservation of the 
Mexican wolf subspecies and of the gray wolf species; that the 
experimental population is not ``essential,'' under 50 CFR 17.81(c)(2); 
that the experimental population is wholly separate geographically from 
any other wild gray wolf population or individual wild gray wolves; that 
no wild Mexican wolves are known to exist in the experimental population 
area or anywhere else; and that future migration of wild Mexican wolves 
into the experimental population area is not possible.
    (3) No person, agency, or organization may ``take'' [see definition 
in paragraph (k)(15) of this section] any wolf in the wild within the 
Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area, except as provided in this 
rule. The Service may investigate each take of a Mexican wolf and may 
refer the take of a wolf contrary to this rule to the appropriate 
authorities for prosecution.
    (i) Throughout the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area, you 
will not be in violation of the Act or this rule for ``unavoidable and 
unintentional take'' [see definition in paragraph (k)(15) of this 
section] of a wolf. Such take must be non-negligent and incidental to a 
legal activity, such as military training and testing, trapping, 
driving, or recreational activities. You must report the take within 24 
hours to the Service's Mexican Wolf Recovery Coordinator or to a 
designated representative of the Service.
    (ii) Throughout the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area, you 
may ``harass'' [see definition in paragraph (k)(15) of this section ] 
wolves that are within 500 yards of people, buildings, facilities, pets, 
``livestock'' [see definition in paragraph (k)(15) of this section], or 
other domestic animals in an opportunistic, noninjurious manner [see 
definition of ``opportunistic, noninjurious harassment'' in paragraph 
(k)(15) of this section] at any time--provided that wolves cannot be 
purposely attracted, tracked, searched out, or chased and then harassed. 
You must report harassment of wolves within 7 days to the Service's 
Mexican Wolf Recovery Coordinator or to a designated representative of 
the Service.
    (iii) Throughout the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area, 
excluding areas within the national park system and national wildlife 
refuge system, no Federal agency or their contractors will be in 
violation of the Act or this rule for unavoidable or unintentional take 
of a wolf resulting from any action authorized by that Federal agency or 
by the Service, including, but not limited to, military training and 
testing. This provision does not exempt agencies and their contractors 
from complying with sections 7(a)(1) and 7(a)(4) of the Act, the latter 
of which requires a conference with the Service if they propose an 
action that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the 
Mexican wolf.
    (iv) In areas within the national park system and national wildlife 
refuge system, Federal agencies must treat Mexican wolves as a 
threatened species for purposes of complying with section 7 of the Act.
    (v) On private land anywhere within the Mexican Wolf Experimental 
Population Area, livestock owners or their agents may take (including 
kill or injure) any wolf actually ``engaged in the act of killing, 
wounding, or biting livestock'' [see definition in paragraph (k)(15) of 
this section]; provided that evidence of livestock freshly wounded or 
killed by wolves is present; and further provided that the take is 
reported to the Service's Mexican Wolf Recovery Coordinator or a 
designated representative of the Service within 24 hours.
    (vi) On tribal reservation land anywhere within the Mexican Wolf 
Experimental Population Area, livestock owners or their agents may take 
(including kill or injure) any wolf actually engaged in the act of 
killing, wounding, or biting livestock; provided that evidence of 
livestock freshly wounded or killed by wolves is present; and further 
provided that the take is reported to the Service's Mexican Wolf

[[Page 185]]

Recovery Coordinator or a designated representative of the Service 
within 24 hours.
    (vii) On ``public lands'' [see definition in paragraph (k)(15) of 
this section] allotted for grazing anywhere within the Mexican Wolf 
Experimental Population Area, including within the designated ``wolf 
recovery areas'' [see definition in paragraph (k)(15) of this section], 
livestock owners or their agents may be issued a permit under the Act to 
take wolves actually engaged in the act of killing, wounding, or biting 
``livestock'' [see definition in paragraph (k)(15) of this section]. 
Before such a permit is issued, the following conditions must be met--
livestock must be legally present on the grazing allotment; six or more 
``breeding pairs'' [see definition in paragraph (k)(15) of this section] 
of Mexican wolves must be present in the Blue Range Wolf Recovery Area; 
previous loss or injury of livestock on the grazing allotment, caused by 
wolves, must be documented by the Service or our authorized agent; and 
agency efforts to resolve the problem must be completed. Permits issued 
under this provision will be valid for 45 days or less and will specify 
the maximum number of wolves you are allowed to take. If you take a wolf 
under this provision, evidence of livestock freshly wounded or killed by 
wolves must be present. You must report the take to the Service's 
Mexican Wolf Recovery Coordinator or a designated representative of the 
Service within 24 hours.
    (viii) Throughout the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area, 
take of Mexican wolves by livestock guarding dogs, when used in the 
traditional manner to protect livestock on public, tribal, and private 
lands, is permitted. If you become aware that such take by your guard 
dog has occurred, you must report the take to the Service's Mexican Wolf 
Recovery Coordinator or a designated representative of the Service 
within 24 hours.
    (ix) Personnel authorized by the Service may take any Mexican wolf 
in the nonessential experimental population in a manner consistent with 
a Service-approved management plan, special management measure, or a 
valid permit issued by the Service under Sec.  17.32. This may include, 
but is not limited to, capture and translocation of wolves that--prey on 
livestock; attack pets or domestic animals other than livestock on 
private or tribal land; ``impact game populations in ways which may 
inhibit further wolf recovery'' [see definition in paragraph (k)(15) of 
this section]; prey on members of the desert bighorn sheep herd found on 
the White Sands Missile Range and San Andres National Wildlife Refuge so 
long as the State of New Mexico lists it as a species to be protected; 
are considered ``problem wolves'' [see definition in paragraph (k)(15) 
of this section]; are a nuisance; endanger themselves by their presence 
in a military impact area; need aid or veterinary care; or are necessary 
for authorized scientific, research, or management purposes. Lethal 
methods of take may be used when reasonable attempts to capture wolves 
alive fail and when the Service determines that immediate removal of a 
particular wolf or wolves from the wild is necessary. Authorized 
personnel may use leg-hold traps and any other effective device or 
method for capturing or controlling wolves to carry out any measure that 
is a part of a Service-approved management plan, notwithstanding any 
conflicts in State or local law. The disposition of all wolves (live or 
dead) or their parts taken as part of a Service-authorized management 
activity must follow provisions in Service-approved management plans or 
interagency agreements or procedures approved by the Service on a case-
by-case basis.
    (x) As determined by the Service to be appropriate, the Service or 
any agent so authorized by the Service may capture, kill, subject to 
genetic testing, place in captivity, euthanize, or return to the wild 
(if found to be a pure Mexican wolf) any feral wolf-like animal, feral 
wolf hybrid, or feral dog found within the Mexican Wolf Experimental 
Population Area that shows physical or behavioral evidence of 
hybridization with other canids, such as domestic dogs or coyotes; being 
an animal raised in captivity, other than as part of a Service-approved 
wolf recovery program; or being socialized or habituated to humans.

[[Page 186]]

    (xi) The United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service, Wildlife Services (WS) division will 
discontinue use of M-44's and choking-type snares in ``occupied Mexican 
wolf range'' [see definition in paragraph (k)(15) of this section]. The 
WS division may restrict or modify other predator control activities 
pursuant to a cooperative management agreement or a conference between 
the Service and the WS division.
    (xii) You may harass or take a Mexican wolf in self defense or 
defense of the lives of others, provided that you report the harassment 
or take within 24 hours to the Service's Mexican Wolf Recovery 
Coordinator or a designated representative of the Service. If the 
Service or an authorized agency determines that a wolf presents a threat 
to human life or safety, the Service or the authorized agency may kill 
it, capture and euthanize it, or place it in captivity.
    (xiii) Intentional taking of any wolf in the Mexican Wolf 
Experimental Population Area, except as described above, is prohibited. 
The Service encourages those authorized to take wolves to use nonlethal 
means when practicable and appropriate.
    (4) You must not possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever, any wolf or wolf part from 
the experimental population except as authorized in this rule or by a 
valid permit issued by the Service under Sec.  17.32. If you kill or 
injure a wolf or find a dead or injured wolf or wolf parts, you must not 
disturb them (unless instructed to do so by an authorized agent of the 
Service), you must minimize your disturbance of the area around them, 
and you must report the incident to the Service's Mexican Wolf Recovery 
Coordinator or a designated representative of the Service within 24 
hours.
    (5) You must not attempt to commit, solicit another to commit, or 
cause to be committed, any offense defined in this rule.
    (6) No land use restrictions will be imposed on private lands for 
Mexican wolf recovery without the concurrence of the landowner.
    (7) No land use restrictions will be imposed on tribal reservation 
lands for Mexican wolf recovery without the concurrence of the tribal 
government.
    (8) On public lands, the Service and cooperating agencies may 
temporarily restrict human access and ``disturbance-causing land use 
activities'' [see definition in paragraph (k)(15) of this section] 
within a 1-mile radius around release pens when wolves are in them, 
around active dens between March 1 and June 30, and around active wolf 
``rendezvous sites'' [see definition in paragraph 17.84(k)(15) of this 
section] between June 1 and September 30, as necessary.
    (9) The two designated wolf recovery areas and the experimental 
population area for Mexican wolves classified as a nonessential 
experimental population by this rule are described in the following 
subsections. Both designated wolf recovery areas are within the 
subspecies' probable historic range and are wholly separate 
geographically from the current range of any known Mexican wolves or 
other gray wolves.
    (i) The Blue Range Wolf Recovery Area includes all of the Apache 
National Forest and all of the Gila National Forest in east-central 
Arizona and west-central New Mexico (Figure 1). Initial releases of 
captive-raised Mexican wolves will take place, generally as described in 
our Preferred Alternative in the FEIS on Mexican wolf reintroduction, 
within the Blue Range Wolf Recovery Area ``primary recovery zone'' [see 
definition in paragraph (k)(15) of this section]. This is the area 
within the Apache National Forest bounded on the north by the Apache-
Greenlee County line; on the east by the Arizona-New Mexico state line; 
on the south by the San Francisco River (eastern half) and the southern 
boundary of the Apache National Forest (western half); and on the west 
by the Greenlee-Graham County line (San Carlos Apache Reservation 
boundary). The Service will allow the wolf population to expand into the 
Blue Range Wolf Recovery Area ``secondary recovery zone'' [see 
definition in paragraph (k)(15) of this section], which is the remainder 
of the Blue Range Wolf Recovery Area not in the primary recovery zone.

    (ii) The White Sands Wolf Recovery Area in south-central New Mexico 
includes all of the White Sands Missile Range; the White Sands National 
Monument; the San Andres National Wildlife Refuge; and the area adjacent 
and to the west of the Missile Range bounded on the south by the 
southerly

[[Page 188]]

boundary of the USDA Jornada Experimental Range and the northern 
boundary of the New Mexico State University Animal Science Ranch, on the 
west by the New Mexico Principal Meridian, on the north by the Pedro 
Armendaris Grant boundary and the Sierra-Socorro County line, and on the 
east by the western boundary of the Missile Range (Figure 2). This is 
the back-up reintroduction area, to be used only if later determined to 
be both necessary and feasible in accordance with the Preferred 
Alternative as set forth in the FEIS on Mexican wolf reintroduction. If 
this area is used, initial releases of captive-raised wolves would take 
place within the White Sands Wolf Recovery Area primary recovery zone. 
This is the area within the White Sands Missile Range bounded on the 
north by the road from the former Cain Ranch Head quarters to Range Road 
16, Range Road 16 to its intersection with Range Road 13, Range Road 13 
to its intersection with Range Road 7; on the east by Range Road 7; on 
the south by Highway 70; and on the west by the Missile Range boundary. 
The Service would allow the wolf population to expand into the White 
Sands Wolf Recovery Area secondary recovery zone, which is the remainder 
of the White Sands Wolf Recovery Area not in the primary recovery zone.

    (iii) The boundaries of the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population 
Area are the portion of Arizona lying north of Interstate Highway 10 and 
south of Interstate Highway 40; the portion of New Mexico lying north of 
Interstate Highway 10 in the west, north of the New Mexico-Texas 
boundary in the

[[Page 190]]

east, and south of Interstate Highway 40; and the portion of Texas lying 
north of United States Highway 62/180 and south of the Texas-New Mexico 
boundary (Figure 3). The Service is not proposing wolf reestablishment 
throughout this area, but only within the Blue Range Wolf Recovery Area, 
and possibly later in the White Sands Wolf Recovery Area, respectively 
described in paragraphs (k)(9) (i) and (ii) of this section. If a member 
of the nonessential experimental population is captured inside the 
Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area, but outside the designated 
wolf recovery areas, it will be re-released within the recovery area, 
put into the captive population, or otherwise managed according to 
provisions of a Service-approved management plan or action. If a wolf is 
found in the United States outside the boundaries of the Mexican Wolf 
Experimental Population Area (and not within any other wolf experimental 
population area) the Service will presume it to be of wild origin with 
full endangered status (or threatened in Minnesota) under the Act, 
unless evidence, such as a radio collar, identification mark, or 
physical or behavioral traits (see paragraph (k)(3)(x) of this section), 
establishes otherwise. If such evidence exists, the Service or an 
authorized agency will attempt to promptly capture the wolf and re-
release it within the recovery area, put it into the captive population, 
or carry out any other management measure authorized by this rule or a 
Service-approved management plan. Such a wolf is otherwise not subject 
to this rule outside the designated Mexican Wolf Experimental Population 
Area.

[[Page 191]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR12JA98.004

    (10) If Mexican wolves of the experimental population occur on 
public lands outside the designated wolf recovery area(s), but within 
the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area, the Service or an 
authorized agency will attempt to capture any radio-collared lone wolf 
and any lone wolf or

[[Page 192]]

member of an established pack causing livestock ``depredations'' [see 
definition in paragraph (k)(15) of this section]. The agencies will not 
routinely capture and return pack members that make occasional forays 
onto public land outside the designated wolf recovery area(s) and 
uncollared lone wolves on public land. However, the Service will capture 
and return to a recovery area or to captivity packs from the 
nonessential experimental population that establish territories on 
public land wholly outside the designated wolf recovery area(s).
    (11) If any wolves move onto private land outside the designated 
recovery area(s), but within the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population 
Area, the Service or an authorized agency will develop management 
actions in cooperation with the landowner including capture and removal 
of the wolf or wolves if requested by the landowner.
    (12) If any wolves move onto tribal reservation land outside the 
designated recovery area(s), but within the Mexican Wolf Experimental 
Population Area, the Service or an authorized agency will develop 
management actions in cooperation with the tribal government including 
capture and removal of the wolf or wolves if requested by the tribal 
government.
    (13) The Service will evaluate Mexican wolf reintroduction progress 
and prepare periodic progress reports, detailed annual reports, and full 
evaluations after 3 and 5 years that recommend continuation, 
modification, or termination of the reintroduction effort.
    (14) The Service does not intend to change the ``nonessential 
experimental'' designation to ``essential experimental,'' 
``threatened,'' or ``endangered'' and foresees no likely situation which 
would result in such changes. Critical habitat cannot be designated 
under the nonessential experimental classification, 16 U.S.C. 
1539(j)(2)(C)(ii).
    (15) Definitions. Key terms used in this rule have the following 
definitions.
    Breeding pair means an adult male and an adult female wolf that have 
produced at least two pups during the previous breeding season that 
survived until December 31 of the year of their birth.
    Depredation means the confirmed killing or wounding of lawfully 
present domestic livestock by one or more wolves. The Service, WS, or 
other Service-authorized agencies will confirm cases of wolf depredation 
on domestic livestock.
    Disturbance-causing land use activity means any land use activity 
that the Service determines could adversely affect reproductive success, 
natural behavior, or survival of Mexican wolves. These activities may be 
temporarily restricted within a 1-mile radius of release pens, active 
dens, and rendezvous sites. Such activities may include, but are not 
limited to--timber or wood harvesting, management-ignited fire, mining 
or mine development, camping outside designated campgrounds, livestock 
drives, off-road vehicle use, hunting, and any other use or activity 
with the potential to disturb wolves. The following activities are 
specifically excluded from this definition--
    (1) Legally permitted livestock grazing and use of water sources by 
livestock;
    (2) Livestock drives if no reasonable alternative route or timing 
exists;
    (3) Vehicle access over established roads to private property and to 
areas on public land where legally permitted activities are ongoing if 
no reasonable alternative route exists;
    (4) Use of lands within the national park or national wildlife 
refuge systems as safety buffer zones for military activities;
    (5) Prescribed natural fire except in the vicinity of release pens; 
and
    (6) Any authorized, specific land use that was active and ongoing at 
the time wolves chose to locate a den or rendezvous site nearby.
    Engaged in the act of killing, wounding, or biting livestock means 
to be engaged in the pursuit and grasping, biting, attacking, wounding, 
or feeding upon livestock that are alive. If wolves are observed feeding 
on a livestock carcass, you cannot assume that wolves killed the 
livestock because livestock can die from many causes and wolves will 
feed on carrion.
    Harass means ``intentional or negligent act or omission which 
creates the likelihood of injury to the wildlife by annoying it to such 
an extent as to

[[Page 193]]

significantly disrupt normal behavioral patterns which include, but are 
not limited to, breeding, feeding, or sheltering'' (50 CFR 17.3). This 
experimental population rule permits only ``opportunistic, noninjurious 
harassment'' (see definition below).
    Impact on game populations in ways which may inhibit further wolf 
recovery. The Service encourages states and tribes to define 
unacceptable impacts from wolf predation on game populations in Service-
approved management plans. Until such time the term will mean the 
following--2 consecutive years with a cumulative 35 percent decrease in 
population or hunter harvest estimates for a particular species of 
ungulate in a game management unit or distinct herd segment compared to 
the pre-wolf 5-year average (unit or herd must contain average of 
greater than 100 animals). If wolf predation is shown to be a primary 
cause of ungulate population declines (greater than 50 percent of 
documented adult or young mortality), then wolves may be moved to reduce 
ungulate mortality rates and assist in herd recovery, but only in 
conjunction with application of other common, professionally acceptable, 
wildlife management techniques.
    Livestock means cattle, sheep, horses, mules, and burros or other 
domestic animals defined as livestock in State and Tribal wolf 
management plans approved by the Service.
    Occupied Mexican wolf range means an area of confirmed presence of 
resident breeding packs or pairs of wolves or area consistently used by 
at least one resident wolf over a period of at least one month. The 
Service must confirm or corroborate wolf presence. Exact delineation of 
the area will be described by:
    (1) 5-mile (8 km) radius around all locations of wolves and wolf 
sign confirmed as described above (nonradio-monitored);
    (2) 5-mile (8 km) radius around radio locations of resident wolves 
when fewer than 20 radio locations are available (for radio-monitored 
wolves only); or
    (3) 3-mile (4.8 km) radius around the convex polygon developed from 
more than 20 radio locations of a pack, pair, or single wolf acquired 
over a period of at least 6 months (for radio-monitored wolves).
    This definition applies only within the Mexican Wolf Experimental 
Population Area.
    Opportunistic, noninjurious harassment (see ``harass'') means as the 
wolf presents itself (for example, the wolf travels onto and is observed 
on private land or near livestock). This is the only type of harassment 
permitted by this rule. You cannot track, attract, search out, or chase 
a wolf and then harass it. Any harassment must not cause bodily injury 
or death to the wolf. The basic intent of harassment permitted by this 
rule is to scare wolves away from the immediate area. It is limited to 
approaching wolves and discharging firearms or other projectile 
launching devices in proximity to but not in the direction of wolves; 
throwing objects in the general direction of but not at wolves; or 
making any loud noise in proximity to wolves.
    Primary recovery zone means an area where the Service--
    (1) Will release captive-raised Mexican wolves,
    (2) May return and re-release previously released Mexican wolves,
    (3) May release translocated wild-born Mexican wolves, and
    (4) Will actively support recovery of the reintroduced population.
    Problem wolves means wolves that--
    (1) Have depredated lawfully present domestic livestock,
    (2) Are members of a group or pack (including adults, yearlings, and 
young-of-the-year) that were directly involved in livestock 
depredations,
    (3) Were fed by or are dependent upon adults involved with livestock 
depredations (because young animals will likely acquire the pack's 
livestock depredation habits),
    (4) Have depredated domestic animals other than livestock on private 
or tribal lands, two times in an area within one year, or
    (5) Are habituated to humans, human residences, or other facilities.
    Public land means land under administration of Federal agencies 
including, but not limited to the National Park Service, Bureau of Land 
Management,

[[Page 194]]

Fish and Wildlife Service, Forest Service, Department of Energy, and 
Department of Defense; and State-owned lands within the boundary of a 
designated wolf recovery area. All State-owned lands within the boundary 
of the experimental population area, but outside designated wolf 
recovery areas, will be subject to the provisions of this rule that 
apply to private lands.
    Rendezvous site means a gathering and activity area regularly used 
by a litter of young wolf pups after they have emerged from the den. 
Typically, the site is used for a period ranging from about one week to 
one month in the summer. Several sites may be used in succession.
    Secondary recovery zone means an area adjacent to a primary recovery 
zone in which the Service allows released wolves to disperse, where 
wolves captured in the wild for authorized management purposes may be 
translocated and released, and where managers will actively support 
recovery of the reintroduced population.
    Take means``to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, 
capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct'' (16 
U.S.C. 1532(19)). Also, see definitions of ``harass'', ``opportunistic, 
noninjurious harassment'', and ``unavoidable and unintentional take.''
    Unavoidable and unintentional take means accidental, unintentional 
take (see definition of ``Take'') which occurs despite reasonable care, 
is incidental to an otherwise lawful activity, and is not done on 
purpose. Examples would be striking a wolf with an automobile and 
catching a wolf in a trap outside of known occupied wolf range. Taking a 
wolf with a trap, snare, or other type of capture device within occupied 
wolf range (except as authorized in paragraph (k)(3)(ix) and (x) of this 
section) will not be considered unavoidable, accidental, or 
unintentional take, unless due care was exercised to avoid taking a 
wolf. Taking a wolf by shooting will not be considered unavoidable, 
accidental, or unintentional take. Shooters have the responsibility to 
be sure of their targets.
    Wolf recovery area means a designated area where managers will 
actively support reestablishment of Mexican wolf populations.
    (l) Grizzly bear (Ursus arctos). (1) Where does this special rule 
apply? The special rule in this paragraph (l) applies to the designated 
Bitterroot Grizzly Bear Experimental Population Area (Experimental 
Population Area), which is found within the species' historic range and 
is defined as follows:

    The boundaries of the Experimental Population Area are delineated by 
U.S. 93 from its junction with the Bitterroot River near Missoula, 
Montana, to Challis, Idaho; Idaho 75 from Challis to Stanley, Idaho; 
Idaho 21 from Stanley to Lowman, Idaho; State Highway 17 from Lowman to 
Banks, Idaho; Idaho 55 from Banks to New Meadows, Idaho; U.S. 95 from 
New Meadows to Coeur d'Alene, Idaho; Interstate 90 from Coeur d'Alene, 
Idaho, to its junction with the Clark Fork River near St. Regis, 
Montana; the Clark Fork River from its junction with Interstate 90 near 
St. Regis to its confluence with the Bitterroot River near Missoula, 
Montana; and the Bitterroot River from its confluence with the Clark 
Fork River to its junction with U.S. Highway 93, near Missoula, Montana 
(See map at the end of this paragraph (l)).

    (2) What is the legal status of the grizzly bear? (i) The grizzly 
bear is listed as ``threatened'' in Sec.  17.11 (h) and protected under 
this part. However, the grizzly bear population to which this paragraph 
(l) applies is considered a nonessential experimental population in 
accordance with section 10(j) of the Act.
    (ii) We have determined that, as of December 18, 2000, no grizzly 
bear population exists in the Experimental Population Area. We find, in 
accordance with Sec.  17.81 (b), that the reintroduction of grizzly 
bears as a nonessential experimental population, as defined in Sec.  
17.81 (b), will further the conservation of the species and will be 
consistent with provisions of section 10(j) of the Act, which requires 
that an experimental population be geographically separate from other 
nonexperimental populations of the same species. We also find, in 
accordance with Sec.  17.81 (c)(2), that the experimental population of 
grizzly bears in the Experimental Population Area is not essential to 
the survival of the species in the wild.
    (iii) Grizzly bears within the Experimental Population Area and the 
Recovery Area will be accommodated

[[Page 195]]

through management provisions provided for in this paragraph (l) and 
through management plans and policies developed by the Citizen 
Management Committee (Committee; see paragraph (l)(6) of this section). 
After reintroduction, every grizzly bear found within the Experimental 
Population Area will be considered a member of the nonessential 
experimental population.
    (iv) In the conterminous United States, a grizzly bear that is 
outside the Experimental Population Area identified in paragraph (l)(1) 
of this section will be considered as threatened.
    (3) Where will grizzly bears be released, and where will recovery be 
emphasized? The Bitterroot Grizzly Bear Recovery Area identifies the 
area of recovery emphasis within the Experimental Population Area. The 
Recovery Area consists of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness and the Frank 
Church-River of No Return Wilderness (See map at the end of paragraph 
(l) of this section). All reintroductions will take place in the Selway-
Bitterroot Wilderness unless it is later determined that reintroduction 
in the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness is appropriate. If, in 
the future, new wilderness areas are designated adjacent to the Recovery 
Area, the Committee may recommend to the Secretary their addition to the 
Recovery Area. The Secretary would have to amend this paragraph (l) to 
change the definition of the Recovery Area.
    (4) What activities are prohibited in the Experimental Population 
Area? (i) You may not take (see definition in Sec.  10.12 of this 
subchapter) any grizzly bear in the Experimental Population Area, except 
as provided in this paragraph (l). We may refer unauthorized take of 
grizzly bears to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.
    (ii) You may not possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever any grizzly bear or parts 
thereof that are taken from the Experimental Population Area or 
possessed in violation of the regulations in this paragraph (l) or in 
violation of applicable State wildlife conservation laws or regulations 
or the Act.
    (iii) You may not attempt to commit, solicit another to commit, or 
cause to be committed, any offense defined in this paragraph (l).
    (5) What activities are allowed in the Experimental Population Area? 
(i) For purposes of this paragraph (l), except for persons engaged in 
hunting or shooting activities, you will not be in violation of the Act 
for ``unavoidable and unintentional take'' (see definition in paragraph 
(l)(16) of this section) of grizzly bears within the Experimental 
Population Area when such take is incidental to a legal activity and is 
not a result of negligent conduct lacking reasonable due care, and when 
due care was exercised to avoid the taking. Any taking must be reported 
within 24 hours to appropriate authorities as listed in paragraph 
(l)(5)(iii) of this section. Persons lawfully engaged in hunting or 
shooting activities must correctly identify their target before shooting 
in order to avoid illegally shooting a grizzly bear. Shooting a grizzly 
bear as a result of mistaking it for another species is considered a 
lack of reasonable due care. The act of taking a grizzly bear that is 
wrongly identified as another species may be referred to appropriate 
authorities for prosecution.
    (ii) Any person with a valid permit issued by us may take grizzly 
bears in the Experimental Population Area for scientific purposes, the 
enhancement of propagation or survival of the species, zoological 
exhibition, and other conservation purposes. Such permits must be 
consistent with the Act, with management plans adopted for the 
nonessential experimental population, and with applicable State wildlife 
conservation laws and regulations.
    (iii) You may take grizzly bears in the Experimental Population Area 
in self-defense or in defense of the lives of others. Such taking must 
be reported within 24 hours as to date, exact location, and 
circumstances to the Grizzly Bear Recovery Coordinator, University Hall, 
Room 309, University of Montana, Missoula, Montana 59812 (406-243-4903); 
or the Assistant Regional Director for Law Enforcement, Eastside Federal 
Complex, 911 NE 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232-4181 (503-231-6125); 
or the Assistant Regional Director for

[[Page 196]]

Law Enforcement, P.O. Box 25486, DFC, Denver, Colorado 80225 (303-236-
7540); and either the Idaho Department of Fish and Game, P.O. Box 25, 
Boise Idaho 83707 (208-334-3700); or the Montana Department of Fish, 
Wildlife and Parks, 1420 E. Sixth Avenue, Helena, Montana 59620 (406-
444-2535); and Nez Perce Tribal authorities (208-843-2253) (as 
appropriate).
    (iv) Livestock owners may obtain a permit from the Service, and the 
Idaho Department of Fish and Game, the Montana Department of Fish, 
Wildlife and Parks, or appropriate Tribal authorities to harass (see 
definition in Sec.  17.3) grizzly bears found in the Experimental 
Population Area that are actually pursuing or killing livestock (to 
include permitting the use of livestock guard dogs around livestock to 
harass such grizzly bears). Prior to issuance of such a permit, 
authorized State, Federal, or Tribal officials must document pursuit or 
killing of livestock. All such harassment must be accomplished by an 
opportunistic, noninjurious method (see definition of ``opportunistic, 
noninjurious harassment'' in paragraph (l)(16) of this section) to the 
grizzly bear, and such harassment must be reported within 24 hours as to 
date, exact location, and circumstances to the authorities listed under 
paragraph (l)(5)(iii) of this section.
    (v) Livestock owners may obtain a permit from the Service, and the 
Idaho Department of Fish and Game, the Montana Department of Fish, 
Wildlife and Parks or appropriate Tribal authorities to take grizzly 
bears on private lands found in the Experimental Population Area in a 
manner other than harassment as defined in this paragraph (l), in order 
to protect livestock actually pursued or being killed on private 
property. Prior to issuance of such a permit, authorized State, Federal, 
or Tribal officials must document pursuit or killing of livestock. Any 
response protocol established by the Committee must have been satisfied 
and efforts to capture depredating grizzly bears by Service or State or 
Tribal wildlife agency personnel must have proven unsuccessful. All such 
taking must be reported as to date, exact location, and circumstances 
within 24 hours to the authorities listed under paragraph (l)(5)(iii) of 
this section.
    (vi) Any authorized employee or agent of the Service or appropriate 
State wildlife agency or Nez Perce Tribe who is lawfully designated for 
such purposes, when acting in the course of official duties, may take a 
grizzly bear from the wild in the Experimental Population Area if such 
action is necessary to:
    (A) Aid a sick, injured, or orphaned grizzly bear;
    (B) Dispose of a dead grizzly bear, or salvage a dead grizzly bear 
that may be useful for scientific study;
    (C) Take a grizzly bear that constitutes a demonstrable but 
nonimmediate threat to human safety or that is responsible for 
depredations to lawfully present domestic animals or other personal 
property, if otherwise eliminating such depredation or loss of personal 
property has not been possible, and after eliminating such threat by 
live-capturing and releasing the grizzly bear unharmed in the area 
defined in paragraph (l)(2) of this section or other areas approved by 
the Committee has been demonstrated not to be possible;
    (D) Move a grizzly bear for genetic management purposes;
    (E) Relocate grizzly bears within the Experimental Population Area 
to improve grizzly bear survival and recovery prospects; or (F) Relocate 
a grizzly bear to avoid conflict with human activities. However, grizzly 
bears in the Experimental Population Area will not be disturbed unless 
they demonstrate a real and imminent threat to human safety, livestock, 
or bees. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, this rule provides 
that on private lands outside the national forest boundary in the 
Bitterroot Valley, Montana (exclusion area), any human/grizzly conflicts 
will be considered unacceptable. Grizzly bear occupancy will be 
discouraged in the exclusion area, and grizzly bears found there will be 
captured and returned to the Recovery Area, or placed in captivity, or 
destroyed, depending on the history of each bear. If a grizzly bear 
enters the exclusion area, State and Federal wildlife management 
agencies will attempt to capture it immediately and notify the public of 
its presence as soon as possible. The public

[[Page 197]]

will be kept updated until the bear is caught. Further, any grizzly bear 
that occupies inhabited human settlement areas on private land within 
the Experimental Population Area that, in the judgment of the management 
agencies or Committee, presents a clear threat to human safety or whose 
behavior indicates that it may become habituated to humans, will be 
relocated or destroyed by management agencies.
    (6) How will local citizens be involved in the management of the 
Bitterroot nonessential experimental grizzly bear population? (i) The 
Secretary will establish a Citizen Management Committee for the 
Bitterroot grizzly bear experimental population and will authorize 
management implementation responsibility as described in paragraph 
(l)(9) of this section, in consultation with the Governors of Idaho and 
Montana. As soon as possible after the effective date of this rule, the 
Secretary will organize the Committee by requesting nominations of 
citizen members from the Governors of Idaho and Montana and the Nez 
Perce Tribe and nominations of agency members by represented agencies.
    (ii) The Committee will be composed of 15 members serving 6-year 
terms. Appointments may initially be of lesser terms to ensure staggered 
replacement.
    (A) Membership will consist of seven individuals appointed by the 
Secretary based upon the recommendations of the Governor of Idaho, five 
members appointed by the Secretary based upon the recommendations of the 
Governor of Montana, one member representing the Nez Perce Tribe 
appointed by the Secretary based on the recommendation of the Nez Perce 
Tribe, one member representing the Forest Service appointed by the 
Secretary of Agriculture, and one member representing the Fish and 
Wildlife Service appointed by the Secretary. Members recommended by the 
Governors of Idaho and Montana will be based on the recommendations of 
interested parties and will include at least one representative each 
from the appropriate State wildlife agencies. If either Governor or the 
Tribe fails to make recommendations within 60 days, the Secretary (or 
his/her designee) will accept recommendations from interested parties, 
and will make the appointments.
    (B) The Committee will consist of a cross-section of interests 
reflecting a balance of viewpoints, and members are to be selected for 
their diversity of knowledge and experience in natural resource issues, 
and for their commitment to collaborative decision-making. In their 
recommendations to the Secretary, the Governors of Idaho and Montana 
will attach written documentation of the qualifications of those 
nominated relating to their knowledge of, and experience in, natural 
resource issues and their commitment to collaborative decision-making.
    (C) Except for the representatives from Federal agencies, the 
Committee will be selected from communities within and adjacent to the 
Recovery and Experimental Population Areas.
    (D) The Secretary will fill vacancies as they occur with the 
appropriate members based on the recommendation of the appropriate 
Governor, the Nez Perce Tribe, or agency.
    (7) Will independent scientific information be readily available to 
the Committee? The Secretary will appoint two scientific advisors to the 
Committee as nonvoting members to attend all meetings of the Committee 
and to provide scientific expertise to the Committee. These scientific 
advisors will not be employed by Federal agencies involved in grizzly 
bear recovery. The Secretary will contact the Wildlife Society Chapters 
in Idaho and Montana and the Universities of Idaho and Montana for 
nominations and will select one wildlife scientist representing each 
State and appoint them as advisors to the Committee.
    (8) What is the overall mission of the Committee, and how will it 
operate? (i) The mission of the Committee is to facilitate recovery of 
the grizzly bear in the Bitterroot ecosystem by assisting in 
implementing the Bitterroot ecosystem chapter of the recovery plan 
(Bitterroot Ecosystem Recovery Plan Chapter--Supplement to the Grizzly 
Bear Recovery Plan, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Missoula, Montana, 
1996). The Committee will make recommendations to land and wildlife 
management agencies that it believes will lead to recovery of the 
grizzly

[[Page 198]]

bear. Decisions on, and implementation of, these recommendations are the 
responsibility of the land and wildlife management agencies.
    (ii) The Committee will meet a minimum of two times per year. These 
meetings will be open to the public. Additionally, the committee will 
provide reasonable public notice of meetings, produce and provide 
written minutes of meetings to interested persons, and involve the 
public in its decision-making process. This public participation process 
will allow members of the public and/or special interest groups to have 
input to Committee decisions and management actions.
    (9) What authority will the Committee have, and what will be its 
primary tasks? The Committee will have the authority and the 
responsibility to carry out the following functions:
    (i) Developing a process for obtaining the best biological, social, 
and economic data. This process will include an explicit mechanism for 
soliciting peer-reviewed, scientific articles on grizzly bears and their 
management, and holding periodic public meetings not less than every 2 
years, in which qualified scientists may submit comments to and be 
questioned by the Committee. The two scientific advisors will lead this 
process. The Committee will base its decisions upon the best scientific 
and commercial data available. All decisions of the Committee, including 
components of its management plans, must lead toward recovery of the 
grizzly bear in the Bitterroot ecosystem and minimize social and 
economic impacts to the extent practicable within the context of the 
existing recovery goals for the species.
    (ii) Soliciting technical advice and guidance from outside experts. 
The scientific advisors will lead the development of an ongoing process 
to provide the Committee with the best scientific and commercial data 
available. The scientific advisors will provide this information in the 
form of peer-reviewed scientific articles on grizzly bears and their 
management, Committee meetings with presentations by scientific experts, 
and requests to State and Federal management agencies and the private 
sector for scientific expertise and advice.
    (iii) Implementing the Bitterroot Ecosystem Chapter of the Grizzly 
Bear Recovery Plan consistent with this paragraph (l). The Committee 
will develop recommendations on existing management plans and policies 
of land and wildlife management agencies, as necessary, for the 
management of grizzly bears in the Experimental Population Area. The 
Committee will make recommendations to land and wildlife management 
agencies regarding changes to plans and policies, but the final decision 
on implementation of those recommendations will be made by those 
agencies. If Committee recommendations require significant changes to 
existing plans and policy, and the agencies tentatively agree to accept 
those recommendations, then the requirements of the National 
Environmental Policy Act may apply. Such management plans and policies 
will be in accordance with applicable State and Federal laws. The 
Committee will give full consideration to Service comments and opinions 
and those of the Forest Service, Idaho Department of Fish and Game, the 
Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, and the Nez Perce Tribe.
    (iv) Providing means by which the public may participate in, review, 
and comment on the decisions of the Committee. The Committee must 
thoroughly consider and respond to public input prior to making 
decisions.
    (v) Developing its internal processes, where appropriate, such as 
governance, decision-making, quorum, terms of members, officers, meeting 
schedules and location, public notice of meetings, and minutes.
    (vi) Requesting staff support from the Service, the Idaho Department 
of Fish and Game, Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, Forest 
Service, other affected Federal agencies, and the Nez Perce Tribe, when 
necessary to perform administrative functions, and requesting 
reimbursement from us for non-Federal Committee members for costs 
associated with travel, lodging, and incidentals.
    (vii) Reviewing existing grizzly bear standards and guidelines used 
by the Forest Service and other agencies and landowners. The Committee 
will perform an annual review of grizzly bear

[[Page 199]]

mortalities and the number and location of bear/human conflicts. This 
review will be the primary mechanism to assess the adequacy of existing 
management techniques and standards. If the Committee deems such 
standards and guidelines inadequate for recovery of grizzly bears, the 
Committee may recommend changes to the Forest Service and other agencies 
and landowners.
    (viii) Developing grizzly bear guidance for proper camping and 
sanitation within the Experimental Population Area and making 
recommendations to land management agencies for adoption of such 
guidelines. Existing camping and sanitation procedures developed in 
other ecosystems with grizzly bears will serve as a basis for such 
guidelines.
    (ix) Developing a protocol for responding to grizzly/human 
encounters, livestock depredations, damage to lawfully present property, 
and other grizzly/human conflicts within the Experimental Population 
Area. Any response protocol developed by the Committee will have to 
undergo public comment and be revised as appropriate based on comments 
received. Any conflicts or mortalities associated with these activities 
will result in review by the Committee to determine what the Committee 
may do to help prevent future conflicts or mortalities. The Committee 
will recommend, as necessary, policy changes on trail restrictions for 
human safety to appropriate wildlife and land management agencies.
    (x) Recommending to the Service changes to recovery criteria, 
including mortality limits, population determinations, and other 
criteria for recovery as appropriate.
    (xi) Reviewing all human-caused grizzly bear mortalities to 
determine whether new measures for avoiding future occurrences are 
required and make recommendations on such measures to appropriate land 
and wildlife management agencies. If grizzly bear mortalities occur as a 
result of black bear hunting, the Committee will work with the State 
Fish and Game Departments in both Idaho and Montana to develop solutions 
to minimize the effects on grizzly bears of black bear hunting.
    (xii) Developing strategies to emphasize recovery inside the 
Recovery Area and to accommodate grizzly bears inside other areas of the 
Experimental Population Area.
    (A) Grizzly bears may range outside the Recovery Area because 
grizzly bear habitat exists throughout the Experimental Population Area. 
The Committee will not recommend that bears be disturbed or moved unless 
conflicts are both significant and cannot be corrected as determined by 
the Committee. This provision includes conflicts associated with 
livestock, for which the Committee will develop strategies to discourage 
grizzly bear occupancy in portions of the Experimental Population Area 
outside of the Recovery Area.
    (B) Unless the Committee determines otherwise, this rule provides 
that private land outside the national forest boundary in the Bitterroot 
Valley, Montana (exclusion area), is an area where any human/grizzly 
conflicts will be considered unacceptable. Grizzly bear occupancy will 
be discouraged in these areas, and grizzly bears will be captured and 
returned to the Recovery Area. If a grizzly bear enters the exclusion 
area, State and Federal wildlife management agencies will attempt to 
capture it immediately and notify the public of its presence as soon as 
possible. The public will be kept updated until the bear is caught. 
Further, any grizzly bear that occupies the exclusion area or other 
inhabited human settlement areas on private land within the Experimental 
Population Area that, in the judgment of the management agencies or 
Committee, presents a clear threat to human safety or whose behavior 
indicates that it may become habituated to humans, will be relocated or 
destroyed by management agencies.
    (xiii) Establishing standards for determining whether the 
experimental reintroduction has been successful and making 
recommendations on the inclusion of such standards in the Grizzly Bear 
Recovery Plan. These standards will be based on the best scientific and 
commercial information available and will reflect that, absent 
extraordinary circumstances, the success or failure of the program 
cannot be measured in

[[Page 200]]

fewer than 20 years. General guidelines for the standards by which 
failure will be measured include, but are not limited to, one or more of 
the following conditions:
    (A) If, within the number of years established by the Committee 
following initial reintroduction, no relocated grizzly bear remains 
within the Experimental Population Area and the reasons for emigration 
or mortality cannot be identified and/or remedied; or
    (B) If, within the number of years established by the Committee 
following initial reintroduction, no cubs of the year or yearlings exist 
and the relocated bears are not showing signs of successful reproduction 
as evidenced by no cubs of the year or yearlings.
    (xiv) Developing procedures for the expeditious issuance of permits 
described in paragraphs (l)(5)(iv) and (l)(5)(v) of this section, and 
making recommendations on such procedures to appropriate agencies.
    (xv) Developing 2-year work plans for the recovery effort for 
submittal to the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (l)(11)(i) of this 
section.
    (xvi) Establishing, based on the best available science, a refined 
interim recovery goal for the Bitterroot Ecosystem Chapter of the 
Grizzly Bear Recovery Plan and a final recovery goal when sufficient 
information is available and after grizzly bears are reintroduced and 
occupy suitable habitats in the Experimental Population Area. As this 
information becomes available, the Committee may recommend the recovery 
goal to the Secretary along with procedures for determining how this 
goal will be measured. The recovery goal for the Bitterroot grizzly bear 
population will be consistent with the habitat available within the 
Recovery Area. Additional adjacent areas of public land can be 
considered for contribution of suitable habitat when setting the 
recovery goal if additional land is shown to be necessary by the best 
scientific and commercial data available. Any recommendations for 
revised recovery goals developed by the Committee will require public 
review and our approval as appropriate prior to revision of any recovery 
plan. Grizzly bears outside the Recovery Area and within the 
Experimental Population Area can contribute to meeting the recovery goal 
if their long-term occupancy in such habitats outside the Recovery Area 
is reasonably certain.
    (10) What agencies will be responsible for day-to-day management 
activities? The Idaho Department of Fish and Game, the Montana 
Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, the Nez Perce Tribe, and the 
Forest Service, in coordination with us, will exercise day-to-day 
management responsibility within the Experimental Population Area in 
accordance with this paragaraph (l). The Service and these cooperating 
agencies will share management responsibility as per agreements with, 
and in consideration of, recommendations from the Committee.
    (11) How will progress of the Committee be monitored; and what 
process will be followed by the Secretary to resolve disputes over 
whether Committee actions are leading to recovery? (i) The Secretary or 
our representative on the Committee will review the Committee's 2-year 
work plans (see paragraph (l)(9)(xv) of this section). If the Secretary 
determines, through our representative on the Committee, that the 
Committee's decisions, work plans, or the implementation of those plans 
are not leading to the recovery of the grizzly bear within the 
Experimental Population Area or are not in compliance with this 
paragraph (l), our representative will ask the Committee to determine 
whether such a decision, plan, or implementation of a plan is leading to 
recovery and is in compliance with this paragraph (l). The Secretary, 
who retains final responsibility and authority for implementation of the 
Act, will review the Committee's determination, as provided in 
paragraphs (l)(11)(ii) through (iv) of this section, and then make a 
final determination. Should the Secretary find that a decision, work 
plan, or implementation of a plan by the Committee is inadequate for 
recovery of the grizzly bear or is not in compliance with this paragraph 
(l), the Secretary may assume lead management responsibility.
    (ii) The Service representative will consider Committee input before 
making any determination that Committee actions are not leading to 
recovery or

[[Page 201]]

are not in compliance with this paragraph (l). In the event that our 
representative on the Committee determines that the actions of the 
Committee are not leading to recovery of the Bitterroot grizzly bear 
population or are not in compliance with this paragraph (l), he or she 
will recommend to the Committee, based on the best scientific and 
commercial data available, alternative or corrective actions and provide 
6 months for the Committee to accomplish those actions. Should the 
Committee reject these corrective actions, our representative will 
convene a Scientific Review Panel of three and will submit to the panel 
for review those Committee actions or decisions that he or she has 
determined are not leading to recovery or are not in compliance with 
this paragrpah (l). The Service representative will consider the views 
of all Committee members prior to convening a Scientific Review Panel.
    (iii) Members of the Scientific Review Panel will be professional 
scientists who have had no involvement with the Committee and are not 
employed by Federal agencies responsible for grizzly bear recovery 
efforts. The Secretary will select one member of the panel, and the 
Governors of Idaho and Montana in consultation with the Universities of 
Idaho and Montana (respectively), will select one panel member each. The 
Scientific Review Panel will review Committee actions or decisions, 
solicit additional information if necessary and, using the best 
scientific and commercial data available, make timely recommendations to 
the Committee as to whether Committee actions will lead to recovery of 
the grizzly bear in the Bitterroot ecosystem and are in compliance with 
paragraph (l). Examples of Committee actions, decisions, or lack of 
actions that can be submitted to the Scientific Review Panel include, 
but are not limited to, the following: sufficiency of public involvement 
in Committee activities; decisions involving sanitation and outreach 
activities; management of nuisance bears; adequacy of recommendations to 
land and wildlife management agencies; adequacy of Committee actions in 
addressing issues such as excessive human-caused grizzly bear mortality; 
and other actions important to recovery of the grizzly bear in the 
Bitterroot ecosystem. Committee compliance with paragraph (l) provides 
the basis for the recommendations of the Scientific Review Panel.
    (iv) If, after timely review, the Committee rejects the 
recommendations of the Scientific Review Panel, and our representative 
determines that Committee actions are not leading to recovery of the 
Bitterroot population, he or she will notify the Secretary. The 
Secretary will review the Panel's recommendations and determine the 
disposition of the Committee.
    (A) If the Secretary determines that the Committee should maintain 
lead management responsibility, the Committee will continue to operate 
according to the provisions of this paragraph (l) until the recovery 
objectives under paragraph (l)(9)(xvi) of this section or the Bitterroot 
Ecosystem Chapter of the Recovery Plan have been met and the Secretary 
has completed delisting.
    (B) If the Secretary decides to assume lead management 
responsibility, the Secretary will consult with the Governors of Idaho 
and Montana regarding that decision and further attempt to resolve the 
disagreement. If, after such consultation, the Secretary assumes lead 
management responsibility, the Secretary will publish a notice in the 
Federal Register explaining the rationale for the determination and 
notify the Governors of Idaho and Montana. The Committee will disband, 
and all requirements identified in this paragraph (l) regarding the 
Committee will be nullified.
    (12) How will the Bitterroot grizzly bear population be monitored? 
The reintroduced population will be monitored closely by Federal and 
State agencies in cooperation with the Committee for the duration of the 
recovery process, generally by use of radio telemetry as appropriate.
    (13) How will success or failure of the project be evaluated? The 
status of Bitterroot grizzly bear recovery will be reevaluated 
separately by the Committee and by the Secretary at 5-year intervals. 
This review will take into account the reproductive success of the 
grizzly bears released, human-caused

[[Page 202]]

mortality, movement patterns of individual bears, food habits, and 
overall health of the population and will recommend changes and 
improvements in the recovery program. Evaluating these parameters will 
assist in determining success or failure of the restoration.
    (14) What process will be followed if the Secretary determines the 
project has failed? (i) If, based on the criteria established by the 
Committee, the Secretary, after consultation with the Committee, the 
Governors of Idaho and Montana, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game, 
the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, and the Nez Perce 
Tribe, determines that the reintroduction has failed to produce a self-
sustaining population, this paragraph (l) will not be used to 
reintroduce additional bears. Any remaining bears will retain their 
experimental status.
    (ii) Prior to declaring the experimental reintroduction a failure, 
we will investigate the probable causes of the failure. If the causes 
can be determined, and legal and reasonable remedial measures identified 
and implemented, we will consider continuing the recovery effort and 
maintaining the relocated population. If such reasonable measures cannot 
be identified and implemented, we will publish the results of our 
evaluation in the Federal Register in a proposed rulemaking to terminate 
the authority for additional experimental grizzly bear reintroductions 
in the Bitterroot ecosystem.
    (15) Will the legal status of grizzly bears in the Experimental 
Population Area change? We do not intend to change the ``nonessential 
experimental'' designation to ``essential experimental,'' 
``threatened,'' or ``endangered'' and foresee no likely situation that 
would result in such changes. Critical habitat cannot be designated 
under the nonessential experimental classification, 16 U.S.C. 
1539(j)(2)(C)(ii).
    (16) What are the definitions of key terms used in the special rule 
in this paragraph (l)? In addition to terms defined in Sec.  10.12 and 
17.3 of this subchapter, the following terms apply to this paragraph 
(l):
    Accommodate means allowing grizzly bears that move outside the 
Recovery Area onto public land in the Experimental Population Area to 
remain undisturbed unless they demonstrate a real and imminent threat to 
human safety or livestock.
    Citizen Management Committee (Committee) means that Committee 
described in paragraph (l)(6) of this section.
    Current range means the area inside or within 10 miles of the 
recovery zone line of currently occupied grizzly bear recovery zones or 
any area where there is a grizzly bear population, as defined in this 
paragraph (l)(16).
    Exclusion area (Bitterroot Valley) means those private lands in 
Montana lying within the Bitterroot Experimental Population Area in the 
Bitterroot Valley outside the Bitterroot National Forest boundary south 
of U.S. Highway 12 to Lost Trail Pass and west of Highway 93.
    Experimental Population Area (Bitterroot Grizzly Bear Experimental 
Population Area) means that area delineated in paragraph (l)(1) of this 
section within which management plans developed as part of the Committee 
described in paragraph (l)(9) of this section will be in effect. This 
area includes the Recovery Area. The Experimental Population Area is 
within the historic range of the grizzly bear, but geographically 
separate from the current range of the grizzly bear.
    Geographically separate means separated by more than 10 miles. The 
term refers to ``wholly separate geographically'' in section 10(j)(2) of 
the Act. The Experimental Population Area and the recovery zone boundary 
of any existing grizzly bear population must be geographically separate.
    Grizzly bear population is defined by verified evidence within the 
previous 6 years which consists of photos within the area, verified 
tracks, or sightings by reputable scientists or agency personnel of at 
least two different female grizzly bears with young or one female with 
different litters in 2 different years in an area geographically 
separate from other grizzly bear populations. Verifiable evidence of 
females with young, to be geographically separate, would have to occur 
greater than

[[Page 203]]

10 miles from the nearest nonexperimental grizzly bear population 
recovery zone boundary.
    Opportunistic, noninjurious harassment means harassment (see 
definition of ``harass'' in Sec.  17.3) that occurs when the grizzly 
bear presents itself (for example, the bear travels onto and is observed 
on private land or near livestock). This paragraph (l) permits only this 
type of harassment. You cannot track, attract, search out, or chase a 
grizzly bear and then harass it. Any harassment must not cause bodily 
injury or death to the grizzly bear. The intent of harassment permitted 
by this definitioin is to scare bears away from the immediate area.
    Recovery Area (Bitterroot Grizzly Bear Recovery Area) means the area 
of recovery emphasis within the Experimental Population Area, and is 
delineated in paragraph (l)(2) of this section. This area consists of 
the Selway-Bitterroot and Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness 
areas. The Recovery Area is within the historic range of the species.
    Recovery emphasis means grizzly bear management decisions in the 
Recovery Area will favor bear recovery so that this area can serve as 
core habitat for survival, reproduction, and dispersal of the recovering 
population. Reintroduction of grizzly bears is planned to occur within 
the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness portion of the Recovery Area unless it 
is later determined that reintroduction in the Frank Church-River of No 
Return Wilderness is appropriate.
    Unavoidable and unintentional take means accidental, unintentional 
take (see definition of take in Sec.  10.12 of this subchapter) that 
occurs despite reasonable care, is incidental to an otherwise lawful 
activity, and is not done on purpose. An example would be striking a 
grizzly bear with an automobile. Taking a grizzly bear by shooting will 
not be considered unavoidable and unintentional take. Shooters have the 
responsibility to be sure of their targets.

    (m) Spotfin chub (=turquoise shiner) (Erimonax monachus), duskytail 
darter (Etheostoma percnurum), smoky madtom (Noturus baileyi). (1) Where 
are populations of these fishes designated as nonessential experimental 
populations (NEPs)? (i) The NEP area for these three fishes is within 
the species' probable historic ranges and is defined as follows: The 
Tellico River, between the backwaters of the Tellico Reservoir 
(approximately Tellico River mile 19 (30.4 kilometers) and Tellico River 
mile 33 (52.8 kilometers), near the Tellico Ranger Station, Monroe 
County, Tennessee.
    (ii) None of the fishes named in paragraph (m) of this section are 
currently

[[Page 205]]

known to exist in the Tellico River or its tributaries. Based on the 
habitat requirements of these fishes, we do not expect them to become 
established outside the NEP area. However, if any individuals of any of 
the species move upstream or downstream or into tributaries outside the 
designated NEP area, we would presume that they came from the 
reintroduced populations. We would then amend paragraph (m)(1)(i) of 
this section and enlarge the boundaries of the NEP area to include the 
entire range of the expanded population.
    (iii) We do not intend to change the NEP designations to ``essential 
experimental,'' ``threatened,'' or ``endangered'' within the NEP area. 
Additionally, we will not designate critical habitat for these NEPs, as 
provided by 16 U.S.C. 1539(j)(2)(C)(ii).
    (2) What activities are not allowed in the NEP area? (i) Except as 
expressly allowed in paragraph (m)(3) of this section, all the 
prohibitions of Sec.  17.31 (a) and (b) apply to the fishes identified 
in paragraph (m)(1) of this section.
    (ii) Any manner of take not described under paragraph (m)(3) of this 
section is prohibited in the NEP area. We may refer unauthorized take of 
these species to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.
    (iii) You may not possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever any of the identified fishes, 
or parts thereof, that are taken or possessed in violation of paragraph 
(m)(2) of this section or in violation of the applicable State fish and 
wildlife laws or regulations or the Act.
    (iv) You may not attempt to commit, solicit another to commit, or 
cause to be committed any offense defined in paragraph (m)(2) of this 
section.
    (3) What take is allowed in the NEP area? Take of this species that 
is incidental to an otherwise legal activity, such as recreation (e.g., 
fishing, boating, wading, trapping, or swimming), forestry, agriculture, 
and other activities that are in accordance with Federal, State, and 
local laws and regulations, is allowed.
    (4) How will the effectiveness of these reintroductions be 
monitored? We will prepare periodic progress reports and fully evaluate 
these reintroduction efforts after 5 and 10 years to determine whether 
to continue or terminate the reintroduction efforts.
    (5) Note: Map of the NEP area for spotfin chub, duskytail darter, 
smoky madtom, and yellowfin madtom (see paragraph (e) of this section) 
in Tennessee follows:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR08AP05.002

    (n) Gray wolf (Canis lupus). (1) The gray wolves (wolf) identified 
in paragraphs (n)(9)(i) and (ii) of this section are nonessential 
experimental populations. These wolves will be managed in accordance 
with the respective provisions of this paragraph (n) in the boundaries 
of the nonessential experimental population (NEP) areas within any State 
or Tribal reservation that has a wolf management plan that has been 
approved by the Service, as further provided in this paragraph (n). 
Furthermore, any State or Tribe that has a wolf management plan approved

[[Page 207]]

by the Service can petition the Secretary of the Department of the 
Interior (DOI) to assume the lead authority for wolf management under 
this rule within the borders of the NEP areas in their respective State 
or reservation.
    (2) The Service finds that management of nonessential experimental 
gray wolves, as defined in this paragraph (n), will further the 
conservation of the species.
    (3) Definitions of terms used in paragraph (n) of this section 
follow:
    Active den site--A den or a specific above-ground site that is being 
used on a daily basis by wolves to raise newborn pups during the period 
April 1 to June 30.
    Breeding pair--An adult male and an adult female wolf that, during 
the previous breeding season, produced at least two pups that survived 
until December 31 of the year of their birth.
    Designated agent--Includes Federal agencies authorized or directed 
by the Service, and States or Tribes with a wolf management plan 
approved by the Director of the Service and with established cooperative 
agreements with us or Memoranda of Agreement (MOAs) approved by the 
Secretary of the DOI. Federal agencies, States, or Tribes may become 
``designated agents'' through cooperative agreements with the Service 
whereby they agree to assist the Service to implement some portions of 
this rule. If a State or Tribe becomes a ``designated agent'' through a 
cooperative agreement, the Service will help coordinate their activities 
and retain authority for program direction, oversight, and guidance. 
States and Tribes with approved plans also may become ``designated 
agents'' by submitting a petition to the Secretary to establish an MOA 
under this rule. Once accepted by the Secretary, the MOA may allow the 
State or Tribe to assume lead authority for wolf management and to 
implement the portions of their State or Tribal plans that are 
consistent with this rule. The Service oversight (aside from Service law 
enforcement investigations) under an MOA is limited to monitoring 
compliance with this rule, issuing written authorizations for wolf take 
on reservations without approved wolf management plans, and an annual 
review of the State or Tribal program to ensure the wolf population is 
being maintained above recovery levels.
    Domestic animals--Animals that have been selectively bred over many 
generations to enhance specific traits for their use by humans, 
including use as pets. This includes livestock (as defined below) and 
dogs.
    Intentional harassment--The deliberate and pre-planned harassment of 
wolves, including by less-than-lethal munitions (such as 12-gauge 
shotgun rubber-bullets and bean-bag shells), that are designed to cause 
physical discomfort and temporary physical injury but not death. The 
wolf may have been tracked, waited for, chased, or searched out and then 
harassed.
    In the act of attacking--The actual biting, wounding, grasping, or 
killing of livestock or dogs, or chasing, molesting, or harassing by 
wolves that would indicate to a reasonable person that such biting, 
wounding, grasping, or killing of livestock or dogs is likely to occur 
at any moment.
    Landowner--An owner of private land, or his/her immediate family 
members, or the owner's employees who are currently employed to actively 
work on that private land. In addition, the owner(s) (or his/her 
employees) of livestock that are currently and legally grazed on that 
private land and other lease-holders on that private land (such as 
outfitters or guides who lease hunting rights from private landowners), 
are considered landowners on that private land for the purposes of this 
regulation. Private land, under this regulation, also includes all non-
Federal land and land within Tribal reservations. Individuals legally 
using Tribal lands in States with approved plans are considered 
landowners for the purposes of this rule. ``Landowner'' in this 
regulation includes legal grazing permittees or their current employees 
on State, county, or city public or Tribal grazing lands.
    Livestock--Cattle, sheep, horses, mules, goats, domestic bison, and 
herding and guarding animals (llamas, donkeys, and certain breeds of 
dogs commonly used for herding or guarding livestock). Livestock 
excludes dogs that are not being used for livestock guarding or herding.

[[Page 208]]

    Non injurious--Does not cause either temporary or permanent physical 
damage or death.
    Opportunistic harassment--Harassment without the conduct of prior 
purposeful actions to attract, track, wait for, or search out the wolf.
    Private land--All land other than that under Federal Government 
ownership and administration and including Tribal reservations.
    Problem wolves--Wolves that have been confirmed by the Service or 
our designated agent(s) to have attacked or been in the act of attacking 
livestock or dogs on private land or livestock on public land within the 
past 45 days. Wolves that we or our designated agent(s) confirm to have 
attacked any other domestic animals on private land twice within a 
calendar year are considered problem wolves for purposes of agency wolf 
control actions.
    Public land--Federal land such as that administered by the National 
Park Service, Service, Bureau of Land Management, USDA Forest Service, 
Bureau of Reclamation, Department of Defense, or other agencies with the 
Federal Government.
    Public land permittee--A person or that person's employee who has an 
active, valid Federal land-use permit to use specific Federal lands to 
graze livestock, or operate an outfitter or guiding business that uses 
livestock. This definition does not include private individuals or 
organizations who have Federal permits for other activities on public 
land such as collecting firewood, mushrooms, antlers, Christmas trees, 
or logging, mining, oil or gas development, or other uses that do not 
require livestock. In recognition of the special and unique authorities 
of Tribes and their relationship with the U.S. Government, for the 
purposes of this rule, the definition includes Tribal members who 
legally graze their livestock on ceded public lands under recognized 
Tribal treaty rights.
    Remove--Place in captivity, relocate to another location, or kill.
    Research--Scientific studies resulting in data that will lend to 
enhancement of the survival of the gray wolf.
    Rule--Federal regulations--``This rule'' or ``this regulation'' 
refers to this final NEP regulation; ``1994 rules'' refers to the 1994 
NEP rules (50 CFR 17.84(i)); and ``4(d) rule'' refers to the 2003 
special 4(d) regulations for threatened wolves in the Western DPS (50 
CFR 17.40(n)), outside of the experimental population areas.
    Unacceptable impact--State or Tribally-determined decline in a wild 
ungulate population or herd, primarily caused by wolf predation, so that 
the population or herd is not meeting established State or Tribal 
management goals. The State or Tribal determination must be peer-
reviewed and reviewed and commented on by the public, prior to a final 
determination by the Service that an unacceptable impact has occurred, 
and that wolf removal is not likely to impede wolf recovery.
    Wounded--Exhibiting scraped or torn hide or flesh, bleeding, or 
other evidence of physical damage caused by a wolf bite.
    (4) Allowable forms of take of gray wolves. The following 
activities, only in the specific circumstances described under this 
paragraph (n)(4), are allowed: opportunistic harassment; intentional 
harassment; take on private land; take on public land; take in response 
to impacts on wild ungulate populations; take in defense of human life; 
take to protect human safety; take by designated agents to remove 
problem wolves; incidental take; take under permits; take per 
authorizations for employees of designated agents; and take for research 
purposes. Other than as expressly provided in this rule, all other forms 
of take are considered a violation of section 9 of the Act. Any wolf or 
wolf part taken legally must be turned over to the Service unless 
otherwise specified in this paragraph (n). Any take of wolves must be 
reported as outlined in paragraph (n)(6) of this section.
    (i) Opportunistic harassment. Anyone may conduct opportunistic 
harassment of any gray wolf in a non-injurious manner at any time. 
Opportunistic harassment must be reported to the Service or our 
designated agent(s) within 7 days as outlined in paragraph (n)(6) of 
this section.
    (ii) Intentional harassment. After we or our designated agent(s) 
have confirmed wolf activity on private land, on

[[Page 209]]

a public land grazing allotment, or on a Tribal reservation, we or our 
designated agent(s) may issue written take authorization valid for not 
longer than 1 year, with appropriate conditions, to any landowner or 
public land permittee to intentionally harass wolves. The harassment 
must occur in the area and under the conditions as specifically 
identified in the written take authorization.
    (iii) Take by landowners on their private land. Landowners may take 
wolves on their private land in the following two additional 
circumstances:
    (A) Any landowner may immediately take a gray wolf in the act of 
attacking livestock or dogs on their private land, provided the 
landowner provides evidence of livestock or dogs recently (less than 24 
hours) wounded, harassed, molested, or killed by wolves, and we or our 
designated agent(s) are able to confirm that the livestock or dogs were 
wounded, harassed, molested, or killed by wolves. The carcass of any 
wolf taken and the area surrounding it should not be disturbed in order 
to preserve physical evidence that the take was conducted according to 
this rule. The take of any wolf without such evidence of a direct and 
immediate threat may be referred to the appropriate authorities for 
prosecution.
    (B) A landowner may take wolves on his/her private land if we or our 
designated agent issued a ``shoot-on-sight'' written take authorization 
of limited duration (45 days or less), and if:
    (1) This landowner's property has had at least one depredation by 
wolves on livestock or dogs that has been confirmed by us or our 
designated agent(s) within the past 30 days; and
    (2) We or our designated agent(s) have determined that problem 
wolves are routinely present on that private property and present a 
significant risk to the health and safety of other livestock or dogs; 
and
    (3) We or our designated agent(s) have authorized agency lethal 
removal of problem wolves from that same property. The landowner must 
conduct the take in compliance with the written take authorization 
issued by the Service or our designated agent(s).
    (iv) Take on public land. Any livestock producer and public land 
permittee (see definitions in paragraph (n)(3) of this section) who is 
legally using public land under a valid Federal land-use permit may 
immediately take a gray wolf in the act of attacking his/her livestock 
on his/her allotment or other area authorized for his/her use without 
prior written authorization, provided that producer or permittee 
provides evidence of livestock recently (less than 24 hours) wounded, 
harassed, molested, or killed by wolves, and we or our designated 
agent(s) are able to confirm that the livestock were wounded, harassed, 
molested, or killed by wolves. The carcass of any wolf taken and the 
area surrounding it should not be disturbed, in order to preserve 
physical evidence that the take was conducted according to this rule. 
The take of any wolf without such evidence may be referred to the 
appropriate authorities for prosecution.
    (A) At our or our designated agent(s)' discretion, we or our 
designated agent(s) also may issue a shoot-on-sight written take 
authorization of limited duration (45 days or less) to a public land 
grazing permittee to take problem wolves on that permittee's active 
livestock grazing allotment if:
    (1) The grazing allotment has had at least one depredation by wolves 
on livestock that has been confirmed by us or our designated agent(s) 
within the past 30 days; and
    (2) We or our designated agent(s) have determined that problem 
wolves are routinely present on that allotment and present a significant 
risk to the health and safety of livestock; and
    (3) We or our designated agent(s) have authorized agency lethal 
removal of problem wolves from that same allotment.
    (B) The permittee must conduct the take in compliance with the 
written take authorization issued by the Service or our designated 
agent(s).
    (v) Take in response to wild ungulate impacts. If wolf predation is 
having an unacceptable impact on wild ungulate populations (deer, elk, 
moose, bighorn sheep, mountain goats, antelope, or bison) as determined 
by the respective State or Tribe, a State or Tribe may lethally remove 
the wolves in question.

[[Page 210]]

    (A) In order for this provision to apply, the States or Tribes must 
prepare a science-based document that:
    (1) Describes what data indicate that ungulate herd is below 
management objectives, what data indicate the impact by wolf predation 
on the ungulate population, why wolf removal is a warranted solution to 
help restore the ungulate herd to State or Tribal management objectives, 
the level and duration of wolf removal being proposed, and how ungulate 
population response to wolf removal will be measured;
    (2) Identifies possible remedies or conservation measures in 
addition to wolf removal; and
    (3) Provides an opportunity for peer review and public comment on 
their proposal prior to submitting it to the Service for written 
concurrence.
    (B) We must determine that such actions are scientifically-based and 
will not reduce the wolf population below recovery levels before we 
authorize lethal wolf removal.
    (vi) Take in defense of human life. Any person may take a gray wolf 
in defense of the individual's life or the life of another person. The 
unauthorized taking of a wolf without demonstration of an immediate and 
direct threat to human life may be referred to the appropriate 
authorities for prosecution.
    (vii) Take to protect human safety. We or our designated agent(s) 
may promptly remove any wolf that we or our designated agent(s) 
determines to be a threat to human life or safety.
    (viii) Take of problem wolves by Service personnel or our designated 
agent(s). We or our designated agent(s) may carry out harassment, non 
lethal control measures, relocation, placement in captivity, or lethal 
control of problem wolves. To determine the presence of problem wolves, 
we or our designated agent(s) will consider all of the following:
    (A) Evidence of wounded livestock, dogs, or other domestic animals, 
or remains of livestock, dogs, or domestic animals that show that the 
injury or death was caused by wolves, or evidence that wolves were in 
the act of attacking livestock, dogs, or domestic animals;
    (B) The likelihood that additional wolf-caused losses or attacks may 
occur if no control action is taken;
    (C) Evidence of unusual attractants or artificial or intentional 
feeding of wolves; and
    (D) Evidence that animal husbandry practices recommended in approved 
allotment plans and annual operating plans were followed.
    (ix) Incidental take. Take of a gray wolf is allowed if the take is 
accidental and incidental to an otherwise lawful activity and if 
reasonable due care was practiced to avoid such take, and such take is 
reported within 24 hours. Incidental take is not allowed if the take is 
not accidental or if reasonable due care was not practiced to avoid such 
take, or it was not reported within 24 hours (we may allow additional 
time if access to the site of the take is limited), and we may refer 
such taking to the appropriate authorities for prosecution. Shooters 
have the responsibility to identify their target before shooting. 
Shooting a wolf as a result of mistaking it for another species is not 
considered accidental and may be referred to the appropriate authorities 
for prosecution.
    (x) Take under permits. Any person with a valid permit issued by the 
Service under Sec.  17.32, or our designated agent(s), may take wolves 
in the wild, pursuant to terms of the permit.
    (xi) Additional take authorization for agency employees. When acting 
in the course of official duties, any employee of the Service or our 
designated agent(s) may take a wolf or wolf-like canid for the following 
purposes:
    (A) Scientific purposes;
    (B) To avoid conflict with human activities;
    (C) To further wolf survival and recovery;
    (D) To aid or euthanize sick, injured, or orphaned wolves;
    (E) To dispose of a dead specimen;
    (F) To salvage a dead specimen that may be used for scientific 
study;
    (G) To aid in law enforcement investigations involving wolves; or
    (H) To prevent wolves or wolf-like canids with abnormal physical or 
behavioral characteristics, as determined by the Service or our 
designated

[[Page 211]]

agent(s), from passing on or teaching those traits to other wolves.
    (I) Such take must be reported to the Service within 7 days as 
outlined in paragraph (n)(6) of this section, and specimens are to be 
retained or disposed of only in accordance with directions from the 
Service.
    (xii) Take for research purposes. We may issue permits under Sec.  
17.32, or our designated agent(s) may issue written authorization, for 
individuals to take wolves in the wild pursuant to approved scientific 
study proposals. Scientific studies should be reasonably expected to 
result in data that will lend to development of sound management of the 
gray wolf, and lend to enhancement of its survival as a species.
    (5) Federal land use. Restrictions on the use of any Federal lands 
may be put in place to prevent the take of wolves at active den sites 
between April 1 and June 30. Otherwise, no additional land-use 
restrictions on Federal lands, except for National Parks or National 
Wildlife Refuges, may be necessary to reduce or prevent take of wolves 
solely to benefit gray wolf recovery under the Act. This prohibition 
does not preclude restricting land use when necessary to reduce negative 
impacts of wolf restoration efforts on other endangered or threatened 
species.
    (6) Reporting requirements. Except as otherwise specified in 
paragraph (n) of this section or in a permit, any take of a gray wolf 
must be reported to the Service or our designated agent(s) within 24 
hours. We will allow additional reasonable time if access to the site is 
limited. Report any take of wolves, including opportunistic harassment, 
to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Western Gray Wolf Recovery 
Coordinator (100 North Park, Suite 320, Helena, Montana 59601, 406-449-
5225 extension 204; facsimile 406-449-5339), or a Service-designated 
agent of another Federal, State, or Tribal agency. Unless otherwise 
specified in paragraph (n) of this section, any wolf or wolf part taken 
legally must be turned over to the Service, which will determine the 
disposition of any live or dead wolves.
    (7) No person shall possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever, any wolf or part thereof from 
the experimental populations taken in violation of the regulations in 
paragraph (n) of this section or in violation of applicable State or 
Tribal fish and wildlife laws or regulations or the Act.
    (8) It is unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, solicit 
another to commit, or cause to be committed any offense defined in this 
section.
    (9) The sites for these experimental populations are within the 
historic range of the species as designated in Sec.  17.84(i)(7):
    (i) The central Idaho NEP area is shown on Map 1. The boundaries of 
the NEP area are those portions of Idaho that are south of Interstate 
Highway 90 and west of Interstate 15, and those portions of Montana 
south of Interstate 90, Highways 93 and 12 from Missoula, Montana, west 
of Interstate 15.

[[Page 212]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06JA05.000

    (ii) The Yellowstone NEP is shown on Map 2. The boundaries of the 
NEP area are that portion of Idaho that is east of Interstate Highway 
15; that portion of Montana that is east of Interstate Highway 15 and 
south of the Missouri River from Great Falls, Montana, to the eastern 
Montana border; and all of Wyoming.

[[Page 213]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06JA05.001

    (iii) All wolves found in the wild within the boundaries of these 
experimental areas are considered nonessential experimental animals. In 
the Western Gray Wolf Distinct Population Segment (Washington, Oregon, 
California, Nevada, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, and Utah and Colorado north 
of Highway 50 and Interstate 70), any wolf that is outside an 
experimental area is considered threatened. Disposition of wolves 
outside the NEP areas may take any of the following courses:
    (A) Any wolf dispersing from the experimental population areas into 
other

[[Page 214]]

parts of the Western DPS will be managed under the special 4(d) rule for 
threatened wolves in the Western DPS (50 CFR 17.40(n)).
    (B) Any wolf originating from the experimental population areas and 
dispersing beyond the borders of the Western DPS may be managed by the 
wolf management regulations established for that area, or may be 
returned to the experimental population areas if it has not been 
involved in conflicts with people, or may be removed if it has been 
involved with conflicts with people.
    (10) Wolves in the experimental population areas will be monitored 
by radio-telemetry or other standard wolf population monitoring 
techniques as appropriate. Any animal that is sick, injured, or 
otherwise in need of special care may be captured by authorized 
personnel of the Service or our designated agent(s) and given 
appropriate care. Such an animal will be released back into its 
respective area as soon as possible, unless physical or behavioral 
problems make it necessary to return the animal to captivity or 
euthanize it.
    (11) Memoranda of Agreement (MOAs). Any State or Tribe with gray 
wolves, subject to the terms of this paragraph (n), may petition the 
Secretary for an MOA to take over lead management responsibility and 
authority to implement this rule by managing the nonessential 
experimental gray wolves in that State or on that Tribal reservation, 
and implement all parts of their approved State or Tribal plan that are 
consistent with this rule, provided that the State or Tribe has a wolf 
management plan approved by the Secretary.
    (i) A State or Tribal petition for wolf management under an MOA must 
show:
    (A) That authority and management capability resides in the State or 
Tribe to conserve the gray wolf throughout the geographical range of all 
experimental populations within the State or within the Tribal 
reservation.
    (B) That the State or Tribe has an acceptable conservation program 
for the gray wolf, throughout all of the NEP areas within the State or 
Tribal reservation, including the requisite authority and capacity to 
carry out that conservation program.
    (C) A description of exactly what parts of the approved State or 
Tribal plan the State or Tribe intends to implement within the framework 
of this rule.
    (D) A description of the State or Tribal management progress will be 
reported to the Service on at least an annual basis so the Service can 
determine if State or Tribal management has maintained the wolf 
population above recovery levels and was conducted in full compliance 
with this rule.
    (ii) The Secretary will approve such a petition upon a finding that 
the applicable criteria are met and that approval is not likely to 
jeopardize the continued existence of the gray wolf in the Western DPS, 
as defined in Sec.  17.11(h).
    (iii) If the Secretary approves the petition, the Secretary will 
enter into an MOA with the Governor of that State or appropriate Tribal 
representative.
    (iv) An MOA for State or Tribal management as provided in this 
section may allow a State or Tribe to become designated agents and lead 
management of nonessential experimental gray wolf populations within the 
borders of their jurisdictions in accordance with the State's or Tribe's 
wolf management plan approved by the Service, except that:
    (A) The MOA may not provide for any form of management inconsistent 
with the protection provided to the species under this rule, without 
further opportunity for appropriate public comment and review and 
amendment of this rule;
    (B) The MOA cannot vest the State or Tribe with any authority over 
matters concerning section 4 of the Act (determining whether a species 
warrants listing);
    (C) The MOA may not provide for public hunting or trapping absent a 
finding by the Secretary of an extraordinary case where population 
pressures within a given ecosystem cannot be otherwise relieved; and
    (D) In the absence of a Tribal wolf management plan or cooperative 
agreement, the MOA cannot vest a State

[[Page 215]]

with the authority to issue written authorizations for wolf take on 
reservations. The Service will retain the authority to issue these 
written authorizations until a Tribal wolf management plan is approved.
    (v) The MOA for State or Tribal wolf management must provide for 
joint law enforcement responsibilities to ensure that the Service also 
has the authority to enforce the State or Tribal management program 
prohibitions on take.
    (vi) The MOA may not authorize wolf take beyond that stated in the 
experimental population rules but may be more restrictive.
    (vii) The MOA will expressly provide that the results of 
implementing the MOA may be the basis upon which State or Tribal 
regulatory measures will be judged for delisting purposes.
    (viii) The authority for the MOA will be the Act, the Fish and 
Wildlife Act of 1956 (16 U.S.C. 742a-742j), and the Fish and Wildlife 
Coordination Act (16 U.S.C. 661-667e), and any applicable treaty.
    (ix) In order for the MOA to remain in effect, the Secretary must 
find, on an annual basis, that the management under the MOA is not 
jeopardizing the continued existence of the gray wolf in the Western 
DPS. The Secretary or State or Tribe may terminate the MOA upon 90 days 
notice if:
    (A) Management under the MOA is likely to jeopardize the continued 
existence of the gray wolf in the Western DPS; or
    (B) The State or Tribe has failed materially to comply with this 
rule, the MOA, or any relevant provision of the State or Tribal wolf 
management plan; or
    (C) The Service determines that biological circumstances within the 
range of the gray wolf indicate that delisting the species is not 
warranted; or
    (D) The States or Tribes determine that they no longer want the wolf 
management authority vested in them by the Secretary in the MOA.
    (o) Spotfin chub (=turquoise shiner) (Erimonax monachus), boulder 
darter (Etheostoma wapiti).
    (1) Where are populations of these fishes designated as nonessential 
experimental populations (NEP)? (i) The NEP area for the boulder darter 
and the spotfin chub is within the species' historic ranges and is 
defined as follows: Shoal Creek (from Shoal Creek mile 41.7 (66.7 km)) 
at the mouth of Long Branch, Lawrence County, TN, downstream to the 
backwaters of Wilson Reservoir (Shoal Creek mile 14 (22 km)) at Goose 
Shoals, Lauderdale County, AL, including the lower 5 miles (8 km) of all 
tributaries that enter this reach.
    (ii) None of the fishes named in paragraph (o) of this section are 
currently known to exist in Shoal Creek or its tributaries. Based on the 
habitat requirements of these fishes, we do not expect them to become 
established outside the NEP area. However, if any individuals of either 
of the species move upstream or downstream or into tributaries outside 
the designated NEP area, we would presume that they came from the 
reintroduced populations.
    (iii) We do not intend to change the NEP designations to ``essential 
experimental,'' ``threatened,'' or ``endangered'' within the NEP area. 
Additionally, we will not designate critical habitat for these NEPs, as 
provided by 16 U.S.C. 1539(j)(2)(C)(ii).
    (2) What take is allowed in the NEP area? Take of these species that 
is accidental and incidental to an otherwise legal activity, such as 
recreation (e.g., fishing, boating, wading, trapping, or swimming), 
forestry, agriculture, and other activities that are in accordance with 
Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, is allowed.
    (3) What take of these species is not allowed in the NEP area? (i) 
Except as expressly allowed in paragraph (o)(2) of this section, all the 
provisions of Sec.  17.31(a) and (b) apply to the fishes identified in 
paragraph (o)(1) of this section.
    (ii) Any manner of take not described under paragraph (o)(2) of this 
section is prohibited in the NEP area. We may refer unauthorized take of 
these species to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.
    (iii) You may not possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever any of the identified fishes, 
or parts thereof, that are taken or possessed in violation of paragraph 
(o)(3) of this section or in violation of the applicable State fish

[[Page 216]]

and wildlife laws or regulations or the Act.
    (iv) You may not attempt to commit, solicit another to commit, or 
cause to be committed any offense defined in paragraph (o)(3) of this 
section.
    (4) How will the effectiveness of these reintroductions be 
monitored? After the initial stocking of these two fish, we will monitor 
annually their presence or absence and document any spawning behavior or 
young-of-the-year fish that might be present. This monitoring will be 
conducted primarily by snorkeling or seining and will be accomplished by 
contracting with the appropriate species experts. We will produce annual 
reports detailing the stocking rates and monitoring activities that took 
place during the previous year. We will also fully evaluate these 
reintroduction efforts after 5 and 10 years to determine whether to 
continue or terminate the reintroduction efforts.
    (5) Note: Map of the NEP area for spotfin chub and boulder darter in 
Tennessee and Alabama follows:

    (p) Northern aplomado falcon (Falco femoralis septentrionalis). (1) 
The northern aplomado falcon (Falco femoralis septentrionalis) (falcon) 
population identified in paragraph (p)(9)(i) of this section is a 
nonessential experimental population (NEP).
    (2) No person may take this species, except as provided in 
paragraphs (p)(3) through (5) and (p)(10) of this section.

[[Page 218]]

    (3) Any person with a valid permit issued by the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service (Service) under Sec.  17.32 may take falcons for 
educational purposes, scientific purposes, the enhancement of 
propagation or survival of the species, zoological exhibition, and other 
conservation purposes consistent with the Endangered Species Act (Act);
    (4) A falcon may be taken within the NEP area, provided that such 
take is not willful, knowing, or due to negligence, or is incidental to 
and not the purpose of the carrying out of an otherwise lawful activity; 
and that such taking is reported within 24 hours, as provided under 
paragraph (p)(6) of this section.
    (5) Any employee of the Service, New Mexico Department of Game and 
Fish, or Arizona Game and Fish Department, who is designated for such 
purpose, or any person with a valid permit issued by the Service under 
50 CFR 17.32, may, when acting in the course of official duties, take a 
falcon if such action is necessary to:
    (i) Aid a sick, injured, or orphaned specimen;
    (ii) Dispose of a dead specimen, or salvage a dead specimen that may 
be useful for scientific study;
    (iii) Move a bird within the NEP area for genetic purposes or to 
improve the health of the population;
    (iv) Relocate falcons that have moved outside the NEP area, by 
returning the falcon to the NEP area or moving it to a captive breeding 
facility. All captures and relocations from outside the NEP area will be 
conducted with the permission of the landowner(s) or appropriate land 
management agencies; or
    (v) Collect nesting data or band individuals.
    (6) Any taking pursuant to paragraphs (p)(3) through (5) of this 
section must be reported within 24 hours by contacting the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, New Mexico Ecological Services Field Office, 2105 
Osuna NE, Albuquerque, NM 87113; (505) 346-2525. Upon contact, a 
determination will be made as to the disposition of any live or dead 
specimens.
    (7) No person shall possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever, any such species taken in 
violation of these regulations.
    (8) It is unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, solicit 
another to commit, or cause to be committed, any offense defined in 
paragraphs (p)(2) and (p)(7) of this section.
    (9)(i) The boundaries of the designated NEP area are based on county 
borders and include the entire States of New Mexico and Arizona. The 
reintroduction area is within the historical range of the species in New 
Mexico.
    (ii) All falcons found in the wild within the boundaries of the NEP 
area after the first releases will be considered members of the NEP. A 
falcon occurring outside of the NEP area is considered endangered under 
the Act unless it is marked or otherwise known to be a member of the 
NEP.
    (iii) The Service has designated the NEP area to accommodate the 
potential future movements of a wild population of falcons. All released 
birds and their progeny are expected to remain in the NEP area due to 
the geographic extent of the designation.
    (10) The NEP will be monitored closely for the duration of the 
reintroduction program. Any bird that is determined to be sick, injured, 
or otherwise in need of special care will be recaptured to the extent 
possible by Service and/or State or permitted Tribal wildlife personnel 
and given appropriate care. Such birds will be released back to the wild 
as soon as possible, unless physical or behavioral problems make it 
necessary to return them to a captive-breeding facility or they are 
euthanized if treatment would be unlikely to be effective.
    (11) The Service plans to evaluate the status of the NEP every 5 
years to determine future management status and needs, with the first 
evaluation expected to be not more than 5 years after the first release 
of birds into the NEP area. All reviews will take into account the 
reproductive success and movement patterns of individuals released, food 
habits, and overall health of the population. This evaluation will 
include a progress report.

<R05>
Sec.  17.84  Special rules--vertebrates.

                                * * * * *

    (e) Yellowfin madtom (Noturus flavipinnis). (1) Where is the 
yellowfin madtom designated as a nonessential experimental population 
(NEP)? We have designated three populations of this species as NEPs: the 
North Fork Holston River Watershed NEP, the Tellico River NEP, and the 
French Broad River and Holston River NEP.
    (i) The North Fork Holston River Watershed NEP area is within the 
species' historic range and is defined as follows: The North Fork 
Holston River watershed, Washington, Smyth, and Scott Counties, 
Virginia; South Fork Holston River watershed upstream to Ft. Patrick 
Henry Dam, Sullivan County, Tennessee; and the Holston River from the 
confluence of the North and South Forks downstream to the John Sevier 
Detention Lake Dam, Hawkins County, Tennessee. This site is totally 
isolated from existing populations of this species by large Tennessee 
River tributaries and reservoirs. As the species is not known to inhabit 
reservoirs and because individuals of the species are not likely to move 
100 river miles through these large reservoirs, the possibility that 
this population could come in contact with extant wild populations is 
unlikely.
    (ii) The Tellico River NEP area is within the species' historic 
range and is defined as follows: The Tellico River, between the 
backwaters of the Tellico Reservoir (approximately Tellico River mile 19 
(30.4 kilometers) and Tellico River mile 33 (52.8 kilometers), near the 
Tellico Ranger Station, Monroe County, Tennessee. This species is not 
currently known to exist in the Tellico River or its tributaries. Based 
on its habitat requirements, we do not expect this species to become 
established outside this NEP area. However, if individuals of this 
population move upstream or downstream or into tributaries outside the 
designated NEP area, we would presume that they came from the 
reintroduced population. We would then amend this regulation to enlarge 
the boundaries of the NEP area to include the entire range of the 
expanded population.
    (iii) The French Broad River and Holston River NEP area is within 
the species' historic range and is defined as follows: the French Broad 
River, Knox and Sevier Counties, Tennessee, from the base of Douglas Dam 
(river mile (RM) 32.3 (51.7 km)) downstream to the confluence with the 
Holston River; then up the Holston River, Knox, Grainger, and Jefferson 
Counties, Tennessee, to the base of Cherokee Dam (RM 52.3 (83.7 km)); 
and the lower 5 RM (8 km) of all tributaries that enter these river 
reaches. This species is not known to exist in any of the tributaries to 
the free-flowing reaches of the French Broad River below Douglas Dam, 
Knox and Sevier Counties, Tennessee, or of the Holston River below the 
Cherokee Dam, Knox, Grainger, and Jefferson Counties, Tennessee. Based 
on its habitat requirements, we do not expect this species to become 
established outside this NEP area. However, if individuals of this 
population move upstream or downstream or into tributaries outside the 
designated NEP area, we would presume that they came from the 
reintroduced population. We would then amend this regulation to enlarge 
the boundaries of the NEP area to include the entire range of the 
expanded population.
    (iv) We do not intend to change the NEP designations to ``essential 
experimental,'' ``threatened,'' or ``endangered'' within the NEP areas. 
Additionally, we will not designate critical habitat for these NEPs, as 
provided by 16 U.S.C. 1539(j)(2)(C)(ii).
    (2) What activities are not allowed in the NEP areas? (i) Except as 
expressly allowed in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, all the 
prohibitions of Sec.  17.31(a) and (b) apply to the yellowfin madtom.
    (ii) Any manner of take not described under paragraph (e)(3) of this 
section is prohibited in the NEP area. We may refer unauthorized take of 
this species to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.
    (iii) You may not possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever any of the identified fishes, 
or parts thereof, that are taken or possessed in violation of paragraph 
(e)(2) of this section or in violation of the applicable State fish and

    (m) Spotfin chub (=turquoise shiner) (Erimonax monachus). (1) Where 
is the spotfin chub designated as a nonessential experimental population 
(NEP)? We have designated three populations of this species as NEPs: the 
Tellico River NEP, the Shoal Creek NEP, and the French Broad River and 
Holston River NEP. This species is not currently known to exist in the 
Tellico River or its tributaries, the Shoal Creek or its tributaries, or 
any of the tributaries to the free-flowing reaches of the French Broad 
River below Douglas Dam, Knox and Sevier Counties, Tennessee, or of the 
Holston River below the Cherokee Dam, Knox, Grainger, and Jefferson 
Counties, Tennessee. Based on its habitat requirements, we do not expect 
this species to become established outside the NEP areas. However, if 
individuals move upstream or downstream or into tributaries outside any 
of the designated NEP areas, we would presume that those individuals 
came from the closest reintroduced population. We would then amend this 
regulation and enlarge the boundaries of the NEP area to include the 
entire range of the expanded population.
    (i) The Tellico River NEP area is within the species' probable 
historic range and is defined as follows: The Tellico River, between the 
backwaters of the Tellico Reservoir (approximately Tellico River mile 19 
(30.4 kilometers (km)) and Tellico River mile 33 (52.8 km), near the 
Tellico Ranger Station, Monroe County, Tennessee.
    (ii) The Shoal Creek NEP area is within the species' historic range 
and is defined as follows: Shoal Creek (from Shoal Creek mile 41.7 (66.7 
km)) at the mouth of Long Branch, Lawrence County, TN, downstream to the 
backwaters of Wilson Reservoir (Shoal Creek mile 14 (22 km)) at Goose 
Shoals, Lauderdale County, AL, including the lower 5 miles (8 km) of all 
tributaries that enter this reach.
    (iii) The French Broad River and Holston River NEP area is within 
the species' historic range and is defined as follows: the French Broad 
River, Knox and Sevier Counties, Tennessee, from the base of Douglas Dam 
(river mile (RM) 32.3 (51.7 km)) downstream to the confluence with the 
Holston River; then up the Holston River, Knox, Grainger, and Jefferson 
Counties, Tennessee, to the base of Cherokee Dam (RM 52.3 (83.7 km)); 
and the lower 5 RM (8 km) of all tributaries that enter these river 
reaches.
    (iv) We do not intend to change the NEP designations to ``essential 
experimental,'' ``threatened,'' or ``endangered'' within the NEP area. 
Additionally, we will not designate critical habitat for these NEPs, as 
provided by 16 U.S.C. 1539(j)(2)(C)(ii).
    (2) What activities are not allowed in the NEP area? (i) Except as 
expressly allowed in paragraph (m)(3) of this section, all the 
provisions of Sec.  17.31(a) and (b) apply to the spotfin chub.
    (ii) Any manner of take not described under paragraph (m)(3) of this 
section is prohibited in the NEP area. We may refer unauthorized take of 
this species to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.
    (iii) You may not possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever any of the identified fishes, 
or parts thereof, that are taken or possessed in violation of paragraph 
(m)(2) of this section or in violation of the applicable State fish and 
wildlife laws or regulations or the Act.
    (iv) You may not attempt to commit, solicit another to commit, or 
cause to be committed any offense defined in paragraph (m)(2) of this 
section.
    (3) What take is allowed in the NEP area? Take of this species that 
is accidental and incidental to an otherwise legal activity, such as 
recreation (e.g., fishing, boating, wading, trapping, or swimming), 
forestry, agriculture, and other activities that are in accordance with 
Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, is allowed.
    (4) How will the effectiveness of these reintroductions be 
monitored? (i) In the Tellico River NEP area, we will prepare periodic 
progress reports and fully evaluate these reintroduction efforts after 5 
and 10 years to determine whether to continue or terminate the 
reintroduction efforts.
    (ii) In the Shoal Creek NEP area, after the initial stocking of 
fish, we will monitor annually their presence or absence and document 
any spawning behavior or young-of-the-year fish that might be present. 
This monitoring will be conducted primarily by snorkeling or seining and 
will be accomplished by contracting with the appropriate species 
experts. We will produce annual reports detailing the stocking rates and 
monitoring activities that took place during the previous year. We will 
also fully evaluate these reintroduction efforts after 5 and 10 years to 
determine whether to continue or terminate the reintroduction efforts.
    (iii) In the Lower French Broad and Lower Holston Rivers NEP area, 
after the initial stocking of these species, we will monitor annually 
their presence or absence and document any spawning behavior or young-
of-

[[Page 221]]

the-year that might be present. This monitoring will be conducted 
primarily by snorkeling or seining and will be accomplished by 
contracting with the appropriate species experts. Annual reports will be 
produced detailing the stocking rates and monitoring activities that 
took place during the previous year. We will also fully evaluate these 
reintroduction efforts after 5 and 10 years to determine whether to 
continue or terminate the reintroduction efforts.

    (o) Boulder darter (Etheostoma wapiti).
    (1) Where is the boulder darter designated as a nonessential 
experimental population (NEP)? (i) The NEP area for the boulder darter 
is within the species' historic range and is defined as follows: Shoal 
Creek (from Shoal Creek mile 41.7 (66.7 km)) at the mouth of Long

Reservoir (Shoal Creek mile 14 (22 km)) at Goose Shoals, Lauderdale 
County, AL, including

[[Page 224]]

the lower 5 miles (8 km) of all tributaries that enter this reach.
    (ii) The boulder darter is not currently known to exist in Shoal 
Creek or its tributaries. Based on the habitat requirements of this 
fish, we do not expect it to become established outside the NEP area. 
However, if any individuals of the species move upstream or downstream 
or into tributaries outside the designated NEP area, we would presume 
that they came from the reintroduced population. We would then amend 
this rule through our normal rulemaking process in order to enlarge the 
boundaries of the NEP area to include the entire range of the expanded 
population.
    (iii) We do not intend to change the NEP designations to ``essential 
experimental,'' ``threatened,'' or ``endangered'' within the NEP area. 
Additionally, we will not designate critical habitat for these NEPs, as 
provided by 16 U.S.C. 1539(j)(2)(C)(ii).
    (2) What activities are not allowed in the NEP area? (i) Except as 
expressly allowed in paragraph (o)(3) of this section, all the 
provisions of Sec.  17.31(a) and (b) apply to the boulder darter.
    (ii) Any manner of take not described under paragraph (o)(3) of this 
section is prohibited in the NEP area. We may refer unauthorized take of 
these species to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.
    (iii) You may not possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever any of the identified fishes, 
or parts thereof, that are taken or possessed in violation of paragraph 
(o)(2) of this section or in violation of the applicable State fish and 
wildlife laws or regulations or the Act.
    (iv) You may not attempt to commit, solicit another to commit, or 
cause to be committed any offense defined in paragraph (o)(2) of this 
section.
    (3) What take is allowed in the NEP area? Take of this species that 
is accidental and incidental to an otherwise legal activity, such as 
recreation (e.g., fishing, boating, wading, trapping, or swimming), 
forestry, agriculture, and other activities that are in accordance with 
Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, is allowed.
    (4) How will the effectiveness of these reintroductions be 
monitored? After the initial stocking of fish, we will monitor annually 
their presence or absence and document any spawning behavior or young-
of-the-year fish that might be present. This monitoring will be

tributaries or in any of the tributaries to the free-flowing reaches of 
the French Broad River below Douglas Dam, Knox and Sevier Counties, 
Tennessee, or of the Holston River below the Cherokee Dam, Knox, 
Grainger, and Jefferson Counties, Tennessee. Based on its habitat 
requirements, we do not expect this species to become established 
outside these NEP areas. However, if individuals move upstream or 
downstream or into tributaries outside either of the designated NEP 
areas, we would presume that these individuals came from the 
reintroduced population. We would then amend this rule and enlarge the 
boundaries of the NEP area to include the entire range of the expanded 
population.
    (i) The Tellico River NEP area is within the species' historic range 
and is defined as follows: The Tellico River, between the backwaters of

Counties, Tennessee, to the base of Cherokee Dam (RM 52.3 (83.7 km)); 
and the lower 5 RM (8 km) of all tributaries that enter these river 
reaches.
    (iii) We do not intend to change the NEP designations to ``essential 
experimental,'' ``threatened,'' or ``endangered'' within the NEP area. 
Additionally, we will not designate critical habitat for these NEPs, as 
provided by 16 U.S.C. 1539(j)(2)(C)(ii).

    (1) Where are these mollusks designated as NEPs? (i) The NEP area 
for these mollusks is within the species' historical range and is 
defined as follows: The French Broad River, Knox and Sevier Counties, 
Tennessee, from the base of Douglas Dam (river mile (RM) 32.3 (51.7 
kilometers (km)) downstream to the confluence with the Holston River; 
then up the Holston River, Knox, Grainger, and Jefferson Counties, 
Tennessee, to the base of Cherokee Dam (RM 52.3 (83.7 km)); and the 
lower 5 RM (8 km) of all tributaries that enter these river reaches. 
None of the species identified in paragraph (b) are known to exist in 
any of the tributaries to the free-flowing reaches of the French Broad 
River below Douglas Dam, Knox and Sevier Counties, Tennessee, or of the 
Holston River below the Cherokee Dam, Knox, Grainger, and Jefferson 
Counties, Tennessee. Based on their habitat requirements, we do not 
expect these species to become established outside this NEP area. 
However, if any individuals are found upstream or downstream or into 
tributaries outside the designated NEP area, we would presume that they 
came from the reintroduced populations. We would then amend paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section to enlarge the boundaries of the NEP area to 
include the entire range of the expanded population.
    (ii) Another NEP area for 10 of these mollusks (Cumberland bean, 
Cumberlandian combshell, Cumberland monkeyface, oyster mussel, birdwing 
pearlymussel, cracking pearlymussel, dromedary pearlymussel, fine-rayed 
pigtoe, shiny pigtoe, and Anthony's riversnail) is provided in paragraph 
(a) of this section.
    (iii) We do not intend to change the NEP designations to ``essential 
experimental,'' ``threatened,'' or ``endangered'' within the NEP area. 
Additionally, we will not designate critical habitat for these NEPs, as 
provided by 16 U.S.C. 1539(j)(2)(C)(ii).
    (2) What activities are not allowed in the NEP area? (i) Except as 
expressly allowed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, all the 
prohibitions of Sec.  17.31(a) and (b) apply to the mollusks identified 
in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (ii) Any manner of take not described under paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section will not be allowed in the NEP area. We may refer the 
unauthorized take of these species to the appropriate authorities for 
prosecution.
    (iii) You may not possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, 
import, or export by any means whatsoever any of the identified 
mollusks, or parts thereof, that are taken or possessed in violation of 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section or in violation of the applicable State 
fish and wildlife laws or regulations or the Act.
    (iv) You may not attempt to commit, solicit another to commit, or 
cause to be committed any offense defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section.
    (3) What take is allowed in the NEP area? Take of these species that 
is accidental and incidental to an otherwise legal activity, such as 
recreation (e.g., fishing, boating, wading, trapping, or swimming), 
forestry, agriculture, and other activities that are in accordance with 
Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, is allowed.
    (4) How will the effectiveness of these reintroductions be 
monitored? We will prepare periodic progress reports and fully evaluate 
these reintroduction efforts after 5 and 10 years to determine whether 
to continue or terminate the reintroduction efforts.

<R05>
Sec.  17.94  Critical habitats.

    (a) The areas listed in Sec.  17.95 (fish and wildlife) and Sec.  
17.96 (plants) and referred to in the lists at Sec. Sec.  17.11 and 
17.12 have been determined by the Director to be Critical Habitat. All 
Federal agencies must insure that any action authorized, funded, or 
carried out by them is not likely to result in the destruction or 
adverse modification of the constituent elements essential to the 
conservation of the listed species within these defined Critical 
Habitats. (See part 402 for rules concerning this prohibition; see also 
part 424 for rules concerning the determination of Critical Habitat).
    (b) The map provided by the Director does not, unless otherwise 
indicated, constitute the definition of the boundaries of a Critical 
Habitat. Such maps are provided for reference purposes to guide Federal 
agencies and other interested parties in locating the general boundaries 
of the Critical Habitat. Critical Habitats are described by reference to 
surveyable landmarks found on standard topographic maps of the area and 
to the States and county(ies) within which all or part of the Critical 
Habitat is located. Unless otherwise indicated within the Critical 
Habitat description, the State and county(ies) names are provided for 
informational purposes only.
    (c) Critical Habitat management focuses only on the biological or 
physical constituent elements within the defined area of Critical 
Habitat that are essential to the conservation of the species. Those 
major constituent elements that are known to require special management 
considerations or protection will be listed with the description of the 
Critical Habitat.
    (d) The sequence of species within each list of Critical Habitats in 
Sec. Sec.  17.95 and 17.96 will follow the sequences in the lists of 
Endangered and Threatened wildlife (Sec.  17.11) and plants (Sec.  
17.12). Multiple entries for each species will be alphabetic by State.

            Mariana Fruit Bat (Pteropus mariannus mariannus)

    (1) The critical habitat unit for the Mariana fruit bat is depicted 
for the Territory of Guam on the maps below.
    (2) Within this area, the primary constituent elements required by 
the Mariana fruit bat for the biological needs of foraging, sheltering, 
roosting, and rearing of young are found in areas supporting limestone, 
secondary, ravine, swamp, agricultural, and coastal forests composed of 
native or introduced plant species. These forest types provide the 
primary constituent elements of:
    (i) Plant species used for foraging, such as Artocarpus sp. 
(breadfruit), Carica papaya (papaya), Cycas circinalis (fadang), Ficus 
spp. (fig), Pandanus tectorius (kafu), Cocos nucifera (coconut palm), 
and Terminalia catappa (talisai); and
    (ii) Remote locations, often within 328 ft (100 m) of clifflines 
that are 260 to 590 ft (80 to 100 m) tall, with limited exposure to 
human disturbance; land that contains mature fig, Mammea odorata 
(chopak), Casuarina equisetifolia (gago), Macaranga thompsonii (pengua), 
Guettarda speciosa (panao), Neisosperma oppositifolia (fagot), and other 
tree species that are used for roosting and breeding.
    (3) Critical habitat does not include existing features and 
structures within the boundaries of the mapped units, such as buildings, 
roads, aqueducts, antennas, water tanks, agricultural fields, paved 
areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas not

[[Page 231]]

containing one or more of the primary constituent elements.
    (4) The critical habitat unit is described below. Coordinates are in 
UTM Zone 55 with units in meters using North American Datum of 1983 
(NAD83)/World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84).

          San Miguel Island Fox (Urocyon littoralis littoralis)

    We have determined that no areas meet the definition of critical 
habitat under section 3(5)(A) of the Act for San Miguel Island fox. 
Therefore, no specific areas are designated as critical habitat for this 
subspecies.

        Santa Catalina Island Fox (Urocyon littoralis catalinae)

    We have determined that no areas meet the definition of critical 
habitat under section 3(5)(A) of the Act for Santa Catalina Island fox. 
Therefore, no specific areas are designated as critical habitat for this 
subspecies.

         Santa Cruz Island Fox (Urocyon littoralis santacruzae)

    We have determined that no areas meet the definition of critical 
habitat under section 3(5)(A) of the Act for Santa Cruz Island fox. 
Therefore, no specific areas are designated as critical habitat for this 
subspecies.

[[Page 233]]

          Santa Rosa Island Fox (Urocyon littoralis santarosae)

    We have determined that no areas meet the definition of critical 
habitat under section 3(5)(A) of the Act for Santa Rosa Island fox. 
Therefore, no specific areas are designated as critical habitat for this 
subspecies.

           Fresno Kangaroo Rat (Dipodomys nitratoides exilis)

    California. An area of land, water, and airspace in Fresno County, 
with the following components (Mt. Diablo Base Meridian): T14S R15E, 
E\1/2\ NW\1/4\ and NE\1/4\ Sec. 11, that part of W\1/2\ Sec. 12 north of 
the Southern Pacific Railroad, E\1/2\ Sec. 12; T14S R16E, that part of 
Sec. 7 south of the Southern Pacific Railroad.
    Within this area, the major constituent elements that are known to 
require special management considerations or protection are the hummocks 
and substrate that provide sites for burrow construction, and the 
natural alkali sink-open grassland vegetation that provides food and 
escape cover.

         San Bernardino Kangaroo Rat (Dipodomys merriami parvus)

    (1) Critical Habitat Units are depicted for San Bernardino and 
Riverside counties, California, on the maps below.
    (2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements for the San 
Bernardino kangaroo rat are those habitat components that are essential 
for the primary biological needs of the species. Based on our current 
knowledge of this species, the primary constituent elements include:
    (i) Soil series consisting predominantly of sand, loamy sand, sandy 
loam, or loam;
    (ii) Alluvial sage scrub and associated vegetation, such as coastal 
sage scrub and chamise chaparral, with a moderately open canopy.
    (iii) River, creek, stream, and wash channels; alluvial fans; 
floodplains; floodplain benches and terraces; and historic braided 
channels that are subject to dynamic geomorphological and hydrological 
processes typical of fluvial systems within the historical range of the 
San Bernardino kangaroo rat. These areas may include a mosaic of 
suitable and unsuitable soils and vegetation that either (A) occur at a 
scale smaller than the home range of the animal, or (B) form a series of 
core areas and linkages between them.
    (iv) Upland areas proximal to floodplains with suitable habitat 
(e.g., floodplains that support the soils, vegetation, or 
geomorphological, hydrological and aeolian processes essential to this 
species). These areas are essential due to their geographic proximity to 
suitable habitat and the functions they serve during flooding events. 
These areas may include marginal habitats such as agricultural lands 
that are disced annually, out-of-production vineyards, margins

[[Page 234]]

of orchards, areas of active or inactive industrial or resource 
extraction activities, and urban/wildland interfaces.
    (3) Existing features and structures, such as buildings, roads, 
railroads, airports, other paved areas, lawns, and other urban 
landscaped areas, do not contain one or more of the primary constituent 
elements. Federal actions limited to those areas, therefore, would not 
trigger a consultation under section 7 of the Act unless they affect the 
species and/or primary constituent elements in adjacent critical 
habitat.

                      Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis)

    (1) Critical habitat units are depicted on the maps below for the 
following States and counties:
    (i) Minnesota: Koochiching and St. Louis counties;
    (ii) Montana: Flathead and Glacier counties; and
    (iii) Washington: Chelan County.
    (2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements for the 
Canada lynx are boreal forest landscapes supporting a mosaic of 
differing successional forest stages and containing:
    (i) Presence of snowshoe hares and their preferred habitat 
conditions, which include dense understories of young trees or shrubs 
tall enough to protrude above the snow;

[[Page 244]]

    (ii) Winter snow conditions that are generally deep and fluffy for 
extended periods of time; and
    (iii) Sites for denning having abundant, coarse woody debris, such 
as downed trees and root wads.
    (3) Critical habitat does not include waterbodies, including lakes, 
reservoirs, or rivers, or human-made structures existing on the 
effective date of this rule, such as buildings, paved and gravel 
roadbeds, and the land on which such structures are located.
    (4) Note: Index map for Canada lynx critical habitat follows:

          Alabama Beach Mouse (Peromyscus polionotus ammobates)

    (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Baldwin County, Alabama, 
on the maps below.
    (2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the 
Alabama Beach Mouse are the habitat components that provide:
    (i) A contiguous mosaic of primary, secondary, and scrub vegetation 
and dune structure, with a balanced level of competition and predation 
and few or no competitive or predaceous nonnative species present, that 
collectively provide foraging opportunities, cover, and burrow sites.
    (ii) Primary and secondary dunes, generally dominated by sea oats 
(Uniola paniculata), that despite occasional temporary impacts and 
reconfiguration from tropical storms and hurricanes, provide abundant 
food resources, burrow sites, and protection from predators.
    (iii) Scrub dunes, generally dominated by scrub oaks (Quercus spp.), 
that provide food resources and burrow sites, and provide elevated 
refugia during and after intense flooding due to rainfall and/or 
hurricane-induced storm surge.
    (iv) Unobstructed habitat connections that facilitate genetic 
exchange, dispersal, natural exploratory movements, and recolonization 
of locally extirpated areas.
    (v) A natural light regime within the coastal dune ecosystem, 
compatible with the nocturnal activity of beach mice, necessary for 
normal behavior, growth, and viability of all life stages.
    (3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as 
buildings, aqueducts, airport runways, roads, other paved areas, and 
piers) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal 
boundaries on the effective date of this rule.
    (4) Critical habitat map units. Data layers defining map units were 
created by delineating habitats that contained one or more of the PCEs 
defined in paragraph (2) of this entry, over 2005 Baldwin County, 
Alabama color photography (UTM 16, NAD 83).

       Choctawhatcee Beach Mouse (Peromyscus polionotus allophrys)

    (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Okaloosa, Walton, and 
Bay Counties, Florida, on the maps below.
    (2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the 
Choctawhatchee beach mouse are the habitat components that provide:

[[Page 262]]

    (i) A contiguous mosaic of primary, secondary, and scrub vegetation 
and dune structure, with a balanced level of competition and predation 
and few or no competitive or predaceous nonnative species present, that 
collectively provide foraging opportunities, cover, and burrow sites;
    (ii) Primary and secondary dunes, generally dominated by sea oats 
(Uniola paniculata), that despite occasional temporary impacts and 
reconfiguration from tropical storms and hurricanes, provide abundant 
food resources, burrow sites, and protection from predators;
    (iii) Scrub dunes, generally dominated by scrub oaks (Quercus spp.), 
that provide food resources and burrow sites, and provide elevated 
refugia during and after intense flooding due to rainfall and/or 
hurricane-induced storm surge;
    (iv) Functional, unobstructed habitat connections that facilitate 
genetic exchange, dispersal, natural exploratory movements, and re-
colonization of locally extirpated areas; and
    (v) A natural light regime within the coastal dune ecosystem, 
compatible with the nocturnal activity of beach mice, necessary for 
normal behavior, growth, and viability of all life stages.
    (3) Critical habitat does not include man-made structures existing 
on the effective date of this rule and not containing one or more of the 
primary constituent elements, such as buildings, aqueducts, airports, 
driveways, and roads, and the land on which such structures are located.
    (4) Critical Habitat Map Units. Data layers defining map units were 
created by delineating habitats that contained one or more of the 
primary constituent elements defined in paragraph (2) of this entry over 
1999 and 2004 digital ortho photography at a scale of at least 1:4000.

      Perdido Key Beach Mouse (Peromyscus polionotus trissyllepsis)

    (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Escambia County, 
Florida, and Baldwin County, Alabama, on the maps below.
    (2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the 
Perdido Key beach mouse are the habitat components that provide:
    (i) A contiguous mosaic of primary, secondary, and scrub vegetation 
and dune structure, with a balanced level of competition and predation 
and few or no competitive or predaceous nonnative species present, that 
collectively provide foraging opportunities, cover, and burrow sites;
    (ii) Primary and secondary dunes, generally dominated by sea oats 
(Uniola paniculata), that despite occasional temporary impacts and 
reconfiguration from tropical storms and hurricanes, provide abundant 
food resources, burrow sites, and protection from predators;
    (iii) Scrub dunes, generally dominated by scrub oaks (Quercus spp.), 
that provide food resources and burrow sites, and provide elevated 
refugia during and after intense flooding due to rainfall and/or 
hurricane-induced storm surge;
    (iv) Functional, unobstructed habitat connections that facilitate 
genetic exchange, dispersal, natural exploratory movements, and re-
colonization of locally extirpated areas; and
    (v) A natural light regime within the coastal dune ecosystem, 
compatible with the nocturnal activity of beach mice, necessary for 
normal behavior, growth, and viability of all life stages.
    (3) Critical habitat does not include man-made structures existing 
on the effective date of this rule and not containing one or more of the 
primary constituent elements, such as buildings, aqueducts, airports, 
driveways, and roads, and the land on which such structures are located.
    (4) Critical Habitat Map Units. Data layers defining map units were 
created by delineating habitats that contained one or more of the 
primary constituent elements defined in paragraph (2) of this entry over 
1999 and 2004 digital ortho photography at a scale of at least 1:4000.

         Preble's Meadow Jumping Mouse (Zapus hudsonius preblei)

    (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Wyoming and Colorado. 
Maps and descriptions follow.
    (2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements for the 
Preble's include those habitat components essential for the biological 
needs of reproducing, rearing of young, foraging, sheltering, 
hibernation, dispersal, and genetic exchange. The primary

[[Page 329]]

constituent elements are found in and near riparian areas located within 
grassland, shrubland, forest, and mixed-vegetation types where dense 
herbaceous or woody vegetation occurs near the ground level, where 
available open water exists during their active season, and where there 
are ample upland habitats of sufficient width and quality for foraging, 
hibernation, and refugia from catastrophic flooding events. Primary 
constituent elements associated with the biological needs of dispersal 
and genetic exchange also are found in areas that provide connectivity 
or linkage between or within Preble's populations. The dynamic 
ecological processes that create and maintain Preble's habitat also are 
important primary constituent elements. Primary constituent elements 
include:
    (i) A pattern of dense riparian vegetation consisting of grasses, 
forbs, and shrubs in areas along rivers and streams that provide open 
water through the Preble's active season;
    (ii) Adjacent floodplains and vegetated uplands with limited human 
disturbance (including hayed fields, grazed pasture, other agricultural 
lands that are not plowed or disced regularly, areas that have been 
restored after past aggregate extraction, areas supporting recreational 
trails, and urban/wildland interfaces);
    (iii) Areas that provide connectivity between and within populations 
(These may include river and stream reaches with minimal vegetative 
cover or that are armored for erosion control; travelways beneath 
bridges, through culverts, and along canals and ditches; and other areas 
that have experienced substantial human alteration or disturbance.); and
    (iv) Dynamic geomorphological and hydrological processes typical of 
systems within the range of the Preble's, i.e., those processes that 
create and maintain river and stream channels, floodplains, and 
floodplain benches, and promote patterns of vegetation favorable to the 
Preble's.
    (3) Existing features and structures within the boundaries of the 
mapped units, such as buildings, roads, parking lots, other paved areas, 
lawns, other urban and suburban landscaped areas, regularly plowed or 
disced agricultural areas, and other features not containing any of the 
primary constituent elements are not considered critical habitat.

       St. Andrew Beach Mouse (Peromyscus polionotus peninsularis)

    (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Bay and Gulf Counties, 
Florida, on the maps below.
    (2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the St. 
Andrew beach mouse are the habitat components that provide:

[[Page 347]]

    (i) A contiguous mosaic of primary, secondary, and scrub vegetation 
and dune structure, with a balanced level of competition and predation 
and few or no competitive or predaceous nonnative species present, that 
collectively provide foraging opportunities, cover, and burrow sites;
    (ii) Primary and secondary dunes, generally dominated by sea oats 
(Uniola paniculata), that despite occasional temporary impacts and 
reconfiguration from tropical storms and hurricanes, provide abundant 
food resources, burrow sites, and protection from predators;
    (iii) Scrub dunes, generally dominated by scrub oaks (Quercus spp.), 
that provide food resources and burrow sites, and provide elevated 
refugia during and after intense flooding due to rainfall and/or 
hurricane-induced storm surge;
    (iv) Functional, unobstructed habitat connections that facilitate 
genetic exchange, dispersal, natural exploratory movements, and re-
colonization of locally extirpated areas; and
    (v) A natural light regime within the coastal dune ecosystem, 
compatible with the nocturnal activity of beach mice, necessary for 
normal behavior, growth, and viability of all life stages.
    (3) Critical habitat does not include man-made structures existing 
on the effective date of this rule and not containing one or more of the 
primary constituent elements, such as buildings, aqueducts, airports, 
driveways, and roads, and the land on which such structures are located.
    (4) Critical Habitat Map Units. Data layers defining map units were 
created by delineating habitats that contained one or more of the 
primary constituent elements defined in paragraph (2) of this entry over 
1999 and 2004 digital ortho photography at a scale of at least 1:4000.
    (5) Note: Map 1, Index Map of Critical Habitat Units for the St. 
Andrew beach mouse, follows:

    Within these areas the major constituent elements that are known to 
require special management considerations or protection are mangrove 
swamps containing red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), 
and white (Laguncularia racemosa) mangroves, and buttonwood (Conocarpus 
erectus); salt marshes, swales, and adjacent transitional wetlands 
containing saltwort (Batis maritima), perennial glasswort (Salicornia 
virginica), saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), sea ox-eye (Borrichia

           Bighorn Sheep (Peninsular Ranges) (Ovis canadensis)

    1. The following map shows the general location of three contiguous 
designated critical habitat units for the Peninsular bighorn sheep in 
Riverside, San Diego, and Imperial counties, California, respectively.

    2. Within these areas, the primary constituent elements for 
Peninsular bighorn sheep are those habitat components that are essential 
for the primary biological needs of feeding, resting, reproduction and 
population recruitment, dispersal, connectivity between ewe groups, and 
isolation from detrimental human disturbance. The principal biological 
and physical constituent elements that are essential to the conservation 
of Peninsular bighorn sheep include: space for the normal

behavior of groups and individuals; protection from disturbance; 
availability of the various native desert plant communities found on 
different topographic slopes, aspects, and landforms, such as steep 
slopes, rolling foothills, alluvial fans, and canyon bottoms; a range of 
habitats that provide forage, especially during periods of drought; 
steep, remote habitat for lambing, rearing of young, and escape from 
disturbance and/or predation; water sources; suitable linkages allowing 
individual bighorn to move freely between ewe groups and maintain 
connections between subpopulations.
    3. Towns and similar developed lands, which do not provide primary 
constituent elements, are not critical habitat. Road and railroad 
rights-of-way, flood control facilities, or other facilities that must 
be traversed by bighorn sheep to maintain connectivity between 
subpopulations, or otherwise may provide food, water, or cover for 
Peninsular bighorn sheep, are considered to support primary constituent 
elements, and therefore are included as critical habitat.

             Buena Vista Lake Shrew (Sorex ornatus relictus)

    (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Kern County, California, 
on the maps below.
    (2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the 
Buena Vista Lake shrew are the habitat components that provide:
    (i) Riparian or wetland communities supporting a complex vegetative 
structure with a thick cover of leaf litter or dense mats of low-lying 
vegetation; and
    (ii) Suitable moisture supplied by a shallow water table, 
irrigation, or proximity to permanent or semipermanent water; and
    (iii) A consistent and diverse supply of prey.
    (3) Critical habitat does not include existing features and 
structures, such as buildings, aqueducts, airports, roads, and other 
developed areas not containing one or more of the primary constituent 
elements.
    (4) Data layers defining map units were created on a base of USGS 
7.5[min] quadrangles, and critical habitat units were then mapped using 
Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates.

                      Mariana Crow (Corvus kubaryi)

    (1) Critical habitat units for the Mariana crow are depicted for the 
Territory of Guam and the island of Rota, Commonwealth of the Northern 
Mariana Islands, on the maps below.
    (2) The primary constituent elements required by the Mariana crow 
for the biological needs of foraging, sheltering, roosting, nesting, and 
rearing of young are found in areas that support limestone, secondary, 
ravine, swamp, agricultural, and coastal forests composed of native and 
introduced plant species. These forest types provide the primary 
constituent elements of:
    (i) Emergent trees and subcanopy trees with dense cover for 
breeding, such as Neisosperma oppositifolia (fagot), Macaranga 
thompsonii (pengua), Intsia bijuga (ifit), Premna obtusifolia (ahgao), 
Eugenia reinwardtiana (aabang), Ficus spp. (fig), Elaeocarpus joga 
(yoga), and Tristiropsis obtusangula (faniok);
    (ii) Sufficient area of predominantly native forest to allow nesting 
at least 950 ft (290 m) from the nearest road and 203 ft (62 m) from the 
nearest forest edge and to support Mariana crow breeding territories 
(approximately 30 to 91 ac (12 to 37 ha)) and foraging areas for 
nonbreeding juvenile crows; and
    (iii) Standing dead trees and plant species for foraging such as 
Aglaia mariannensis (maypunayo), Artocarpus spp. (breadfruit), Cocos 
nucifera (coconut palm), fagot, Hibiscus tiliaceus (pago), ifit, 
Leucaena spp. (tangantangan), Ochrosia mariannensis (langiti), Pandanus 
tectorius (kafu), ahgao, fig, and joga.
    (3) Critical habitat does not include existing features and 
structures within the boundaries of the mapped units, such as buildings, 
roads, aqueducts, antennas, water tanks, agricultural fields, paved 
areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas not containing one or 
more of the primary constituent elements.
    (4) Critical habitat units are described below. Coordinates are in 
UTM Zone 55 with units in meters using North American Datum of 1983 
(NAD83)/World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84).

    1. Critical habitat units are depicted for Unit 1 (Central Yukon-
Kuskokwim Delta), Unit 2 (South Y-K Delta Unit), Unit 3 (Norton Sound), 
Unit 4 (Ledyard Bay), and Unit 5 (the Wintering Unit in the Bering Sea 
between St. Lawrence and St. Matthew Islands) for reference only. The 
areas in critical habitat are described below.
    2. Within these areas, the primary constituent elements are those 
habitat components that are essential for the primary biological needs 
of feeding, nesting, brood rearing, roosting, molting, migrating and 
wintering. The primary constituent elements for Units 1 and 2 (the Y-K 
Delta units) include the vegetated intertidal zone and all open water 
inclusions within this zone. Primary constituent elements for the Norton 
Sound Unit (Unit 3) and the Ledyard Bay Unit (Unit 4) include all marine 
waters greater than 5 m (16.4 ft) in depth and less than or equal to 25 
m (82.0 ft) in depth, along with associated marine aquatic flora and

[[Page 421]]

fauna in the water column, and the underlying marine benthic community. 
Primary constituent elements for the Wintering Unit (Unit 5) include all 
marine waters less than or equal to 75 m (246.1 ft) in depth, along with 
associated marine aquatic flora and fauna in the water column, and the 
underlying marine benthic community. Critical habitat does not include 
those areas within the boundary of any unit that do not fit the 
description of primary constituent elements for that unit.
    3. Critical habitat does not include existing features and 
structures, such as buildings, roads, pipelines, utility corridors, 
airports, other paved areas, and other developed areas.
    4. This final rule designating critical habitat for the spectacled 
eider uses published coordinates of prominent landmarks, when 
appropriate, obtained from the Dictionary of Alaska Place Names.

habitat components that are essential for the primary biological needs 
of feeding, roosting, molting, and wintering. The primary constituent 
elements for Unit 1 include the vegetated intertidal zone and all open 
water inclusions within this zone. The primary constituent elements for 
Units 2, 3, 4, and 5 are marine waters up to 9 m (30 feet) deep and the 
underlying substrate, the associated invertebrate fauna in the water 
column, the underlying marine benthic community, and where present, 
eelgrass beds and associated flora and fauna. Critical habitat does not 
include those areas within the boundary of any unit that do not fit the 
description of primary constituent elements for that unit.
    3. Critical habitat does not include existing human structures, such 
as buildings, roads, pipelines, utility corridors, airports, other paved 
areas, docks, wharves, buoys, or other developed areas.

             Oahu elepaio (Chasiempis sandwichensis ibidis)

    (1) Critical Habitat Units are depicted for the City and County of 
Honolulu on the maps below.
    (2)(i) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements required 
by the Oahu elepaio are those habitat components that are essential for 
the biological needs of foraging, sheltering, roosting, nesting, and 
rearing of young. These primary constituent elements are undeveloped 
wet, mesic, and dry forest habitats with a generally continuous canopy 
and a dense understory and that are composed of native and/or introduced 
plant species. Such forests are found in valleys and on mountain slopes 
and ridges. The primary constituent elements associated with the 
biological needs of dispersal and genetic exchange are undeveloped wet 
or dry shrub land and wet or dry cliff habitats composed of native and/
or introduced plant species that separate elepaio populations. Elepaio 
may not establish territories in shrub or cliff habitats and may use 
them only transiently, but undeveloped areas containing these habitats 
are important for linking populations by providing dispersal corridors 
and promoting genetic exchange among populations.
    (ii) Within the forests and shrub lands providing the primary 
constituent elements, plant species composition varies with rainfall, 
elevation, and degree of habitat disturbance, and plant species occur in 
a variety of assemblages. Common native and introduced species within 
these plant assemblages include, but are not limited to, ohia 
(Metrosideros polymorpha), koa (Acacia koa), papala kepau (Pisonia 
umbellifera), lama (Diospyros sandwicensis), mamaki (Pipturus albidus), 
kaulu (Sapindus oahuensis), hame (Antidesma platyphyllum), alaa 
(Pouteria sandwicensis), aalii (Dodonaea viscosa), naupaka kuahiwi 
(Scaevola spp.), pukiawe (Styphelia tameiameiae), uluhe (Dicranopteris 
linearis), guava (Psidium guajava), strawberry guava (P. cattleianum), 
mango (Mangifera indica), kukui (Aleurites moluccana), christmasberry 
(Schinus terebinthifolius), ti (Cordyline terminalis), rose apple 
(Syzygium jambos), mountain apple (S. malaccense), and Java plum (S. 
cumini).
    (3) Existing developed features and structures, such as buildings, 
roads, aqueducts, antennas, water tanks, agricultural fields, paved 
areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas, that do not contain one 
or more of the primary constituent elements, are not included as 
critical habitat.
    (4) Map of critical habitat units for the Oahu elepaio follows.

       Southwestern Willow Flycatcher (Empidonax traillii extimus)

    (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Apache, Cochise, Gila, 
Graham, Greenlee, Maricopa, Mohave, Pinal, Pima, and Yavapai counties in 
Arizona, Kern, Santa Barbara, San Bernardino, and San Diego counties in 
southern California, Clark County in southern Nevada, Grant, Hidalgo, 
Mora, Rio Arriba, Soccoro, Taos, and Valencia counties in New Mexico, 
and Washington County in southwestern Utah on the maps and as described 
below.
    (2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for 
southwestern willow flycatcher are:
    (i) Riparian habitat in a dynamic successional riverine environment 
(for nesting, foraging, migration, dispersal, and shelter) that 
comprises:
    (A) Trees and shrubs that include Gooddings willow (Salix 
gooddingii), coyote willow (Salix exigua), Geyers willow (Salix 
geyerana), arroyo willow (Salix lasiolepis), red willow (Salix 
laevigata), yewleaf willow (Salix taxifolia), pacific willow (Salix 
lasiandra), boxelder (Acer negundo), tamarisk (Tamarix ramosissima), 
Russian olive (Eleagnus angustifolia), buttonbush (Cephalanthus 
occidentalis), cottonwood (Populus fremontii), stinging nettle (Urtica 
dioica), alder (Alnus rhombifolia, Alnus oblongifolia, Alnus 
tenuifolia), velvet ash (Fraxinus velutina), poison hemlock (Conium 
maculatum), blackberry (Rubus ursinus), seep willow (Baccharis 
salicifolia, Baccharis glutinosa), oak (Quercus agrifolia, Quercus 
chrysolepis), rose (Rosa californica, Rosa arizonica, Rosa multiflora), 
sycamore (Platinus wrightii), false indigo (Amorpha californica), 
Pacific poison ivy (Toxicodendron diversilobum), grape (Vitus 
arizonica), Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus

quinquefolia), Siberian elm (Ulmus pumila), and walnut (Juglans 
hindsii);
    (B) Dense riparian vegetation with thickets of trees and shrubs 
ranging in height from 2 to 30 meters (m) (6 to 98 feet (ft). Lower-
stature thickets (2 to 4 m or 6 to 13 ft tall) are found at higher 
elevation riparian forests, and tall-stature thickets are found at 
middle- and lower-elevation riparian forests;
    (C) Areas of dense riparian foliage at least from the ground level 
up to approximately 4 m (13 ft) above ground or dense foliage only at 
the shrub level, or as a low, dense tree canopy;
    (D) Sites for nesting that contain a dense tree and/or shrub canopy 
(the amount of cover provided by tree and shrub branches measured from 
the ground) (i.e., a tree or shrub canopy with densities ranging from 50 
percent to 100 percent); or
    (E) Dense patches of riparian forests that are interspersed with 
small openings of open water or marsh, or shorter/sparser vegetation 
that creates a mosaic that is not uniformly dense. Patch size may be as 
small as 0.1 ha (0.25 ac) or as large as 70 ha (175 ac); and
    (ii) A variety of insect prey populations found within or adjacent 
to riparian floodplains or moist environments, including: flying ants, 
wasps, and bees (Hymenoptera); dragonflies (Odonata); flies (Diptera); 
true bugs (Hemiptera); beetles (Coleoptera); butterflies/moths and 
caterpillars (Lepidoptera); and spittlebugs (Homoptera).

gnatcatcher are those habitat components that are essential for the 
primary biological needs of foraging, nesting, rearing of young, intra-
specific communication, roosting, dispersal, genetic exchange, or 
sheltering (Atwood 1990). Primary

[[Page 465]]

constituent elements are provided in undeveloped areas that support 
various types of sage scrub or support chaparral, grassland, and 
riparian habitats where they occur proximal to sage scrub and where they 
may be utilized for biological needs such as breeding and foraging 
(Atwood et al. 1998, Campbell et al. 1998). Primary constituent elements 
associated with the biological needs of dispersal are also found in 
undeveloped areas that provide linkage between or within larger core 
areas, including open space and disturbed areas that may receive only 
periodic use.
    Primary constituent elements include, but are not limited to, the 
following plant communities in their natural state or those that have 
been recently disturbed (e.g., fire or grubbing): Venturan coastal sage 
scrub, Diegan coastal sage scrub, maritime succulent scrub, Riversidean 
sage scrub, Riversidean alluvial fan scrub, southern coastal bluff 
scrub, and coastal sage-chaparral scrub (Holland 1986). Based upon 
dominant species, these communities have been further divided into 
series such as black sage, brittlebush, California buckwheat, California 
buckwheat-white sage, California encelia, California sagebrush, 
California sagebrush-black sage, California sagebrush-California 
buckwheat, coast prickly-pear, mixed sage, purple sage, scalebroom, and 
white sage (Sawyer and Keeler-Wolf 1995). Dominant species within these 
plant communities include California sagebrush (Artemisia californica), 
buckwheats (Eriogonum fasciculatum and E. cinereum), encelias (Encelia 
californica and E. farinosa), and various sages (commonly Salvia 
mellifera, S. apiana, and S. leucophylla). Other commonly occurring 
plants include coast goldenbush (Isocoma menziesii), bush monkeyflower 
(Mimulus aurantiacus), Mexican elderberry (Sambucus mexicana), 
bladderpod (Isomeris arborea), deerweed (Lotus scoparius), chaparral 
mallow (Malacothamnus fasciculatum), and laurel sumac (Malosma laurina), 
and several species of Rhus (R. integrifolia, R. ovata, and R. 
trilobata). Succulent species, such as boxthorn (Lycium spp.), cliff 
spurge (Euphorbia misera), jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis), and various 
species of cacti (Opuntia littoralis, O. prolifera, and Ferocactus 
viridescens), and live-forever (Dudleya spp.), are represented in 
maritime succulent scrub, coast prickly-pear scrub, and southern coastal 
bluff scrubs.
    3. Critical habitat does not include non-Federal lands covered by a 
legally operative incidental take permit for the coastal California 
gnatcatcher issued under section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act on or before 
October 24, 2000.
    4. Critical habitat does not include existing features and 
structures, such as buildings, roads, aqueducts, railroads, airports, 
other paved areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas not 
containing one or more of the primary constituent elements.

      Guam Micronesian Kingfisher (Halcyon cinnamomina cinnamomina)

    (1) The critical habitat unit for the Guam Micronesian kingfisher is 
depicted for the Territory of Guam on the maps below.
    (2) The primary constituent elements required by the Guam 
Micronesian kingfisher for the biological needs of foraging, sheltering, 
roosting, nesting, and rearing of young are found in areas that support 
limestone, secondary, ravine, swamp, agricultural, and coastal forests 
composed of native and introduced plant species. These forest types 
include the primary constituent elements of:
    (i) Closed canopy and well-developed understory vegetation; large 
(approximately 43 cm (17 in) diameter at breast height), standing dead 
trees (especially Tristiropsis obtusangula (faniok), Pisonia grandis 
(umumu), Artocarpus spp. (breadfruit), Ficus spp. (fig), and Cocos 
nucifera (coconut palm)); mud nests of Nasutitermes spp. termites; and 
root masses of epiphytic ferns for breeding;
    (ii) Sufficiently diverse structure to provide exposed perches and 
ground surfaces, leaf litter, and other substrates that support a wide 
range of vertebrate and invertebrate prey species for foraging 
kingfishers; and
    (iii) Sufficient overall breeding and foraging area to support 
kingfisher territories of approximately 25 ac (10 ha) each.
    (3) Critical habitat does not include existing features and 
structures within the boundaries of the mapped units, such as buildings, 
roads, aqueducts, antennas, water tanks, agricultural fields, paved 
areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas not containing one or 
more of the primary constituent elements.
    (4) The critical habitat unit is described below. Coordinates are in 
UTM Zone 55 with units in meters using North American Datum of 1983 
(NAD83) / World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84).

northerwestern portion of the Area; (9) that portion of Everglades 
National Park, Dade County, within the following boundary: Beginning at 
the point where the Park boundary meets Florida Highway 94 in T54S R35E 
Sec. 20, thence eastward and southwest along the Park boundary to the 
southwest corner of Sec. 31 in T7S R37E, thence southwestward along a 
straight line to the southwest corner of Sec. 2 in T58S R35E, thence 
westward along the south sides of Sec. 3, 4, 5, and 6 in T58S R35E to 
the Dade-Monroe county line, thence northward along the Dade-Monroe 
county line to the Park boundary, thence eastward and northward along 
the Park boundary to the point of beginning.

         Marbled Murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus marmoratus)

    1. Critical habitat units are depicted for the States of Washington, 
Oregon, and California on the maps below.
    2. The primary constituent elements: individual trees with potential 
nest platforms and forest lands of at least one half site-potential tree 
height regardless of contiguity within 0.8 kilometers (0.5 miles) of 
individual trees with potential nesting platforms and that are used or 
potentially used by the marbled murrelet for nesting or roosting.
    3. A description of the critical habitat units follows. Where a 
critical habitat unit includes Federal lands within the boundaries of a 
Late Successional Reserve established by the Northwest Forest Plan, 
those boundaries include any minor adjustments. Critical habitat units 
do not include non-federal lands covered by a legally operative 
incidental take permit for marbled murrelets issued under section 10(a) 
of the Act.

             Mexican Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis lucida)

    (1) Critical habitat units for the States of Arizona, Colorado, New 
Mexico, and Utah are depicted on the maps below. Larger maps and digital 
files for all four States and maps of critical habitat units in the 
State of New Mexico are available at the New Mexico Ecological Services 
Field Office, 2105 Osuna N.E., Albuquerque, New Mexico 87113, telephone 
(505) 346-2525. For the States of Arizona, Colorado, and Utah, maps of 
the critical habitat units specific to each State are available at the 
following Service offices--Arizona Ecological Services Field Office, 
2321 West Royal Palm Road, Suite 103, Phoenix, Arizona 85021, telephone 
(602) 640-2720; Colorado State Sub-Office, 764 Horizon Drive South, 
Annex A, Grand Junction, Colorado 81506, telephone (970) 243-2778; and 
Utah Ecological Services Field Office, Lincoln Plaza, 145 East 1300 
South, Suite 404, Salt Lake City, Utah 84115, telephone (801) 524-5001.
    (2) Critical habitat units are designated in portions of McKinley, 
Rio Arriba, Sandoval, and Socorro Counties in New Mexico; Apache, 
Cochise, Coconino, Graham, and Pima Counties in Arizona; Carbon, Emery, 
Garfield, Grand, Iron, Kane, Washington, and Wayne Counties in Utah; and 
Custer, Douglas, El Paso, Fremont, Huerfano, Jefferson, Pueblo, and 
Teller Counties in Colorado.
    (3)(i) The primary constituent elements essential to the 
conservation of the owl include those physical and biological features 
that support nesting, roosting, and foraging. These elements were 
determined from studies of owl behavior and habitat use throughout the 
range of the owl. Although the vegetative communities and structural 
attributes used by the owl vary across the range of the subspecies, they 
consist primarily of mixed conifer forests or canyons. The mixed-
conifer, pine-oak communities and canyon habitat appear to be the most 
frequently used community throughout most portions of the subspecies' 
range (Skaggs and Raitt 1988; Ganey and Balda 1989, 1994; Gutierrez and 
Rinkevich 1991, Service 1995). Although the structural characteristics 
of owl habitat vary depending on uses of the habitat (e.g., nesting, 
roosting, foraging) and variations in the plant communities over the 
range of the subspecies, some general attributes are common to the 
subspecies' life-history requirements throughout its range.
    (ii) Protected and restricted habitat are two of the three types of 
owl habitat discussed in the Recovery Plan and are used as the basis for 
defining critical habitat. Protected areas include known owl sites 
(PACs), areas in mixed-conifer and pine-oak types with greater than 40 
percent slopes where timber harvest has not occurred in the past 20 
years and administratively reserved lands, such as Wilderness Areas or 
Research Natural Areas. Restricted habitat includes mixed-conifer 
forest, pine-oak forest, and riparian areas outside of protected areas. 
This final rule does not include all areas that meet the definition of 
protected and restricted habitat.
    (iii) Canyon habitats used for nesting and roosting are typically 
characterized by cooler conditions found in steep, narrow canyons, often 
containing crevices, ledges, and/or caves. These canyons frequently 
contain

[[Page 591]]

small clumps or stringers of ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, white fir, 
and/or pinyon-juniper. Deciduous riparian and upland tree species may 
also be present. Adjacent uplands are usually vegetated by a variety of 
plant associations including pinyon-juniper woodland, desert scrub 
vegetation, ponderosa pine-Gamble oak, ponderosa pine, or mixed-conifer. 
Owl habitat may also exhibit a combination of attributes between the 
forested and canyon types.
    (iv) The primary constituent elements for the Mexican spotted owl 
are:
    (A) Primary constituent elements related to forest structure:
    (1) A range of tree species, including mixed conifer, pine-oak, and 
riparian forest types, composed of different tree sizes reflecting 
different ages of trees, 30 percent to 45 percent of which are large 
trees with a trunk diameter of 12 inches (0.3 meters) or more when 
measured at 4.5 feet (1.4 meters) from the ground;
    (2) A shade canopy created by the tree branches covering 40 percent 
or more of the ground; and
    (3) Large dead trees (snags) with a trunk diameter of at least 12 
inches (0.3 meters) when measured at 4.5 feet (1.4 meters) from the 
ground.
    (B) Primary constituent elements related to maintenance of adequate 
prey species:
    (1) High volumes of fallen trees and other woody debris;
    (2) A wide range of tree and plant species, including hardwoods; and
    (3) Adequate levels of residual plant cover to maintain fruits, 
seeds, and allow plant regeneration.
    (C) Primary constituent elements related to canyon habitat include 
one or more of the following:
    (1) Presence of water (often providing cooler and often higher 
humidity than the surrounding areas);
    (2) Clumps or stringers of mixed-conifer, pine-oak, pinyon-juniper, 
and/or riparian vegetation;
    (3) Canyon wall containing crevices, ledges, or caves; and
    (4) High percent of ground litter and woody debris.
    (4) Lands located within the mapped boundaries of the critical 
habitat designation that are not included in this designation, and are 
therefore excluded by definition, include: State and private lands, 157 
wildland urban interface projects and the Penasco WUI project area that 
contain owls or habitat on Forest Service lands that are identified in 
the Wildland Urban Interface database located at http://www.fs.fed.us/
r3/wui/ and addressed in the April 10, 2001, final biological opinion on 
the Forest Service's proposed wildland urban interface fuel treatments 
in New Mexico and Arizona and the September 27, 2002, final biological 
opinion on the Rio Penasco II Non-Programmatic Vegetation Management 
Project and Forest Plan Amendment. The final biological opinions are 
available from the New Mexico Ecological Services Field Office, 2105 
Osuna Road NE, Albuquerque, NM 87113.
    (5) Critical habitat is defined as those areas within the mapped 
boundaries. Federal actions within the mapped boundaries would not 
trigger a section 7 consultation unless they may affect the owl or 
affect protected or restricted habitat, which includes canyon habitat, 
and one or more of the primary constituent elements.
    (6) The minimum mapping unit for this designation does not exclude 
all developed areas, such as buildings, roads, bridges, parking lots, 
railroad tracks, other paved areas, the lands that support these 
features, and other lands unlikely to contain the primary constituent 
elements. Federal actions limited to these areas would not trigger a 
section 7 consultation, unless they affect protected or restricted 
habitat and one or more of the primary constituent elements in adjacent 
critical habitat.
    (7) Overview map of general locations of critical habitat for the 
Mexican spotted owl follows:

   Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus)--Great Lakes Breeding Population

    1. Critical habitat units are depicted for St. Louis County, 
Minnesota; Douglas, Ashland, Marinette, and Manitowoc Counties, 
Wisconsin; Lake County, Illinois; Porter County, Indiana; Erie and Lake 
Counties, Ohio; Erie County, Pennsylvania; Oswego and Jefferson 
Counties, New York; and Alger, Schoolcraft, Luce, Mackinac, Chippewa, 
Iosco, Presque Isle, Cheboygan, Emmet, Charlevoix, Leelanau, Benzie, 
Mason, and Muskegon Counties, Michigan, on the maps below.
    2. i. The primary constituent elements required to sustain the Great 
Lakes breeding population of the piping plover are found on Great Lakes 
islands and mainland shorelines that support open, sparsely vegetated 
sandy habitats, such as sand spits or sand beaches, that are associated 
with wide, unforested systems of dunes and inter-dune wetlands. In order 
for habitat to be physically and biologically suitable for piping 
plovers, it must have a total shoreline length of at least 0.2 km (0.12 
mi) of gently sloping, sparsely vegetated (less than 50 percent 
herbaceous and low woody cover) sand beach with a total beach area of at 
least 2 hectares (ha) (5 acres (ac)) and a low level of disturbance from 
human activities and from domestic animals. As the nesting season 
progresses, the level of disturbance tolerated by piping plovers 
increases. A lower level of disturbance is required at the beginning of 
the nesting period during nest site selection, egg laying, and 
incubation. Beach activities that may be associated with a high level of 
disturbance include, but are not limited to, walking pets off leash, 
loud noise, driving ATVs, or significantly increased human presence. The 
level of disturbance is relative to the proximity to the nest, 
intensity, and frequency of these and other similar activities.
    ii. Appropriately sized sites must also have areas of at least 50 
meters (m) (164 feet (ft)) in length where the beach width is more than 
7 m (23 ft), there is protective cover for nests and chicks, and the 
distance to the treeline (from the normal high water line to where the 
forest begins) is more than 50 m (164 ft). Beach width is defined as the 
distance from the normal high water line to the foredune (a low barrier 
dune ridge immediately inland from the beach) edge, or to the sand/
vegetation boundary in areas where the foredune is absent. The beach 
width may be narrower than 7 m (23 ft) if appropriate sand and cobble 
areas of at least 7 m (23 ft) exist between the dune and the treeline. 
Protective cover for nests and chicks consists of small patches of 
herbaceous vegetation, cobble (stones larger than 1 cm (0.4 inches (in)) 
diameter), gravel (stones smaller than 1 cm (0.4 in) diameter), or 
debris such as driftwood, wrack, root masses, or dead shrubs.
    iii. The dynamic ecological processes that create and maintain 
piping plover habitat are also important primary constituent elements. 
These geologically dynamic lakeside regions are controlled by processes 
of erosion, accretion, plant succession, and lake-level fluctuations. 
The integrity of the habitat components depends upon regular sediment 
transport processes, as well as episodic,

[[Page 662]]

high-magnitude storm events. By their nature, Great Lakes shorelines are 
in a constant state of change; habitat features may disappear, or be 
created nearby. The critical habitat boundaries reflect these natural 
processes and the dynamic character of Great Lakes shorelines.
    3. Critical habitat does not include existing features and 
structures, such as buildings, marinas, paved areas, boat ramps, piers, 
bridges, lighthouses, and similar structures not containing one or more 
of the primary constituent elements.

          Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) Wintering Habitat

    1. The primary constituent elements essential for the conservation 
of wintering piping plovers are those habitat components that support 
foraging, roosting, and sheltering and the physical features necessary 
for maintaining the natural processes that support these habitat 
components. The primary constituent elements include intertidal beaches 
and flats (between annual low tide and annual high tide) and associated 
dune systems and flats above annual high tide. Important components of 
intertidal flats include sand and/or mud flats with no or very sparse 
emergent vegetation. In some cases, these flats may be covered or 
partially covered by a mat of blue-green algae. Adjacent non-or sparsely 
vegetated sand, mud, or algal flats above high tide are also important, 
especially for roosting piping plovers, and are primary constituent 
elements of piping plover wintering habitat. Such sites may have debris, 
detritus (decaying organic matter), or micro-topographic relief (less 
than 50 cm above substrate surface) offering refuge from high winds and 
cold weather. Important components of the beach/dune ecosystem include 
surf-cast algae, sparsely vegetated backbeach and salterns (beach area 
above mean high tide seaward of the permanent dune line, or in cases 
where no dunes exist, seaward of a delineating feature such as a 
vegetation line, structure, or road), spits, and washover areas. 
Washover areas are broad, unvegetated zones, with little or no 
topographic relief, that are formed and maintained by the action of 
hurricanes, storm surge, or other extreme wave action.
    2. Critical habitat does not include existing developed sites 
consisting of buildings, marinas, paved areas, boat ramps, exposed oil 
and gas pipelines and similar structures. Only those areas containing 
these primary constituent elements within the designated boundaries are 
considered critical habitat.

   Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus)--Northern Great Plains Breeding 
                               Population

    1. Critical habitat units are depicted for Minnesota, Montana, 
Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota, on the maps and as described 
below.
    2. The one overriding primary constituent element (biological) 
required to sustain the northern Great Plains breeding population of 
piping plovers that must be present at all sites is the dynamic 
ecological processes that create and maintain piping plover habitat. 
Without this biological process the physical component of the primary 
constituent elements would not be able to develop. These processes 
develop a mosaic of habitats on the landscape that provide the essential 
combination of prey, forage, nesting, brooding and chick-rearing areas. 
The annual, seasonal, daily, and even hourly availability of the habitat 
patches is dependent on local weather, hydrological conditions and 
cycles, and geological processes. The biological primary constituent 
element, i.e., dynamic ecological processes, creates different physical

[[Page 731]]

primary constituent elements on the landscape. These physical primary 
constituent elements exist on different habitat types found in the 
northern Great Plains, including mixosaline to hypersaline wetlands 
(Cowardin et al. 1979), rivers, reservoirs, and inland lakes. These 
habitat types or physical primary constituent elements that sustain the 
northern Great Plains breeding population of piping plovers are 
described as follows:
    i. On prairie alkali lakes and wetlands, the physical primary 
constituent elements include--(1) shallow, seasonally to permanently 
flooded, mixosaline to hypersaline wetlands with sandy to gravelly, 
sparsely vegetated beaches, salt-encrusted mud flats, and/or gravelly 
salt flats; (2) springs and fens along edges of alkali lakes and 
wetlands; and (3) adjacent uplands 200 ft (61 m) above the high water 
mark of the alkali lake or wetland.
    ii. On rivers the physical primary constituent elements include--
sparsely vegetated channel sandbars, sand and gravel beaches on islands, 
temporary pools on sandbars and islands, and the interface with the 
river.
    iii. On reservoirs the physical primary constituent elements 
include--sparsely vegetated shoreline beaches, peninsulas, islands 
composed of sand, gravel, or shale, and their interface with the water 
bodies.
    iv. On inland lakes (Lake of the Woods) the physical primary 
constituent elements include--sparsely vegetated and windswept sandy to 
gravelly islands, beaches, and peninsulas, and their interface with the 
water body.
    3. Critical habitat does not include existing developed areas such 
as mainstem dam structures, buildings, marinas, boat ramps, bank 
stabilization and breakwater structures, row cropped or plowed 
agricultural areas, roads and other lands (e.g., high bank bluffs along 
Missouri River) unlikely to contain primary constituent elements 
essential for northern Great Plains piping plover conservation.

 Western Snowy Plover (Charadrius alexandrinus nivosus)--Pacific Coast 
                               Population

    (1) Critical habitat units are depicted on the maps below for the 
following States and counties:
    (i) Washington: Grays Harbor and Pacific counties;
    (ii) Oregon: Coos, Curry, Douglas, Lane, and Tillamook counties; and
    (iii) California: Del Norte, Humboldt, Los Angeles, Marin, 
Mendocino, Monterey, Orange, San Diego, San Luis Obispo, San

[[Page 764]]

Mateo, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz, and Ventura counties.
    (2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the 
pacific coast population of western snowy plover are the habitat 
components that provide:
    (i) Sparsely vegetated areas above daily high tides (such as sandy 
beaches, dune systems immediately inland of an active beach face, salt 
flats, seasonally exposed gravel bars, dredge spoil sites, artificial 
salt ponds and adjoining levees) that are relatively undisturbed by the 
presence of humans, pets, vehicles or human-attracted predators 
(essential for reproduction, food, shelter from predators, protection 
from disturbance, and space for growth and normal behavior);
    (ii) Sparsely vegetated sandy beach, mud flats, gravel bars or 
artificial salt ponds subject to daily tidal inundation, but not 
currently under water, that support small invertebrates (essential for 
food); and
    (iii) Surf or tide-cast organic debris such as seaweed or driftwood 
(essential to support small invertebrates for food, and to provide 
shelter from predators and weather for reproduction).
    (3) Critical habitat does not include existing features and 
structures, such as buildings, paved areas, boat ramps, and other 
developed areas, not containing one or more of the primary constituent 
elements. Any such structures that were inside the boundaries of a 
critical habitat unit at the time it was designated are not critical 
habitat. The land on which such structures directly sit is also not 
critical habitat, as long as the structures remain in place.
    (4) Critical habitat map units. Data layers defining map units were 
created on a base of USGS 7.5[min] quadrangles, and critical habitat 
units were then mapped using Universal Transverse Mercatur, North 
American Datum 1927 (UTM NAD 27) coordinates. These coordinates 
establish the vertices and endpoints of the landward bounds of the 
units. Other bounds are established descriptively according to compass 
headings and the position of the mean low waterline (MLW). For purposes 
of estimating unit sizes, we approximated MLW in California using the 
most recent GIS projection of mean high water (MHW). We chose MHW both 
because it is the only approximation of the coastline currently 
available in GIS format. We were unable to obtain recent GIS maps of MHW 
or MLW for Oregon and Washington; therefore, we approximated MLW for 
units in those States based on aerial photographs.
    (5) Exclusions from the critical habitat designation. Certain 
geographic areas are excluded from the critical habitat designation as 
described below in this paragraph (5).
    (i) Exclusions under sections 3(5)(A) and 4(b)(2) of the Endangered 
Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). Vandenberg Air 
Force Base, San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Program, six units 
bordering the south San Francisco Bay totaling 1,847 ac (747.4 ha), 
Dillon Beach (Unit CA 7), Vandenberg South (CA 17B), Atascadero Beach 
(CA 15B), Vandenberg North (CA 17A), Silver Strand (CA 27C), Jetty Road 
to Aptos (CA 12A), Morro Bay Beach (CA 15C), Pismo Beach/Nipomo (CA 16), 
and Monterey to Moss Landing (CA 12C).

    Primary constituent elements: riverine and floodplain habitats 
(particularly willow-dominated riparian woodland with dense understory 
vegetation maintained, in part, in a non-climax stage by periodic floods 
or other agents) and adjacent coastal sage scrub, chaparral, or other 
upland plant communities.

               Rota Bridled White-Eye (Zosterops rotensis)

    (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Rota, Commonwealth of 
the Northern Mariana Islands, on the map below.
    (2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the 
Rota bridled white-eye are the habitat components that provide forest 
above 490 feet (ft) (150 meters (m)) in elevation containing a midstory 
and canopy layer, high epiphytic plant volume (typically 11 percent or 
greater), Elatostema and Procris spp. on the ground, and Elaeocarpus 
joga (yoga), Hernandia labyrinthica (oschal), Merrilliodendron 
megacarpum (faniok), Pandanus tectorius (kafu), and/or Premna 
obtusifolia (ahgao) trees as dominant forest components for foraging, 
sheltering, roosting, and nesting and rearing of young. In addition, the 
habitat should contain the specific forest components for foraging, 
nesting, or both, as follows:
    (i) Yoga, oschal, faniok, Macaranga thompsonii (pengua), ahgao, 
Pipturus argenteus (amahadyan), Persea americana (avocado), Ficus 
tinctoria (hodda), Aglaia mariannensis (mapunyao), Eugenia thompsonii 
(atoto), Acacia confusa (sosugi), and/or Tarenna sambucina (sumac-lada) 
trees, and/or Bambusa vulgaris (piao, bamboo) in the canopy or subcanopy 
for foraging; or

[[Page 863]]

    (ii) Yoga, oschal, faniok, and/or sosugi trees 10 to 49 ft (3 to 15 
m) tall and 1 to 24 inches (2 to 60 centimeters) diameter at breast 
height for nesting.
    (3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as 
buildings, aqueducts, airports, roads, and other paved areas) and the 
land on which they are located existing on the effective date of this 
rule and not containing one or more of the primary constituent elements.

                        Critical Habitat Map Unit

    (4) Data layers defining the mapped unit were created on a base of 
USGS 7.5[min] quadrangles, and the critical habitat unit was then mapped 
using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates.
    (5) Rota bridled white-eye critical habitat, Rota, Commonwealth of 
the Northern Mariana Islands (3,958 ac; 1,602 ha).
    (i) Unit consists of 346 points with following coordinates in UTM
